Born on June 25, 1974, in Los Angeles, California, Cohen is best known for his childhood roles in popular films and television shows, including The Goonies and Child's Play.\n\n**Early life, family and education**\n\nJeff Cohen was born Jeffrey Bertan McMahon on June 25, 1974, in Los Angeles, California. He took his stage name from the maiden name of his mother, Elaine Cohen. Cohen is Jewish and has stated that his upbringing was traditional, with his parents observing the Sabbath and keeping kosher. He has two siblings, a sister named Eydie Faye and a brother. Faye is a playwright and actress who has appeared in various productions, including a cameo in The Goonies.\n\nCohen's interest in acting began at a young age, and he started appearing in local productions and commercials. He attended the Hebrew Academy of Los Angeles, a private Jewish day school. After graduating from high school, Cohen decided to pursue a career in law, citing the influence of his parents and the desire to understand the business side of the entertainment industry.\n\n**Entertainment career**\n\nCohen's early career in the entertainment industry began with appearances on children's television shows. In 1982, he was one of the children describing words to the contestants on the CBS game show Child's Play. During the summer of 1985, he appeared as a celebrity on the game show Body Language. In 1986, he landed a role in the Disney TV movie Ask Max. This exposure helped Cohen secure his breakout role in The Goonies, a 1985 adventure film directed by Richard Donner.\n\nIn The Goonies, Cohen played the role of Chunk, a lovable and comedic character. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $61 million at the box office. Cohen's performance in The Goonies earned him recognition and praise from critics, solidifying his status as a child actor.\n\n**Acting**\n\nCohen's acting career spanned several years, with appearances in films and television shows. In addition to The Goonies, he appeared in various other productions, including Child's Play and Ask Max. Cohen's performances were often characterized by his comedic timing and energetic personality.\n\nDespite his success as a child actor, Cohen's career slowed down in the early 1990s. He decided to pursue a career in law, citing the influence of his parents and the desire to understand the business side of the entertainment industry.\n\n**Law**\n\nCohen's interest in law began while he was still acting. He would often accompany his parents to industry events and meet with producers, agents, and other industry professionals. This exposure helped him understand the business side of the entertainment industry and sparked his interest in law.\n\nCohen used introductions from Goonies director Richard Donner to get summer jobs on the business side of movie studios. He would say about that time in the ABA Journal story, \"I grew up loving The Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers, but suddenly I had a new crop of heroes.\" He chose to pursue a legal career upon finding out that many of the most important figures on the business side of Hollywood had law degrees.\n\nCohen attended the University of Southern California (USC) Gould School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. He then worked as a lawyer for several years, representing clients in the entertainment industry. In 2009, he joined the law firm of Kasowitz, Benson & Torres, where he worked on various high-profile cases.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Child's Play (1982)\n* Body Language (1985)\n* Ask Max (1986)\n* The Goonies (1985)\n\n**References**\n\n* ABA Journal story\n* USC Gould School of Law alumni profile\n* Kasowitz, Benson & Torres firm profile\n* Variety article on child actors\n\n**External links**\n\n* Jeff Cohen's LinkedIn profile\n* USC Gould School of Law alumni profile\n* Kasowitz, Benson & Torres firm profile", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jeff_Cohen_(actor)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life, family and education\nCohen was born Jeffrey Bertan McMahon on June 25, 1974, in Los Angeles, California He took his stage name from the maiden name of his mother, Elaine Cohen [2] He is Jewish [3]\n\n\nEntertainment career\nCohen was one of the children describing words to the contestants on the 1982–83 CBS game show Child's Play During the summer of 1985, he appeared as a celebrity on Body Language In 1986, he was also in the Disney TV movie Ask Max Cohen's sister, Eydie Faye, is a playwright and actress In the final scene of The Goonies, when the families gather on the beach, Faye has a cameo as Chunk's sister [6]\n\n\nActing\nCohen was one of the children describing words to the contestants on the 1982–83 CBS game show Child's Play During the summer of 1985, he appeared as a celebrity on Body Language In 1986, he was also in the Disney TV movie Ask Max Cohen's sister, Eydie Faye, is a playwright and actress In the final scene of The Goonies, when the families gather on the beach, Faye has a cameo as Chunk's sister [6]\n\n\nLaw\nCohen used introductions from Goonies director Richard Donner to get summer jobs on the business side of movie studios; he would say about that time in the ABA Journal story, \"I grew up loving The Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers, but suddenly I had a new crop of heroes.\" He chose to pursue a legal career upon finding out that many of the most important figures on the business side of Hollywood had law degrees [1]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The building is part of the redeveloped World Trade Center complex and serves as the headquarters of Silverstein Properties, a real estate development and investment company.\n\n**History**\n\nThe original 7 World Trade Center was a 47-story skyscraper with a red granite facade. It opened in 1987 as part of the original World Trade Center building complex. The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks caused the collapse of the World Trade Center; falling debris from the collapsing 110-story Twin Towers destroyed or severely damaged nearby buildings, including 7 World Trade Center, which collapsed shortly thereafter.\n\n**Construction**\n\nThe construction phase of the new 7 World Trade Center began on May 7, 2002, with the installation of a fence around the construction site. Restoring the Consolidated Edison substation was an urgent priority to meet power demands of Lower Manhattan; the utility stated that it needed to replace four of the ten destroyed transformers by 2003. Because 7 World Trade Center is separate from the main 16-acre (6.5 ha) World Trade Center site, Larry Silverstein required approval only from the landowner, the Port Authority, before he could rebuild the tower. Construction of the power substation was completed in October 2003, and the substation went into service in May 2004.\n\n**Completion and Early Years**\n\nThe building was officially opened on May 23, 2006. The opening was marked by a free concert featuring Suzanne Vega, Citizen Cope, Bill Ware Vibes, Brazilian Girls, Ollabelle, Pharaoh's Daughter, Ronan Tynan (of the Irish Tenors), and special guest Lou Reed. Prior to its opening, in March 2006, the new building was used as a filming location for the movie Perfect Stranger.\n\n**2000s**\n\nThe building was officially opened on May 23, 2006. The opening was marked by a free concert featuring Suzanne Vega, Citizen Cope, Bill Ware Vibes, Brazilian Girls, Ollabelle, Pharaoh's Daughter, Ronan Tynan (of the Irish Tenors), and special guest Lou Reed. Prior to its opening, in March 2006, the new building was used as a filming location for the movie Perfect Stranger.\n\n**2010s to Present**\n\nThe law firm WilmerHale signed 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2) at the building in April 2011. The building became fully leased that September after MSCI agreed to occupy 125,000 square feet (11,600 m2) on the top floor; other tenants at the time included FXDD, WilmerHale, and the bank WestLB. Following this, Silverstein announced in 2012 that he would refinance the building with a $452.8 million Liberty bond issue and a $125 million commercial mortgage-backed security loan. At the time, the building was valued at $940 million, in large part because it was fully occupied. FXDD subleased its space to engineering company Permasteelisa in 2015 and artificial intelligence firm IPsoft in 2016. The building was 94.8 percent occupied by 2017. By then, roughly three-quarters of the space was occupied by four tenants, including Moody's, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and WilmerHale.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nThe new 7 World Trade Center has 52 stories and is 741 ft (226 m) tall. The building has 42 floors of leasable space, starting at the 11th floor, and a total of 1.7 million sq ft (160,000 m2) of office space. The first ten floors house an electrical substation which provides power to much of Lower Manhattan. The office tower has a narrower footprint at ground level than did its predecessor, so the course of Greenwich Street could be restored to reunite TriBeCa and the Financial District. The original building, on the other hand, had bordered West Broadway on the east, necessitating the destruction of Greenwich Street between Barclay Street and the northern border of the World Trade Center superblock.\n\n**Facade**\n\nDavid Childs of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill worked in conjunction with glass artist and designer James Carpenter to create a design that uses ultra-clear, low-iron glass to provide reflectivity and light. There are stainless-steel spandrels behind the glass to help reflect sunlight. The spandrels are textured and are curved in a manner that reflects light both from each story's window sills and from the sky. On the lower stories, there are 15-by-5-foot (4.6 by 1.5 m) panels with steel triangular prisms. There are 130,000 prisms in total, which are tilted at different angles to reflect natural light from the sky. The window panes on the upper floors are 13.6 feet (4.1 m) high and are made of white glass with low concentrations of iron. Stainless steel used in the facade is molybdenum-containing Type 316, which provides improved resistance to corrosion.\n\n**Features**\n\nInside the main lobby, artist Jenny Holzer created an LED installation with glowing text moving across wide plastic panels. The wall measures 65 ft (20 m) wide and 14 ft (4.3 m) tall. Holzer worked with Klara Silverstein, the wife of Larry Silverstein, to select poetry for the art installation. The wall of the lobby is structurally fortified as a security measure. On the upper stories, some tenants customized the design of their spaces. The space occupied by Mansueto Ventures was designed to maximize natural light exposure and has an open floor plan. The 40th-floor space used by the New York Academy of Sciences was designed by H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture and includes a reception lobby with an openwork screen; a 296-seat event room; and a horizontal 72-foot-long (22 m) mural.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* World Trade Center\n* One World Trade Center\n* Three World Trade Center\n* Four World Trade Center\n* Five World Trade Center\n* Brookfield Place (previously World Financial Center)\n* National September 11 Memorial & Museum", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"7_World_Trade_Center\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe original 7 World Trade Center was a 47-story skyscraper with a red granite facade [6] [7] It opened in 1987 as part of the original World Trade Center building complex [8] The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks caused the collapse of the World Trade Center;

following measures which would result in the rise of the cost of living:\n\n\nOther Tax Measures\nThe number of casualties is unconfirmed, although the current estimate exceeds 10 The ambiguity arises from abductions, extrajudicial killings, and the tampering and withholding of evidence and information by the Kenya Police However, injuries have been experienced by both protesters and police officers with the former suffering injuries resulting from police's extreme rules of engagement towards protesters Despite being mostly peaceful initially, the protests resulted in at least two

attempting to exploit the protests for personal gain by serving as a propaganda tool for the incumbent regime [45]\n\n\nJulius Malema\nOn 24 June 2024, the Economic Freedom Fighters in South Africa

{"title": "Ernest_Hemingway", "content": "\nEarly life\nErnest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois, an affluent suburb just west of Chicago, [1] to Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician His parents were well-educated and well-respected in Oak Park, [2] a conservative community about which resident Frank Lloyd Wright said, \"So many churches for so many good people to go to.\" [3] When Clarence and Grace Hemingway married in 1896, they lived with Grace's father, Ernest Miller Hall, [4] after whom they named their first son, the second of their six children [2] His sister Marcelline preceded him in 1898, and his younger siblings included Ursula in 1902, Madelaine in 1904, Carol in 1911, and Leicester in 1915 [2] Grace followed the Victorian convention of not differentiating children's clothing by gender With only a year separating the two, Ernest and Marcelline resembled one another strongly Grace wanted them to appear as twins, so in Ernest's first three years she kept his hair long and dressed both children in similarly frilly feminine clothing [5]\n\n\nWorld War I\nHemingway wanted to go to war and tried to enlist in the U.S Army but was not accepted because he had poor eyesight [11] Instead he volunteered to a Red Cross recruitment effort in December 1917 and signed on to be an ambulance driver with the American Red Cross Motor Corps in Italy [12] In May 1918, he sailed from New York, and arrived in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery [13] That June he arrived at the Italian Front On his first day in Milan, he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion to join rescuers retrieving the shredded remains of female workers He described the incident in his 1932 non-fiction book Death in the Afternoon: \"I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments.\" [14] A few days later, he was stationed at Fossalta di Piave [14]\n\n\nParis\nAnderson suggested Paris because it was inexpensive and it was where \"the most interesting people in the world\" resided There Hemingway would meet writers such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce and Ezra Pound who \"could help a young writer up the rungs of a career\" [26] \nHemingway was a \"tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man.\" [28] He lived with Hadley in a small walk-up at 74 rue du Cardinal Lemoine  [fr]  in the Latin Quarter, and rented a room nearby for work [26] Stein, who was the bastion of modernism in Paris, [29] became Hemingway's mentor and godmother to his son Jack; [30] she introduced him to the expatriate artists and writers of the Montparnasse Quarter, whom she referred to as the \"Lost Generation\"—a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of The Sun Also Rises [31] A regular at Stein's salon, Hemingway met influential painters such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Juan Gris [32] He eventually withdrew from Stein's influence, and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades [33]\n\n\nKey West\nHemingway and Pauline went to Kansas City, Missouri, where their son Patrick was born on June 28, 1928, at Bell Memorial Hospital [65] Pauline had a difficult delivery; Hemingway wrote a fictionalized version of the event in A Farewell to Arms After Patrick's birth, they traveled to Wyoming, Massachusetts, and New York [66] On December 6, Hemingway was in New York visiting Bumby, about to board a train to Florida, when he received the news that his father Clarence had killed himself [note 2] [67] Hemingway was devastated, having earlier written to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties; the letter arrived minutes after the suicide He realized how Hadley must have felt after her own father's suicide in 1903, and said, \"I'll probably go the same way.\" [68]\n\n\nSpanish Civil War\nHemingway had been following developments in Spain since early in his career [82] and from 1931 it became clear that there would be another European war Hemingway predicted war would happen in the late 1930s Baker writes that Hemingway did not expect Spain to \"become a sort of international testing-ground for Germany, Italy, and Russia before the Spanish Civil War was over\" [83] Despite Pauline's reluctance, he signed with North American Newspaper Alliance to cover the Spanish Civil War, [84] and sailed from New York on February 27, 1937 [85] Journalist and writer Martha Gellhorn accompanied Hemingway He had met her in Key West a year earlier Like Hadley, Martha was a St Louis native and, like Pauline, had worked for Vogue in Paris According to Kert, Martha \"never catered to him the way other women did\" [86]\n\n\nWorld War II\nThe United States entered the war after the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 [105] Back in Cuba, Hemingway refitted the Pilar as a Q-boat and went on patrol for German U-boats [note 4] [16] He also created a counterintelligence unit headquartered in his guesthouse to surveil Falangists, [106] and Nazi sympathizers [107] Martha and his friends thought his activities \"little more than a diverting racket\", but the FBI began watching him and compiled a 124-page file [note 5] [108] Martha wanted Hemingway in Europe as a journalist and failed to understand his reticence to take part in another European war They fought frequently and bitterly, and he drank too much, [109] until she left for Europe to report for Collier's in September 1943 [110] On a visit to Cuba in March 1944, Hemingway was bullying and abusive with Martha Reynolds writes that \"looking backward from 1960–61  [anyone] might say that his behavior was a manifestation of the depression that eventually destroyed him\" [110] A few weeks later, he contacted Collier's who made him their front-line correspondent [111] He was in Europe from May 1944 to March 1945 [112]\n\n\nCuba and the Nobel Prize\nHemingway said he \"was out of business as a writer\" from 1942 to 1945 [123] In 1946 he married Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later The Hemingway family suffered a series of accidents and health problems in the years following the war: in a 1945 car accident, he injured his knee and sustained another head wound A few years later Mary broke first her right ankle and then her left in successive skiing accidents A 1947 car accident left Patrick with a head wound, severely ill and delirious The doctor in Cuba diagnosed schizophrenia, and sent him for 18 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy [124]\n\n\nIdaho and suicide\nAfter leaving Cuba, in Sun Valley, Hemingway continued to rework the material that was published as A Moveable Feast through the 1950s [148] In mid-1959, he visited Spain to research a series of bullfighting articles commissioned by Life magazine [154] Life wanted only 10,000 words, but the manuscript grew out of control [155] For the first time in his life he could not organize his writing, so he asked A E Hotchner to travel to Cuba to help him Hotchner helped trim the Life piece down to 40,000 words, and Scribner's agreed to a full-length book version (The Dangerous Summer) of almost 130,000 words [156] Hotchner found Hemingway to be \"unusually hesitant, disorganized, and confused\", [157] and suffering badly from failing eyesight [158] He left Cuba for the last time on July 25, 1960 Mary went with him to New York where he set up a small office and attempted unsuccessfully to work Soon after, he left New York, traveling without Mary to Spain to be photographed for the front cover of Life magazine A few days later the news reported that he was seriously ill and on the verge of dying, which panicked Mary until she received a cable from him telling her, \"Reports false Enroute Madrid Love Papa.\" [159] He was, in fact, seriously ill, and believed himself to be on the verge of a breakdown [156] Feeling lonely, he took to his bed for days, retreating into silence, despite having the first installments of The Dangerous Summer published in Life that September to good reviews [160] In October, he went back to New York, where he refused to leave Mary's apartment, presuming that he was being watched She quickly took him to Idaho, where they were met at the train station in Ketchum by local physician George Saviers [156]\n\n\nWriting style\nFollowing the tradition established by Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Sinclair Lewis, Hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist [9] The New York Times wrote in 1926 of Hemingway's first novel, \"No amount of analysis can convey the quality of The Sun Also Rises It is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame.\" [182] The Sun Also Rises is written in the spare, tight prose that made Hemingway famous, and, according to James Nagel, \"changed the nature of American writing\" [183] In 1954, when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, it was for \"his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.\" [184] Henry Louis Gates believes Hemingway's style was fundamentally shaped \"in reaction to  [his] experience of world war\" After World War I, he and other modernists \"lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization\" by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th-century writers and by creating a style \"in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences—a fiction in which nothing crucial—or at least very little—is stated explicitly.\" [16]\n\n\nThemes\nHemingway's writing includes themes of love, war, travel, expatriation, wilderness, and loss [206] Critic Leslie Fiedler sees the theme he defines as \"The Sacred Land\"—the American West—extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the \"Hotel Montana\" in The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls [207] In Hemingway's Expatriate Nationalism, Jeffrey Herlihy describes \"Hemingway's Transnational Archetype\" as one that involves characters who are \"multilingual and bicultural, and have integrated new cultural norms from the host community into their daily lives by the time plots begin.\" [208] In this way, \"foreign scenarios, far from being mere exotic backdrops or cosmopolitan milieus, are motivating factors in-character action\" [209]\n\n\nInfluence and legacy\nHemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him either emulated or avoided it [220] After his reputation was established with the publication of The Sun Also Rises, he became the spokesperson for the post–World War I generation, having established a style to follow [183] His books were burned in Berlin in 1933, \"as being a monument of modern decadence\", and disavowed by his parents as \"filth\" [221] Reynolds asserts the legacy is that \" [Hemingway] left stories and novels so starkly moving that some have become part of our cultural heritage.\" [222] Benson believes the details of Hemingway's life have become a \"prime vehicle for exploitation\", resulting in a Hemingway industry [223] The Hemingway scholar Hallengren  [sv] believes the \"hard-boiled style\" and the machismo must be separated from the author himself [221] Benson agrees, describing him as introverted and private as J D Salinger, although Hemingway masked his nature with braggadocio [224] During World War II, Salinger met and corresponded with Hemingway, whom he acknowledged as an influence In a letter to Hemingway, Salinger claimed their talks \"had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war\" and jokingly \"named himself national chairman of the Hemingway Fan Clubs\" [225]\n\n\nSelected works\nThis is a list of work that Ernest Hemingway published during his lifetime While much of

Born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois, Hemingway is widely regarded as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. His distinctive writing style, characterized by simplicity, clarity, and a focus on concrete detail, has been emulated by many writers. Hemingway's life and works have had a significant impact on literature, and his legacy continues to be celebrated and studied by scholars and readers around the world.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHemingway was born to Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician.

Instead, he volunteered to join the American Red Cross Motor Corps in Italy in 1917. In May 1918, he sailed from New York, arriving in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery. Hemingway was stationed at the Italian Front, where he witnessed the aftermath of a munitions factory explosion that killed many female workers. He described the incident in his 1932 non-fiction book, \"Death in the Afternoon.\"\n\n**Paris**\n\nHemingway's experiences during World War I influenced his decision to move to Paris, where he settled in 1921. He was drawn to the city's vibrant expatriate community, which included writers, artists, and intellectuals. In Paris, Hemingway met influential writers such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound, who became his mentors and friends. Stein introduced Hemingway to the Lost Generation, a term he popularized with the publication of \"The Sun Also Rises.\" Hemingway's relationships with Stein and other artists and writers in Paris shaped his writing style and influenced his perception of the world.\n\n**Key West**\n\nIn 1927, Hemingway moved to Key West, Florida, where he married Pauline Pfeiffer. They had a son, Patrick, born in 1928. Hemingway's experiences in Key West, including his friendships with local fishermen and his involvement in the Cuban Revolution, influenced his writing. His novel \"To Have and Have Not\" was set in Key West and reflected his experiences in the city.\n\n**Spanish Civil War**\n\nHemingway was drawn to the Spanish Civil War, which began in 1936. He traveled to Spain to cover the conflict as a journalist, and his experiences there influenced his novel \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\" Hemingway's involvement in the Spanish Civil War also marked a turning point in his relationship with his second wife, Martha Gellhorn, whom he met in the 1930s. Gellhorn was a journalist and writer who accompanied Hemingway to Spain, and their relationship was marked by tension and conflict.\n\n**World War II**\n\nDuring World War II, Hemingway joined the U.S. Army and served as a correspondent in Europe. His experiences during the war influenced his writing, particularly in his novel \"Across the River and into the Trees.\" Hemingway's involvement in the war also marked a turning point in his relationship with Martha Gellhorn, who left him in 1945. Hemingway's experiences during World War II had a profound impact on his writing and his perception of the world.\n\n**Cuba and the Nobel Prize**\n\nAfter the war, Hemingway returned to Cuba, where he lived with his third wife, Mary Welsh Hemingway. In 1954, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his mastery of the art of narrative. Hemingway's experiences in Cuba, including his love of fishing and his relationships with local people, influenced his writing. His novel \"The Old Man and the Sea\" was set in Cuba and reflected his experiences in the city.\n\n**Writing Style**\n\nHemingway's writing style was characterized by simplicity, clarity, and a focus on concrete detail. His use of sparse, economical language and his emphasis on action and dialogue influenced a generation of writers. Hemingway's style was also marked by a focus on the human condition, particularly in his exploration of themes such as love, loss, and mortality.\n\n**Themes**\n\nHemingway's writing explored a range of themes, including love, war, travel, expatriation, wilderness, and loss. His experiences during World War I and the Spanish Civil War influenced his writing, particularly in his exploration of the human cost of conflict. Hemingway's novel \"A Farewell to Arms\" was set during World War I and reflected his experiences in the conflict. His novel \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" was set during the Spanish Civil War and explored the human cost of conflict.\n\n**Influence and Legacy**\n\nHemingway's legacy continues to be celebrated and studied by scholars and readers around the world. His distinctive writing style, characterized by simplicity, clarity, and a focus on concrete detail, has been emulated by many writers. Hemingway's influence extends beyond literature, and his experiences during World War I and the Spanish Civil War have had a profound impact on our understanding of the human cost of conflict.\n\n**Selected Works**\n\nHemingway published a range of works during his lifetime, including novels, short stories, and non-fiction books.

article in English about \"Ernest_Hemingway\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nErnest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois, an affluent suburb just west of Chicago, [1] to Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician His parents were well-educated and well-respected in Oak Park, [2] a conservative community about which resident Frank Lloyd Wright said, \"So many churches for so many good people to go to.\" [3] When Clarence and Grace Hemingway married in 1896, they lived with Grace's father, Ernest Miller Hall, [4] after whom they named their first son, the second of their six children [2] His sister Marcelline preceded him in 1898, and his younger siblings included Ursula in 1902, Madelaine in 1904, Carol in 1911, and Leicester in 1915 [2] Grace followed the Victorian convention of not differentiating children's clothing by gender With only a year separating the two, Ernest and Marcelline resembled one another strongly Grace wanted them to appear as twins, so in Ernest's first three years she kept his hair long and dressed both children in similarly frilly feminine clothing [5]\n\n\nWorld War I\nHemingway wanted to go to war and tried to enlist in the U.S Army but was not accepted because he had poor eyesight [11] Instead he volunteered to a Red Cross recruitment effort in December 1917 and signed on to be an ambulance driver with the American Red Cross Motor Corps in Italy [12] In May 1918, he sailed from New York, and arrived in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery [13] That June he arrived at the Italian Front On his first day in Milan, he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion to join rescuers retrieving the shredded remains of female workers He described the incident in his 1932 non-fiction book Death in the Afternoon: \"I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments.\" [14] A few days later, he was stationed at Fossalta di Piave [14]\n\n\nParis\nAnderson suggested Paris because it was inexpensive and it was where \"the most interesting people in the world\" resided There Hemingway would meet writers such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce and Ezra Pound who \"could help a young writer up the rungs of a career\" [26] \nHemingway was a \"tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man.\" [28] He lived with Hadley in a small walk-up at 74 rue du Cardinal Lemoine  [fr]  in the Latin Quarter, and rented a room nearby for work [26] Stein, who was the bastion of modernism in Paris, [29] became Hemingway's mentor and godmother to his son Jack; [30] she introduced him to the expatriate artists and writers of the Montparnasse Quarter, whom she referred to as the \"Lost Generation\"—a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of The Sun Also Rises [31] A regular at Stein's salon, Hemingway met influential painters such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Juan Gris [32] He eventually withdrew from Stein's influence, and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades [33]\n\n\nKey West\nHemingway and Pauline went to Kansas City, Missouri, where their son Patrick was born on June 28, 1928, at Bell Memorial Hospital [65] Pauline had a difficult delivery; Hemingway wrote a fictionalized version of the event in A Farewell to Arms After Patrick's birth, they traveled to Wyoming, Massachusetts, and New York [66] On December 6, Hemingway was in New York visiting Bumby, about to board a train to Florida, when he received the news that his father Clarence had killed himself [note 2] [67] Hemingway was devastated, having earlier written to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties; the letter arrived minutes after the suicide He realized how Hadley must have felt after her own father's suicide in 1903, and said, \"I'll probably go the same way.\" [68]\n\n\nSpanish Civil War\nHemingway had been following developments in Spain since early in his career [82] and from 1931 it became clear that there would be another European war Hemingway predicted war would happen in the late 1930s Baker writes that Hemingway did not expect Spain to \"become a sort of international testing-ground for Germany, Italy, and Russia before the Spanish Civil War was over\" [83] Despite Pauline's reluctance, he signed with North American Newspaper Alliance to cover the Spanish Civil War, [84] and sailed from New York on February 27, 1937 [85] Journalist and writer Martha Gellhorn accompanied Hemingway He had met her in Key West a year earlier Like Hadley, Martha was a St Louis native and, like Pauline, had worked for Vogue in Paris According to Kert, Martha \"never catered to him the way other women did\" [86]\n\n\nWorld War II\nThe United States entered the war after the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 [105] Back in Cuba, Hemingway refitted the Pilar as a Q-boat and went on patrol for German U-boats [note 4] [16] He also created a counterintelligence unit headquartered in his guesthouse to surveil Falangists, [106] and Nazi sympathizers [107] Martha and his friends thought his activities \"little more than a diverting racket\", but the FBI began watching him and compiled a 124-page file [note 5] [108] Martha wanted Hemingway in Europe as a journalist and failed to understand his reticence to take part in another European war They fought frequently and bitterly, and he drank too much, [109] until she left for Europe to report for Collier's in September 1943 [110] On a visit to Cuba in March 1944, Hemingway was bullying and abusive with Martha Reynolds writes that \"looking backward from 1960–61  [anyone] might say that his behavior was a manifestation of the depression that eventually destroyed him\" [110] A few weeks later, he contacted Collier's who made him their front-line correspondent [111] He was in Europe from May 1944 to March 1945 [112]\n\n\nCuba and the Nobel Prize\nHemingway said he \"was out of business as a writer\" from 1942 to 1945 [123] In 1946 he married Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later The Hemingway family suffered a series of accidents and health problems in the years following the war: in a 1945 car accident, he injured his knee and sustained another head wound A few years later Mary broke first her right ankle and then her left in successive skiing accidents A 1947 car accident left Patrick with a head wound, severely ill and delirious The doctor in Cuba diagnosed schizophrenia, and sent him for 18 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy [124]\n\n\nIdaho and suicide\nAfter leaving Cuba, in Sun Valley, Hemingway continued to rework the material that was published as A Moveable Feast through the 1950s [148] In mid-1959, he visited Spain to research a series of bullfighting articles commissioned by Life magazine [154] Life wanted only 10,000 words, but the manuscript grew out of control [155] For the first time in his life he could not organize his writing, so he asked A E Hotchner to travel to Cuba to help him Hotchner helped trim the Life piece down to 40,000 words, and Scribner's agreed to a full-length book version (The Dangerous Summer) of almost 130,000 words [156] Hotchner found Hemingway to be \"unusually hesitant, disorganized, and confused\", [157] and suffering badly from failing eyesight [158] He left Cuba for the last time on July 25, 1960 Mary went with him to New York where he set up a small office and attempted unsuccessfully to work Soon after, he left New York, traveling without Mary to Spain to be photographed for the front cover of Life magazine A few days later the news reported that he was seriously ill and on the verge of dying, which panicked Mary until she received a cable from him telling her, \"Reports false Enroute Madrid Love Papa.\" [159] He was, in fact, seriously ill, and believed himself to be on the verge of a breakdown [156] Feeling lonely, he took to his bed for days, retreating into silence, despite having the first installments of The Dangerous Summer published in Life that September to good reviews [160] In October, he went back to New York, where he refused to leave Mary's apartment, presuming that he was being watched She quickly took him to Idaho, where they were met at the train station in Ketchum by local physician George Saviers [156]\n\n\nWriting style\nFollowing the tradition established by Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Sinclair Lewis, Hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist [9] The New York Times wrote in 1926 of Hemingway's first novel, \"No amount of analysis can convey the quality of The Sun Also Rises It is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame.\" [182] The Sun Also Rises is written in the spare, tight prose that made Hemingway famous, and, according to James Nagel, \"changed the nature of American writing\" [183] In 1954, when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, it was for \"his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.\" [184] Henry Louis Gates believes Hemingway's style was fundamentally shaped \"in reaction to  [his] experience of world war\" After World War I, he and other modernists \"lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization\" by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th-century writers and by creating a style \"in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences—a fiction in which nothing crucial—or at least very little—is stated explicitly.\" [16]\n\n\nThemes\nHemingway's writing includes themes of love, war, travel, expatriation, wilderness, and loss [206] Critic Leslie Fiedler sees the theme he defines as \"The Sacred Land\"—the American West—extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the \"Hotel Montana\" in The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls [207] In Hemingway's Expatriate Nationalism, Jeffrey Herlihy describes \"Hemingway's Transnational Archetype\" as one that involves characters who are \"multilingual and bicultural, and have integrated new cultural norms from the host community into their daily lives by the time plots begin.\" [208] In this way, \"foreign scenarios, far from being mere exotic backdrops or cosmopolitan milieus, are motivating factors in-character action\" [209]\n\n\nInfluence and legacy\nHemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him either emulated or avoided it [220] After his reputation was established with the publication of The Sun Also Rises, he became the spokesperson for the post–World War I generation, having established a style to follow [183] His books were burned in Berlin in 1933, \"as being a monument of modern decadence\", and disavowed by his parents as \"filth\" [221] Reynolds asserts the legacy is that \" [Hemingway] left stories and novels so starkly moving that some have become part of our cultural heritage.\" [222] Benson believes the details of Hemingway's life have become a \"prime vehicle for exploitation\", resulting in a Hemingway industry [223] The Hemingway scholar Hallengren  [sv] believes the \"hard-boiled style\" and the machismo must be separated from the author himself [221] Benson agrees, describing him as introverted and private as J D Salinger, although Hemingway masked his nature with braggadocio [224] During World War II, Salinger met and corresponded with Hemingway, whom he acknowledged as an influence In a letter to Hemingway, Salinger claimed their talks \"had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war\" and jokingly \"named himself national chairman of the Hemingway Fan Clubs\" [225]\n\n\nSelected works\nThis is a list of work that Ernest Hemingway published during his lifetime

{"title": "Money_Heist", "content": "\nPremise\nSet in Madrid, a mysterious man known as the \"Professor\" recruits a group of eight people, who choose city names as their aliases for anonymity, to carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the Royal Mint of Spain, and escaping with €984 million After taking 67 people hostage inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days to print the money as they deal with elite police forces In the events following the initial heist, the group members are forced out of hiding and prepare for a second heist, with some additional members, this time aiming to escape with gold from the Bank of Spain, as they again deal with hostages and police forces.\n\n\nCast and characters\nWe wanted to make a very small project in a simple

project in a simple way; we wanted to cross lines we couldn't cross in previous projects, in terms of narrative and structure without any intermediaries.\n\n\nCasting\nCasting took place late in February 2016, spanning more than two months [21] The characters were not fully fleshed out at the beginning of this process, and took shape based on the actors' performances [22] Casting directors Eva Leira and Yolanda Serrano were looking for actors with the ability to play empathetic robbers with believable love and family connections [23] Antena 3 announced the ensemble cast in March 2017 [24] and released audition excerpts of most cast actors in the series' aftershow Tercer Grado and on their website [22]\n\n\nDesign\nThe show's look and atmosphere were developed by creator Álex Pina, director Jesús Colmenar, and director of photography Migue Amoedo, according to La Vanguardia \"the most prolific television trio in recent years\" [39] Abdón Alcañiz served as art director [40] Their collaboration projects usually take a primary colour as a basis; [40] Money Heist had red as \"one of the distinguishing features of the series\" [41] that stood over the gray sets [42] Blue, green and yellow were marked as a forbidden colour in production design [42] To achieve \"absolute film quality\", red tones were tested with different types of fabrics, textures and lighting [43] The iconography of the robbers' red jumpsuits mirrored the yellow prison dress code in Locked Up [41] For part 3, the Italian retail clothing company Diesel modified the red jumpsuits to better fit the body and launched a clothing line inspired by the series [42] Salvador Dalí was chosen as the robbers' mask design because of Dalí's recognisable visage that also serves as an iconic cultural reference to Spain; Don Quixote as an alternative mask design was discarded [44] This choice sparked criticism by the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation for not requesting the necessary permissions [23]\n\n\nFilming\nParts 1 and 2 were filmed back-to-back in the greater Madrid region from January until August 2017 [19] [21] [48] The pilot episode was recorded in 26 days, [45] while all other episodes had around 14 filming days [12] Production was split into two units to save time, with one unit shooting scenes involving the Professor and the police, and the other filming scenes with the robbers [15] The main storyline is set in the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid, but the exterior scenes were filmed at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) headquarters for its passing resemblance to the Mint, [45] and on the roof of the Higher Technical School of Aeronautical Engineers, part of the Technical University of Madrid [48] The hunting estate where the robbers plan their coup was filmed at the Finca El Gasco farm estate in Torrelodones [48] Interior filming took place at the former Locked Up sets in Colmenar Viejo [9] and at the Spanish national daily newspaper ABC in Torrejón de Ardoz for printing press scenes [19] As the show was designed as a limited series, all sets were destroyed once production of part 2 had finished [15]\n\n\nMusic\nThe series' theme song, \"My Life Is Going On\", was composed by Manel Santisteban, who also served as composer on Locked Up Santisteban approached Spanish singer, Cecilia Krull, to write and perform the lyrics, which are about having confidence in one's abilities and the future [57] The theme song is played behind a title sequence featuring paper models of major settings from the series [57] Krull's main source of inspiration was the character Tokyo in the first episode of the series, when the Professor offers her a way out of a desperate moment [58] The lyrics are in English as the language that came naturally to Krull at the time of writing [58]\n\n\nEpisodes\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman using the alias \"Tokyo\" as a man called the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police He proposes to include her in a heist of massive proportions After a brief outline of the plan, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid The eight robbers are code-named for cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki, and Oslo Dressed in red jumpsuits and masks depicting artist Salvador Dalí, the robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with €2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel The Professor heads the heist from an external location Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation at an abandoned hunting estate in the Toledo countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and are warned that there will be casualties.\n\n\nSeason 1: Parts 1 and 2 (2017)\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman using the alias \"Tokyo\" as a man called the

personal relationships, and are warned that there will be casualties.\n\n\nSeason 2: Parts 3, 4 and 5 (2019–2021)\nPart 3 begins three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, and restarts the story showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations However, when Europol captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the Bank of Spain to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including Mónica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together, and enlist three new members: Palermo, Bogotá and Marseille, with Palermo in charge Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets At the same time, the Professor and Lisbon travel in an RV and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police The robbers thwart a police breach of the bank, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers Nairobi is injured by a police sniper's shot to the chest With another police assault on the bank coming, and believing Lisbon has been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares DEFCON 2 The robbers respond by firing a rocket at the armored police vehicle that is advancing on the bank, turning the robbers from folk heroes to killers in the eyes of the public Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for a trap She concludes that because of the Professor's miscalculation, \"the war had begun.\"\n\n\nThemes and analysis\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the heist genre While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong Spanish identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo [63] The producers regarded the cultural identity as an important part of the personality of the series, as it made the story more relatable for viewers [18] They also avoided adapting the series to international tastes, [18] which helped to set it apart from the usual American TV series [64] and raised international awareness of Spanish sensibilities [18] Emotional dynamics like the passion and impulsivity of friendship and love offset the perfect strategic crime for increased tension [49] [63] Nearly all main characters, including the relationship-opposing Professor, eventually succumb to love, [55] for which the series received comparisons to telenovelas [6] [65] Comedic elements, which were compared to Back to the Future [21] and black comedy, [52] also offset the heist tension [66] The heist film formula is subverted by the heist starting straight after the opening credits instead of lingering on how the gang is brought together [67]\n\n\nBroadcast and release\nPart 1 aired on free-to-air Spanish TV channel Antena 3 in the Wednesday 10:40 p.m time slot from 2 May 2017 till 27 June 2017 [45] Part 2 moved to the Monday 10:40 p.m time slot and was broadcast from 16 October 2017 till 23 November 2017, [79] with the originally planned 18 to 21 episodes cut down to 15 [14] [80] As the series was developed with Spanish prime-time television in mind, [8] the episodes had a length of around 70 minutes, as is typical for Spanish television [81] The first five episodes of part 1 were followed by an aftershow entitled Tercer Grado (Third Grade) [22]\n\n\nOriginal broadcast\nPart 1 aired on free-to-air Spanish TV channel Antena 3 in the Wednesday 10:40 p.m

The first five episodes of part 1 were followed by an aftershow entitled Tercer Grado (Third Grade) [22]\n\n\nNetflix acquisition\nPart 1 was made available on Netflix Spain on 1 July 2017, like other series belonging to Antena 3's parent media group Atresmedia [85] In December 2017, Netflix acquired the exclusive global streaming rights for the series [71] [85] Netflix re-cut the series into 22 episodes of around 50 minutes' length [81] Cliffhangers and scenes had to be divided and moved to other episodes, but this proved less drastic than expected because of the series' perpetual plot twists [81] Netflix dubbed the series and renamed it from La casa de papel to Money Heist for distribution in the English-speaking world, [71] releasing the first part on 20 December 2017 without any promotion [14] [19] The second part was made available for streaming on 6 April 2018 [19] Pina assessed the viewer experience on Antena 3 versus Netflix as \"very different\", although the essence of the series remained the same [81]\n\n\nRenewal\nIn October 2017, Álex Pina said that part 2 had remote but intentional spin-off possibilities, and that his team was open to continue the robbers' story in the form of movies or a Netflix renewal [89] Following the show's success on the streaming platform, Netflix approached Pina and Atresmedia to produce new chapters for the originally self-contained story The writers withdrew themselves for more than two months to decide on a direction, [43] creating a bible with central ideas for new episodes in the process [25] The crucial factors in accepting Netflix's deal were the creators recognising that characters still had things to say, and having the opportunity to deviate from the perfectly orchestrated heist of the first two parts [49] Adamant that the story should be set in Spain again, [52] the producers wanted to make it a sequel rather than a direct continuation, and expand on the familiarity and affection between the characters instead of the former group of strangers [8] Rio's capture was chosen as the catalyst to get the gang back together because he as the narrator's boyfriend represented the necessary emotional factor for the renewal not to be \"suicide.\" [90]\n\n\nReception\nThe series' beginning on Antena 3 was received well by Spanish media [83] Nayín Costas of El Confidencial named the premiere a promising start that captivated viewers with \"adrenaline, well-dosed touches of humor and a lot of tension,\" but considered it a challenge to maintain the dramatic tension for the remainder of the series [108] While considering the pilot's voice-over narration unnecessary and the sound editing and dialogs lacking, Natalia Marcos of El País enjoyed the show's ensemble cast and the ambition, saying \"It is daring, brazen and entertaining, at least when it starts Now we want more, which is not little.\" [41] Reviewing the full first part, Marcos lauded the series for its outstanding direction, the musical selection and for trying to innovate Spanish television, but criticized the length and ebbing tension [84] At the end of the series' original run, Nayín Costas of El Confidencial commended the series for its \"high quality closure\" that may make the finale \"one of the best episodes of the Spanish season\", but regretted that it aimed to satisfy viewers with a predictable happy ending rather than risk to \"do something different, original, ambitious\", and that the show was unable to follow in the footsteps of Pina's Locked Up [109]\n\n\nCritical reception\nThe series' beginning on Antena 3

of the most popular series on IMDb [81] It regularly trended on Twitter world-wide, largely because celebrities commented on it, such as football players Neymar and Marc Bartra, American singer Romeo Santos, [19] and author Stephen King [74] While users flooded social networks with media of themselves wearing the robbers' outfit, [19] the robbers' costumes were worn at the Rio Carnival, and Dalí icons were shown on huge banners in Saudi Arabia football stadiums [81] Real footage of these events would later be shown in part 3 as a tribute to the show's international success [112] The Musée Grévin in Paris added statues of the robbers to its wax museum in summer 2018 [6] The show's iconography was used prominently by third parties for advertising, [115] sports presentations, [116] and in porn [117]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nIn November 2020, Netflix announced that it would create a South Korean adaptation of the show The 12-part production, titled Money Heist: Korea - Joint

Heist**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nMoney Heist, also known as La Casa de Papel in Spanish, is a Spanish television series created by Álex Pina for Antena 3. The series premiered on May 2, 2017, and has since become a global phenomenon, attracting millions of viewers worldwide. The show's unique blend of crime, drama, and social commentary has made it a critical and commercial success, leading to international adaptations and spin-offs.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe series follows the story of a group of eight thieves, each with their own unique skills and personalities, who plan and execute a massive heist on the Royal Mint of Spain. Led by the enigmatic Professor, the team, code-named for cities, uses their skills and expertise to infiltrate the mint and print €984 million in cash. As the heist unfolds, the team must navigate the complexities of their plan, while also dealing with the consequences of their actions.\n\n**Set in Madrid, a mysterious man known as the \"Professor\" recruits a group of eight people, who choose city names as their aliases for anonymity, to carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the Royal Mint of Spain, and escaping with €984 million**\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe show features an ensemble cast of talented actors, each bringing their own unique energy to their characters. The main cast includes:\n\n* Álvaro Morte as the Professor\n* Itziar Ituño as Raquel Murillo, aka Lisbon\n* Pedro Alonso as Andrés de Fonollosa, aka Berlin\n* Alba Flores as Ágata Jiménez, aka Nairobi\n* Miguel Herrán as Aníbal Cortés, aka Rio\n* Jaime Lorente as Daniel Ramos, aka Denver\n* Esther Acebo as Mónica Gaztambide, aka Stockholm\n* Darko Perić as Mario Uyarte, aka Oslo\n* Enrique Arce as Arturo Román, aka Tokyo\n* Belén Cuesta as María Taboada, aka Helsinki\n* Kiti Mánver as Amelia, aka Lisbon's mother\n* Luka Peroš as Sergio Marquina, aka Rio's brother\n\n**Main**\n\nThe series consists of four main parts, each with its own unique storyline and themes. Part 1 follows the team as they plan and execute the heist, while Part 2 explores the aftermath of the heist and the team's struggles to stay together. Part 3 introduces new characters and a new storyline, while Part 4 is a standalone episode that explores the team's past.\n\n**Recurring**\n\nThroughout the series, there are several recurring characters and storylines that add depth and complexity to the show. These include the team's relationships with each other, their personal struggles and motivations, and the police investigation into the heist.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe show was produced by Álex Pina, Jesús Colmenar, and Migue Amoedo, with a team of writers and directors. The show's look and atmosphere were developed by the creators, who drew inspiration from art, fashion, and popular culture.\n\n**Conception and Writing**\n\nThe show's concept was developed by Álex Pina, who wanted to create a show that would subvert the traditional heist genre. Pina drew inspiration from his own experiences as a writer and producer, as well as from popular culture and art.\n\n**Casting**\n\nCasting took place late in February 2016, spanning more than two months. The characters were not fully fleshed out at the beginning of this process, and took shape based on the actors' performances. Casting directors Eva Leira and Yolanda Serrano were looking for actors with the ability to play empathetic robbers with believable love and family connections.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe show's look and atmosphere were developed by creator Álex Pina, director Jesús Colmenar, and director of photography Migue Amoedo, according to La Vanguardia \"the most prolific television trio in recent years\". Abdón Alcañiz served as art director. Their collaboration projects usually take a primary colour as a basis; Money Heist had red as \"one of the distinguishing features of the series\" that stood over the gray sets. Blue, green and yellow were marked as a forbidden colour in production design.\n\n**Filming**\n\nParts 1 and 2 were filmed back-to-back in the greater Madrid region from January until August 2017. The pilot episode was recorded in 26 days, while all other episodes had around 14 filming days. Production was split into two units to save time, with one unit shooting scenes involving the Professor and the police, and the other filming scenes with the robbers.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe series' theme song, \"My Life Is Going On\", was composed by Manel Santisteban, who also served as composer on Locked Up. Santisteban approached Spanish singer, Cecilia Krull, to write and perform the lyrics, which are about having confidence in one's abilities and the future.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman using the alias \"Tokyo\" as a man called the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police. He proposes to include her in a heist of massive proportions. After a brief outline of the plan, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid.\n\n**Season 1: Parts 1 and 2 (2017)**\n\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman using the alias \"Tokyo\" as a man called the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police. He proposes to include her in a heist of massive proportions. After a brief outline of the plan, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid.\n\n**Season 2: Parts 3, 4 and 5 (2019–2021)**\n\nPart 3 begins three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, and restarts the story showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when Europol captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the Bank of Spain to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture.\n\n**Themes and Analysis**\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the heist genre. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong Spanish identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.\n\n**Broadcast and Release**\n\nPart 1 aired on free-to-air Spanish TV channel Antena 3 in the Wednesday 10:40 p.m time slot from 2 May 2017 till 27 June 2017. Part 2 moved to the Monday 10:40 p.m time slot and was broadcast from 16 October 2017 till 23 November 2017, with the originally planned 18 to 21 episodes cut down to 15.\n\n**Netflix Acquisition**\n\nPart 1 was made available on Netflix Spain on 1 July 2017, like other series belonging to Antena 3's parent media group Atresmedia. In December 2017, Netflix acquired the exclusive global streaming rights for the series.\n\n**Renewal**\n\nIn October 2017, Álex Pina said that part 2 had remote but intentional spin-off possibilities, and that his team was open to continue the robbers' story in the form of movies or a Netflix renewal. Following the show's success on the streaming platform, Netflix approached Pina and Atresmedia to produce new chapters for the originally self-contained story.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe series' beginning on Antena 3 was received well by Spanish media. Nayín Costas of El Confidencial named the premiere a promising start that captivated viewers with \"adrenaline, well-dosed touches of humor and a lot of tension,\" but considered it a challenge to maintain the dramatic tension for the remainder of the series.\n\n**Public Response**\n\nAfter the move to Netflix, the series remained the most-followed series on Netflix for six consecutive weeks and became one of the most popular series on IMDb. It regularly trended on Twitter world-wide, largely because celebrities commented on it.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nIn November 2020, Netflix announced that it would create a South Korean adaptation of the show. The 12-part production, titled Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area, will be a collaboration between BH Entertainment and Contents Zium, with Kim Hong-sun set to direct.\n\n**Adaptation and Spin-off**\n\nIn November 2020, Netflix announced that it would create a South Korean adaptation of the show.

February 2016, spanning more than two months [21] The characters were not fully fleshed out at the beginning of this process, and took shape based on the actors' performances [22] Casting directors Eva Leira and Yolanda Serrano were looking for actors with the ability to play empathetic robbers with believable love and family connections [23] Antena 3 announced the ensemble cast in March 2017 [24] and released audition excerpts of most cast actors in the series' aftershow Tercer Grado and on their website [22]\n\n\nDesign\nThe show's look and atmosphere were developed by creator Álex Pina,

and yellow were marked as a forbidden colour in production design [42] To achieve \"absolute film quality\", red tones were tested with different types of fabrics, textures and lighting [43] The iconography of the robbers' red jumpsuits mirrored the yellow prison dress code in Locked Up [41] For part 3, the Italian retail clothing company Diesel modified the red jumpsuits to better fit the body and launched a clothing line inspired by the series [42] Salvador Dalí was chosen as the robbers' mask design because of Dalí's recognisable visage that also serves as an iconic cultural reference to Spain; Don Quixote as an alternative mask design was discarded [44] This choice sparked criticism by the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation for not requesting the necessary permissions [23]\n\n\nFilming\nParts 1 and 2 were filmed back-to-back in the greater Madrid region from January until August 2017 [19] [21] [48] The pilot episode was recorded in 26 days, [45] while all other episodes had around 14 filming days [12] Production was split into two units to save time, with one unit shooting scenes involving the Professor and the police, and the other filming scenes with the robbers [15] The main storyline is set in the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid, but the exterior scenes were filmed at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) headquarters for its passing resemblance to the Mint, [45] and on the roof of the Higher Technical School of Aeronautical Engineers, part of the Technical University of Madrid [48] The hunting estate where the robbers plan their coup was filmed at the Finca El Gasco farm estate in Torrelodones [48] Interior filming took place at the former Locked Up sets in Colmenar Viejo [9] and at the Spanish national daily newspaper ABC in Torrejón de Ardoz for printing press scenes [19] As the show was designed as a limited series, all sets were destroyed once production of part 2 had finished [15]\n\n\nMusic\nThe series' theme song, \"My Life Is Going On\", was composed by Manel Santisteban, who also served as composer on Locked Up Santisteban approached Spanish singer, Cecilia Krull, to write and perform the lyrics, which are about having confidence in one's abilities and the future [57] The theme song is played behind a title sequence featuring paper models of major settings from the series [57] Krull's main source of inspiration was the character Tokyo in the first episode of the series, when the Professor offers her a way out of a desperate moment [58] The lyrics are in English as the language that came naturally to Krull at the time of writing [58]\n\n\nEpisodes\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman using the alias \"Tokyo\" as a man called the \"Professor\" saves her from

Bank of Spain to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including Mónica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together, and enlist three new members: Palermo, Bogotá and Marseille, with Palermo in charge Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets At the same time, the Professor and Lisbon travel in an RV and then an ambulance while

robbers Nairobi is injured by a police sniper's shot to the chest With another police assault on the bank coming, and believing Lisbon has been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares DEFCON 2 The robbers respond by firing a rocket at the armored police vehicle that is advancing on the bank, turning the robbers from folk heroes to killers in the eyes of the public Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for a trap She concludes that because of the Professor's miscalculation, \"the war had begun.\"\n\n\nThemes and analysis\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the heist genre While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong Spanish identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo [63] The producers regarded the cultural identity as an important part of the personality of the series, as it made the story more relatable for viewers [18] They also avoided adapting the series to international tastes, [18] which helped to set it apart from the usual American TV series [64] and raised international awareness of Spanish sensibilities [18] Emotional dynamics like the passion and impulsivity of friendship and love offset the perfect strategic crime for increased tension [49] [63] Nearly all main characters, including the relationship-opposing Professor, eventually succumb to love, [55] for which the series received comparisons to telenovelas [6] [65] Comedic elements, which were compared to Back to the Future [21] and black comedy, [52] also offset the heist tension [66] The heist film formula is subverted by the heist starting straight after the opening credits instead of lingering on how the gang is brought together [67]\n\n\nBroadcast and release\nPart 1 aired on free-to-air Spanish TV channel Antena 3 in the Wednesday 10:40 p.m time slot from 2

episodes of around 50 minutes' length [81] Cliffhangers and scenes had to be divided and moved to other episodes, but this proved less drastic than expected because of the series' perpetual plot twists [81] Netflix dubbed the series and renamed it from La casa de papel to Money Heist for distribution in the English-speaking world, [71] releasing the first part on 20 December 2017 without any promotion [14] [19] The second part was made available for streaming on 6 April 2018 [19] Pina assessed the viewer experience on Antena 3 versus Netflix as \"very different\", although the essence of the series remained the same [81]\n\n\nRenewal\nIn October 2017, Álex Pina said that part 2 had remote but intentional spin-off possibilities, and that his team was open to continue the robbers' story in the form of movies or a Netflix renewal [89] Following the show's success on the streaming platform, Netflix approached Pina and Atresmedia to produce new chapters for the originally self-contained story The writers withdrew themselves for more than two months to decide on a direction, [43] creating a bible with central ideas for new episodes in the process [25] The crucial factors in accepting Netflix's deal were the creators recognising that characters still had things to say, and having the opportunity to deviate from the perfectly orchestrated heist of the first two parts [49] Adamant that the story should be set in Spain again, [52] the producers wanted to make it a sequel rather than a direct continuation, and expand on the familiarity and affection between the characters instead of the former group of strangers [8] Rio's capture was chosen as the catalyst to get the gang back together because he as the narrator's boyfriend represented the necessary emotional factor for the renewal not to be \"suicide.\" [90]\n\n\nReception\nThe series' beginning on Antena 3 was received well by Spanish media [83] Nayín Costas of El Confidencial named the premiere a promising start that captivated viewers with \"adrenaline, well-dosed touches of humor and a lot of tension,\" but considered it a challenge to maintain the dramatic tension for the remainder of the series [108] While considering the pilot's voice-over narration unnecessary and the sound editing and dialogs lacking, Natalia Marcos of El País enjoyed the show's ensemble cast and the ambition, saying \"It is daring, brazen and entertaining, at least when it starts Now we want more, which is not little.\" [41] Reviewing the full first part, Marcos lauded the series for its outstanding direction, the musical selection and for trying to innovate Spanish television, but criticized the length and ebbing tension [84] At the end of the series' original run, Nayín Costas of El Confidencial commended the series for its \"high quality closure\" that may make the finale \"one of the best episodes of the Spanish season\", but regretted that it aimed to satisfy viewers with a predictable happy ending rather than risk to \"do something different, original, ambitious\", and that the show was unable to follow in the footsteps of Pina's Locked Up [109]\n\n\nCritical reception\nThe series' beginning on Antena 3

Santos, [19] and author Stephen King [74] While users flooded social networks with media of themselves wearing the robbers' outfit, [19] the robbers' costumes were worn at the Rio Carnival, and Dalí icons were shown on huge banners in Saudi Arabia football stadiums [81] Real footage of these events would later be shown in part 3 as a tribute to the show's international success [112] The Musée

father, Caesar Tenuta [2] [7]\n\n\nCareer\nTenuta began her comedy career performing openers and small time shows on the Chicago comedy circuit in the 1970s [4] [5] During her first performance, Tenuta shocked audiences by dressing up as the Virgin Mary, and after being encouraged by her friends to incorporate an accordion into her routine, she began to develop the character into her iconic persona as the wisecracking \"Love Goddess\" [5]\n\n\nComedy career\nTenuta began her comedy career performing openers and small time shows on the Chicago comedy circuit in the 1970s [4] [5] During her first performance, Tenuta shocked audiences by dressing up as the Virgin Mary, and after being encouraged by her friends to incorporate an accordion into her routine, she began to develop the character into her iconic persona as the wisecracking \"Love Goddess\" [5]\n\n\nOther ventures\nTenuta's use of her voice in her stand-up act lent itself to voice-over work in several animated programs This included doing the voice of Edna on Duckman, Munch Kelly on Cow and Chicken in the banned episode \"Buffalo Gals\", [11] Black Widow on Space Ghost Coast to Coast, [12] a foul-mouthed mermaid in Johnny Bravo, Queen Porcina in Mighty Magiswords and as herself in Dr Katz, Professional Therapist She appeared in numerous film and television roles, including the dominatrix disciplinarian \"Samantha Rottweiler\" in Butch Camp, and the loud-mouthed librarian \"Mrs Holler\" in Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide [13] [14] She also played various minor characters on The Weird Al Show, was featured in many of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's comedy shorts and music videos, and appeared in dozens of other minor acting roles [14]\n\n\nStand up routine\nTenuta's act was primarily structured around an exaggerated, campy, and offbeat persona that was referred to primarily as \"The Love Goddess\" [19] She also styled herself with other monikers including \"The Petite Flower\", \"Aphrodite of the Accordion\", \"Fashion-Plate Saint\", \"Queen of Candy-Pants\", \"Princess of Panty Shields\", \"Empress of Elvis Impersonators,\" and the \"Buffer of Foreheads.\" [20] [21] Her routine, which blended observational and insult humor, was a performance of \"surreal lunacy.\" [6] \"The Love Goddess\" began every show with her signature greeting \"Hi Pigs!\" before diving into a bawdy, chaotic, and whimsical whirlwind of stories, impressions, and songs [6] One review of a 1987 performance reported that Tenuta's show was a veritable \"onslaught\" of \"atavistic growlings and gum-chewing bimbo stances,\" filled with \"little nasties,\" crass jokes, and \"political offensiveness\" [22]\n\n\nPersona\nTenuta's act was primarily structured around an exaggerated,

Borscht Belt and Vaudeville comedy styles [6] As \"The Love Goddess,\" Tenuta regularly lampooned religion, politics, celebrities, sports, and current events [23] [24] Most of Tenuta's content passed through the filter of her faux religion \"Judyism,\" which, in her own words, aimed to \"help you forget about your problems and think about mine for a change\" [10] Throughout her act, Judy continuously worked to convince the women in her audience to convert to Judyism, and bloom into Love Goddesses themselves [25] [26]\n\n\nAudience interaction\nTenuta's performances were renowned for a high level of audience interaction and participation She was known for picking on audience members, making them targets of her jokes and roping them in on-stage antics [4] One 1996 show review by The Chicago Tribune detailed a performance Tenuta gave in her home town in which she performed especially unconventional comic routines, including: ordering a pizza directly to herself on stage and having the local pizza delivery man feed it to her; performing a \"fertility dance\" over the \"prostrate\" figure of the club's booker; and having her own mother \"forced to feed pickled weiners to 'stud puppets  [scantily clad men].'\" [28] She even convinced 'two large and seemingly conservative suburban gentlemen to engage in a peculiar and obscene dance with clown wigs, a set of fake breasts, and large inflatable phallus.\" [28] Tenuta was especially known for bringing male audience members onto stage, and shoving her used gum into their mouths [4]\n\n\nGay rights\nTenuta was an outspoken

{"title": "Ohio", "content": "\nHistory\nArcheological evidence of spear points of both the Folsom and Clovis types indicate that the Ohio Valley was inhabited by nomadic people as early as 13,000 BC [22] These early nomads disappeared from Ohio by 1,000 BC [22] Between 1,000 and 800 BC, the sedentary Adena culture emerged The Adena established \"semi-permanent\" villages because they domesticated plants, including sunflowers, and \"grew squash and possibly corn\"; with hunting and gathering, this cultivation supported more settled, complex villages [23] The most notable remnant of the Adena culture is the Great Serpent Mound, located in Adams County, Ohio [23]\n\n\nIndigenous settlement\nArcheological evidence of spear points of both the Folsom and Clovis types indicate that the Ohio

settled, complex villages [23] The most notable remnant of the Adena culture is the Great Serpent Mound, located in Adams County, Ohio [23]\n\n\nColonial and Revolutionary eras\nDuring the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region Beginning in 1754, the Kingdom of France and Kingdom of Great Britain fought in the French and Indian War, with various Native American tribes on each side As a result of the Treaty of Paris, the French ceded control of Ohio and the remainder of the Old Northwest to Great Britain in 1763 [34]\n\n\nNorthwest Territory\nThe United States created the Northwest Territory under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 [47] Slavery was not permitted in the new territory Settlement began with the founding of Marietta by the Ohio Company of Associates, which had been formed by a group of American Revolutionary War veterans Following the Ohio Company, the Miami Company (also referred to as the \"Symmes Purchase\") claimed the southwestern section, and the Connecticut Land Company surveyed and settled the Connecticut Western Reserve in present-day Northeast Ohio Territorial surveyors from Fort Steuben began surveying an area of eastern Ohio called the Seven Ranges at about the same time.\n\n\nRufus Putnam, the \"Father of Ohio\"\nRufus Putnam served in important military capacities in both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War He was one of the most highly respected men in the early years of the United States [49]\n\n\nStatehood and early years\nOn February 19, 1803, U.S President Thomas Jefferson signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution [56] But Congress had not passed a formal resolution admitting Ohio as the 17th state Although no formal resolution of admission was required, when the oversight was discovered in 1953, as Ohio began preparations for celebrating its sesquicentennial, Ohio congressman George H Bender introduced a bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, the date on which the Ohio General Assembly first convened [57] At a special session at the old state capital in Chillicothe, the Ohio state legislature approved a new petition for statehood, which was delivered to Washington, D.C., on horseback, and approved that August [57] [58] [59]\n\n\nCivil War and industrialization\nOhio's central position and its population gave it an important place in the Civil War The Ohio River was a vital artery for troop and supply movements, as were Ohio's railroads Ohio's industry made it one of the most important states in the Union during the war It contributed more soldiers per capita than any other state in the Union In 1862, the state's morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the Battle of Shiloh, a costly victory in which Ohio forces suffered 2,000 casualties [63] Later that year, when Confederate troops under the leadership of Stonewall Jackson threatened Washington, D.C., Ohio governor David Tod recruited 5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service [64] From July 13 to 26, 1863, towns along the Ohio River were attacked and ransacked in Morgan's Raid, starting in Harrison in the west and culminating in the Battle of Salineville near West Point in the far east While this raid was overall insignificant to the Confederacy, it aroused fear among people in Ohio and Indiana as it was the furthest advancement of troops from the South in the war [65] Almost 35,000 Ohioans died in the conflict, and 30,000 were physically wounded [66] By the end of the Civil War, the Union's top three generals—Ulysses S Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan—were all from Ohio [67]\n\n\n20th century\nThe state legislature officially adopted the flag of Ohio on May 9, 1902 [69] Dayton natives Orville and Wilbur Wright made four brief flights at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, inventing the first successful airplane [70] Ohio was hit by its greatest natural disaster in the Great Flood of 1913, resulting in at least 428 fatalities and hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage, particularly around the Great Miami River basin [71]\n\n\n21st century\nOhio's economy has undergone significant change in the 21st century, as the trend of deindustrialization has greatly impacted the American Midwest and the Rust Belt Manufacturing in the Midwest experienced a stark decline during the early 21st century, [82] a trend that greatly impacted Ohio From 1990 to 2019, it lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs, but added over 1,000,000 non-manufacturing jobs [82] Coinciding with this decline, Ohio has seen a large decline in union membership: 17.4% of Ohioan workers were union members in 2000, while 12.8% were union members in 2022 [83]\n\n\nGeography\nOhio's location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion Because it links the Northeast to the Midwest, much cargo and business traffic passes through its borders along its well-developed highways Ohio has the nation's 10th-largest highway network and is within a one-day drive of 50% of North America's population and 70% of North America's manufacturing capacity [98] To the north, Ohio has 312 miles (502 km) of coastline with Lake Erie, [99] which allows for numerous cargo ports such as Cleveland and Toledo Ohio's southern border is defined by the Ohio River Ohio's neighbors are Pennsylvania to the east, Michigan to the northwest, Lake Erie to the north, Indiana to the west, Kentucky on the south, and West Virginia on the southeast Ohio's borders were defined by metes and bounds in the Enabling Act of 1802 as follows:\n\n\nFauna\nOhio has wide variety of unique animal species Rare and endangered species include the Eastern Hellbender, which is found in the Southeastern Appalachian region of Ohio and is classified as state endangered [107] The Eastern Hellbender is the 3rd largest amphibian in the world, and can grow up to 27 inches in length It is fully aquatic and breathes almost entirely through its skin Due to this, it is only found in pristine, cool, clear, fast flowing streams and rivers It is highly threatened by habitat loss, water pollution, and sedimentation due to logging and other human activities [108]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Ohio is a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb) throughout most of the state, except in the extreme southern counties of Ohio's Bluegrass region section, which are located on the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and Upland South region of the United States Summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state, while winters generally range from cool to cold Precipitation in Ohio is moderate year-round Severe weather is not uncommon in the state, although there are typically fewer tornado reports in Ohio than in states located in what is known as the Tornado Alley Severe lake effect snowstorms are also not uncommon on the southeast shore of Lake Erie, which is located in an area designated as the Snowbelt.\n\n\nEarthquakes\nAlthough few have registered as noticeable to the average resident, more than 200 earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.0 or higher have occurred in Ohio since 1776 [114] The Western Ohio Seismic Zone and a portion of the Southern Great Lakes Seismic Zone are located in the state, and numerous faults lie under the surface [114] [115]\n\n\nCities\nThere are 13 metropolitan statistical areas in Ohio, anchored by 16 cities, as defined by the U.S Office of Management and Budget Additionally, 30 Ohio cities function as centers of micropolitan statistical areas, urban clusters smaller than that of metropolitan areas Ohio's three largest cities are Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati.\n\n\nDemographics\nFrom just over 45,000 residents in 1800, Ohio's population grew faster than 10% per decade (except for the 1940 census) until the 1970 census, which recorded just over 10.65 million Ohioans [131] Growth then slowed for the next four decades [132] The United States Census Bureau counted 11,808,848 in the 2020 census, a 2.4% increase since the 2010 United States census [133] Ohio's population growth lags that of the entire United States, and whites are found in a greater density than the U.S average As of 2000 [update], Ohio's center of population is located in Morrow County, [134] in the county seat of Mount Gilead [135] This is approximately 6,346 feet (1,934 m) south and west of Ohio's population center in 1990

black populations in all major metropolitan areas throughout the state, Ohio has a significant Hispanic population made up of Mexicans in Toledo and Columbus, and Puerto Ricans in Cleveland and Columbus, and also has a significant and diverse Asian population in Columbus.\n\n\nLanguages\nAbout 6.7% of the population age 5 years and older reported speaking a language other than English, with 2.2% of the population speaking Spanish, 2.6% speaking other Indo-European languages, 1.1% speaking Asian and Austronesian languages, and 0.8% speaking other languages [12] Numerically: 10,100,586

As the years passed, the Adena culture emerged, establishing \"semi-permanent\" villages through the domestication of plants, including sunflowers, and the cultivation of squash and possibly corn. This cultivation supported more settled, complex villages.\n\n## Indigenous Settlement\n\nBetween 1,000 and 800 BC, the Adena culture flourished in Ohio. The Adena established villages that were more permanent and complex than those of the earlier nomadic peoples. The Adena culture is notable for its distinctive earthen mounds, which were used for ceremonial and burial purposes. The Great Serpent Mound, located in Adams County, Ohio, is one of the most impressive examples of Adena architecture and is considered one of the most impressive earthworks in the world.\n\n## Colonial and Revolutionary Eras\n\nDuring the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region. The French and Indian War (1754-1763) saw the French cede control of Ohio and the remainder of the Old Northwest to Great Britain. As a result of the Treaty of Paris, the French ceded control of Ohio to Great Britain in 1763.\n\n## Northwest Territory\n\nThe United States created the Northwest Territory under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Slavery was not permitted in the new territory, and settlement began with the founding of Marietta by the Ohio Company of Associates, a group of American Revolutionary War veterans. Following the Ohio Company, the Miami Company (also referred to as the \"Symmes Purchase\") claimed the southwestern section, and the Connecticut Land Company surveyed and settled the Connecticut Western Reserve in present-day Northeast Ohio.\n\n## Rufus Putnam, the \"Father of Ohio\"\n\nRufus Putnam served in important military capacities in both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. He was one of the most highly respected men in the early years of the United States and played a significant role in the founding of Ohio.\n\n## Statehood and Early Years\n\nOn February 19, 1803, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution. However, Congress had not passed a formal resolution admitting Ohio as the 17th state. When the oversight was discovered in 1953, Ohio congressman George H. Bender introduced a bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, the date on which the Ohio state legislature first convened.\n\n## Civil War and Industrialization\n\nOhio's central position and population gave it an important place in the Civil War. The Ohio River was a vital artery for troop and supply movements, as were Ohio's railroads. Ohio's industry made it one of the most important states in the Union during the war. The state contributed more soldiers per capita than any other state in the Union. In 1862, the state's morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the Battle of Shiloh, a costly victory in which Ohio forces suffered 2,000 casualties.\n\n## 20th Century\n\nThe state legislature officially adopted the flag of Ohio on May 9, 1902. Dayton natives Orville and Wilbur Wright made four brief flights at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, inventing the first successful airplane. Ohio was hit by its greatest natural disaster in the Great Flood of 1913, resulting in at least 428 fatalities and hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage, particularly around the Great Miami River basin.\n\n## 21st Century\n\nOhio's economy has undergone significant change in the 21st century, as the trend of deindustrialization has greatly impacted the American Midwest and the Rust Belt. Manufacturing in the Midwest experienced a stark decline during the early 21st century, a trend that greatly impacted Ohio. From 1990 to 2019, it lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs, but added over 1,000,000 non-manufacturing jobs.\n\n# Geography\n\nOhio's location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion. It links the Northeast to the Midwest, making it a crucial hub for cargo and business traffic. Ohio has the nation's 10th-largest highway network and is within a one-day drive of 50% of North America's population and 70% of North America's manufacturing capacity.\n\n## Fauna\n\nOhio has a wide variety of unique animal species. Rare and endangered species include the Eastern Hellbender, which is found in the Southeastern Appalachian region of Ohio and is classified as state endangered. The Eastern Hellbender is the 3rd largest amphibian in the world, and can grow up to 27 inches in length.\n\n## Climate\n\nThe climate of Ohio is a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb) throughout most of the state, except in the extreme southern counties of Ohio's Bluegrass region section, which are located on the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and Upland South region of the United States. Summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state, while winters generally range from cool to cold.\n\n## Earthquakes\n\nAlthough few have registered as noticeable to the average resident, more than 200 earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.0 or higher have occurred in Ohio since 1776. The Western Ohio Seismic Zone and a portion of the Southern Great Lakes Seismic Zone are located in the state, and numerous faults lie under the surface.\n\n# Cities\n\nOhio has 13 metropolitan statistical areas, anchored by 16 cities, as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Additionally, 30 Ohio cities function as centers of micropolitan statistical areas, urban clusters smaller than that of metropolitan areas. Ohio's three largest cities are Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati.\n\n# Demographics\n\nFrom just over 45,000 residents in 1800, Ohio's population grew faster than 10% per decade (except for the 1940 census) until the 1970 census, which recorded just over 10.65 million Ohioans. Growth then slowed for the next four decades. The United States Census Bureau counted 11,808,848 in the 2020 census, a 2.4% increase since the 2010 United States census. Ohio's population growth lags that of the entire United States, and whites are found in a greater density than the U.S. average.\n\n# Economy\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the total number of people employed in 2016 was 4,790,178. The total number of unique employer establishments was 252,201, while the total number of non-employer establishments was 785,833. In 2010, Ohio was ranked second in the country for best business climate by Site Selection magazine, based on a business-activity database. The state has also won three consecutive Governor's Cup awards from the magazine, based on business growth and developments. As of 2016, Ohio's gross domestic product (GDP) was $626 billion. This ranks Ohio's economy as the seventh-largest among all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\n\n# Culture\n\nOhio is home to 30 art institutions, including the Columbus Museum of Art, Cincinnati Art Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art, and other entities. The full list includes museums, galleries, and cultural centers that showcase a wide range of artistic and cultural expressions.\n\n## Art\n\nOhio is home to 30 art institutions, including the Columbus Museum of Art, Cincinnati Art Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art, and other entities. The full list includes museums, galleries, and cultural centers that showcase a wide range of artistic and cultural expressions.\n\n## Cuisine\n\nBuckeye candy is a local specialty, popular in the state of Ohio. The confection is a variation of standard peanut butter cups known as a 'Buckeye.' Coated in chocolate, with a partially exposed center of peanut butter fudge, the candy resembles the appearance of the nut that grows on the state tree, commonly known as the buckeye.\n\n## Music\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame are both located in Cleveland. Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed is credited with coining the term and promoting rock and roll in the early 1950s. Cincinnati is home to the American Classical Music Hall of Fame and Museum. Six Ohio musicians are Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members, including Dave Grohl, the Isley Brothers, Nine Inch Nails, Bobby Womack, Benjamin Orr, and Chrissie Hynde.\n\n## Sports\n\nOhio is home to eight professional sports teams across the five different major leagues in the United States. Current teams include the Cincinnati Reds and Cleveland Guardians of Major League Baseball, the Columbus Crew and FC Cincinnati of Major League Soccer, the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association, the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns of the National Football League, and the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League.\n\n# Government and Politics\n\n## State Government\n\nThe state government of Ohio consists of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The Governor serves as the head of the executive branch, while the General Assembly is the legislative branch. The Supreme Court of Ohio is the highest court in the state.\n\n## Local Government\n\nThere are also several levels of local government in Ohio: counties, municipalities (cities and villages), townships, special districts, and school districts.\n\n## Politics\n\nHistorian R. Douglas Hurt asserts that not since Virginia \"had a state made such a mark on national political affairs\" as Ohio. The Economist notes that \"This slice of the mid-west contains a bit of everything American—part north-eastern and part southern, part urban and part rural, part hardscrabble poverty and part booming suburb.\"\n\n## \"Mother of Presidents\"\n\nSix U.S. presidents hailed from Ohio at the time of their elections, giving rise to its nickname \"mother of presidents,\" a sobriquet it shares with Virginia. It is also termed \"modern mother of presidents,\" in contrast to Virginia's status as the origin of presidents earlier in American history. Virginia-born William Henry Harrison lived much of his life in North Bend, Ohio, was elected from the state, and is also buried there. The other five presidents are Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, William Howard Taft, and Warren G. Harding.\n\n## Allegations of Voter Suppression\n\nIn a 2020 study, Ohio was ranked as the 17th hardest state for citizens to vote in. Since 1994, the state has had a policy of purging infrequent voters from its rolls. In April 2016, a lawsuit was filed, challenging this policy on the grounds that it violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002. In June, the federal district court ruled for the plaintiffs and entered a preliminary injunction applicable only to the November 2016 election.\n\n# Education\n\nOhio's system of public education is outlined in Article VI of the state constitution, and in Title XXXIII of the Ohio Revised Code. Substantively, Ohio's system is similar to those found in other states. At the state level, the Ohio Department of Education governs primary and secondary educational institutions. At the municipal level, there are approximately 700 school districts statewide. The Ohio Board of Regents coordinates and assists with Ohio's institutions of higher education.\n\n# Libraries\n\nOhio is home to some of the nation's highest-ranked public libraries. Major metropolitan public library systems include the Cleveland Public Library, the Cuyahoga County Public Library, the Cincinnati and Hamilton County Public Library, and the Columbus Metropolitan Library. The Ohio Public Library Information Network provides Ohio residents with internet access to their 251 public libraries. It also provides Ohioans with free home access to high-quality, subscription research databases.\n\n# Transportation\n\nMany major east–west transportation corridors go through Ohio. One of those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century as \"Main Market Route 3,\" was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic Lincoln Highway, which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco. In Ohio, the Lincoln Highway linked many towns and cities together, including Canton, Mansfield, Wooster, Lima, and Van Wert. The Lincoln Highway's arrival in Ohio was a major influence on the state's development.\n\n## Roads\n\nMany major east–west transportation corridors go through Ohio. One of those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century as \"Main Market Route 3,\" was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic Lincoln Highway, which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco.\n\n## Trails\n\nOhio has a highly developed network of signed state bicycle routes. Many of them follow rail trails, with conversion ongoing. The Ohio to Erie Trail (route 1) connects Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland. U.S. Bicycle Route 50 traverses Ohio from Steubenville to the Indiana state line outside Richmond.\n\n## Rail\n\nOhio has an extensive rail network, though today most lines carry only freight traffic. Three Class I freight railroads operate in Ohio: CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Canadian National Railway. Many local freight carriers also exist in the state.\n\n## Transit\n\nMass transit exists in many forms in Ohio cities, primarily through bus systems. The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) operates the RTA Rapid Transit system, which consists of one heavy rail line, three light rail lines, and three bus rapid transit lines. Cincinnati is served by the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) bus network as well as a 3.6-mile (5.8 km) streetcar line, the Cincinnati Bell Connector. Other major transit agencies in Ohio include the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) serving Columbus and the Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority (GDRTA) serving Dayton.\n\n## Air Travel\n\nOhio has four international airports, four commercial, and two military. The four international include Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, John Glenn Columbus International Airport, Dayton International Airport, and Rickenbacker International Airport (one of two military airfields). The other military airfield is Wright Patterson Air Force Base, which is one of the largest Air Force bases in the United States. Other major airports are in Toledo and Akron. Cincinnati's main airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, is in Hebron, Kentucky, and therefore is not included in Ohio airport lists.\n\n## Waterways\n\nOhio has a network of waterways, including the Ohio River, Lake Erie, and numerous smaller lakes and rivers.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ohio\" following this

governor David Tod recruited 5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service [64] From July 13 to 26, 1863, towns along the Ohio River were attacked and ransacked in Morgan's Raid, starting in Harrison in the west and culminating in the Battle of Salineville near West Point in the far east While this raid was overall insignificant to the Confederacy, it aroused fear among people in Ohio and Indiana as it was the furthest advancement of troops from the South in the war [65] Almost 35,000 Ohioans died in the conflict, and 30,000 were physically wounded [66] By the end of the Civil War, the Union's top three generals—Ulysses S Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan—were all from Ohio [67]\n\n\n20th century\nThe state legislature officially adopted the flag of Ohio on May 9,

members in 2022 [83]\n\n\nGeography\nOhio's location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion Because it links the Northeast to the Midwest, much cargo and business traffic passes through its borders along its well-developed highways Ohio has the nation's 10th-largest highway network and is within a one-day drive of 50% of North America's population and 70% of North America's

voters from its rolls In April 2016, a lawsuit was filed, challenging this policy on the grounds that it violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 [259] and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 [260] In June, the federal district court ruled for the plaintiffs and entered a preliminary injunction applicable only to the November 2016 election The preliminary injunction was upheld in September by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit Had it not been upheld, thousands of voters would have been purged from the rolls just a few weeks before the election [259] [261]\n\n\nEducation\nOhio's system of public education is outlined in Article VI of the state constitution, and in Title XXXIII of the Ohio Revised Code Substantively, Ohio's system is similar to those found in other states At the State level, the Ohio Department of Education governs primary and secondary educational institutions At the municipal level, there are approximately 700 school districts statewide The Ohio Board of Regents coordinates and assists with Ohio's institutions of higher education.\n\n\nLibraries\nOhio is home to some of the nation's highest-ranked public libraries [268] Major metropolitan public library systems include the Cleveland Public Library, the Cuyahoga County Public Library, the Cincinnati and Hamilton County Public Library, and the Columbus Metropolitan Library The Ohio Public Library Information Network provides Ohio residents with internet access to their 251 public libraries It also provides Ohioans with free home access to high-quality, subscription research databases.\n\n\nTransportation\nMany major east–west transportation corridors go through Ohio One of those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century as \"Main Market Route 3\", was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic Lincoln Highway which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco In Ohio, the Lincoln Highway linked many towns and cities together, including Canton, Mansfield, Wooster, Lima, and Van Wert The Lincoln Highway's arrival in Ohio was a major influence on the state's development Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1926, the Lincoln Highway through Ohio became U.S Route 30.\n\n\nRoads\nMany major east–west transportation corridors go through Ohio One of those pioneer

network of signed state bicycle routes Many of them follow rail trails, with conversion ongoing The Ohio to Erie Trail (route 1) connects Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland U.S Bicycle Route 50 traverses Ohio from Steubenville to the Indiana state line outside Richmond [270]\n\n\nRail\nOhio has an extensive rail network, though today most lines carry only freight traffic Three Class I freight railroads operate in Ohio: CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Canadian National Railway Many local freight carriers also exist in the state.\n\n\nTransit\nMass transit exists in many forms in Ohio cities, primarily through bus systems The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) operates the RTA Rapid Transit system, which consists of one heavy rail line, three light rail lines, and three bus rapid transit lines Cincinnati is served by the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) bus network as well as a 3.6-mile (5.8 km) streetcar line, the Cincinnati Bell Connector Other major transit agencies in Ohio include the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) serving Columbus and the Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority (GDRTA) serving Dayton.\n\n\nAir travel\nOhio has four international airports, four commercial, and two military The four international include Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, John Glenn Columbus International Airport, Dayton International Airport, and Rickenbacker International Airport (one of two military airfields) The other military airfield is Wright Patterson Air Force Base which is one of the largest Air Force bases in the United States Other major airports are in Toledo and Akron Cincinnati's main airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, is in Hebron, Kentucky, and therefore is not included in Ohio airport lists.\n\n\nWaterways\n40°N 83°W﻿ / ﻿40°N 83°W﻿ / 40; -83﻿ (State of Ohio)\n\n\nSee also\n40°N 83°W﻿ / ﻿40°N 83°W﻿ / 40; -83﻿ (State of

{"title": "Crocus_City_Hall_attack", "content": "\nBackground\nRussia has been subject to major terrorist attacks starting from a series of explosions that hit Moscow apartment blocks in 1999, followed by the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002, the Beslan school siege in 2004 and the Domodedovo International Airport bombing in 2011 [31] [32] There have been at least a half-dozen attacks in or near Moscow by Muslim terrorists, most of them Chechen militants, over the past 25 years [33]\n\n\nPrior warnings from other countries\nOn 7 March, the United States Embassy in Moscow warned that \"extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts\" and advised US citizens to \"avoid large gatherings over the next 48 hours,\" [39] [40] [41] [42] to avoid crowds, to stay updated by monitoring local media, and to maintain awareness of surroundings [39] Canada and the United Kingdom also issued similar warnings to their citizens in Russia [43] That day, the US also privately warned Russian officials of the danger of an impending attack from IS–KP from intelligence gathered earlier in March, under the US intelligence community's \"duty to warn\" requirement, [44] [36] specifically mentioning the Crocus City Hall venue [45] US officials later stated to The New York Times that the attack was related to the prior US warning, [41] and also said that the intelligence reports that the warning was based on had been shared with Russian officials before the attack [31] In contrast, the Russian ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said that in regards to the attacks \"no concrete information, nothing was passed to us\", [44] while the head of the FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, said that the US warning was \"of a general nature\" [46]\n\n\nVenue\nCrocus City Hall was built in 2009 as a concert venue with a capacity of 6,200 people and is one of the largest concert venues in the Moscow area [17] It is a seven-story building which has an area of about 38,000 m2 [49] It is part of a larger block of shopping centers, restaurants, and other attractions called Crocus City, [50] which was built by Azerbaijani billionaire and property developer Aras Agalarov [51] and was also the venue of the Miss Universe 2013 pageant and the Top Hit Music Awards in 2013 and 2019 [52]\n\n\nAttack\nOn 22 March 2024 the Russian band Picnic was scheduled to play a sold-out show at Crocus City Hall [54] [55] At around 20:00 MSK (UTC+3), [56] before the band began their performance, masked gunmen in combat fatigues opened fire on the crowd using AK–style assault rifles [31] [57] An IS–KP report also claimed that the assailants had pistols and knives [2] Because the show was about to begin, some believed the initial sound of gunshots was part of the act [58] At the time of the attack, children and teenagers were also in the building for a ballroom dancing competition [59] The venue's security guards were unarmed, and it is believed that some of them were killed in the attack [60] A part-time cloakroom assistant, 15-year-old Islam Khalilov, reportedly helped save more than a hundred concert-goers by showing them an exit through the venue's office space [61] He was assisted by three of his co-workers, 14-year-old Artyom Donskov, Nikita Ivanov and another [62]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe attack left at least 145 dead [5] including a number who subsequently died of their wounds, [87] and some 551 more injured, [7] some critically [19] [88] [57] [89] [90] Aside from gunshot wounds, some of the deaths were caused by smoke inhalation [91] According to the Russian Children's Rights Commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, six children were killed and seven others were injured in the attack Eight children also lost their parents [92] The oldest fatality was a woman in her 70s Most of the victims were from the northwestern edge of Moscow, including Krasnogorsk and Khimki [91] Three citizens of Belarus, [84] [82] two from Kyrgyzstan, [83] and one each from Moldova, [86] Armenia [93] and Azerbaijan [94] were among those killed.\n\n\nInvestigation\nAs of 27 April, 12 people have been detained, including the four suspected assailants in a white car, who were captured [101] on the 376-kilometre (234 mi) mark of the M3 highway leading to the Ukrainian border (140 kilometres  [87 mi] away), near the village of Khatsun  [ru] in Bryansk Oblast, [102] and about 340 kilometres (211 mi) southwest of Moscow, on the evening of 22 March [103] [104] [35] Russia coordinated with Belarusian security forces to prevent the suspects from crossing the Belarus–Russia border [105] [106] The Investigative Committee of Russia launched a criminal terrorist probe into the attack [107] Officials later said that the attackers were not Russian citizens [108]\n\n\nSuspects\nThe FSB announced that twelve people [29] were arrested in connection with the attacks, with eight of them appearing in court as of 26 March [153] Nine people were arrested in the town of Vahdat, Tajikistan in connection with the attacks [154] [155] The FSB announced the arrest of four people in Dagestan, who were suspected of providing the gunmen with the weapons used [156] [157] On 1 April, the FSB released an interrogation video where one of the suspects reportedly confessed to transferring weapons from Makhachkala to Mytishchi [158]\n\n\nAlleged gunmen\nFour Tajik citizens have been accused of carrying out the massacre: [159]\n\n\nSuspected co-conspirators\nIslamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack shortly after in a statement released via Telegram by the IS-affiliated Amaq News Agency, [22] [177] stating that the attackers \"retreated to their bases safely\" [178] IS did not specify which one of its branches was responsible but all the information points to Islamic State – Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), which is the regional branch of the Islamic State that is active in South-Central Asia, primarily Afghanistan, as being responsible, most likely with involvement from the Islamic State branches in Turkey and possibly the Caucasus [179] [180] US officials said they had intelligence indicating that IS–KP had been planning an attack on Moscow [36]\n\n\nResponsibility for the attack\nIslamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack shortly after in a statement released via Telegram by the

[36]\n\n\nAftermath\nDespite a police cordon, passers-by laid tributes outside Crocus City Hall following the attack, [184] while advertising billboards in Moscow displayed memorial posters showing a candle and the message Skorbim (\"We mourn\") [76] [185] [186] Heavy equipment began clearing debris and structures at the scene on 24 March [187] Makeshift memorials for the victims of the attack were also erected in cities across Russia [188] On 25 March, three shopping malls belonging to Aras Agalarov's Crocus International company, the company that ran the Crocus City Hall, were closed indefinitely [181]\n\n\nAnti-immigrant sentiment\nRussia has a large number of Central Asian migrant workers, including those from Tajikistan They are often employed in menial jobs with no security, but wages are better in Russia than their homeland Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, there have been frequent raids on living quarters and hostels, deportations of undocumented migrants, and fears over conscription to the Russian army The precarious position of Tajik migrants increased after the Crocus City Hall attack [205] Following the attack, the central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan warned against unnecessary travel to Russia from its citizens [115]\n\n\nResponses\nPutin and the FSB suggested that Ukraine was involved in the attack, without offering evidence [182] Putin said the terrorists tried to flee into Ukraine and that \"the Ukrainian side\" had \"opened a window\" for them to cross the border [216] Russia and Ukraine have been at war since 2014 and Russia has been undertaking a full-scale invasion of the country since 2022 Nikolay Patrushev, the secretary of the Security Council of Russia, claimed that Ukraine was behind the attack [217] Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB, said that \"radical Islamists\" prepared the attack with help from Ukrainian and Western \"special services\" [218] Maria Zakharova of the Russian foreign ministry accused the US of using Islamic State as a \"bogeyman\" to cover for Ukraine [216] Following the arrest of a suspected \"financier\" of the attack, the Investigative Committee of Russia said on 28 March that it had recovered data suggesting that the attackers received \"significant amounts of money and cryptocurrency from Ukraine\" [219] On 5 April, it also announced that it had found images of Ukrainian flags and a Ukrainian postage stamp from a phone belonging to one of the suspects [220] Latvia-based Russian news outlet Meduza reported that state media in Russia were instructed by the Russian government to highlight possible \"traces\" of Ukrainian involvement [221] A day after the attack, pro-Kremlin Russian television station NTV broadcast an audio deepfake purporting to confirm Ukrainian involvement [222] On 26 March, Putin's claims were seemingly contradicted by his close ally, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, who said the attackers had first tried to cross into Belarus [223]\n\n\nRussian allegations of Ukrainian and Western involvement\nPutin and the FSB suggested that Ukraine was involved in the attack, without offering evidence [182] Putin said

[223]\n\n\nDomestic\nPutin wished those injured in the attack a speedy recovery and praised the doctors involved in treating the victims [238] Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said that \"the perpetrators will be punished They do not deserve mercy.\" [182] A spokesperson for Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church said that he was \"praying for peace for the souls of the dead\" [239] [240]\n\n\nInternational\nThe United States embassy in Moscow expressed \"sincere condolences to the Russian people\", [252] while advising its citizens to avoid the area as they were \"severely limited\" in their ability to assist US citizens due to the limits placed on US personnel's ability to travel within Russia [252] [9] [253] The British embassy in Moscow condemned the attack and expressed its \"sincere condolences to the relatives and loved ones of those hurt and killed in today's events.\" [63] The Spanish embassy in Moscow also condemned the attack, expressing its thoughts and solidarity with those affected, and flew flags at half mast [254]\n\n\nFrench terror alert level\nOn 24 March, the French government raised its security alert to its highest level, with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal citing the Crocus City Hall attack as one of the reasons [270] Following a phone call between French defence minister Sébastien Lecornu and his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu on 3 April in which the latter suggested French collusion with Ukraine in the attack, president Emmanuel Macron dismissed the accusations as \"ridiculous\" and \"indeed baroque and threatening.\" [271]\n\n\nCrackdown on IS in Turkey\nSince the attack, the Turkish government has expanded its crackdown on IS by detaining over 180 people suspected to have links to the group This includes 147 detained on 26 March in raids across 30 provinces [272] [273]\n\n\nReciprocal visa requirements\nOn 8 April, Turkey announced that it had cancelled a 2018 bilateral visa-exemption agreement with Tajikistan citing \"security concerns\" and that Tajik citizens will need to obtain a visa before traveling to Turkey [237] [275] The visa requirements went into effect on 20 April [276]\n\n\nSee

but wages are better in Russia than their homeland Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, there have been frequent raids on living quarters and hostels, deportations of undocumented migrants, and fears over conscription to the Russian army The precarious position of Tajik migrants increased after the Crocus City Hall attack [205] Following the attack, the central Asian country of

Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB, said that \"radical Islamists\" prepared the attack with help from Ukrainian and Western \"special services\" [218] Maria Zakharova of the Russian foreign ministry accused the US of using Islamic State as a \"bogeyman\" to cover for Ukraine [216] Following the arrest of a suspected \"financier\" of the attack, the Investigative Committee of Russia said

images of Ukrainian flags and a Ukrainian postage stamp from a phone belonging to one of the suspects [220] Latvia-based Russian news outlet Meduza reported that state media in Russia were instructed by the Russian government to highlight possible \"traces\" of Ukrainian involvement [221] A day after the attack, pro-Kremlin Russian television station NTV broadcast an audio deepfake purporting to confirm Ukrainian involvement [222] On 26 March, Putin's claims were seemingly contradicted by his close ally, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, who said the attackers had first tried to cross into Belarus [223]\n\n\nRussian allegations of Ukrainian and Western involvement\nPutin and the FSB suggested that Ukraine was involved in the attack, without offering evidence [182] Putin said

perpetrators will be punished They do not deserve mercy.\" [182] A spokesperson for Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church said that he was \"praying for peace for the souls of the dead\" [239] [240]\n\n\nInternational\nThe United States embassy in Moscow expressed \"sincere condolences to the Russian people\", [252] while advising its citizens to avoid the area as they were \"severely

expressed its \"sincere condolences to the relatives and loved ones of those hurt and killed in today's events.\" [63] The Spanish embassy in Moscow also condemned the attack, expressing its thoughts

Minister Gabriel Attal citing the Crocus City Hall attack as one of the reasons [270] Following a phone call between French defence minister Sébastien Lecornu and his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu on 3 April in which the latter suggested French collusion with Ukraine in the attack, president Emmanuel Macron dismissed the accusations as \"ridiculous\" and \"indeed baroque and threatening.\" [271]\n\n\nCrackdown on IS in Turkey\nSince the attack, the Turkish government has expanded its crackdown on IS by detaining over 180 people suspected to have links to the group This includes 147 detained on 26 March in raids across 30 provinces [272] [273]\n\n\nReciprocal visa requirements\nOn 8 April, Turkey announced that it had cancelled a 2018 bilateral visa-exemption agreement with

advocacy, GLAM engagement, and Wikimania [32] [33] [34] While many of these things are also done by individual contributors or less formal groups, they are not referred to as affiliates.\n\n\nWikimania\nWikimania is an annual global conference for Wikimedians and Wikipedians, started in 2005 The first Wikimania was held in Frankfurt, Germany, in 2005 Wikimania is organized by a committee supported usually by the local national chapter, with support from local institutions (such as a library or university) and usually from the Wikimedia Foundation Wikimania has been held in cities such as Buenos Aires, [38] Cambridge, [39] Haifa, [40] Hong Kong, [41] Taipei, London, [42] Mexico City, [43] Esino Lario, Italy, [44] Montreal, Cape Town, and Stockholm The 2020 conference scheduled to take place in Bangkok was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with those of 2021 and 2022, which were held online as a series of virtual, interactive presentations The in-person conference returned in 2023 when it was held in Singapore, at which UNESCO joined as a partner organization [45]\n\n\nTechnology\nThe Wikimedia Foundation maintains the hardware that runs its projects in its own servers It also maintains the MediaWiki platform and many other software libraries that run its projects [46]\n\n\nHardware\nWikipedia employed a single server until 2004, when the server setup was expanded into a distributed multitier architecture [47] Server downtime in 2003 led to the first fundraising drive By December 2009, Wikimedia ran on co-located servers, with 300 servers in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam [48] In 2008, it also switched from multiple different Linux operating system vendors to Ubuntu Linux [49] [50] In 2019, it switched to Debian [51]\n\n\nSoftware\nThe operation of Wikimedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open-source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MariaDB database since 2013; [65] previously the MySQL database was used [66] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects.\n\n\nCorporate identity\nThe Wikimedia Foundation was founded in 2003 by Jimmy Wales so that there would be an independent charitable entity responsible for company domains and trademarks, and so that Wikipedia and its sister projects could be funded through non-profit means in the future [73] [74] The name \"Wikimedia\", a compound of wiki and media, was coined by American author Sheldon Rampton in a post to the English Wikipedia mailing list in March 2003, [75] three months after Wiktionary became the second wiki-based project hosted on the original server The Foundation's mission is collection and distribution of educational knowledge under free licenses or public domain and promised to keep these projects free of charge [9]\n\n\nFinances\nThe Wikimedia Foundation mainly finances itself through donations from the public, collected through email campaigns and annual fundraising banners placed on Wikipedia, as well as grants from various tech companies and philanthropic organizations [11] [80] Campaigns for the Wikimedia Endowment have included emails asking donors to leave Wikimedia money in their will [81]\n\n\nWikimedia Endowment\nIn January 2016, the Foundation announced the creation of an endowment to safeguard its future [101] The Wikimedia Endowment was established as a donor-advised fund at the Tides Foundation, with a stated goal to raise $100 million in the next 10 years [102] Craig Newmark was one of the initial donors, giving $1 million [103] Peter Baldwin and Lisbet Rausing, of Arcadia Fund, donated $5 million in 2017 [104]\n\n\nFinancial development\nThe Foundation summarizes its assets in the \"Statements of Activities\" in its audited reports These do not include funds in the Wikimedia Endowment, however expenses from the 2015–16 financial year onward include payments to the Wikimedia Endowment [115]\n\n\nExpenses (2004–2020)\nA plurality of Wikimedia Foundation expenses are salaries and wages, followed by community and affiliate grants, contributions to the endowment, and other professional operating expenses and services [116] [79]\n\n\nGrants\nThe Wikimedia Foundation has received a steady stream of grants from other foundations throughout its history.\nIn 2008, the Foundation received a $40,000 grant from the Open Society Institute to create a printable version of Wikipedia [117] It also received a $262,000 grant from the Stanton Foundation to purchase hardware, [118] a $500,000 unrestricted grant from Vinod and Neeru Khosla, [119] who later that year joined the Foundation advisory board, [120] and $177,376 from the historians Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin (Arcadia Fund), among others [118] In March 2008, the Foundation announced what was then its largest donation yet: a three-year, $3 million grant from the Sloan Foundation [121]\n\n\nBoard of trustees\nThe Foundation's board of trustees supervises the activities of the Foundation The founding board had three members, to which two community-elected trustees were added Starting in 2008 it was composed of ten members:\n\n\nStaff\nIn 2004, the Foundation appointed Tim Starling as developer liaison to help improve the MediaWiki software, Daniel Mayer as chief financial officer (finance, budgeting, and coordination of fund drives), and Erik Möller as content partnership coordinator In May 2005, the Foundation announced seven more official appointments [162]\n\n\nHistory\nIn 2004, the Foundation appointed Tim Starling as developer liaison to help improve the MediaWiki software, Daniel Mayer as chief financial officer (finance, budgeting, and coordination of fund drives), and Erik Möller as content partnership coordinator In May 2005, the Foundation announced seven more official appointments [162]\n\n\nPresent department structure\nAs of October 23, 2023, [update] there were over 700 people working at the Foundation [179] Maryana Iskander was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022 [180]\n\n\nDisputes\nA number of disputes have resulted in litigation [182] [183] [184] [185] while others have not [186] Attorney Matt Zimmerman has said, \"Without strong liability protection, it would be difficult for Wikipedia to continue to provide a platform for user-created encyclopedia content.\" [187]\n\n\nExcessive spending and fundraising\nIn 2014, Jimmy Wales was confronted with allegations that WMF had \"a miserable cost/benefit ratio and for years now has spent millions on software development without producing anything that actually works\" He acknowledged that he had \"been frustrated as well about the endless controversies about the rollout of inadequate software not developed with sufficient community consultation and without proper incremental rollout to catch show-stopping bugs\" [206]\n\n\nKnowledge Engine project\nKnowledge Engine was a search engine project initiated in 2015 by WMF to locate and display verifiable and trustworthy information on the Internet [213] The KE's goal was to be less reliant on traditional search engines It was funded with a $250,000 grant from the Knight Foundation [214] Some perceived the project as a scandal, mainly because it was conceived in secrecy, and the project proposal was even a surprise to some staff, in contrast with a general culture of transparency in the organization and on the projects Some of the information available to the community was received through leaked documents published by The Signpost in 2016 [215] [213] Following this dispute, Executive Director Lila Tretikov resigned [216] [217] [218]\n\n\nSocial justice campaigns\nIn 2022, in a recent \"personal appeal\" displayed in an advertising banner on Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, one of the founders, emphasized that \"Wikipedia is not for sale.\" This statement highlights the non-profit nature of the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), a non-profit organization based in California that owns intellectual property assets, such as the Wikipedia name and branding However, the WMF does not own or control the global communities that maintain the site [219]\n\n\nReferences\n37°47′21″N 122°24′12″W﻿ / ﻿37.78917°N 122.40333°W﻿ / 37.78917; -122.40333\n\n\nExternal links\n37°47′21″N 122°24′12″W﻿ / ﻿37.78917°N 122.40333°W﻿ / 37.78917;

High School [6] He majored in management at the Georgia Institute of Technology [6] He later said that he considers Bret Hart his wrestling idol [26]\n\n\nFootball career\nAnoaʻi played football for three years at Pensacola Catholic High School and one year at Escambia High School; in his senior year, he was named Defensive Player of the Year by the Pensacola News Journal [6] While at the Georgia Institute of Technology, he was a member of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team along with Calvin Johnson, who later became a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame [6] Anoaʻi was a three-year starter beginning in his sophomore year and was also one of the team captains as a senior [6] He earned first-team All-Atlantic

2012, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view event alongside Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins, assaulting Ryback during the triple threat main event for the WWE Championship, allowing CM Punk to retain the title, thus establishing themselves as villains [44] The trio declared themselves The Shield and vowed to rally against \"injustice\", while also denying working for Punk, even though they would routinely emerge from the crowd to attack Punk's adversaries, including Ryback and WWE Tag Team Champions Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane) [45] [46] [47] [48] This led to a six-man tag team

SmackDown brand. He is one of the most popular and successful wrestlers in the world, known for his charisma, athleticism, and compelling in-ring performances.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nLeati Joseph Anoaʻi, better known as Roman Reigns, was born on May 25, 1985, in Pensacola, Florida. His father, Sika Anoa'i, was a professional wrestler of Samoan descent, while his mother, Patricia Hooker, was of Sicilian ancestry. Anoa'i's family has a long history in professional wrestling, with his cousins including The Tonga Kid, Rikishi, Umaga, and Yokozuna. He attended Pensacola Catholic High School before transferring to Escambia High School.\n\n**Football Career**\n\nAnoaʻi played football for three years at Pensacola Catholic High School and one year at Escambia High School. In his senior year, he was named Defensive Player of the Year by the Pensacola News Journal. While at the Georgia Institute of Technology, he was a member of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team, alongside Calvin Johnson, who later became a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Anoa'i was a three-year starter, beginning in his sophomore year, and was also one of the team captains as a senior. He earned first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) honors in 2006 after recording 40 tackles, two recovered fumbles, and 4.5 sacks.\n\n**Professional Wrestling Career**\n\n#### **World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)**\n\nAnoa'i began his professional wrestling career in 2008, working for various independent promotions.

The group made their debut on November 18, 2012, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view event, attacking Ryback during the triple threat main event for the WWE Championship. The Shield declared themselves as villains, vowing to rally against \"injustice\" and denying working for CM Punk, even though they would routinely emerge from the crowd to attack Punk's adversaries. This led to a six-man tag team Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, in which Reigns, Ambrose, and Rollins defeated Team Hell No and Ryback in their debut match.\n\n#### **Controversial Rise to Main Event Status (2014-2015)**\n\nFollowing Rollins's betrayal, Reigns would briefly continue teaming with Ambrose before embarking on a singles run.

The app can be used to communicate with individuals or teams, both internally and externally.\n\n**Features**\n\nMicrosoft Teams offers a range of features that enable teams to communicate and collaborate more effectively. Some of the key features include:\n\n* **Chats**: Teams allows users to communicate in two-way persistent chats with one or multiple participants. Participants can message using text, emojis, stickers, and GIFs, as well as sharing links and files.\n* **Channels**: Channels allow team members to communicate without the use of email or group SMS (texting). Users can reply to posts with text, images, GIFs, and image macros. Direct messages send private messages to designated users rather than the entire channel.\n* **Group conversations**: Ad-hoc groups can be created to share instant messaging, audio calls (VoIP), and video calls inside the client software.\n* **Telephone replacement**: A feature on one of the higher cost licensing tiers allows connectivity to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone system. This allows users to use Teams as if it were a telephone, making and receiving calls over the PSTN, including the ability to host \"conference calls\" with multiple participants.\n* **Meetings**: Meetings can be scheduled with multiple participants able to share audio, video, chat, and presented content with all participants. Multiple users can connect via a meeting link.\n* **Automated minutes**: Automated minutes are possible using the recording and transcript features.\n* **Teams Live Events**: Teams Live Events replaces Skype Meeting Broadcast for users to broadcast to 10,000 participants on Teams, Yammer, or Microsoft Stream.\n* **Breakout Rooms**: Breakout rooms split a meeting into small groups. This is often utilized for collaboration during trainings or any environment where having all participants speak at once could be disruptive or unfeasible.\n* **Front Row**: Front Row adjusts the layout of the viewer's screen, placing the speaker or content in the center of the gallery with other meeting participant's video feeds reduced in size and located below the speaker.\n\n**Education**\n\nMicrosoft Teams for Education allows teachers to distribute, provide feedback, and grade student assignments turned in via Teams using the Assignments tab through Office 365 for Education subscribers. Quizzes can also be assigned to students through an integration with Office Forms.\n\n**Protocols**\n\nMicrosoft Teams is based on a number of Microsoft-specific protocols. Video conferences are realized over the protocol MNP24, known from the Skype consumer version. VoIP and video conference clients based on SIP and H.323 need special gateways to connect to Microsoft Teams servers. With the help of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), clients behind Network address translation routers and restrictive firewalls are also able to connect, if peer-to-peer is not possible.\n\n**Integrations**\n\nMicrosoft Teams has integrations through Microsoft AppSource, its integration marketplace. In 2020, Microsoft partnered with KUDO, a cloud-based solution with language interpretation, to allow integrated language meeting controls. In June 2022, an update was released using AI to improve call audio through the elimination of background feedback loops and canceling non-vocal audio.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nIn July 2023, the EU Commission opened an anti-trust investigation into the possibility that Microsoft unfairly used its office suite market power to increase sales of Teams and hurt its competitors. The next month, Microsoft announced it would make Teams an optional part of the Microsoft 365 bundle, and provide more information to software developers to allow Teams users to transition to competing software with their Teams data. In early 2023, Microsoft updated Teams to open links from chats in Microsoft Edge instead of the default browser set by the user. In June 2024, the EU Commission charged Microsoft with antitrust violations for bundling Microsoft Teams into the Office suite.\n\n**See also**\n\nMicrosoft Office 365, Microsoft 365, Slack, Skype.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**External links**\n\nMicrosoft Teams official website.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Microsoft_Teams\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nOn August 29, 2007, Microsoft purchased Parlano and its persistent group chat product, MindAlign [14] On March 4, 2016, Microsoft had considered bidding $8 billion for Slack, but Bill Gates was against the purchase, stating that the firm should instead focus on improving Skype for Business [15] Lu Qi, EVP of Applications and Services, was leading the push to purchase Slack [15] After the departure of Lu later that year, Microsoft announced Teams to the public as a direct competitor to Slack at an event in New York on November 2, 2016, [11] [16] and was launched worldwide on March 14, 2017 [17] [18] It is currently led by Microsoft corporate vice president Brian MacDonald [19]\n\n\nUsage\nMicrosoft Teams is a web-based desktop app, originally developed on top of the Electron framework which combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js JavaScript platform [48] Version 2.0 was rebuilt using the Evergreen version of Microsoft Edge WebView2 in place of Electron [9]\n\n\nUnderlying software\nMicrosoft Teams is a web-based desktop app, originally developed on top of the Electron framework which combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js JavaScript platform [48] Version 2.0 was rebuilt using the Evergreen version of Microsoft Edge WebView2 in place of Electron [9]\n\n\nFeatures\nTeams allows users to communicate in two-way persistent chats with one or multiple participants Participants can message using text, emojis, stickers and gifs, as well as sharing links and files In August 2022, the chat feature was updated for \"chat with yourself\";

{"title": "Jupiter's_Legacy_(comic)", "content": "\nPublication history\nJupiter's Legacy was initially to be titled Jupiter's Children [9] [15] [16] The original idea for the series was conceived when writer Mark Millar read the memoirs of Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher, in which she shared that despite her fame as Princess Leia, she did not feel anything special because of her two even more famous parents It led Millar to observe that \"even Princess Leia feels the sense of not living up to her parents.\" [17] Thus Millar described the story as evoking the generational conflict of Hamlet, and would explore, as one of its themes, the question of \"what it would be like to grow up as Wonder Woman and Superman's kids\", in particular the difficulty in living up to the legacy of previous generations Millar created the series as a \"big, weighty tome that happens to be about superheroes\", which examines the connection of superheroes to the American ideal Millar was also influenced by sources such as Star Wars, King Kong, origin stories from the Golden Age of Comics, and by Roman mythology This is seen in the name Jupiter, which Millar chose because it evoked a grand, mythological scope to the story, which he hoped to contemporize by blending those themes with modern imagery, and a Wagnerian story structure Other themes and motifs explored include the dawn of man, the origin of Earth, and contemporary concerns about the current economy and the end of capitalism Millar explains: [4]\n\n\nSynopses\nSheldon Sampson / The Utopian – A patriotic American who lost

generation\nChloe Sampson – Sheldon and Grace's daughter [3] [7] She inherited superhuman abilities from her parents, but as a woman in her twenties at the beginning of the series, [47] has not followed in their footsteps as a superhero, preferring instead a socialite's life of nightclubs and drugs She believes she is frequently in conflict with her mother because her mother is irritated by Chloe's non-confrontational nature, and instead engages in charity work, thinking it will please her, but Chloe's brother Brandon believes she cynically participates in indiscriminate endorsement work for personal gain and to curry favor with their mother Chloe also laments how perfect her parents are, regretting that she will never be as \"cool\" as her father or as attractive as her mother She prefers dating \"disappointing bad boys\" rather than superheroes because the latter would be akin to \"dating her father\", and according to her therapist, she does not maintain proper relationships because she always compares her relationships to her parents' idealized marriage [27] According to Millar, Chloe and Brandon are in their twenties, and live completely in the shadow of their parents He created them because, as he explains, \"I like the idea of exploring what it would be like to grow up as the kids of the two most famous and beloved people on the planet This side of things has a very Postcards from the Edge feel and there's enormous tension between them all.\" [47] As the series progresses, she and her boyfriend, Hutch, become fugitives after the other superheroes, led by Walter and Brandon, murder her parents, [29] and the two hide in Australia while raising their gifted son, Jason [18] She possesses a sonic scream with which she can shatter durable materials, [34] or

appears in issue 4 He has superhuman abilities, but at the direction of his parents, who are in hiding from the other superheroes by living inconspicuous lives in Australia, Jason conceals his gifts by deliberately doing poorly at both school work and sports Unbeknownst to his parents, however, Jason secretly engages in superheroic activity [18] Because of his frequent absences, his schoolmates and parents deduce the truth of his double life in issue 5 [20] He is capable of flight and superhuman speed [18] He can survive for indefinite periods in outer space He even has the ability to verbally communicate while on the Moon through some as-yet unspecified means [20] He also has a genius intellect, [18] with which he is able to build a meta-scanner that can scan the Earth's population for people like him who have specially augmented genes [20] By the time of Requiem, which is set three decades after volume 2, Jason has taken on his maternal grandfather's superhero identity, the Utopian [51] He has married Neutrino (Gabriella) and the two have a daughter together, Maisie.\n\n\nCritical reception\nThe series holds an average critics' rating of 8.2 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup [5]\n\n\nMain series\nThe series holds an average critics' rating of 8.2 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup [5]\n\n\nIssue 1\nIssue 1 holds an 8.2 rating at Comic Book Roundup [5] Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources gave issue #1 four out of five stars, calling it \"Millar's strongest new comic in a long time.\" McElhatton praised out Millar's script, in particular the quiet tone of the 1932 sequence that piqued his interest, and the fight scene between Walter and Blackstar, which McElhatton felt represented a unique approach to superhero clichés McElhatton lauded Frank Quitely's artwork as \"elegant\", in particular his ability to draw the reader's eye toward the center of panels Compliments were also given to Peter Doherty's colors, which were used well to differentiate between the 1932 and modern scenes [1] Melissa Grey of IGN gave the issue of 9.2 score of \"Amazing\", lauding the world in the story \"immediately familiar and uniquely original\", and saying that Millar's examination of \"the shades of gray\" between black and white regarding heroes struck a chord unlike any of his previous attempts at the theme of incorporating superhumans into the real world Grey said of Quitely's artwork that it \"blends a powerful realism with a sense of the fantastical in a way that is seamlessly integrated with Millar's narrative.\" [54] David Brothers of ComicsAlliance thought the issue \"fell short\" While Brothers complimented some aspects of the writing and art, such as the 1932 scenes and the psychic paintings, he felt that Millar's characterization and his take on realistic superheroes in the modern scenes was unoriginal, his dialogue in the modern scenes unnatural, that Quitely's characters were not well-designed, and that the book lacked the spectacle by Millar that would've given a better opportunity for Quitely and Doherty to have effected better work [3] Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool gave the issue a positive review for the depiction of the socioeconomic and political conflicts, Quitely and Doherty's art, and the soap opera plot of the characters' power plays [55] Patrick Hume of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, calling it an effective, absorbing and smart superhero story that pushes the boundaries of the genre Hume noted the presence of Millar's trademark black humor and \"full-throttle action\", as well as \"a maturity and thematic sophistication that has not been apparent in other recent work\" Though Hume thought some of Millar's delivery of the issue's ideas was at times heavy-handed, he was impressed enough by the book to continue with it Hume also thought that Quitely's more defined, gritty, more intimate art was better-suited to the story than the large-scale, widescreen action he effected on The Authority Doherty's subdued color palette was also noted by Hume [2]\n\n\nIssue 2\nIssue 2 holds an 8.1 rating at Comic Book Roundup [5] James Hunt of Comic Book Resources gave issue #2 four out of five stars, finding it easily engaging, better-paced than the first issue, and enjoying the social satire with which Millar employed parallels with ancient Greek and Roman tragedies, and creating a well-rounded and well-realized cast, which was not typified by what Hunt regarded as Millar's usual cynicism Hunt also called Quitely's art \"beautiful\", calling him \"one of the definitive superhero artists of all time\", and seeing elements in his artwork that were similar to Quitely's work on All-Star Superman However, Hunt thought the coloring was \"muddy and muted\", and obscured the details [28] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the issue a 7.3 score of \"Good\", saying that he wished Millar would explore genres other than superheroes in his Millarworld work, and was disappointed that Jupiter's Legacy was not the book to break that trend that it had initially seemed to him While Schedeen thought the issue's material was interesting, and thought Millar, Quitely and Doherty's handling of it was dramatically successful, the superhero deconstruction did not feel fresh or original to him Schedeen also did not feel the plot twist at the end of the issue was justified in light of the established characters [6] Zach Wilkerson of Multiversity Comics gave the issue a score of 7.2, calling it \"A beautiful book hindered by a ho-hum plot.\" Wilkerson felt that while the \"breathtaking\" artwork justified buying the book, it lacked any noteworthy or original concepts, and criticized the unlikeable Brandon and Chloe Nonetheless, Wilkerson felt that the book harbored enough depth and potential to be a modern classic, provided that the creative team properly follow-through on the foundations they laid [7]\n\n\nIssue 3\nIssue 3 holds an 8.8 rating at Comic Book Roundup [5] Wilkerson gave issue #3 a score of 9.2, saying that while the series appears derivative of Watchmen and The Authority, its resonant themes of familial conflict and politics set it apart from those stories, and reassessed his review of issue #2, as \"unfair\", saying that the third issue's developments, in which the story moves forward in earnest, validates the content of the first two issues Wilkerson called the story \"gut-wrenching\" and Quitely's depiction of Sheldon and Grace's death was \"visceral\" [9] Anghus Houvouras of Flickering Myth felt that the plot was too obvious, the generational conflict was uninspired, and felt like Millar was recycling ideas he had used in his previous work Houvouras also felt that there were no characters in the story with which a reader could connect or invest in, as the cast was composed of \"stereotypes and caricatures\" Houvouras also felt the issue was paced far too fast Houvouras said that Quitely's depiction of Utopian's defeat was \"beautifully staged\", but that the lack of information revealed about him made his death \"ultimately meaningless\" and \"at best morbidly hilarious and at worst sub-par paper thin plotting.\" [8]\n\n\nIssue 4\nIssue 4 holds a 7.9 rating at Comic Book Roundup [5] The highest score given to the issue was Chris Bennett and Ross Sweeney of Big Comic Page, who rated it a 10 Bennett lauded Millar's ability to create a plausible fictional world, and stated that while dystopias are an overused trope in fiction, Millar's use of it was an enjoyable one Bennett also complimented Quitely's \"precise line work and the overall expressiveness\" in his art Bennett criticized, however, the wait between this and the previous issue [56] Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources, who gave the issue an 8.0, took notice of the sense of wonderment exhibited by the 1930s \"pulp-ish, old school feel\" of the bedtime story that Chloe tells Jason, and the contrast with the cold, fascist reality of the present surveillance state in which the family lives, which Millar and Quitely effected with the full-page illustration of the monitoring station hovering over their neighborhood [57] Soup Owens-Fowler of Geeked-Out Nation gave the issue a 5.0, saying that after months of waiting for the issue to be published, the issue was a disappointment, despite the depiction Chloe and Hutch teaching Jason to hide his abilities, which provided some enjoyable moments Owens-Fowler though there should have been more establishing shots of the current dystopia, and also thought that Frank Quitely did not provide his best work despite having months to work on it, calling the art \"serviceable\", but not as impressive as in past comics, the mysterious alien college being a notable exception [58]\n\n\nIssue 5\nIssue 5 holds an 8.8 rating at Comic Book Roundup [59] Erik Gonzalez of All-Comic.com, who rated the book a 10, lauded the issue for the character introspection, the family drama exhibited in the lunar scene with Chloe and Jason, and the manner in which Frank Quitely rendered the character's facial expressions, and the realism of the superhuman battle He also praised Pete Doherty's colors [60] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the issue a score of 8.2, criticizing the story as lacking anything compelling enough to justify the 10-month wait for the issue Nonetheless, Schedeen thought Barnabas Wolfe was a \"fun new villain\", and praised Quitely's use of posture and body language [61] All the other reviews counted at Comic Book Roundup gave the issue a score of 8.0 or higher except for Lido Giovacchini of Front Towards Gamer, who gave it a 6.5, the issue's lowest score at the Roundup Though overall Lido enjoyed the earlier issues' themes of youth disenfranchisement, he felt that the storyline's shift towards the dystopia created by Walter and Brandon's totalitarian regime made it less interesting and unique than it earlier had been Lido stated that while Millar is skilled at story structure and plotting, he did not think that he is equally proficient at imbuing his stories with depth and meaning, calling the latter \"misinformed\" and \"sophomoric\" [62]\n\n\nVolume 2\nThe second volume of Jupiter's Legacy (June 2016 – July 2017) holds a critics' rating of 8.6 at Comic Book Roundup [63]\n\n\nPrequels and sequels\nThe spinoff Jupiter's Circle holds a rating of 7.3 out of 10 at Comic Book Roundup [64] The second volume has an average rating of 8.3, based on 22 reviews of its six issues [65] The 2021 sequel series Jupiter's Legacy: Requiem also yielded positive critical reception, with the debut issue garnering a 7.9 from 6 reviews, [11] and the subsequent two issues both garnering ratings of 9.6, each from a single reviewer [5]\n\n\nCollected editions\nFollowing the acquisition of MiIllarworld by Netflix and subsequent production of the Jupiter's Legacy TV series, the original collections of the comic series and sequels were republished under the title of Jupiter's Legacy.\n\n\nIn other media\nOn April 8, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Mark Millar and Lorenzo di Bonaventura had partnered to develop the comic into feature films Lorenzo explained his attraction to the property thus: \"What appealed to me was the emotional weight of the family dynamic in Shakespearean fashion.\" [12] In June 2016, Brian and Mark Gunn were announced as the screenwriters that would adapt the property to the big screen [66] Director James Gunn would later convince Millar that the story worked best as a television series instead of a film, on account of the story's density, which needed a more long-form medium to be told [67]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nInline

The series was first published in 2013 by Image Comics and has since become a critically acclaimed and commercially successful title.\n\nIntroduction\n----------\n\nJupiter's Legacy is a story that explores the complexities of family dynamics, power struggles, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond human control. The series follows the story of the Sampson family, a family of superheroes who have been protecting the world for generations. However, as the series progresses, it becomes clear that the family's legacy is not as simple as it seems, and that the true nature of their powers and their relationships with one another are far more complex and nuanced.\n\nPublication History\n-----------------\n\nJupiter's Legacy was initially to be titled Jupiter's Children, but Mark Millar eventually settled on the current title. The story was conceived when Millar read the memoirs of Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher, in which she shared that despite her fame as Princess Leia, she did not feel anything special because of her two even more famous parents.

English about \"Jupiter's_Legacy_(comic)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPublication history\nJupiter's Legacy was initially to be titled Jupiter's Children [9] [15] [16] The original idea for the series was conceived when writer Mark Millar read the memoirs of Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher, in which she shared that despite her fame as Princess Leia, she did not feel anything special because of her two even more famous parents It led Millar to observe that \"even Princess Leia feels the sense of not living up to her parents.\" [17] Thus Millar described the story as evoking the generational conflict of Hamlet, and would explore, as one of its themes, the question of \"what it would be like to grow up as Wonder Woman and Superman's kids\", in particular the difficulty in living up to the legacy of previous generations Millar created the series as a \"big, weighty tome that happens to be about superheroes\", which examines the connection of superheroes to the American ideal Millar was also influenced by sources such as Star Wars, King Kong, origin stories from the Golden Age of Comics, and by Roman mythology This is seen in the name Jupiter, which Millar chose because it evoked a grand, mythological scope to the story, which he hoped to contemporize by blending those themes with modern imagery, and a Wagnerian story structure Other themes and motifs explored include the dawn of man, the origin of Earth, and contemporary concerns about the current economy and the end of capitalism Millar explains: [4]\n\n\nSynopses\nSheldon Sampson / The Utopian –

series, [47] has not followed in their footsteps as a superhero, preferring instead a socialite's life of nightclubs and drugs She believes she is frequently in conflict with her mother because her mother is irritated by Chloe's non-confrontational nature, and instead engages in charity work, thinking it will please her, but Chloe's brother Brandon believes she cynically participates in indiscriminate endorsement work for personal gain and to curry favor with their mother Chloe also laments how perfect her parents are, regretting that she will never be as \"cool\" as her father or as attractive as her mother She prefers dating \"disappointing bad boys\" rather than superheroes because the latter would be akin to \"dating her father\", and according to her therapist, she does not maintain proper relationships because she always compares her relationships to her parents' idealized marriage [27] According to Millar, Chloe and Brandon are in their twenties, and live completely in the shadow of their parents He created them because, as he explains, \"I like the idea of exploring what it would be like to grow up as the kids of the two most famous and beloved people on the planet This side of things has a very Postcards from the Edge feel and there's enormous tension between them all.\" [47] As the series progresses, she and her boyfriend, Hutch, become fugitives after the other superheroes, led by Walter and Brandon, murder her parents, [29] and the two hide in Australia while raising their gifted son, Jason [18] She possesses a sonic scream with which she can shatter

Australia, Jason conceals his gifts by deliberately doing poorly at both school work and sports Unbeknownst to his parents, however, Jason secretly engages in superheroic activity [18] Because of his frequent absences, his schoolmates and parents deduce the truth of his double life in issue 5 [20] He is capable of flight and superhuman speed [18] He can survive for indefinite periods in outer space He even has the ability to verbally communicate while on the Moon through some as-yet unspecified means [20] He also has a genius intellect, [18] with which he is able to build a meta-scanner that can scan the Earth's population for people like him who have specially augmented genes [20] By the time of Requiem, which is set three decades after volume 2, Jason has taken on his maternal grandfather's superhero identity, the Utopian [51] He has married Neutrino (Gabriella) and the two have a daughter together, Maisie.\n\n\nCritical reception\nThe series holds an average critics' rating of 8.2 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup [5]\n\n\nMain series\nThe series holds an average critics' rating of 8.2 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup [5]\n\n\nIssue 1\nIssue 1 holds an 8.2 rating at Comic Book Roundup [5] Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources gave issue #1 four out of five stars, calling it \"Millar's strongest new comic in a long time.\" McElhatton praised out Millar's script, in particular the quiet tone of the 1932 sequence that piqued his interest, and the fight scene between Walter and Blackstar, which McElhatton felt represented a unique approach to superhero clichés McElhatton lauded Frank Quitely's artwork as \"elegant\", in particular his ability to draw the reader's eye toward the center of panels Compliments were also given to Peter Doherty's colors, which were used well to differentiate between the 1932 and modern scenes [1] Melissa Grey of IGN gave the issue of 9.2 score of \"Amazing\", lauding the world in the story \"immediately familiar and uniquely original\", and saying that Millar's examination of \"the shades of gray\" between black and white regarding heroes struck a chord unlike any of his previous attempts at the theme of incorporating superhumans into the real world Grey said of Quitely's artwork that it \"blends a powerful realism with a sense of the fantastical in a way that is seamlessly integrated with Millar's narrative.\" [54] David Brothers of ComicsAlliance thought the issue \"fell short\" While Brothers complimented some aspects of the writing and art, such as the 1932 scenes and the psychic paintings, he felt that Millar's characterization and his take on realistic superheroes in the modern scenes was unoriginal, his dialogue in the modern scenes unnatural, that Quitely's characters were not well-designed, and that the book lacked the spectacle by Millar that would've given a better opportunity for Quitely and Doherty to have effected better work [3] Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool gave the issue a positive review for the depiction of the socioeconomic and political conflicts, Quitely and Doherty's art, and the soap opera plot of the characters' power plays [55] Patrick Hume of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, calling it an effective, absorbing and smart superhero story that pushes the boundaries of the genre Hume noted the presence of Millar's trademark black humor and \"full-throttle action\", as well as \"a maturity and thematic sophistication that has not been apparent in other recent work\" Though Hume thought some of Millar's delivery of the issue's ideas was at times heavy-handed, he was impressed enough by the book to continue with it Hume also thought that Quitely's more defined, gritty, more intimate art was better-suited to the story than the large-scale, widescreen action he effected on The Authority Doherty's subdued color palette was also noted by Hume [2]\n\n\nIssue 2\nIssue 2 holds an 8.1 rating at Comic Book Roundup [5] James Hunt of Comic Book Resources gave issue #2 four out of five stars, finding it easily engaging, better-paced than the first issue, and enjoying the social satire with which Millar employed parallels with ancient Greek and Roman tragedies, and creating a well-rounded and well-realized cast, which was not typified by what Hunt regarded as Millar's usual cynicism Hunt also called Quitely's art \"beautiful\", calling him \"one of the definitive superhero artists of all time\", and seeing elements in his artwork that were similar to Quitely's work on All-Star Superman However, Hunt thought the coloring was \"muddy and muted\", and obscured the details [28] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the issue a 7.3 score of \"Good\", saying that he wished Millar would explore genres other than superheroes in his Millarworld work, and was disappointed that Jupiter's Legacy was not the book to break that trend that it had initially seemed to him While Schedeen thought the issue's material was interesting, and thought Millar, Quitely and Doherty's handling of it was dramatically successful, the superhero deconstruction did not feel fresh or original to him Schedeen also did not feel the plot twist at the end of the issue was justified in light of the established characters [6] Zach Wilkerson of Multiversity Comics gave the issue a score of 7.2, calling it \"A beautiful book hindered by a ho-hum plot.\" Wilkerson felt that while the \"breathtaking\" artwork justified buying the book, it lacked any noteworthy or original concepts, and criticized the unlikeable Brandon and Chloe Nonetheless, Wilkerson felt that the book harbored enough depth and potential to be a modern classic, provided that the creative team properly follow-through on the foundations they laid [7]\n\n\nIssue 3\nIssue 3 holds an 8.8 rating at Comic Book Roundup [5] Wilkerson gave issue #3 a score of 9.2, saying that while the series appears derivative of Watchmen and The Authority, its resonant themes of familial conflict and politics set it apart from those stories, and reassessed his review of issue #2, as \"unfair\", saying that the third issue's developments, in which the story moves forward in earnest, validates the content of the first two issues Wilkerson called the story \"gut-wrenching\" and Quitely's depiction of Sheldon and Grace's death was \"visceral\" [9] Anghus Houvouras of Flickering Myth felt that the plot was too obvious, the generational conflict was uninspired, and felt like Millar was recycling ideas he had used in his previous work Houvouras also felt that there were no characters in the story with which a reader could connect or invest in, as the cast was composed of \"stereotypes and caricatures\" Houvouras also felt the issue was paced far too fast Houvouras said that Quitely's depiction of Utopian's defeat was \"beautifully staged\", but that the lack of information revealed about him made his death \"ultimately meaningless\" and \"at best morbidly hilarious and at worst sub-par paper thin plotting.\" [8]\n\n\nIssue 4\nIssue 4 holds a 7.9 rating at Comic Book Roundup [5] The highest score given to the issue was Chris Bennett and Ross Sweeney of Big Comic Page, who rated it a 10 Bennett lauded Millar's ability to create a plausible fictional world, and stated that while dystopias are an overused trope in fiction, Millar's use of it was an enjoyable one Bennett also complimented Quitely's \"precise line work and the overall expressiveness\" in his art Bennett criticized, however, the wait between this and the previous issue [56] Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources, who gave the issue an 8.0, took notice of the sense of wonderment exhibited by the 1930s \"pulp-ish, old school feel\" of the bedtime story that Chloe tells Jason, and the contrast with the cold, fascist reality of the present surveillance state in which the family lives, which Millar and Quitely effected with the full-page illustration of the monitoring station hovering over their neighborhood [57] Soup Owens-Fowler of Geeked-Out Nation gave the issue a 5.0, saying that after months of waiting for the issue to be published, the issue was a disappointment, despite the depiction Chloe and Hutch teaching Jason to hide his abilities, which provided some enjoyable moments Owens-Fowler though there should have been more establishing shots of the current dystopia, and also thought that Frank Quitely did not provide his best work despite having months to work on it, calling the art \"serviceable\", but not as impressive as in past comics, the mysterious alien college being a notable exception [58]\n\n\nIssue 5\nIssue 5 holds an 8.8 rating at Comic Book Roundup [59] Erik Gonzalez of All-Comic.com, who rated the book a 10, lauded the issue for the character introspection, the family drama exhibited in the lunar scene with Chloe and Jason, and the manner in which Frank Quitely rendered the character's facial expressions, and the realism of the superhuman battle He also praised Pete Doherty's colors [60] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the issue a score of 8.2, criticizing the story as lacking anything compelling enough to justify the 10-month wait for the issue Nonetheless, Schedeen thought Barnabas Wolfe was a \"fun new villain\", and praised Quitely's use of posture and body language [61] All the other reviews counted at Comic Book Roundup gave the issue a score of 8.0 or higher except for Lido Giovacchini of Front Towards Gamer, who gave it a 6.5, the issue's lowest score at the Roundup Though overall Lido enjoyed the earlier issues' themes of youth disenfranchisement, he felt that the storyline's shift towards the dystopia created by Walter and Brandon's totalitarian regime made it less interesting and unique than it earlier had been Lido stated that while Millar is skilled at story structure and plotting, he did not think that he is equally proficient at imbuing his stories with depth and meaning, calling the latter \"misinformed\" and \"sophomoric\" [62]\n\n\nVolume 2\nThe second volume of Jupiter's Legacy (June 2016 – July 2017) holds a critics' rating of 8.6 at Comic Book Roundup [63]\n\n\nPrequels and sequels\nThe spinoff Jupiter's Circle holds a rating of 7.3 out of 10 at Comic Book Roundup [64] The second volume has an average rating of 8.3, based on 22 reviews of its six issues [65] The 2021 sequel series Jupiter's Legacy: Requiem also yielded positive critical reception, with the debut issue garnering a 7.9 from 6 reviews, [11] and the subsequent two issues both garnering ratings of 9.6, each from a single reviewer [5]\n\n\nCollected editions\nFollowing the acquisition of MiIllarworld by Netflix and subsequent production of the Jupiter's Legacy TV series, the original collections of the comic series and sequels were republished under the title of Jupiter's Legacy.\n\n\nIn other media\nOn April 8, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Mark Millar and Lorenzo di Bonaventura had partnered to develop the comic into feature films Lorenzo explained his attraction to the property thus: \"What appealed to me was the emotional weight of the family dynamic in Shakespearean fashion.\" [12] In June 2016, Brian and Mark Gunn were announced as the screenwriters that would adapt the property to the big screen [66] Director James Gunn would later convince Millar that the story worked best as a television series instead of a film, on account of the story's density, which needed a more long-form medium to be told [67]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nInline citations\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

According to the film, Jews have culturally appropriated the religious heritage of Black people and then covered it up. This claim has been thoroughly debunked by historians and scholars, who point out that the film's interpretation of Jewish history and culture is fundamentally flawed.\n\nOne of the key arguments made in the film is that the Jewish people have a long history of taking on the identities and cultural practices of other groups. However, this argument is based on a misreading of historical evidence and ignores the complex and nuanced nature of cultural exchange and borrowing. In reality, Jewish communities have often maintained their unique cultural identities while also engaging in cultural exchange and borrowing with other groups.\n\nControversy\n------------\n\nIn October 2022, Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball player Kyrie Irving tweeted a link to Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America. The tweet sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, with many critics accusing Irving of promoting hate speech and anti-Semitism. In two subsequent news conferences, Irving refused to apologize and declined to disavow the film's anti-Semitic content.\n\nIrving's refusal to apologize and condemn anti-Semitism sparked a heated debate about the limits of free speech and the responsibility of public figures to promote hate speech. Many critics argued that Irving's actions were not only hurtful but also damaging to the reputation of the NBA and the broader sports community.\n\nOn November 3, 2022, the Nets suspended Irving without pay, citing his failure to meet the team's expectations for conduct and behavior. After his suspension, Irving tweeted an apology via Instagram, stating that he had \"no intention of offending anyone\" and promising to donate $500,000 to unspecified causes and organizations that combat hate.\n\nHowever, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) rejected Irving's donation, with the group's CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, stating that Irving had \"failed at almost every step along the way to do the right thing, apologize and condemn anti-Semitism.\" Greenblatt added that the ADL was \"optimistic\" that Irving would learn from his mistakes and take a more active role in combating hate speech.\n\nOn November 20, 2022, Irving's suspension was lifted after he issued a full apology, condemned hate speech and anti-Semitism, and stated that he had meant no harm. While some critics argued that Irving's apology was insufficient and that he had not done enough to make amends, others saw his apology as a necessary step towards healing and reconciliation.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Anti-Semitism\n* Hate speech\n* Free speech\n* Cultural appropriation\n* Jewish history and culture\n* Black Hebrew Israelites\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references.)\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* [Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America] (official website)\n* [Kyrie Irving's apology] (Instagram)\n* [Irving's suspension] (NBA)\n* [ADL statement] (Anti-Defamation League)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hebrews_to_Negroes:_Wake_Up_Black_America\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe film was homemade by amateur filmmaker Ronald Dalton Jr on a reported budget of $8,000 [5] [1]\n\n\nSynopsis\nThe film promotes false Black Hebrew Israelite beliefs that some people of color, including Black Americans, \"are the true descendants of the biblical Israelites.\" One of the ideas shared in the film is that the Jews of today are not actual Jews and they culturally appropriated the religious heritage of Black people and then covered it up [8] This claim has been debunked [9] [10]\n\n\nControversy\nIn October 2022, Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball player Kyrie Irving tweeted a link to Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America [6]  In two news conferences after he made the tweet, Irving refused to apologize and declined to disavow antisemitism or the Hebrews to Negroes film [14] [15] On November 3, 2022, the Nets suspended Irving without pay After his suspension, Irving tweeted an apology via Instagram, and agreed to donate \"$500,000 to unspecified causes and organizations that combat hate\" [14] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) rejected Irving's $500,000 donation; the group's CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, said Irving had \"failed at almost every step along the way to do the right thing, apologize and condemn antisemitism\" and added: \"We were optimistic but after watching the debacle of a press conference, it's clear that Kyrie feels no accountability for his actions.\" [16] Irving's suspension was lifted on November 20, 2022, after he issued an apology, condemned hate speech and antisemitism, and said he had meant no harm [15]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Cyrus has since established herself as a successful musician, actress, and philanthropist.\n\n**Early Life and Career Beginnings**\n\nDestiny Hope Cyrus was born to Leticia \"Tish\" Jean Cyrus (née Finley) and country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. She was born with supraventricular tachycardia, a condition causing an abnormal resting heart rate. Her birth name, Destiny Hope, expressed her parents' belief that she would accomplish great things. Her parents nicknamed her \"Smiley\", which they later shortened to \"Miley\", because she often smiled as an infant. In 2008, she legally changed her name to Miley Ray Cyrus; her middle name honors her grandfather, Democratic politician Ronald Ray Cyrus, who was from Kentucky. Cyrus's godmother is singer-songwriter Dolly Parton.\n\n**Career**\n\nCyrus auditioned for the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana when she was thirteen years old. She auditioned for the role of the title character's best friend, but was called to audition for the lead role instead seeing her comical performance. Despite being denied the part at first because she was \"too small and too young\" for the role, she was later cast as the lead because of her singing and goofy acting abilities. The series premiered in March 2006 to the largest audience for a Disney Channel program and quickly ranked among the highest-rated series on basic cable. The success of the series led to Cyrus being labeled a \"teen idol.\" She toured with the Cheetah Girls as Hannah Montana in September 2006 and performed songs from the show's first season. Walt Disney Records released a soundtrack credited to Cyrus's character in October of that year. The record was both a critical and commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 chart in the United States and selling over three million copies worldwide.\n\n**2006–2009: Hannah Montana and Early Musical Releases**\n\nCyrus auditioned for the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana when she was thirteen years old.

As she does, she'll want to change her image, and that change will be met with adversity.\" [349] The release of her 2010 album Can't Be Tamed saw Cyrus officially attempting to distance herself from her teenage persona by releasing controversial music videos for her songs \"Can't Be Tamed\" and \"Who Owns My Heart\" [350] [351] Her behavior throughout 2013 and 2014 sparked a substantial amount of controversy, although her godmother Dolly Parton said \"...the girl can write The girl can sing The girl is smart And she doesn't have to be so drastic But I will respect her choices I did it my way, so why can't she do it her way?\" [352] Liel Leibovitz at Tablet noted in 2013: \"Talking to the website Hunger, the singer argued that those adults who deem her gyrations too sultry and her music too saccharine were simply too ancient—and Jewish—to get it 'With magazines, with movies, it's always weird when things are targeted for young people yet they're driven by people that are like 40 years too old', Cyrus opined And one group stands out in  [her] mind as deserving of most of the blame: 'It can't be like this 70-year-old Jewish man that doesn’t leave his desk all day, telling me what the clubs want to hear.'\" [353]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCyrus currently resides in Hidden Hills, California, and also owns a $5.8 million home in her hometown of Franklin [366] [367] While Cyrus was raised as a Christian and identified herself as such during her childhood and early adult life, [24] she includes references to Tibetan Buddhism in the lyrics to her song \"Milky Milky Milk\" (2015) [368] and is also influenced by Hindu beliefs [369]\n\n\nSexuality and gender\nCyrus came out to her mother at age 14 [372] [373] [374] and has said: \"I never want to label myself!

cried when eating her first fish after her vegan diet, saying \"I cried for the fish .. it really hurts me to eat fish.\" [384] Her decision to quit being vegan sparked backlash from people in the

stated \"I love weed\" and \"I just love getting stoned.\" [390] In a 2017 interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Cyrus said that she had quit cannabis before the press tour for her

shaping the 2000s teen pop culture, earning her the honorific nickname of \"Teen Queen\" [493] [494] [495] Bickford stated Hannah Montana adopted a business model of combining celebrity acts with film, television, and popular music for a pre-adolescent audience He called the series \"genre-defining\" [496] and likened this model to 1990s teen pop artists such as Britney Spears and NSYNC, who were also marketed to children [496] Morgan Genevieve Blue of Feminist Media Studies stated the series' primary female characters, Miley and her alter ego Hannah, are positioned as post-feminist

{"title": "Third-degree_murder", "content": "\nJurisdiction\nIf murder is committed within the borders of a state, that state has jurisdiction, and in a similar way, if the crime is committed in the District of Columbia, the D.C Superior Court (the equivalent of a state court in the District) retains jurisdiction, though in some cases involving U.S government property or personnel, the federal courts may have exclusive jurisdiction [11]\n\n\nDegrees\nThe first division of the general crime of murder into graded subcategories was enacted into the law of Pennsylvania in 1794 [14] This enactment is often explained in terms of a desire to narrow the scope of application of capital punishment in that state and in the other states which subsequently graded murder into \"first\" and \"second\" degrees The English common law, which had been received into the laws of the U.S states, at the time applied capital punishment to a large number of crimes; as a result, states statutorily divided the crime of murder into first and second degrees, and began applying capital punishment only to criminals convicted of first-degree murder [15] By 1953, three states—namely Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin—had further created the subcategory of third-degree murder [16]\n\n\nFetal killing\nUnder the common law, an assault on a pregnant woman resulting in a stillbirth was not considered murder [83] Remedies were limited to criminal penalties for the assault on the mother and tort action for loss of the anticipated economic services of the lost child, for emotional pain and suffering, or both With the widespread adoption of laws protecting unborn life, the assailant could be charged with that offense, but the penalty was often only a fine and a few days in jail A number of states have passed \"fetal homicide\" laws, making killing of a fetus murder; the laws differ about the stage of development at which the fetus is protected.\n\n\nSentencing guidelines\nIn Arizona, a person is charged with murder when the offender knowingly and intentionally causes the death of a person or unborn child First-degree murder must be premeditated In the state of Arizona, if one is found guilty of first-degree murder, there is the possibility of receiving the death penalty, life without the possibility of parole, or life [86]\n\n\nArizona\nIn Arizona, a person is charged with murder when the offender knowingly and intentionally causes the death of a person or unborn child First-degree murder must be premeditated In the state of Arizona, if one is found guilty of first-degree murder, there is the possibility of receiving the death penalty, life without the possibility of parole, or life [86]\n\n\nCalifornia\nIf a person is convicted of first-degree murder in California, that person may face a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, or the death penalty At minimum, they will face a sentence of 25 years-to-life in prison, and thus must serve at least 25 years before being eligible for parole [87]\nThe punishment for the crime of first-degree murder in California is upgraded to a minimum of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or execution of the murderer in at least the following circumstances: [88]\n\n\nFlorida\nIn Florida, a person is guilty of first-degree murder when it is perpetrated from a premeditated design to result in the death of a human being A person is also guilty of first-degree murder if they cause the death of any individual during the commission of a predicate felony regardless of actual intent or premeditation This is called felony murder This offense is categorized as capital offense, so if convicted, the offender could possibly receive the death penalty [93] [94] [16]\n\n\nHawaii\nThe state of Hawaii has no death penalty If they are found guilty, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole [98] [99] A first-degree murder involves one or more specific elements:\n\n\nLouisiana\nLouisiana states homicide in the third-degree is manslaughter There are other specific guidelines, for example, the killing of a police officer or firefighter is an automatic first-degree charge, and intent to kill more than one person is automatically a first-degree charge In the state of Louisiana convicted murderers can receive life imprisonment or the death penalty [100]\n\n\nMichigan\nIn Michigan, a person is found guilty of first-degree murder when murder is perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, or any other willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing In Michigan, the top penalty the perpetrator can receive is life imprisonment [101]\n\n\nMinnesota\nMinnesota law originally defined third-degree murder solely as depraved-heart murder (\"without intent to effect the death of any person, caus [ing] the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life\") [102] [103] In 1987, an additional drug-related provision (\"without intent to cause death, proximately caus [ing] the death of a human being by, directly or indirectly, unlawfully selling, giving away, bartering, delivering, exchanging, distributing, or administering a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II\") was added to the definition of third-degree murder [102] [104] Up until the early 2000s, prosecutions under that provision were rare, but they began to rise in the 2010s Some reports linked this increase in prosecutions to the opioid epidemic in the United States [105]\n\n\nNevada\nIn Nevada, first-degree murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, either expressed or implied If a serial killer is found guilty with aggravating circumstances, for example killing someone with torture or killing a stranger with no apparent motive, then the state can seek the death penalty or a sentence of life without parole [108]\n\n\nNew Mexico\nNew Mexico once divided the crime of murder into five different degrees A legal scholar writing in 1953 (by which time this level of division had been abolished) described this as the \"all-time 'record'\" for dividing murder into degrees [16] The definitions were as follows:\n\n\nPennsylvania\nPennsylvania law defines third-degree murder as a murder which is neither a first-degree murder (\"criminal homicide .. committed by an intentional killing\") nor a second-degree murder (\"committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony\") For purposes of that section, \"felony\" is specifically defined as \"engaging in or being an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing, or attempting to commit robbery, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary or kidnapping.\" [111] There are also parallel crimes of first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree murder of an unborn child [112] There does not exist the crime of third-degree murder of a law-enforcement officer, only first-degree and second-degree Third-degree murder and third-degree murder of an unborn child are punishable by a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment [113]\n\n\nWisconsin\nSoon after statehood, Wisconsin enacted statutes repealing the common law crime of murder, creating the statutory crime of murder and dividing the statutory crime of murder into three degrees, with the third encompassing felony murder For example, the 1849 Revised Statutes defined third-degree murder as a killing \"perpetrated without any design to effect the death, by a person engaged in the commission of any felony\" [119] The 1956 Criminal Code in § 940.03 defined

criminal homicide offense that involves the unintentional killing of another person. The definition of third-degree murder varies from state to state, but it generally involves a killing that is not premeditated or intentional.\n\nJurisdiction\n\nThe jurisdiction for third-degree murder cases typically falls under the state where the crime was committed. If a murder is committed within the borders of a state, that state has jurisdiction, and in a similar way, if the crime is committed in the District of Columbia, the D.C Superior Court retains jurisdiction. However, in some cases involving U.S government property or personnel, the federal courts may have exclusive jurisdiction.\n\nDegrees\n\nThe concept of graded murder, with first, second, and third degrees, was first introduced in Pennsylvania in 1794. This act was intended to narrow the scope of capital punishment in the state and in other states that subsequently adopted the graded murder system. The English common law, which was received into the laws of U.S states at the time, applied capital punishment to a wide range of crimes. As a result, states statutorily divided the crime of murder into first and second degrees, and began applying capital punishment only to criminals convicted of first-degree murder.\n\nBy 1953, three states—Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin—had further created the subcategory of third-degree murder. The concept of graded murder was later adopted by other states, with each state defining its own degrees and penalties.\n\nFetal killing\n\nUnder the common law, an assault on a pregnant woman resulting in a stillbirth was not considered murder. Remedies were limited to criminal penalties for the assault on the mother and tort action for loss of the anticipated economic services of the lost child, for emotional pain and suffering, or both. With the widespread adoption of laws protecting unborn life, the assailant could be charged with that offense, but the penalty was often only a fine and a few days in jail.\n\nA number of states have passed \"fetal homicide\" laws, making killing of a fetus murder. These laws differ about the stage of development at which the fetus is protected. For example, some states consider a fetus to be protected from the moment of conception, while others consider it to be protected only after a certain point in fetal development.\n\nSentencing guidelines\n\nIn Arizona, a person is charged with murder when the offender knowingly and intentionally causes the death of a person or unborn child. First-degree murder must be premeditated. If a person is found guilty of first-degree murder, there is the possibility of receiving the death penalty, life without the possibility of parole, or life.\n\nIn California, if a person is convicted of first-degree murder, that person may face a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, or the death penalty. At minimum, they will face a sentence of 25 years-to-life in prison, and thus must serve at least 25 years before being eligible for parole.\n\nIn Florida, a person is guilty of first-degree murder when it is perpetrated from a premeditated design to result in the death of a human being. A person is also guilty of first-degree murder if they cause the death of any individual during the commission of a predicate felony, regardless of actual intent or premeditation. This is called felony murder.\n\nIn Hawaii, the state has no death penalty. If a person is found guilty of first-degree murder, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n\nIn Louisiana, homicide in the third-degree is manslaughter. There are other specific guidelines, for example, the killing of a police officer or firefighter is an automatic first-degree charge, and intent to kill more than one person is automatically a first-degree charge.\n\nIn Michigan, a person is found guilty of first-degree murder when murder is perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, or any other willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing. The top penalty the perpetrator can receive is life imprisonment.\n\nIn Minnesota, the law originally defined third-degree murder solely as depraved-heart murder. In 1987, an additional drug-related provision was added to the definition of third-degree murder. Up until the early 2000s, prosecutions under that provision were rare, but they began to rise in the 2010s. Some reports linked this increase in prosecutions to the opioid epidemic in the United States.\n\nIn Nevada, first-degree murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, either expressed or implied. If a serial killer is found guilty with aggravating circumstances, for example, killing someone with torture or killing a stranger with no apparent motive, then the state can seek the death penalty or a sentence of life without parole.\n\nIn New Mexico, the state once divided the crime of murder into five different degrees. A legal scholar writing in 1953 described this as the \"all-time 'record'\" for dividing murder into degrees. The definitions were as follows:\n\n*   First-degree murder: murder committed with premeditation and deliberation.\n*   Second-degree murder: murder committed without premeditation and deliberation.\n*   Third-degree murder: murder committed without malice and with no intent to kill.\n*   Fourth-degree murder: murder committed with malice and intent to kill, but without premeditation.\n*   Fifth-degree murder: murder committed with malice and intent to kill, with premeditation and deliberation.\n\nPennsylvania law defines third-degree murder as a murder which is neither a first-degree murder nor a second-degree murder. For purposes of that section, \"felony\" is specifically defined as \"engaging in or being an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing, or attempting to commit robbery, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary or kidnapping.\"\n\nWisconsin soon after statehood enacted statutes repealing the common law crime of murder, creating the statutory crime of murder and dividing the statutory crime of murder into three degrees, with the third encompassing felony murder. The 1849 Revised Statutes defined third-degree murder as a killing \"perpetrated without any design to effect the death, by a person engaged in the commission of any felony.\" The 1956 Criminal Code in § 940.03 defined third-degree murder as causing the death of another \"in the course of committing or attempting to commit a felony... as a natural and probable consequence of the commission of or attempt to commit the felony,\" and provided that the sentence for the underlying felony could thus be extended by 15 years.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

recapture the Champions League [6]\n\n\nAjax\nOn 6 December 2010, after the resignation of Martin Jol, De Boer was appointed caretaker manager of Ajax until the winter break His first game in charge

during the invasion of the 1980s nor to the Taliban during the civil war of the early 1990s In the war of 1996–2001, Panjshir was a center of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance [36] In these conflicts, Panjshir was under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Massoud who was killed by a suicide bomber in 2001 Soon after, the United States invasion of Afghanistan resulted in the overthrow of the previously dominant, Taliban-led Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the eventual establishment of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan [63] Massoud and his family remained highly respected in Panjshir in the next two decades [21]\n\n\nSaleh and Massoud's announcements\nOn 17 August 2021, Saleh—citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan—declared himself President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there [66] His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi along with the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Dushanbe [66] [27] On 23 August 2021, Massoud made contact with unnamed American lawmakers [67]\n\n\nDisposition of forces\nPrior to the fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into Panjshir Province [68] There, they were joined by Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, including commandos, [68] [69] ex-Mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and other anti-Taliban activists [29] Most of them regrouped at Baghlan Province's Andarab District before moving to Panjshir after making their escape from Kunduz, Badakhshan, Takhar, and Baghlan [63] According to a Russian estimate, the disparate Anti-Taliban forces had approximately 7,000 personnel under arms as of mid August 2021 [70] Other estimates place this number as low as 2,000, though Saleh himself claims 10,000 men under arms [42] By 22 August 2021, Ahmad Massoud claimed to have gathered about 9,000 fighters and at least a \"handful of armoured humvees\" in the valley [40]\n\n\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan and anti-Taliban militias\nPrior to the fall of Kabul, Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored

humvees\" in the valley [40]\n\n\nIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan\nAn estimate by the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy made prior to the fall of Kabul estimated the strength of the Taliban, throughout the whole of Afghanistan, at 60,000 armed cadre supported by up to 200,000 irregulars [74] Due to the rapid capitulation of the Afghan National Army, the Taliban have since acquired substantial materiel of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft [75] The Taliban remain a movement consisting of many different sub-groups whose aims, strategies, beliefs, and loyalties vary [76]\n\n\nTimeline\nAround 17 August 2021, remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the Panjshir Valley at the urging of Massoud, [65] [77] along with local civilians who had responded to his mobilization calls [78] At the time, the Panjshir Valley was—according to one observer—\"under siege on all sides\" but had not come under direct attack [79] On 18 August, the number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anaba in Panjshir [80] [81] By 22 August, Ahmad Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending Panjshir as well as training [40]\n\n\nEmergence of Panjshir resistance and first anti-Taliban revolts\nAround 17 August 2021, remnants of the Afghan National Army began

ceasefire was declared with the Taliban and the resistance entering into talks [55] [107] Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that he was \"80 percent confident of a solution without war in the Panjshir Valley\" [108] On 29 August, Panjshir representatives stated that there were no Taliban fighters trying to enter Panjshir, refuting information from Anaamullah Samangani, who is a member of the Taliban's Cultural Commission [109] On 1 September, it was reported that ceasefire talks failed [110]\n\n\nTaliban offensive and revolts in central Afghanistan\nOn 31 August 2021, Taliban fighters commenced an offensive against the National Resistance Front in the provinces of Baghlan, Panjshir, and Parwan [118] [1] Anti-Taliban sources claimed that the offensive involved al-Qaeda troops, a statement backed by videos in which pro-Taliban fighters were heard speaking non-native or locally uncommon languages such as Arabic [1] Sources reported that the offensive started when Taliban fighters were spotted entering Gulbahar and blocked the main road with a container [118] Taliban forces retook Dih Saleh District in Baghlan, allowing them to directly attack Panjshir An initial Taliban assault through Khawak Pass connecting the Baghlan and central Panjshir Provinces failed [1] [119] NRFA spokesperson Fahim Dashty said that the attack was likely done to test the area's defenses [119] Taliban troops also began to attack southern Panjshir from Gulbahar, resulting in heavy fighting Despite being numerically superior to the defenders, the Taliban failed to break through [1] A refugee interviewed later by Al Jazeera stated that the Taliban had blocked roads out of Panjshir using shipping containers during their offensive, and the shutdown of internet connections and mobile phone services left residents unable to learn what was happening in other places [120]\n\n\nSiege of final Panjshir Valley holdouts and exile activities\nOn 6 September, after heavy fighting resulting in high losses on both sides, the Taliban captured the governor's office in Bazarak, and claimed control of the whole Panjshir Valley [134] The remaining NRF troops had reportedly retreated into the mountains, [135] [136] [58] with the Taliban stating that many had fled the region [137] An NRF official then claimed Massoud was at a safe location, while Saleh escaped to Tajikistan [135] [136] [58] Ali Nazary, head of foreign affairs for the resistance group, said that Ahmed Massoud was still present inside Afghanistan [134] The NRF contested the Taliban's conquest of Panjshir, [138] arguing that resistance fighters were still present in strategic positions in the valley, continuing their fight [139] [137] [140]\n\n\nGuerrilla campaign by the NRF and other groups\nOn 12 November 2021, clashes between republicans and Taliban forces took place at Khoshudara, located in Baghlan Province's Khost wa Fereng District Both sides suffered several losses A local informed The Independent that the NRF still held settlements in Khost wa Fereng [165]\n\n\n2022\nOn 2 January 2022, The Independent reported that in the preceding few days, the Ahmad Khan Samangani Front clashed in the village of Kichi Manghar in the Hazrati Sultan district of Samangan, killing at least two members of the Taliban including a commander, while one of the militia's commanders was killed by the Taliban in the engagement According to the source, a few hours after the end of the clash, Taliban forces attacked the village of Kichi Mungar and killed two of Abdul Halim's relatives who were not associated with the militia There were also reports of fighting between the NRF and the Taliban in the Ishkamish District, Takhar Province, with one Taliban and one NRF member being killed in the village of Elich during the clashes The Taliban has so far refused to comment on the attack [174]\n\n\nRebellion in Balkhab and expanded NRF operations\nOn 6 May 2022, the NRF launched an offensive, reportedly capturing three districts in Panjshir Province The NRF spokesman Ali Nazary stated that the NRF had taken control of the three district's roads, villages, and outposts, after which they besieged the local Taliban offices He also stated that \"Many Taliban fighters have asked for time to surrender The enemy has suffered heavy casualties.\" Taliban officials denied any fighting in the area Local Panjshir residents reported heavy fighting during the night The NRF also stated that the group would continue their presence across 12 provinces, mostly in the north [186] [187] On 9 May, the NRF ambushed a Taliban vehicle in Qala-e-Olang and killed an unknown number of Taliban fighters, which they responded by firing on civilians in Qasan village as retaliation for the ambush [188] Approximately 30 Taliban fighters had been killed in the NRF offensive as of 12 May The Taliban subsequently sent reinforcements from other provinces to bolster their garrisons in Panjshir Fighting was concentrated at Abdullah Khel which the NRF temporarily seized before retreating [189] [190] On 17 May, the first meeting of the Supreme Council of National Resistance took place in Ankara, Turkey with Abdul Rashid Dostum being involved [191]\n\n\n2023\nOn 25 January 2023, NRF forces attacked a Taliban camp in Kapisa, killing three fighters and wounding two with no casualties from the NRF [236]\n\n\n2024\nOn 11 January, the Afghanistan Freedom Front claimed responsibility for an attack on a Taliban intelligence forces' convoy in Kabul's Khairkhana area, killing three Taliban and wounding another two [262] The Taliban convoy was allegedly targeting girls and detaining them in the Panjsad Family neighbourhood, something which the AFF condemned as the AFF pledged to stand up for women's rights in Afghanistan.\n\n\nForeign involvement\nAs of 23 August 2021, there was no public support for the resistance from the international community At the start of the conflict, the US and other potential allies were focused on the concurrent Kabul airlift, which required the Taliban's cooperation Massoud's op-ed in The Washington Post requesting Western support may be evidence of a lack of enthusiasm (for the resistance) in the US government [278]\n\n\nNeutral\nAs of 23 August 2021, there was no public support for the resistance from the international community At the start of

Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, Marine veteran and ex-CIA Special Activities Center operator, argued in a Time editorial that Washington, D.C should provide support in Afghanistan by allowing the CIA to station its officers with counterterrorism responsibilities to secretly assist anti-Taliban resistance groups [280] U.S senator Lindsey Graham and representative Michael Waltz advocated for giving NRF support so that they can hold their ground against the Taliban after they captured Kabul [281]\n\n\nPro-Taliban\nFollowing the death of Fahim Dashti, a journalist with the Afghanistan National Journalists Union and spokesperson for the National Resistance Front, officials from the NRF accused Pakistan of aiding the Taliban and stated that Dashti had died in a drone strike carried out by the Pakistan Air Force [3] The former parliamentary representative of Samangan Province, Zia Arianjad reiterated the claim to the Iranian Aamaj News, stating that PAF was assisting the Taliban in Panjshir with drone strikes using smart bombs [288] [4] According to defense analyst Babak Taghvaee, Pakistan was using CH-4 drones to assist the Taliban in Panjshir [4] Faiz Hameed, the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence, the military intelligence agency of Pakistan, had visited Kabul prior to Dashti's death, [2] to assist the Taliban in reorganising the Afghan military according to a senior Pakistani official [289]\n\n\nAnalysis\nShortly after the fall of Kabul, journalists Carlotta Gall and Adam Nossiter wrote in The New York Times that the international community would be in a bind if they showed some form of support for the resistance because of the airlift operations that were then ongoing [29] Abdul Matin Beyk suggested that other anti-Taliban forces were waiting to see if the Panjshir-based fighters would either resist to the end or keep considering negotiations with Taliban representatives [29] He suggested that their successes could inspire others to do the same [29]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Panjshir Conflict**\n\nThe Panjshir conflict is an ongoing armed conflict in the Panjshir Valley of Afghanistan, which began in August 2021. The conflict involves the National Resistance Front (NRF), a group of anti-Taliban fighters, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, also known as the Taliban. The Panjshir Valley has a long history of resistance against foreign occupation, and the current conflict is a continuation of that tradition.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Panjshir Valley was a key location during the Soviet-Afghan War, as it was a stronghold of the mujahideen resistance. The valley's natural defenses, surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, made it a difficult terrain for the Soviets to conquer. In the 1980s, the Panjshir Valley was the site of many battles between the mujahideen and the Soviet forces.\n\nAfter the Soviet withdrawal, the Panjshir Valley became a center of anti-Taliban resistance during the civil war in the 1990s. The valley was under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Massoud, a prominent anti-Taliban leader who was killed by a suicide bomber in 2001. Massoud's death was a significant blow to the anti-Taliban movement, but his legacy continued to inspire resistance against the Taliban.\n\n**Saleh and Massoud's Announcements**\n\nOn August 17, 2021, Amrullah Saleh, the former Vice President of Afghanistan, declared himself the President of Afghanistan from the Panjshir Valley. Saleh claimed that he was the legitimate president of Afghanistan and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from the valley. His announcement was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud, the leader of the National Resistance Front, and the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Dushanbe.\n\n**Disposition of Forces**\n\nPrior to the fall of Kabul, the Panjshiris began moving military equipment from surrounding areas, including helicopters and armored vehicles, into the Panjshir Province. They were joined by Afghan National Army commanders and soldiers, including commandos, ex-mujahideen who had previously served Ahmad Massoud's late father, and other anti-Taliban activists. The number of personnel under arms was estimated to be around 7,000, although estimates vary widely.\n\n**Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and Anti-Taliban Militias**\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which was established in 2021, has been engaged in a conflict with the Taliban. The conflict has been ongoing since the fall of Kabul, with the Taliban attempting to consolidate their power and the NRF resisting their efforts.\n\n**Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan**\n\nThe Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, also known as the Taliban, has been estimated to have around 60,000 armed cadre and up to 200,000 irregulars. They have acquired substantial materiel of US manufacture, including armored vehicles and combat aircraft. The Taliban remain a movement consisting of many different sub-groups whose aims, strategies, beliefs, and loyalties vary.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe conflict in the Panjshir Valley began in August 2021, when remnants of the Afghan National Army began massing in the valley at the urging of Massoud. The number of admissions for war injuries was increasing at the Emergency Surgical Centre for War Victims in Anaba in the Panjshir Valley. By August 22, Massoud's forces were mostly focused on defending the Panjshir Valley and training.\n\n**Emergence of Panjshir Resistance and First Anti-Taliban Revolts**\n\nThe emergence of the Panjshir resistance and the first anti-Taliban revolts began in August 2021. The NRF, led by Massoud, began to mobilize forces and engage in clashes with the Taliban. The resistance was initially focused on defending the Panjshir Valley, but it soon spread to other parts of the country.\n\n**Ceasefire and Sporadic Clashes**\n\nOn August 26, 2021, a ceasefire was declared between the NRF and the Taliban. However, sporadic clashes continued between the two sides. The NRF accused the Taliban of attempting to breach their defenses, while the Taliban claimed that the NRF was engaging in provocations.\n\n**Taliban Offensive and Revolts in Central Afghanistan**\n\nOn August 31, 2021, the Taliban launched an offensive against the NRF in the provinces of Baghlan, Panjshir, and Parwan. The offensive involved al-Qaeda troops, according to anti-Taliban sources. The NRF claimed that the attack was designed to test their defenses.\n\n**Siege of Final Panjshir Valley Holdouts and Exile Activities**\n\nOn September 6, 2021, the Taliban captured the governor's office in Bazarak and claimed control of the whole Panjshir Valley. The remaining NRF troops had retreated into the mountains. The NRF contested the Taliban's conquest of Panjshir, arguing that resistance fighters were still present in strategic positions in the valley.\n\n**Guerrilla Campaign by the NRF and Other Groups**\n\nThe NRF continued to engage in guerrilla warfare against the Taliban, including ambushes and raids. The NRF also claimed to have launched operations in other parts of the country, including the provinces of Baghlan and Takhar.\n\n**2022**\n\nIn January 2022, the Ahmad Khan Samangani Front clashed with the Taliban in the village of Kichi Manghar in the Hazrati Sultan district of Samangan. The clash resulted in the deaths of at least two Taliban fighters, including a commander.\n\n**Rebellion in Balkhab and Expanded NRF Operations**\n\nOn May 6, 2022, the NRF launched an offensive in the Panjshir Province, capturing three districts and besieging the local Taliban offices.

village of Elich during the clashes The Taliban has so far refused to comment on the attack [174]\n\n\nRebellion in Balkhab and expanded NRF operations\nOn 6 May 2022, the NRF launched an offensive, reportedly capturing three districts in Panjshir Province The NRF spokesman Ali Nazary stated that the NRF had taken control of the three district's roads, villages, and outposts, after which they besieged the local Taliban offices He also stated that \"Many Taliban fighters have asked for time to surrender The enemy has suffered heavy casualties.\" Taliban officials denied any fighting in the area Local Panjshir residents reported heavy fighting during the night The NRF also stated that the group would continue their presence across 12 provinces, mostly in the north [186] [187] On 9 May, the NRF ambushed a Taliban vehicle in Qala-e-Olang and killed an unknown number of Taliban fighters, which they responded by firing on civilians in Qasan village as retaliation for the ambush [188] Approximately 30 Taliban fighters had been killed in the NRF offensive as of 12 May The Taliban subsequently sent reinforcements from other provinces to bolster their garrisons in Panjshir Fighting

wounding another two [262] The Taliban convoy was allegedly targeting girls and detaining them in the Panjsad Family neighbourhood, something which the AFF condemned as the AFF pledged to stand up for women's rights in Afghanistan.\n\n\nForeign involvement\nAs of 23 August 2021, there was no public support for the resistance from the international community At the start of the conflict, the US and other potential allies were focused on the concurrent Kabul airlift, which required the Taliban's cooperation Massoud's op-ed in The Washington Post requesting Western support may be evidence of a lack of enthusiasm (for the resistance) in the US government [278]\n\n\nNeutral\nAs of 23 August 2021, there was no public support for the resistance from the international community At the start of

may be evidence of a lack of enthusiasm (for the resistance) in the US government [278]\n\n\nPro-NRF\nOn 25 August 2021, Bilal Y Saab, an ex-Pentagon senior advisor, and Mick Mulroy, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, Marine veteran and ex-CIA Special Activities Center operator, argued in a Time editorial that Washington, D.C should provide support in Afghanistan by allowing the CIA to station its officers with counterterrorism responsibilities to secretly assist anti-Taliban resistance groups [280] U.S senator Lindsey Graham and representative Michael Waltz

assisting the Taliban in Panjshir with drone strikes using smart bombs [288] [4] According to defense analyst Babak Taghvaee, Pakistan was using CH-4 drones to assist the Taliban in Panjshir [4] Faiz Hameed, the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence, the military intelligence agency of Pakistan, had visited Kabul prior to Dashti's death, [2] to assist the Taliban in reorganising the Afghan military according to a senior Pakistani official [289]\n\n\nAnalysis\nShortly after the fall of Kabul, journalists Carlotta Gall and Adam Nossiter wrote in The New York Times that the international community would be in a bind if they showed some form of support for the resistance because of the airlift operations that were then ongoing [29] Abdul Matin Beyk suggested that other anti-Taliban forces were waiting to see if the Panjshir-based fighters would either resist to the end or keep considering negotiations with Taliban representatives [29] He suggested that their successes could inspire others to do the same [29]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on August 24, 1965, in Morton Grove, Illinois, Matlin's life journey has been marked by her determination to succeed in a world where she is often the only deaf person in the room.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMatlin was born to Libby and Donald Matlin, who were high school sweethearts. Her father was an automobile dealer, and her mother was a devoted homemaker. At the age of 18 months, Matlin lost all hearing in her right ear and 80% of the hearing in her left ear due to a severe illness and fevers. This life-altering event did not deter Matlin's parents, who encouraged her to explore her creative side. In her autobiography, \"I'll Scream Later,\" Matlin shares her experiences growing up as a deaf child, including the challenges she faced in school and her desire to connect with her family and friends.\n\nMatlin's sense of humor about her deafness is well-known, and she often pokes fun at the misconceptions people have about her abilities. For instance, she recounts a situation where she was talking to someone through a speakerphone, and after 10 minutes, the person asked her how she could hear them. Matlin playfully replied, \"You know what? I can hear on Wednesdays!\" This lighthearted approach to her deafness has helped to break down barriers and promote understanding.\n\n**Career**\n\nMatlin's stage debut was at the age of seven, when she played the role of Dorothy in an International Center on Deafness and the Arts (ICODA) children's theatre production of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" She continued to appear with the ICODA children's theatre group throughout her childhood, developing her acting skills and confidence. At the age of 13, Matlin won second prize in the Chicago Center's Annual International Creative Arts Festival for an essay titled, \"If I Was not a Movie Star.\"\n\nMatlin's breakthrough role came in 1986 when she played the lead in the film \"Children of a Lesser God,\" opposite William Hurt. Her performance earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the youngest winner in the category at the time. This achievement marked a significant milestone in her career, as she became the first deaf person to win an Oscar.\n\n**Other Ventures**\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Matlin is actively involved with charitable organizations that support the deaf community and other causes. She has been a member of the Easter Seals board of directors and has worked with the Children Affected by AIDS Foundation, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and VSA arts. Matlin has also been a strong advocate for the rights of deaf people, accepting television roles only if producers commit to captioning the films, remaining open-minded and respectful of both signed and spoken communication preferences, and promoting telephone equipment specifically designed for deaf persons.\n\nMatlin has testified before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources in support of the establishment of the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders. She has also been involved in the fight against AIDS, the \"Victory Awards\" for the National Rehabilitation Hospital, and other causes.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMatlin married Burbank police officer Kevin Grandalski on August 29, 1993, at the home of actor Henry Winkler. The couple met while she was filming a scene from \"Reasonable Doubts\" outside the studio grounds, and Grandalski was assigned to provide security and control traffic.

{"title": "2021_Russian_legislative_election", "content": "\nBackground\nAfter the 2016 Russian legislative election, United Russia was the most popular party, with its polling rates ranging from 40% to 55%, while the ratings of the main opposition parties were much lower; the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) each had just over 10%, while A Just Russia (JR) was around the 5% threshold required to enter the State Duma.\n\n\nEarly polling, pension reform, and 2018 protests\nAfter the 2016 Russian legislative election, United Russia was the most popular party, with its polling rates ranging from 40% to 55%, while the ratings of the main opposition parties were much lower; the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) each had just over 10%, while A Just Russia (JR) was around the 5% threshold required to enter the State Duma.\n\n\n2020 constitutional reform and speculations about a snap election\nDuring his 2020 Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly on 15 January, President Vladimir Putin proposed a referendum to be held on the number of amendments arguing that a national vote would be necessary to make the changes to the Constitution of Russia \"legitimate\" [36] The amendments proposed to weaken the executive power and expand the powers of the Federal Assembly In particular, it is supposed to transfer the power to form a government to the State Duma; this means that if the amendments were adopted, the next Cabinet would be formed by the State Duma [37] Immediately after Putin's speech, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev resigned along with the entire government On 16 January, Mikhail Mishustin was appointed as the new Prime Minister After that, there were suggestions about the dissolution of the State Duma and holding a snap election after the constitutional reform; the State Duma can only be dissolved if it refuses the President's appointment of a Prime Minister three times in a row or passes a no-confidence motion against the government According to sources from the Presidential Administration of Russia, the constitution may be amended to allow self-dissolution of the State Duma Some political scientists and MPs also have said that the dissolution of the State Duma and holding of a snap election is likely; [38] [39] [40] however, this opinion is not shared by Andrey Klishas, head of the Legal Committee of the Federation Council, who is part of the working group on preparing amendments to the constitution [41]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nOwing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the format of individual electoral events can be changed for health reasons In 2020, a law was passed that allows early voting at polling stations two days before the official voting day In addition, the polling stations themselves can be organized outside the premises, but this decision is not mandatory and may be made by the CEC within ten days after the election is scheduled [54] [55]\n\n\nBarring of opposition candidates\nA number of opposition candidates were barred from running in the elections, [21] including allies of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny and other candidates affiliated with him following the designation of his networks, including the Anti-Corruption Foundation, as \"extremist\" earlier in the year, [21] effectively banning anyone associated with Navalny or his groups from running for office [56] Navalny allies barred from running include Lyubov Sobol, Ilya Yashin, Oleg Stepanov, Irina Fatyanova, and Alexandra Semenova [21] [57] [1] Other allies of Navalny were exiled prior to the election and tried to coordinate opposition votes from abroad [1]\n\n\nSmart Voting\nSmart Voting, a tactical voting strategy created by Navalny and his team aimed at electing candidates with the best chance of defeating those backed by the Kremlin and the ruling United Russia party, faced a crackdown by authorities before the election [60] [61] [62] Navalny urged voters to use the Smart Voting website to vote against pro-Kremlin candidates [63] Smart Voting was previously used twice in regional elections, helping opposition candidates win 20 of 45 seats in the 2019 Moscow City Duma election and United Russia lose its majorities in the legislatures of the cities of Novosibirsk, Tambov, and Tomsk [60] Navalny ally Leonid Volkov stated that \"15%-20% of candidates endorsed by Smart Voting have won seats in legislatures\" [60] [63]\n\n\nPre-election payments\nOn 24 August, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed off one-off cash payments of 10,000 rubles ($135) for pensioners after proposing payments for pensioners and military servicemen two days earlier during a meeting with United Russia candidates [76] [77] On 31 August, Putin approved one-off cash payments of 15,000 rubles ($200) for law enforcement, servicemen, firefighters and others, with the move seen by critics as bolstering support for the ruling party, while the Kremlin denied that the payments were connected to the election [78] [79] [80] [81] Russian journalist Dmitry Kolezev described the military and police payments as a means to ensure the loyalty of the security forces that the government would rely upon to disperse protests [80] The COVID-19 pandemic in Russia and the stagnating economy may have played a role in justification of the tactic [80] [82]\n\n\nElectoral system\nAs of 2021, under Article 96 of Constitution of Russia the service term of the State Duma is limited to five years and each seat is allocated through a parallel voting: one ballot for party-lists and one ballot for a single candidate (both are counted by first-past-the-post voting method) [83]\n\n\nPolitical parties and candidates\nAccording to the law enacted since 2014 half of the seats (225) are elected by party-list proportional representation (PLPR) with a minimum of 5% electoral threshold of number of votes that enable the party to get seats The other half elected in 225 single-member constituencies (circuits, SMC) by first-past-the-post voting (plurality voting) [84] [85] [86]\n\n\nSeats distribution\nArticle 89 of the State Duma deputies election law stipulates the proportional algorithm (i.e Hare quota) should be used to distribute 225 seats among parties who clear 5% electoral threshold in number of votes cast per given party [85] [84] The rest of seats (225) are distributed according to the plurality voting, as it was stipulated by law at the time of the election [e]\n\n\nChanges in the electoral system\nOwing to allegedly falling ratings of the ruling party, it was assumed that the party would try to reform the electoral system in order to maintain a majority in the new State Duma In particular, it was assumed that the share of MPs elected by party lists could be reduced from 50% (225 seats) to 25% (112 or 113), and the rest would be elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, [90] or elections on the party lists could be canceled altogether and all 450 seats would be elected in single-member constituencies; [91] however, such assumptions were not justified, and the electoral system remained the same In April 2021, an amendment was made to the Federal Law on Elections to the State Duma, increasing the federal part of the party list from 10 to 15 candidates [92]\n\n\nObservers\nPutin's government restricted Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) representatives from carrying out election monitoring activity; [61] the Russian government cited COVID-19 concerns but did not elaborate on details [93] The OSCE reported that Russian authorities insisted on limiting a number of OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights observers to 50, and limiting the number of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly observers to ten, even though the Russian government response to the COVID-19 pandemic had no restrictions that \"would seem to prevent the deployment of a full election observation mission\" at that time [94] It was the first time since 1993 that the OSCE would not participate in observing elections in Russia [95] The OSCE had earlier determined that 420 short-term and 80 long-term observers would be needed in order to reliably assess the process [94] Faced with major limitations on its freedom to observe, OSCE decided not to send a monitoring team at all [93] [61] [94] Only a symbolic delegation would be present.\n\n\nInternational\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia condemned Russia for conducting elections in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali, which are occupied by Russia and referred to as the occupied territories of Georgia but internationally recognized as part of Georgia [211] [212]\n\n\nBelarus\nThe National Assembly of Belarus has reportedly sent a delegation to Russia to observe the voting process The group consisted of the same parliament members who are part to the Union State [99]\n\n\nPolitical parties\nAs of August 2021, there are 32 registered political parties in Russia [100] Parties represented in the State Duma, in which case seats must be obtained in the vote on the party list, parties that received more than 3% of the vote by party list in the previous elections, or parties that are represented at least in one of the regional parliaments, or also by party list, are allowed to contest in the elections without collecting signatures Other parties need to collect 200,000 signatures if they have also held conventions and nominated candidates to participate in the elections The official list of parties entitled to participate in the elections without collection of signatures was announced before the election After the 2020 Russian regional elections, there are only 14 such parties [9] [101] [102]\n\n\nAutomatically on ballot\nOn 19 December 2018, the Party of Growth became the first party to

single-mandate constituencies, not party lists He said: \"Today, no slogans, no 'locomotives', [f] we can't win .. we can't cover the whole of Russia, so it's easier for us to focus on specific constituencies We need real candidates who will be known on the ground And the electorate who will know first of all the person, and not even the Party of Growth.\" The party would nominate about 40 candidates in single-member constituencies According to the plan, deputies elected in the course of elections to municipal and regional legislative bodies prior to 2021 should form the election

allow the party to maintain its position as the leading political force in Russia and win the 2021 election [133] Party leader Dmitry Medvedev said that he would head a commission to prepare a new election program for the party [134] In addition, a project office was established to prepare for the election [135] According to the party's General Council Secretary Andrey Turchak, United Russia would fight to preserve its constitutional majority, and intends to win at least 301 seats [136] According to sources from the party leadership, United Russia has assessed the work of its deputies in the State Duma Based on this assessment, not all of them would be able to run in the upcoming election, and is assumed that about half of the faction would be made up of new deputies [137]\n\n\nUnited

win approximately 10% of the electorate When asked by a journalist if he is open to working with supporters of Alexei Navalny and in fact nominating some of his supporters as candidates, Rybakov replied: \"We are open to conversation We are discussing all this.\" On 3 July, Grigory Yavlinsky, the founder of the party, decided to not run for parliament, instead endorsing younger candidates Yabloko was expected to nominate other famous opposition candidates such as Dmitry Gudkov and Andrei Pivovarov, along with many Navalny supporters [149] [150]\n\n\nA Just Russia — For Truth\nOn 20

the federal list Prilepin also said that Nikolai Starikov and Sergey Mikheev would also run only on the party list [157] Mikheev explained this decision by saying that it is more reasonable to

six E-voting elections, both federal and municipal, would be held in regions, including Moscow [27] E-voting was heavily used on the election days in Moscow Even though initially considered convenient

abandon it and amend the outcome [194]\n\n\nCandidate duplicates\nWhile non-systemic opposition was largely eliminated from the elections, those candidates (mostly of systemic opposition) who were

"Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2021_Russian_legislative_election\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nAfter the 2016 Russian legislative election, United Russia was the most popular party, with its polling rates ranging from 40% to 55%, while the ratings of the main opposition parties were much lower; the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) each had just over 10%, while A Just Russia (JR) was around the 5% threshold required to enter the State Duma.\n\n\nEarly polling, pension reform, and 2018 protests\nAfter the 2016 Russian legislative election, United Russia was the most popular party, with its polling rates ranging from 40% to 55%, while the ratings of the main opposition parties were much lower; the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) each had just over 10%, while A Just Russia (JR) was around the 5% threshold required to enter the State Duma.\n\n\n2020 constitutional reform and speculations about a snap election\nDuring his 2020 Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly on 15 January, President Vladimir Putin proposed a referendum to be held on the number of amendments arguing that a national vote would be necessary to make the changes to the Constitution of Russia \"legitimate\" [36] The amendments proposed to weaken the executive power and expand the powers of the Federal Assembly In particular, it is supposed to transfer the power to form a government to the State Duma; this means that if the amendments were adopted, the next Cabinet would be formed by the State Duma [37] Immediately after Putin's speech, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev resigned along with the entire government On 16 January, Mikhail Mishustin was appointed as the new Prime Minister After that, there were suggestions about the dissolution of the State Duma and holding a snap election after the constitutional reform; the State Duma can only be dissolved if it refuses the President's appointment of a Prime Minister three times in a row or passes a no-confidence motion against the government According to sources from the Presidential Administration of Russia, the constitution may be amended to allow self-dissolution of the State Duma Some political scientists and MPs also have said that the dissolution of the State Duma and holding of a snap election is likely; [38] [39] [40] however, this opinion is not shared by Andrey Klishas, head of the Legal Committee of the Federation Council, who is part of the working group on preparing amendments to the constitution [41]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nOwing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the format of individual electoral events can be changed for health reasons In 2020, a law was passed that allows early voting at polling stations two days before the official voting day In addition, the polling stations themselves can be organized outside the premises, but this decision is not mandatory and may be made by the CEC within ten days after the election is scheduled [54] [55]\n\n\nBarring of opposition candidates\nA number of opposition candidates were barred from running in the elections, [21] including allies of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny and other candidates affiliated with him following the designation of his networks, including the Anti-Corruption Foundation, as \"extremist\" earlier in the year, [21] effectively banning anyone associated with Navalny or his groups from running for office [56] Navalny allies barred from running include Lyubov Sobol, Ilya Yashin, Oleg Stepanov, Irina Fatyanova, and Alexandra Semenova [21] [57] [1] Other allies of Navalny were exiled prior to the election and tried to coordinate opposition votes from abroad [1]\n\n\nSmart Voting\nSmart Voting, a tactical voting strategy created by Navalny and his team aimed at electing candidates with the best chance of defeating those backed by the Kremlin and the ruling United Russia party, faced a crackdown by authorities before the election [60] [61] [62] Navalny urged voters to use the Smart Voting website to vote against pro-Kremlin candidates [63] Smart Voting was previously used twice in regional elections, helping opposition candidates win 20 of 45 seats in the 2019 Moscow City Duma election and United Russia lose its majorities in the legislatures of the cities of Novosibirsk, Tambov, and Tomsk [60] Navalny ally Leonid Volkov stated that \"15%-20% of candidates endorsed by Smart Voting have won seats in legislatures\" [60] [63]\n\n\nPre-election payments\nOn 24 August, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed off one-off cash payments of 10,000 rubles ($135) for pensioners after proposing payments for pensioners and military servicemen two days earlier during a meeting with United Russia candidates [76] [77] On 31 August, Putin approved one-off cash payments of 15,000 rubles ($200) for law enforcement, servicemen, firefighters and others, with the move seen by critics as bolstering support for the ruling party, while the Kremlin denied that the payments were connected to the election [78] [79] [80] [81] Russian journalist Dmitry Kolezev described the military and police payments as a means to ensure the loyalty of the security forces that the government would rely upon to disperse protests [80] The COVID-19 pandemic in Russia and the stagnating economy may have played a role in justification of the tactic [80] [82]\n\n\nElectoral system\nAs of 2021, under Article 96 of Constitution of Russia the service term of the State Duma is limited to five years and each seat is allocated through a parallel voting: one ballot for party-lists and one ballot for a single candidate (both are counted by first-past-the-post voting method) [83]\n\n\nPolitical parties and candidates\nAccording to the law enacted since 2014 half of the seats (225) are elected by party-list proportional representation (PLPR) with a minimum of 5% electoral threshold of number of votes that enable the party to get seats The other half elected in 225 single-member constituencies (circuits, SMC) by first-past-the-post voting (plurality voting) [84] [85] [86]\n\n\nSeats distribution\nArticle 89 of the State Duma deputies election law stipulates the proportional algorithm (i.e Hare quota) should be used to distribute 225 seats among parties who clear 5% electoral threshold in number of votes cast per given party [85] [84] The rest of seats (225) are distributed according to the plurality voting, as it was stipulated by law at the time of the election [e]\n\n\nChanges in the electoral system\nOwing to allegedly falling ratings of the ruling party, it was assumed that the party would try to reform the electoral system in order to maintain a majority in the new State Duma In particular, it was assumed that the share of MPs elected by party lists could be reduced from 50% (225 seats) to 25% (112 or 113), and the rest would be elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, [90] or elections on the party lists could be canceled altogether and all 450 seats would be elected in single-member constituencies; [91] however, such assumptions were not justified, and the electoral system remained the same In April 2021, an amendment was made to the Federal Law on Elections to the State Duma, increasing the federal part of the party list from 10 to 15 candidates [92]\n\n\nObservers\nPutin's government restricted Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) representatives from carrying out election monitoring activity; [61] the Russian government cited COVID-19 concerns but did not elaborate on details [93] The OSCE reported that Russian authorities insisted on limiting a number of OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights observers to 50, and limiting the number of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly observers to ten, even though the Russian government response to the COVID-19 pandemic had no restrictions that \"would seem to prevent the deployment of a full election observation mission\" at that time [94] It was the first time since 1993 that the OSCE would not participate in observing elections in Russia [95] The OSCE had earlier determined that 420 short-term and 80 long-term observers would be needed in order to reliably assess the process [94] Faced with major limitations on its freedom to observe, OSCE decided not to send a monitoring team at all [93] [61] [94] Only a symbolic delegation would be present.\n\n\nInternational\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia condemned Russia for conducting elections in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali, which are occupied by Russia and referred to as the occupied territories of Georgia but internationally recognized as part of Georgia [211] [212]\n\n\nBelarus\nThe National Assembly of Belarus has reportedly sent a delegation to Russia to observe the voting process The group consisted of the same parliament members who are part to the Union State [99]\n\n\nPolitical parties\nAs of August 2021, there are 32 registered political parties in Russia [100] Parties represented in the State Duma, in which case seats must be obtained in the vote on the party list, parties that received more than 3% of the vote by party list in the previous elections, or parties that are represented at least in one of the regional parliaments, or also by party list, are allowed to contest in the elections without collecting signatures Other parties need to collect 200,000 signatures if they have also held conventions and nominated candidates to participate in the elections The official list of parties entitled to participate in the elections without collection of signatures was announced before the election After the 2020 Russian regional elections, there are only 14 such parties [9] [101] [102]\n\n\nAutomatically on ballot\nOn 19 December 2018, the Party of Growth became the first party to launch a campaign when its leader Boris Titov opened the party's \"Election 2021\" federal

17 March 2021, the CEC has announced that at least six E-voting elections, both federal and municipal, would be held in regions, including Moscow [27] E-voting was heavily used on the election days in

[193] and the opposition parties demanding to abandon it and amend the outcome [194]\n\n\nCandidate duplicates\nWhile non-systemic opposition was largely eliminated from the elections, those

it was suggested by Nicklaus as a means to make the matches more competitive, since the Americans almost always won, often by lopsided margins [34] From the resumption of competition in 1947 through 1977, Great Britain and Ireland had only managed one win and one tie.\n\n\nFormat\nThe Ryder Cup involves various match play competitions between players selected from two teams of twelve It takes place from a Friday to a Sunday with a total of 28 matches being played, all matches being over 18 holes On Friday and Saturday there are four fourball matches and four foursomes matches each day;

The competition was founded in 1927 by Samuel Ryder, who donated the trophy, and has been held every two years since then, except during World War II.\n\n## Founding of the Cup\n\nThe idea for the Ryder Cup was born in 1920 when James D. Harnett, a golf writer for the magazine Golf Illustrated, suggested that a team of American professionals be chosen to play in the 1921 Open Championship in Britain. The Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA of America) responded positively to the idea, and a team of 12 American professionals was chosen to play in the championship.\n\n## Gleneagles 1921\n\nThe first Ryder Cup match was held at Gleneagles in Scotland in 1921. The match was played between a team of 12 American professionals and a team of 12 British professionals. The match was a stroke play competition, and the Americans won by a margin of 17-5.\n\n## Wentworth 1926\n\nIn 1926, the Ryder Cup was held at Wentworth in England. The match was played between a team of 4 American professionals, led by Walter Hagen, and a team of 4 British professionals. The match was a stroke play competition, and the Americans won by a margin of 7-5.\n\n## Worcester 1927\n\nThe 1927 Ryder Cup was held at Worcester in England. The match was played between a team of 12 American professionals and a team of 12 British professionals. The match was a match-play competition, and the Americans won by a margin of 9-3.\n\n## Inclusion of Continental European Golfers\n\nIn 1979, the Ryder Cup was expanded to include players from continental Europe. This change was made in an effort to make the competition more competitive, as the Americans had dominated the matches for many years. The change was suggested by Jack Nicklaus, who felt that the addition of European players would make the competition more exciting and challenging.\n\n## Format\n\nThe Ryder Cup involves various match play competitions between players selected from two teams of 12. The competition takes place over three days, with a total of 28 matches being played. The matches are played in the following format:\n\n* Friday and Saturday: Four four-ball matches and four foursomes matches each day\n* Sunday: 12 singles matches\n\n## Team Composition\n\nThe captains of each team have always selected the players and chosen the playing order in each group of matches. In the early years of the competition, it was common for the captain to be one of the players. However, with the change to 18-hole matches and the extension to three days, it became more difficult for the captain to combine the roles of captain and player.\n\n## Captains\n\nThe captains of the Ryder Cup have always been professional golfers. The only captain who never played in the Ryder Cup was J.H. Taylor, the 1933 British captain. The captains have always selected the players and chosen the playing order in each group of matches.\n\n## Qualification and Selection\n\nThe selection process for the Ryder Cup players has varied over the years. In the early contests, the teams were generally decided by a selection committee. However, later qualification based on performances was introduced. The current system, by which most of the team is determined by performances with a small number of players selected by the captain, has been used by both sides since 1989.\n\n## Notable Ryder Cups\n\nThe 1969 Ryder Cup, held at Royal Birkdale in England, was one of the most competitive matches in terms of play. The Americans won the match by a margin of 19-13, with 18 of the 32 matches going to the last green.\n\nThe 1989 Ryder Cup, held at The Belfry in England, was notable for the tensions between the teams. The Americans had lost the previous two matches, and the pressure was on them to win. The Europeans won the match by a margin of 14-14, with the decisive point coming in the final match.\n\nThe 1991 Ryder Cup, held at Kiawah Island in South Carolina, was marked by a series of controversies. The European team claimed that the American team had made a series of unfair gestures, including showing a video of past Ryder Cups that was perceived as biased towards the Americans.\n\nThe 1999 Ryder Cup, held at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, was a dramatic match that saw the Americans come back from a 10-6 deficit to win by a margin of 141/2-131/2.\n\nThe 2012 Ryder Cup, held at Medinah Country Club in Illinois, was a remarkable comeback by the Europeans. The team was down 10-4 after 14 matches, but came back to win by a margin of 141/2-13 1/2.\n\n## Cancellations and Postponements\n\nThe 1939 Ryder Cup was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II in Europe. The competition was scheduled to be held at Ponte Vedra Country Club in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nThe 1941, 1943, and 1945 Ryder Cups were not played due to World War II. The competition resumed in 1947 at the Portland Golf Club in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe 2001 Ryder Cup was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks. The competition was rescheduled for the following year and was played at The Belfry in England.\n\nThe 2020 Ryder Cup was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The competition was rescheduled for the following year and will be played at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin.\n\n## Future Venues\n\nThe PGA European Tour has announced that it will put out the Ryder Cup hosting rights from 2018 through 2030 to a competitive bid process throughout Europe.\n\n## Television\n\nThe Ryder Cup has been covered by the BBC in the UK and the United States. However, in the 1970s, ITV gained the rights to the Ryder Cup and showed the 1973, 1975, and 1977 cups. Sky Sports has since taken over live coverage of the Ryder Cup.\n\n## Traditions\n\nThere is a tradition in the Ryder Cup of allowing a nominated player to substitute for an injured player in a singles match. The nominated player is selected by the captain prior to the start of the matches and is matched up against the injured player.\n\n## Similar Golf Events\n\nThe Presidents Cup is a similar golf event to the Ryder Cup, except that the competing sides are a U.S. side and an International side from the rest of the world. The Presidents Cup is held in years when there is no Ryder Cup.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ryder_Cup\" following this outline:\n\n\nFounding of the Cup\nOn 27 September 1920 Golf Illustrated wrote a letter to the Professional Golfers' Association of America with a suggestion that a team of 12 to 20 American professionals be chosen to play in the 1921 Open Championship, to be financed by popular subscription [15] At that time no American golfer had won The Open Championship The idea was that of James D Harnett, who worked for the magazine The PGA of America replied positively and announced the idea in the November 1920 issue The fund was called the British Open Championship Fund By the following spring, the idea had been firmed up [16] A team of 12 would be chosen, who would sail in time to play in a warm-up tournament at Gleneagles (the Glasgow Herald 1000 Guinea Tournament) before The Open at St Andrews, two weeks later The team of 12 was chosen by PGA President George Sargent and PGA Secretary Alec Pirie, with the assistance of USGA Vice-president Robert Gardner [17] A team of 11 sailed from New York on the RMS Aquitania on 24 May 1921 together with James Harnett, Harry Hampton deciding at the last minute that he could not travel [18]\n\n\nGleneagles 1921\nOn 27 September 1920 Golf Illustrated wrote a letter to the Professional Golfers' Association of America with a suggestion that a team of 12 to 20 American professionals be chosen to play in the 1921 Open Championship, to be financed by popular subscription [15] At that time no American golfer had won The Open Championship The idea was that of James D Harnett, who worked for the magazine The PGA of America replied positively and announced the idea in the November 1920 issue The fund was called the British Open Championship Fund By the following spring, the idea had been firmed up [16] A team of 12 would be chosen, who would sail in time to play in a warm-up tournament at Gleneagles (the Glasgow Herald 1000 Guinea Tournament) before The Open at St Andrews, two weeks later The team of 12 was chosen by PGA President George Sargent and PGA Secretary Alec Pirie, with the assistance of USGA Vice-president Robert Gardner [17] A team of 11 sailed from New York on the RMS Aquitania on 24 May 1921 together with James Harnett, Harry Hampton deciding at the last minute that he could not travel [18]\n\n\nWentworth 1926\nIt was common at this time for a small number of professionals to travel to compete in each other's national championship In 1926, a larger than usual contingent of American professionals were travelling to Britain to compete in the Open Championship, two weeks before their own Championship In February it was announced that Walter Hagen would select a team of four American professionals (including himself) to play four British professionals in a match before the Open Championship [24] The match would be a stroke play competition with each playing the four opposing golfers over 18 holes [25] In mid-April, it was announced that \"A golf enthusiast, who name has not yet been made public\" was ready to donate a cup for an annual competition [26] Later in April it was announced that Samuel Ryder would be presenting a trophy \"for annual competition between British and American professionals.\" with the first match to be played on 4 and 5 June \"but the details are not yet decided\", [27] and then in May it was announced that the match would be a match-play competition, 8-a-side, foursomes on the first day, singles on the second [28] Eventually, at Hagen's request, 10 players competed for each team [29] Samuel Ryder (together with his brother James) had sponsored a number of British professional events starting in 1923 [25]\n\n\nWorcester 1927\nThe 1927 competition was organized on a much more formal basis A Ryder Cup \"Deed of Trust\" was drawn up formalising the rules of the contest, while each of the PGA organisations had a selection process In Britain, Golf Illustrated launched a fund to raise £3,000 to fund professional golfers to play in the U.S Open and the Ryder Cup Ryder contributed £100 and, when the fund closed with a shortfall of £300, he made up the outstanding balance himself Although not in the rules at that time, the American PGA restricted their team to those born in the United States [31]\n\n\nInclusion of continental European golfers\nThe most significant change to the Ryder Cup has been the inclusion of continental European golfers since 1979 Up until 1977, the matches featured teams representing the United States and Great Britain and Ireland From 1979 players from continental Europe have been eligible to join what is now known as Team Europe The change to include continental Europeans arose from discussion in 1977 between Jack Nicklaus and Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby, who was serving as the President of the Professional Golfers' Association;

Kennedy Jr.**\n\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. was an American lawyer, journalist, and magazine publisher who was the son of President John F. Kennedy. He is best known for his work as the founder and editor-in-chief of George magazine, which was launched in 1995. Kennedy was also a licensed pilot who died in a plane crash in 1999 at the age of 38.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Jr. was born on November 25, 1960, at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. His father, John F. Kennedy, had been elected president of the United States just 18 days earlier, and his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy, was still recovering from a difficult pregnancy. John-John, as he was nicknamed, was the second of three children, with an older sister, Caroline, and a younger brother, Patrick, who died two days after birth in 1963.\n\nKennedy's childhood was marked by a sense of tragedy and loss. His father's assassination in 1963 had a profound impact on the family, and John-John's mother struggled to cope with the loss of her husband. Despite these challenges, Kennedy's family remained close-knit, and he was raised with a strong sense of values and morality.\n\n**Education**\n\nKennedy attended private schools in Manhattan, starting at Saint David's School and later moving to Collegiate School, where he attended from third through tenth grade. He then attended Phillips Academy, a preparatory boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts, where he developed a strong passion for politics and public service.\n\nAfter graduating from Phillips Academy, Kennedy took a gap year to travel and work abroad. He accompanied his mother on a trip to Africa, where they got lost in the wilderness for two days without food or water. Kennedy's resourcefulness and leadership skills helped them survive the ordeal, and he was later praised for his bravery and quick thinking.\n\n**Career**\n\nKennedy's career in journalism began in 1984, when he worked as a researcher at the Office of Business Development in New York City. He later became the deputy director of the 42nd Street Development Corporation, where he conducted negotiations with developers and city agencies.\n\nIn 1986, Kennedy began working as a journalist, writing for various publications, including The New York Times and Vogue. He also started to make a name for himself as a talented young actor, appearing in several stage productions and television shows.\n\n**Acting**\n\nKennedy's passion for acting began when he was a student at Brown University, where he appeared in several plays and musicals. After graduating, he continued to act, appearing in several stage productions and television shows.\n\nIn 1985, Kennedy made his New York acting debut in a production of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" at the Irish Theater on Manhattan's West Side. He received rave reviews for his performance, with the executive director of the Irish Arts Center praising him as \"one of the best young actors I've seen in years.\"\n\n**George Magazine**\n\nIn 1995, Kennedy founded George magazine, a glossy, politics-as-lifestyle and fashion monthly. He served as the editor-in-chief and publisher of the magazine, which quickly gained a reputation for its innovative approach to politics and culture.\n\nUnder Kennedy's leadership, George magazine became a platform for progressive politics and social commentary. He used the magazine to promote his own views on politics and culture, and to showcase the work of emerging artists and writers.\n\n**Decline**\n\nBy 1997, Kennedy and his business partner, Michael Berman, were locked in a power struggle, which led to screaming matches, slammed doors, and even a physical altercation. Berman eventually sold his share of the company, and Kennedy took on Berman's responsibilities.\n\nDespite his best efforts, the magazine continued to decline, and Kennedy's personal life began to suffer. He and his wife, Carolyn Bessette, were struggling to maintain a healthy relationship, and Kennedy's obsession with the magazine was taking a toll on his mental health.\n\n**Later Life**\n\nIn 1998, Kennedy resumed his piloting lessons, which had been put on hold after his cousin Michael's death in a skiing accident. He received his pilot's license in April 1998 and began to fly regularly, often taking friends and family members on flights around the country.\n\nKennedy's love of flying was a source of comfort and joy for him, and he often said that it was his favorite way to clear his mind and relax. Tragically, his love of flying would ultimately be the cause of his death, as he died in a plane crash on July 18, 1999, at the age of 38.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Jr. left behind a lasting legacy as a journalist, actor, and entrepreneur. His work on George magazine helped to shape the way we think about politics and culture, and his passion for flying continues to inspire others.\n\nIn 2000, Reaching Up, the organization which Kennedy founded in 1989, joined with The City University of New York to establish the John F. Kennedy Jr Institute. The institute is dedicated to promoting civic engagement and community service, and it continues to be a vibrant and dynamic force in the city.\n\nIn 2003, the ARCO Forum at Harvard Kennedy School was renamed the John F. Kennedy Jr Forum of Public Affairs, in honor of Kennedy's love of politics and public service. The forum continues to bring together leaders and policymakers from around the world, and it remains a powerful symbol of Kennedy's commitment to public service.\n\nOverall, John F. Kennedy Jr. was a talented and ambitious young man who was cut down in his prime. His legacy continues to inspire others, and his work on George magazine and in the world of politics and culture remains a testament to his boundless energy and enthusiasm.", "prompt": "Write a

predominant calendar in the Roman Empire and subsequently, most of the Western world for more than 1,600 years The Roman calendar began the year on 1 January, and this remained the start of the year after the Julian reform However, even after local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar, they started the new year on different dates The Alexandrian calendar in Egypt started on 29 August (30 August after an Alexandrian leap year) Several local provincial calendars were aligned to start on the birthday of the Emperor Augustus, 23 September The indiction caused the Byzantine year, which used the Julian calendar, to begin on 1 September; this date is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church for the beginning of the liturgical year.\n\n\nChristian observance\nAs a date in the Christian calendar, New Year's Day liturgically marked the Feast of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus, which is still observed as such in the Anglican Church, the Lutheran Church, [11] [12] the Eastern Orthodox Church (Julian calendar, see below) and in Traditional Catholicism by those who retain the usage of the General Roman Calendar of 1960 The mainstream Roman Catholic Church celebrates on this day the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God [13]\n\n\nGift giving\nAmong the 7th-century pagans of Flanders and the Netherlands, it was the custom to exchange gifts at the winter solstice This

house-elf, compare Puck] at night or exchange New Year gifts or supply superfluous drinks  [another Yule custom].\" [14] However, on the date that European Christians celebrated the Feast of the Circumcision, they exchanged Christmas presents because the feast fell within the 12 days of the Christmas season in the Western Christian liturgical calendar; [15] The custom of exchanging Christmas gifts in a Christian context is traced back to the Biblical Magi who gave gifts to the Christ Child [16] [17] In Tudor England, 1 January (as the Feast of the Circumcision, not New Year's Day), along with Christmas Day and Twelfth Night, was celebrated as one of three main festivities among the twelve days of Christmastide [18]\n\n\nAcceptance of 1 January as New Year's Day\nMost nations of Europe

become common [c] With the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750, Britain and the Empire formally adopted 1 January as New Year's Day in 1752 and, with the same Act, also discarded the Julian calendar at the

"Mutaz Essa Barshim\n\nMutaz Essa Barshim is a Qatari track and field athlete who specializes in the high jump event. He is a two-time Olympic medalist and a three-time World Champion, and is considered one of the greatest high jumpers of all time.\n\nBiography\n\nMutaz Essa Barshim was born on June 24, 1991, in Doha, Qatar, to a Sudanese family. He is the eldest of six siblings, and his father was also a track and field athlete. Barshim's family encouraged his athletic pursuits from an early age, and he began competing in track and field events at the age of 10. He initially focused on running and long jumping, but switched to high jumping at the age of 15, which he found more enjoyable.\n\nBarshim began training at the Aspire Academy in Doha, where he honed his skills under the guidance of his coach, Stanisław Szczyrba. Szczyrba, a Polish-Swedish coach, had a significant influence on Barshim's career, and the two formed a close bond that extended beyond a traditional coach-athlete relationship.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBarshim grew up in a sports-loving family, and his father's athletic background played a significant role in his early interest in track and field. He attended an Arabic school in Doha, where he learned to speak English, and began competing in local and national events. Barshim's decision to focus on high jumping was influenced by his desire to excel in an event that required both technique and power.\n\nAt the age of 15, Barshim began training seriously, and his natural talent and dedication quickly paid off. He set a series of personal bests, and his performances caught the attention of national selectors, who invited him to compete for Qatar in international events.\n\n2011\n\nBarshim's breakthrough year came in 2011, when he won gold in the Asian Athletics Championships in Kobe, Japan, clearing a height of 2.35 meters. He continued his impressive form, winning a gold medal at the Military World Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a clearance of 2.28 meters.\n\nBarshim made his debut on the global senior stage at the 2011 World Athletics Championships in Daegu, South Korea, where he reached the final, finishing seventh overall.

earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, becoming the first woman in hip hop to earn an Oscar nomination [90]\n\n\nCultural impact\nQueen Latifah has been cited as an

Reynolds [108]\n\n\nInfluence on the entertainment industry\nQueen Latifah has demonstrated several forms of activism over her lifetime, challenging Eurocentric ideals and representing the black, female body An initial sign of the beginning of her resistance to these Eurocentric standards started with her name Her entire name was self-chosen, and while 'Latifah' came from an Arabic book, 'Queen' originated from her desire to create a strong, black identity, which was fueled by her mother, Rita Owens, who gave her the foundation to develop into a self-proclaimed Queen

from her desire to create a strong, black identity, which was fueled by her mother, Rita Owens, who gave her the foundation to develop into a self-proclaimed Queen [111]\n\n\nEarly influence of feminism\nWhile Afrocentric influence and pro-black productions were what Queen Latifah focused on, she also incorporated feminism throughout her work Latifah's demonstration of Afrocentricity co-existed with how she also demonstrated her feminism The message of hip hop and rap began to change around the mid-nineties, with rappers like Queen Latifah, as well as Monie Love and Lil' Kim, changing the narrative The lyrics of the songs produced by several of these women related to sexual liberation, female autonomy, and sexual domination [115] Language in hip hop was changed through female artists, reclaiming derogatory words that are used against women and incorporating them within their music.\n\n\nFlavor Unit Records\nLatifah also founded a production company, which was referred to as Flavor Unit Records, eventually Flavor Unit Entertainment, co-launching it in 1995 with her business partner Shakim Compere [116] Near the creation of this label, she helped several artists create their music, such as Daddy D Daddy D was Latifah's first artist to create a single with Her purpose was to create a multimedia company that operates at full service Several music artists at the time wanted to join Queen Latifah's label because they easily identified her success, from an artist herself, to a self made label chief [116] The label remained quite small in the nineties, but eventually gained traction as Queen Latifah gained more attention While her record label helped several artists start up their career, she remained at Motown Records for her own benefit [116]\n\n\nPortrayal of characters\nQueen Latifah expanded her career from music, branching out to acting, as well as producing Her first role that she took on was in the movie Jungle Fever, which was released in 1991, where she performed among several significant black actors, such as Samuel L Jackson and Halle Berry Her role in this movie was not major, but displayed her overall talent enough in the film She later moved to entertainment television, starring and co-producing certain episodes of the show Living Single.\n\n\nLiving Single\nQueen Latifah was the star of her own sitcom, which followed her character, Khadijah James, and three of her black, female friends This sitcom that aired for three years aimed to highlight the Black American experience by demonstrating Black excellence [117] Latifah's character is described to embody what black womanhood was in the early nineties Her character was well rounded and represented the idea of a ‘girl boss’ was With this all black cast, the possibilities for characters to be presented in a variety of ways were endless Some characters, such as Maxine Shaw, played by Erika Alexander, were depicted as lawyers, while others were depicted as wealthy, such as Regine Hunter, played by Kim Fields Khadijah was everything from a business owner, to a songwriter, to a friend, all while maintaining the lead role in the show Depth and duality behind black characters on sitcoms within the nineties was not very common outside of Black Entertainment Television (BET), so it was quite significant to television when Queen Latifiah took on such an important role With the help of Queen Latifah, Yvette Lee Bowser, the executive producer and creator, was actively changing the perception of Black Americans, painting a new light on the Black experience [117]  \n\n\nEarly influence of sexuality in entertainment (before the 2000s)\nQueen Latifah's sexuality has always come into question through her on-screen performances In one of her films, 1996's Set It Off, she takes on a more masculine role Cleopatra Sims (Cleo), Latifah's character, can be described as a butch, lesbian bank robber, which highlighted her sexuality [118] She was so successful while playing this masculine role, that rumors about her sexuality started spreading [118] In the early stages of her career, Latifah chose not to address the rumors regarding her sexuality, letting the public categorize her in their own way Queen Latifah's ambiguity played to her strengths when acting, allowing her to have versatile roles and not become constrained to certain acting roles because of her off screen sexuality [118] This can be identified in many of her later films in her career, playing a range of either oversexualized characters or sexually muted characters The distance Queen Latifah created from assumptions about her sexuality in her early career excluded her from any queer discourse throughout the nineties [119] Her involvement in offhanded politics and pro-black work productions helped define her work, while her sexuality did not affect her work, early on [119]\n\n\nAccolades\nQueen Latifah became the first female hip-hop recording artist to get nominated for an Oscar In 2003, Queen Latifah was awarded Artist of the Year by Harvard Foundation [120] In 2006, Latifah became the first hip-hop artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, [121] and was also inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2011 [122] In her music career, Queen Latifah has sold nearly 2 million albums in the US [123] [124] The Root ranked her at number

University [127] In 2019, Harvard University awarded the W E B Du Bois Medal to Queen Latifah for cultural contributions [128] In 2023, Queen Latifah's debut album All Hail the Queen, was added into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry, making it the earliest female rap recording to enter the National Recording Registry, [129] and made her the second female hip-hop recording artist to have her music included after Lauryn Hill; [130] [131] however some outlets incorrectly reported her as the first to accomplish the feat [132] [133]\n\n\nDiscography\nStudio

changing the narrative The lyrics of the songs produced by several of these women related to sexual liberation, female autonomy, and sexual domination [115] Language in hip hop was changed through female artists, reclaiming derogatory words that are used against women and incorporating them within their music.\n\n\nFlavor Unit Records\nLatifah also founded a production company, which was referred to as Flavor Unit Records, eventually Flavor Unit Entertainment, co-launching it in 1995 with her business partner Shakim Compere [116] Near the creation of this label, she helped several artists create their music, such as Daddy D Daddy D was Latifah's first artist to create a single with Her purpose was to create a multimedia company that operates at full service Several music artists at the time wanted to join Queen Latifah's label because they easily identified her success, from an artist herself, to a self made label chief [116] The label remained quite small in the nineties, but eventually gained traction as Queen Latifah gained more attention While her record label helped several artists start up their career, she remained at Motown Records for her own benefit [116]\n\n\nPortrayal of characters\nQueen Latifah expanded her career from music, branching out to acting, as well as producing Her first role that she took on was in the movie Jungle Fever, which was released in 1991, where she performed among several significant black actors, such as Samuel L Jackson and Halle Berry Her role in this movie was not major, but displayed her overall talent enough in the film She later moved to entertainment television, starring and co-producing certain episodes of the show Living Single.\n\n\nLiving Single\nQueen Latifah was the star of her own sitcom, which followed her character, Khadijah James, and three of her black, female friends This sitcom that aired for three years aimed to highlight the Black American experience by demonstrating Black excellence [117] Latifah's character is described to embody what black womanhood was in the early nineties Her character was well rounded and represented the idea of a ‘girl boss’ was With this all black cast, the possibilities for characters to be presented in a variety of ways were endless Some characters, such as Maxine Shaw, played by Erika Alexander, were depicted as lawyers, while others were depicted as wealthy, such as Regine Hunter, played by Kim Fields Khadijah was everything from a business owner, to a songwriter, to a friend, all while maintaining the lead role in the show Depth and duality behind black characters on sitcoms within the nineties was not very common outside of Black Entertainment Television (BET), so it was quite significant to television when Queen Latifiah took on such an important role With the help of Queen Latifah, Yvette Lee Bowser, the executive producer and creator, was actively changing the perception of Black Americans, painting a new light on the Black experience [117]  \n\n\nEarly influence of sexuality in entertainment (before the 2000s)\nQueen Latifah's sexuality has always come into question through her on-screen performances In one of her films, 1996's Set It Off, she takes on a more masculine role Cleopatra Sims (Cleo), Latifah's character, can be described as a butch, lesbian bank robber, which highlighted her sexuality [118] She was so successful while playing this masculine role, that rumors about her sexuality started spreading [118] In the early stages of her career, Latifah chose not to address the rumors regarding her sexuality, letting the public categorize her in their own way Queen Latifah's ambiguity played to her strengths when acting, allowing her to have versatile roles and not become constrained to certain acting roles because of her off screen sexuality [118] This can be identified in many of her later films in her career, playing a range of either oversexualized characters or sexually muted characters The distance Queen Latifah created from assumptions about her sexuality in her early career excluded her from any queer discourse throughout the nineties [119] Her involvement in offhanded politics and pro-black work productions helped define her work, while her sexuality did not affect her work, early on [119]\n\n\nAccolades\nQueen Latifah became the first female hip-hop recording artist to get nominated for an Oscar In 2003, Queen Latifah was awarded Artist of the Year by Harvard Foundation [120] In 2006, Latifah became the first hip-hop artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, [121] and was also inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2011 [122] In her music career, Queen Latifah has sold nearly 2 million albums in the US [123] [124] The Root ranked her at number 35 on The Root 100 list [125] In 2017, American Black Film Festival honored Latifah with the Entertainment Icon award [126] In 2018, she received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts Degree by the Rutgers University [127] In 2019, Harvard University awarded the W E B Du Bois Medal to Queen Latifah for cultural contributions [128] In 2023, Queen Latifah's debut album All Hail the Queen, was added into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry, making it the earliest female rap recording to enter the National Recording Registry, [129] and made her the second female hip-hop recording artist to have her music included after Lauryn Hill; [130] [131] however some outlets incorrectly reported her as the first to accomplish the feat [132] [133]\n\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\n\nTours\nLatifah, Jill Scott and Erykah Badu joined to create and own the rights to the Sugar Water Festival Tour, LLC All three singers toured together while inviting music duo Floetry in 2005 and singer Kelis in 2006 as opening acts Comedian/actress Mo'Nique served as host for the 2006 Sugar Water Tour.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nMusic

technical resources In 2006, STR used a chassis based on the 2005 Red Bull Racing Red Bull RB1 chassis, originally designed by Jaguar Racing, and Minardi's contracted supply of rev-limited V10 Cosworth engines It was widely speculated that the 2007 chassis for both teams would be essentially the same Adrian Newey design, although Red Bull was careful to announce that the \"STR2 will be built by Red Bull Technology, and Toro Rosso will fully own the intellectual rights of the car\" [123] Formula One teams are not allowed to use another team's chassis STR has been used as a 'B' team for Red Bull Racing, allowing the company to work with more drivers As of the 2010 season this arrangement was outlawed, and the STR5 is the first Toro Rosso car designed and built in-house [124] In 2006, Red Bull Racing driver Vitantonio Liuzzi was given a full-time seat with STR alongside another Red Bull sponsored driver, Scott Speed Liuzzi retained his seat in STR for the 2007 season Sebastian Vettel replaced Speed in the middle of the 2007 season, and Sébastien Bourdais replaced Liuzzi at STR for the 2008 season Against expectation, Toro Rosso performed well during the 2008 season and Sebastian Vettel won the 2008 Italian Grand Prix This meant that STR took their first win before Red Bull Racing, and helped to secure Vettel a drive with Red Bull Racing for 2009 when he also took that team's first win.\n\n\nRacing record\nAs a constructor, Red Bull Racing have achieved the following statistics:\n\n\nDrivers' Champions\nThe following drivers won the Formula One

attention after his death during a police encounter in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, 2020. The incident sparked widespread protests and civil unrest across the United States and internationally, leading to calls for police reform and an end to systemic racism.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nGeorge Floyd was born on October 14, 1973, in Fayetteville, North Carolina, to George Perry Floyd Sr. and Larcenia \"Cissy\" Jones Floyd. He was the oldest of five siblings. Floyd's family moved to Houston, Texas, when he was a child, where he grew up in the Third Ward. He attended the Houston Independent School District, but did not graduate from high school. Instead, he dropped out to pursue a career in music.\n\n**Adult Life**\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Floyd became an automotive customizer and played club basketball. He also began performing as a rapper, using the stage name Big Floyd in the hip-hop group Screwed Up Click. The New York Times described his deep-voiced rhymes as \"purposeful,\" delivered in a slow-motion clip about \"'choppin' blades'\" – driving cars with oversize rims – and his Third Ward pride. Floyd was also involved with the rap group Presidential Playas, and worked on their album Block Party, released in 2000.\n\n**Post-College**\n\nAfter returning to Houston from college in Kingsville, Texas, in 1995, Floyd became more involved in the music industry. He continued to perform as a rapper and worked with various artists. However, his life took a different turn when he became involved in criminal activities. Between 1997 and 2005, Floyd served eight jail terms on various charges, including drug possession, theft, and trespass.\n\n**Criminal Convictions**\n\nFloyd's criminal convictions were largely due to his association with the wrong crowd and his involvement in the drug trade. In 2004, he was convicted of possessing half a gram of crack cocaine based on the sole testimony of police officer Gerald Goines. Later, in 2019, Goines' involvement in the Harding Street raid led to Goines being investigated for a pattern of falsifying evidence. As a result, in April 2021, the district attorney of Harris County, Texas, requested a posthumous pardon for this particular conviction of Floyd's because of Goines' lack of credibility.\n\n**Post-Prison Life**\n\nAfter his release from prison, Floyd became more involved with Resurrection Houston, a Christian church and ministry.

Floyd also delivered meals to senior citizens and volunteered with other projects, such as the Angel By Nature Foundation, a charity founded by rapper Trae tha Truth. He later became involved with a ministry that brought men from the Third Ward to Minnesota in a church-work program with drug rehabilitation and job placement services.\n\n**Murder**\n\nOn May 25, 2020, police were called by a Cup Foods grocery store employee, who suspected that Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 bill. Floyd was sitting in a car with two other passengers. Police officers forcibly removed him from the car and handcuffed him. The incident was caught on camera, and the video showed Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, with his knee on Floyd's neck for approximately 9 minutes and 29 seconds. Floyd became unresponsive, and despite attempts to revive him, he was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nAfter Floyd's murder, there were global protests and riots against the use of excessive force by police officers against black suspects and a lack of police accountability. Protests began in Minneapolis the day after Floyd's murder and developed in cities throughout all 50 U.S states and internationally.

The Staircase is known for its intricate and complex structure, featuring a series of ascending and descending arpeggios that evoke the image of a staircase.\n\nIn the 19th century, The Staircase became a popular theme in classical music, with composers such as Chopin and Liszt incorporating it into their works. The piece has also been adapted and arranged for various ensembles, including orchestras and chamber groups. Today, The Staircase remains a beloved and recognizable theme in classical music, evoking a sense of grandeur and elegance.\n\n**Theater, film, and television**\n\nThe Staircase is also a title that has been used in various forms of theater, film, and television. One notable example is a 2012 documentary series of the same name, directed by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade.

The documentary explores the intricacies of the case, featuring interviews with Peterson and his family, as well as the detectives and prosecutors involved in the investigation.\n\nThe series, which consists of 13 episodes, provides a detailed and nuanced portrayal of the trial and its aftermath. The Staircase has received critical acclaim for its thoughtful and thorough examination of the case, as well as its insightful exploration of the American justice system. The series has also been praised for its thoughtful and empathetic portrayal of the characters involved, particularly Peterson and his family.\n\nIn addition to the documentary series, The Staircase has also been used as a title for various plays, films, and television shows. These works often explore themes of justice, morality, and the human condition, using the staircase as a metaphor for the complexities and challenges of human life.\n\n**Places**\n\nThe Staircase is also a term that has been used to describe various physical locations. One notable example is the Staircase House, a historic home located in Durham, North Carolina. The house was built in the late 19th century and features a distinctive staircase that has become a popular tourist attraction.\n\nThe Staircase House is a rare example of a well-preserved Victorian-era home in the United States. The house has been lovingly restored and maintained by its current owners, who offer tours and events throughout the year. Visitors to the house can explore its opulent interior, including the grand staircase that has become a hallmark of the property.\n\nIn addition to the Staircase House, The Staircase has also been used to describe various other physical locations, including buildings, landmarks, and public spaces. These locations often feature distinctive staircases or other architectural elements that have become iconic or culturally significant.\n\n**Other uses**\n\nThe Staircase is a term that has also been used in various other contexts, including business, education, and technology.

Over the next several months, Foster returned to the kelp forest, eager to see Ali again and learn more about this fascinating creature.\n\n## Foster's Connection with Ali\n\nAs Foster spent more time with Ali, he began to develop a deep connection with the octopus. He observed Ali's behavior, learning about its complex social structure, problem-solving abilities, and even its unique communication methods. Foster's relationship with Ali was not just about observing the octopus, but also about forming a bond with it.\n\n## The Story of the Film\n\nMy Octopus Teacher is not just a documentary about an octopus; it is also a story about the human experience. Foster's journey with Ali is a metaphor for the human desire for connection and understanding. Through his experiences with the octopus, Foster comes to realize the importance of empathy, compassion, and respect for the natural world.\n\n**Production**\n\n## Partnerships and Funding\n\nMy Octopus Teacher was produced in partnership with Sea Change Project, Off The Fence, and ZDF Enterprises. The film was executively produced by Ellen Windemuth, a renowned producer who has worked on several high-profile documentaries.\n\n## Cinematography\n\nThe cinematography for the film was directed by underwater cameraman Roger Horrocks. Horrocks worked closely with Foster to capture the stunning footage of the kelp forest and the octopus. The film also features footage from Foster himself, who came up with the idea for the documentary.\n\n## Previous Work on Blue Planet II\n\nInterestingly, a smaller amount of underwater footage from the same location and pairing (Foster and Horrocks) had been shown previously on Blue Planet II, episode 5. The film's use of previously shot footage adds to the authenticity and credibility of the documentary.\n\n**Reception and Legacy**\n\n## Release and Distribution\n\nMy Octopus Teacher was released on 7 September 2020 on Netflix, a global streaming platform with millions of subscribers. The film's release was met with widespread critical acclaim and enthusiasm from audiences.\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe film received several accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2021. The film's success can be attributed to its unique storytelling, stunning cinematography, and the inspiring story of Craig Foster and his unlikely friendship with Ali the octopus.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **The Octopus: A Study in Intelligence**, by Marta F.

He was born on November 14, 1975, in Fontana, California, and began his musical career at a young age.\n\n# Early Life and Education\n\nBarker was born in Fontana, California, on November 14, 1975. When he was four, his mother gave him his first drum kit, which was the only one he would have until he was 15. Barker began taking drum lessons at age five with a drummer named Michael Mai, who would expose young Barker to many different playing styles. At this time, he also began taking trumpet lessons. In junior high, Barker learned to play the piano and briefly tried singing, joining the madrigals men and women's choir. In addition, Barker had non-musical aspirations; he also was interested in becoming a professional surfer and skateboarder. However, Barker states that \"I always migrated back to drums, though. That was the one direction that kind of felt like I was connected to and I could kind of understand. I could express myself better through my drums than I could anything else.\"\n\n# Career\n\nAfter graduating from Fontana High School, Barker worked as a trash man in Laguna Beach and played with the punk rock band Snot and Feeble, a Fontana-based band where he met Chad Larson. Larson went on to co-found the ska punk group the Aquabats in 1994. After local shows and demo tapes, the band recruited Barker through Larson's connection. Barker, who was \"sleeping on [his] friend's couch\" and still working as a trash man, only intended to fill in for a few days but ended up joining the band. The group then went into the studio with veteran producer Jim Goodwin to record The Fury of the Aquabats! Barker's speed and accuracy meant that once his parts were recorded, he was free to head off and rehearse (and sit in with other bands). He had picked up a nickname with the Aquabats—Baron Von Tito—the reasons for which are lost to history as none of the members recall why.\n\n# Musical Beginnings (1993-1998)\n\nAfter graduating from Fontana High School, Barker worked as a trash man in Laguna Beach and played with the punk rock band Snot and Feeble, a Fontana-based band where he met Chad Larson.

He had picked up a nickname with the Aquabats—Baron Von Tito—the reasons for which are lost to history as none of the members recall why.\n\n# Mainstream Success (1999-2004)\n\nBarker's first album with Blink—Enema of the State—was released in June 1999 and catapulted the trio to stardom, becoming the biggest pop punk band of the era. Three singles were released from the record—\"What's My Age Again?\", \"All the Small Things\", and \"Adam's Song\"—that crossed over into Top 40 radio format and experienced major commercial success. \"All the Small Things\" became a number-one hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, but also became a crossover hit and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Its video parodied boy bands and pop music videos and won a Moon Man for Best Group Video at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. The album has sold over 15 million copies worldwide and had a considerable effect on pop punk music.\n\n# Reality Television Star and Collaborations (2005-2008)\n\nAfter a Nightmare Before Christmas-inspired wedding in October 2004, Barker starred in the MTV reality series Meet the Barkers with wife Shanna Moakler. The series followed Barker and his new family through his daily life, including Blink-182's final tour and the new Transplants album. The new Transplants album, Haunted Cities (2005), was completed in the aftermath of the Blink-182 \"hiatus\" and released in mid-2005. Meanwhile, Hoppus and Barker continued recording music together and began working on electronic demos, which they called +44. Barker began another new project in 2005 called Expensive Taste, featuring Paul Wall and Skinhead Rob—the project would be more traditionally hip-hop. Barker also turned his direction to producing, working with artists such as Bun B and T.I. The +44 project came to a turning point when Hoppus and Barker purchased their own studio in October 2005, named Opra Music. When Your Heart Stops Beating, the debut of +44, was greeted by less-than-stellar reviews and little commercial success.\n\n# Solo Album and Reunions (Since 2009)\n\nBarker's accident led to a Blink-182 reunion, with the group announcing their return at the February 2009 Grammy Awards. Barker continued to produce remixes throughout 2009, including a remix of \"3 a.m.\" by Eminem; he also collaborated with Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash. In the midst of the band's reunion tour in August 2009, DJ AM was found dead by a friend in his New York apartment. Though Goldstein had been prescribed medication for pain following the crash, the medical examiner reported that he died from \"acute intoxication\" listing several prescription drugs and cocaine.\n\n# Influences and Favorite Drummers\n\nBarker told CBS Local that his first ever hero was Animal from The Muppets, crediting the character as his inspiration to pursue drumming; Barker would eventually play along with Animal and Dr Teeth and the Electric Mayhem on a 2012 episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! He also cites John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, Alex Van Halen of Van Halen, Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe, and Danny Carey of Tool as his favorite drummers. In a 2016 Q&A with Vevo, Barker credited Buddy Rich as the greatest drummer of all time. He also stated that Van Halen's \"Jump\" was the first song he learned on the drums.\n\n# Personal Life\n\nBarker's first marriage, to Melissa Kennedy, lasted nine months until he filed for divorce in August 2002. He later married actress and Miss USA 1995 first runner-up titleholder, Shanna Moakler, on October 30, 2004. The couple had a The Nightmare Before Christmas goth-style ceremony held on the eve of Halloween. Barker and Moakler have two children together, a son born in 2003, and a daughter born in 2005. Barker also remains extremely close with his former stepdaughter Atiana, Moakler's daughter with ex-fiancé, boxer Oscar De La Hoya; who appears regularly on The Kardashians where she is referred to as Barker's “daughter.”\n\n# Plane Crash (2008)\n\nOn September 19, 2008, Barker was involved in a near-fatal plane crash in Columbia, South Carolina. Barker was a passenger on a Learjet 60 that was attempting to take off from Columbia Metropolitan Airport when it crashed. The plane crashed on the runway, and Barker's legs were severely burned. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he underwent surgery for his injuries. Barker's injuries were so severe that he had to undergo skin grafts and was hospitalized for several weeks. Barker has since spoken publicly about the incident, crediting his survival to the bravery of the pilot and the medical staff who treated him.\n\n# Film, Television, and Video Games\n\nBarker has appeared in numerous films and television shows, including his own reality show, Meet the Barkers, which debuted in 2005. He is also known for his appearances in the films American Pie and Punk'd. In addition, Barker has made appearances on various television shows, including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In 2012, Barker appeared in a commercial for the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops II.\n\n# Discography\n\n* The Fury of the Aquabats!

He has established himself as a talented and versatile actor, known for his nuanced performances in a wide range of films and television series.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nDev Patel was born to Anita Patel, a care worker, and Raju Patel, an IT consultant. His parents are Gujaratis, although they were both born in Nairobi in British Kenya, where there is a significant Indian diaspora. They immigrated to the United Kingdom separately in their teens and first met in London. Patel was raised in the Hindu faith and speaks some Gujarati. His ancestors came from Jamnagar and Unjha in the Indian state of Gujarat.\n\nPatel's early life was marked by a strong interest in acting, which was encouraged by his parents. He attended the Rutherford School in Ealing, where he was an average student, but his grades were not his primary focus. Instead, he spent most of his time acting in school plays and productions.\n\n**Career**\n\nPatel's professional acting career began in 2006, when he auditioned for the E4 teen drama television series Skins. His mother saw the casting advertisement in Metro and took him to the audition, even though he had a science exam the next day. After two auditions, he was cast in the role of Anwar Kharral, a British Pakistani Muslim teenager. The characterisation of Anwar was partly based on Patel's own personality, as the role was developed specifically for him once he was cast in Skins.\n\nPatel's performance in Skins earned him critical acclaim and recognition within the industry. He went on to appear in several other television series and films, including The Last Enemy and The Road to Guantanamo.\n\n**2006–2007: Early Work**\n\nPatel's early work in television and film was marked by a range of small and supporting roles. He appeared in the television series The Last Enemy, playing the role of a young boy, and in the film The Road to Guantanamo, playing the role of a detainee at the Guantanamo Bay detention center.\n\nIn 2007, Patel appeared in the television series End of the Line, playing the role of a young boy who becomes embroiled in a mystery surrounding a group of teenagers. He also appeared in the film The Other Boleyn Girl, playing the role of a young servant.\n\n**2008–2010: Career Breakthrough**\n\nPatel's breakthrough role came in 2008, when he was cast in the role of Jamal Malik in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The film was directed by Danny Boyle and tells the story of a young man who becomes a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and is accused of cheating.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, earning Patel widespread recognition and acclaim. He went on to appear in several other films, including The Last Airbender and The Road to Nowhere.\n\n**2011–2020**\n\nIn 2011, Patel co-starred in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, directed by John Madden. The film was a box office success, grossing over $136 million worldwide. Patel's performance in the film earned him critical acclaim and recognition, and he went on to appear in several other films, including The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Chappie.\n\nIn 2015, Patel appeared in the film The Man Who Knew Infinity, directed by Matt Brown. The film tells the story of the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan, an Indian mathematician who was discovered by a Cambridge University professor.\n\n**2020–present**\n\nIn 2021, Patel starred in The Green Knight, directed by David Lowery. The film is a fantasy adventure that follows the story of Sir Gawain, a young knight who embarks on a quest to find the Green Knight.\n\nPatel has also signed a deal with ShivHans Pictures to produce, develop, and create projects.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPatel began dating his Slumdog Millionaire co-star Freida Pinto in 2009. The couple announced their split in 2014, after nearly six years of dating.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n**Film**\n\n* The Road to Guantanamo (2006)\n* The Other Boleyn Girl (2007)\n* Slumdog Millionaire (2008)\n* The Last Airbender (2010)\n* The Road to Nowhere (2011)\n* The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2012)\n* The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2015)\n* The Man Who Knew Infinity (2015)\n* Chappie (2015)\n* The Green Knight (2021)\n\n**Television**\n\n* Skins (2007-2009)\n* The Last Enemy (2008)\n* End of the Line (2007)\n\n**Video Games**\n\n* Slumdog Millionaire (2009) (video game)\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of British actors\n* List of Indian actors in Hollywood\n* List of Gujarati people\n\n**External links**\n\n* Dev Patel at IMDb\n* Dev Patel on Twitter\n* Dev Patel on Instagram", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dev_Patel\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nDev Patel was born on 23 April 1990 in Harrow, North West London [4] [5] to Indian parents; Anita Patel, a care worker, and Raju Patel, an IT consultant [6] [7] His parents are Gujaratis, [8] though they were both born in Nairobi in British Kenya, where there is a significant Indian diaspora They immigrated to the United Kingdom separately in their teens, and first met in London [6] [9] Patel was raised in the Hindu faith [10] He speaks some Gujarati [11] His ancestors came from Jamnagar and Unjha in the Indian state of Gujarat [12]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 2006, Patel's professional acting career began when he auditioned for the E4 teen drama television series Skins His mother saw the casting advertisement in Metro and took him to the audition, even though he had a science exam the next day [6] [19] After two auditions, he was cast in the role of Anwar Kharral, a British Pakistani Muslim teenager [6] The characterisation of Anwar was partly based on Patel's own personality, as the role was developed specifically for him once he was cast in Skins [20] With no prior professional acting experience, recalled that, on \"the first day of shooting, I didn't really know what to do.\" [6]\n\n\n2006–2007: Early work\nIn 2006, Patel's professional acting career began when he auditioned for the E4 teen drama television series Skins His mother saw the casting advertisement in Metro and took him to the audition, even though he had a science exam the next day [6] [19] After two auditions, he was cast in the role of Anwar Kharral, a British Pakistani Muslim teenager [6] The characterisation of Anwar was partly based on Patel's own personality, as the role was developed specifically for him once he was cast in Skins [20] With no prior professional acting experience, recalled that, on \"the first day of shooting, I didn't really know what to do.\" [6]\n\n\n2008–2010: Career breakthrough\nPatel made his feature film debut when he was cast in the role of Jamal Malik, the central character in Danny Boyle's film Slumdog Millionaire [24] The Jamal Malik character is an Indian Muslim boy born and brought up in the poverty of Bombay, India [25] Boyle considered hundreds of young male actors, but found that Bollywood leads were generally \"strong, handsome hero-types\", not the personality he was looking for [26] Boyle's 17-year-old daughter Caitlin pointed him to Skins [26] [27]\n\n\n2011–2020\nPatel co-starred in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2012), (and subsequently in its 2015 sequel, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) directed by John Madden, which received positive reviews [53] and was a box office success, grossing $136 million [54] For the role, he had to take lessons in perfecting an Indian-English accent [55]\n\n\n2020–present\nIn 2021, Patel starred in The Green Knight, based on Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, directed by David Lowery [67] [68] In April of that year, he signed a deal to \"produce, develop and create projects\" with ShivHans Pictures [69]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPatel began dating his Slumdog Millionaire co-star Freida Pinto in 2009 [80] On 10 December 2014, the couple announced that they had split after nearly six years of dating [81]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Sumerian_language", "content": "\nStages\nThe history of written Sumerian can be divided into several periods: [10] [11] [12] [13]\n\n\nClassification\nSumerian is widely accepted to be a local language isolate [46] [47] [48] [49] Sumerian was at one time widely held to be an Indo-European language, but that view has been almost universally rejected [50] Since its decipherment in the early 20th century, scholars have tried to relate Sumerian to a wide variety of languages Because Sumerian has prestige as the first attested written language, proposals for linguistic affinity sometimes have a nationalistic flavour [51] Attempts have been made to link Sumerian with a range of widely disparate groups such as the Austroasiatic languages, [52] Dravidian languages, [53] Uralic languages such as Hungarian and Finnish, [54] [55] [56] [57] Sino-Tibetan languages [58] and Turkic languages (the last being promoted by Turkish nationalists as part of the Sun language theory [59] [60]) Additionally, long-range proposals have attempted to include Sumerian in broad macrofamilies [61] [62] Such proposals enjoy virtually no support among modern linguists, Sumerologists and Assyriologists and are typically seen as fringe theories [51]\n\n\nWriting system\nPictographic proto-writing was used starting in c 3300 BC It is unclear what underlying language it encoded, if any By c 2800 BC, some tablets began using syllabic elements that clearly indicated a relation to the Sumerian language Around 2600 BC, [67] [68] cuneiform symbols were developed using a wedge-shaped stylus to impress the shapes into wet clay This cuneiform (\"wedge-shaped\") mode of writing co-existed with the proto-cuneiform archaic mode Deimel (1922) lists 870 signs used in the Early Dynastic IIIa period (26th century) In the same period the large set of logographic signs had been simplified into a logosyllabic script comprising several hundred signs Rosengarten (1967) lists 468 signs used in Sumerian (pre-Sargonian) Lagash.\n\n\nDevelopment\nPictographic proto-writing was used starting in c 3300 BC It is unclear what underlying language it encoded, if any By c 2800 BC, some tablets began using syllabic elements that clearly indicated a relation to the Sumerian language Around 2600 BC, [67] [68] cuneiform symbols were developed using a wedge-shaped stylus to impress the shapes into wet clay This cuneiform (\"wedge-shaped\") mode of writing co-existed with the proto-cuneiform archaic mode Deimel (1922) lists 870 signs used in the Early Dynastic IIIa period (26th century) In the same period the large set of logographic signs had been simplified into a logosyllabic script comprising several hundred signs Rosengarten (1967) lists 468 signs used in Sumerian (pre-Sargonian) Lagash.\n\n\nTransliteration\nDepending on the context, a cuneiform sign can be read either as one of several possible logograms, each of which corresponds to a word in the Sumerian spoken language, as a phonetic syllable (V, VC, CV, or CVC), or as a determinative (a marker of semantic category, such as occupation or place) (See the article Cuneiform.) Some Sumerian logograms were written with multiple cuneiform signs These logograms are called diri-spellings, after the logogram 𒋛𒀀 DIRI which is written with the signs 𒋛 SI and 𒀀 A The text transliteration of a tablet will show just the logogram, such as the word dirig, not the separate component signs.\n\n\nHistoriography\nThe key to reading logosyllabic cuneiform came from the Behistun inscription, a trilingual cuneiform inscription written in Old Persian, Elamite and Akkadian (In a similar manner, the key to understanding Egyptian hieroglyphs was the bilingual  [Greek and Egyptian with the Egyptian text in two scripts] Rosetta stone and Jean-François Champollion's transcription in 1822.)\n\n\nPhonology\nAssumed phonological and morphological forms will be between slashes // and curly brackets {}, respectively, with plain text used for the standard Assyriological transcription of Sumerian Most of the following examples are unattested Note also that, not unlike most other pre-modern orthographies, Sumerian cuneiform spelling is highly variable, so the transcriptions and the cuneiform examples will generally show only one or at most a few common graphic forms out of many that may occur Spelling practices have also changed significantly in the course of the history of Sumerian: the examples in the article will use the most phonetically explicit spellings attested, which usually means Old Babylonian or Ur III period spellings except where an authentic example from another period is used.\n\n\nConsonants\nEarly Sumerian is conjectured to have had at least the consonants listed in the table below The consonants in parentheses are reconstructed by some scholars based on indirect evidence; if they existed, they were lost around the Ur III period in the late 3rd millennium BC.\n\n\nVowels\nThe vowels that are clearly distinguished by the cuneiform script are /a/, /e/, /i/, and /u/ Various researchers have posited the existence of more vowel phonemes such as /o/ and even /ɛ/ and /ɔ/, which would have been concealed by the transmission through Akkadian, as that language does not distinguish them [99] [100] That would explain the seeming existence of numerous homophones in transliterated Sumerian, as well as some details of the phenomena mentioned in the next paragraph [101] These hypotheses are not yet generally accepted [87] Phonemic vowel length has also been posited by many scholars based on vowel length in Sumerian loanwords in Akkadian, [102] [103] occasional so-called plene spellings with extra vowel signs, and some internal evidence from alternations [f] [103] [105] However, scholars who believe in the existence of phonemic vowel length do not consider it possible to reconstruct the length of the vowels in most Sumerian words [106] [g]\n\n\nStress\nSumerian stress is usually presumed to have been dynamic, since it seems to have caused vowel elisions on many occasions Opinions vary on its placement As argued by Bram Jagersma [114] and confirmed by other scholars, [115] [116] the adaptation of Akkadian words of Sumerian origin seems to suggest that Sumerian stress tended to be on the last syllable of the word, at least in its citation form The treatment of forms with grammatical morphemes is less clear Many cases of apheresis in forms with enclitics have been interpreted as entailing that the same rule was true of the phonological word on many occasions, i.e that the stress could be shifted onto the enclitics; however, the fact that many of these same enclitics have allomorphs with apocopated final vowels (e.g /‑še/ ~ /-š/) suggests that they were, on the contrary, unstressed when these allomorphs arose [114] It has also been conjectured that the frequent assimilation of the vowels of non-final syllables to the vowel of the final syllable of the word may be due to stress on it [117] However, a number of suffixes and enclitics consisting of /e/ or beginning in /e/ are also assimilated and reduced [118]\n\n\nOrthography\nSumerian writing expressed pronunciation only roughly It was often morphophonemic, so much of the allomorphic variation could be ignored [124] Especially in earlier Sumerian, coda consonants were also often ignored in spelling; e.g /mung̃areš/ 'they put it here' could be written 𒈬𒃻𒌷 mu-g̃ar-re2 The use of VC signs for that purpose, producing more elaborate spellings such as 𒈬𒌦𒃻𒌷𒌍 mu-un-g̃ar-re2-eš3, became more common only in the Neo-Sumerian and especially in the Old Babylonian period [125]\n\n\nGrammar\nEver since its decipherment, research of Sumerian has been made difficult not only by the lack of any native speakers, but also by the relative sparseness of linguistic data, the apparent lack of a closely related language, and the features of the writing system A further oft-mentioned and paradoxical problem for the study of Sumerian is that the most numerous and varied texts written in the most phonetically explicit and precise orthography are only dated to periods when the scribes themselves were no longer native speakers and often demonstrably had less-than-perfect command of the language they were writing in; conversely, for much of the time during which Sumerian was still a living language, the surviving sources are few, unvaried and/or written in an orthography that is more difficult to interpret [135]\n\n\nNominal morphology\nThe Sumerian noun is typically a one or two-syllable root (𒅆 igi \"eye\", 𒂍 e2 \"house, household\", 𒎏 nin \"lady\"), although there are also some roots with three syllables like 𒆠𒇴 šakanka \"market\" There are two semantically predictable grammatical genders, which have traditionally been called animate and inanimate, although these names do not express their membership exactly, as explained below.\n\n\nNoun phrases\nThe Sumerian noun is typically a one or two-syllable root (𒅆 igi \"eye\", 𒂍 e2 \"house, household\", 𒎏 nin \"lady\"), although there are also some roots with three syllables like 𒆠𒇴 šakanka \"market\" There are two semantically predictable grammatical genders, which have traditionally been called animate and inanimate, although these names do not express their membership exactly, as explained below.\n\n\nGender\nThe two genders have been variously called animate and inanimate, [140] [141] [142] [143] human and non-human, [144] [145] or personal/person and impersonal/non-person [146] [147] Their assignment is semantically predictable: the first gender includes humans and gods, while the second one includes animals, plants, non-living objects, abstract concepts, and groups of humans Since the second gender includes animals, the use of the terms animate and inanimate is somewhat misleading [146] and conventional, [141] but it is most common in the literature, so it will be maintained in this article.\n\n\nNumber\nThe plural marker proper is (𒂊)𒉈 /-(e)ne/ [l] It is used only with nouns of the animate gender and its use is optional It is often omitted when other parts of the clause indicate the plurality of the referent [152] Thus, it is not used if the noun is modified by a numeral (𒇽𒁹𒁹𒁹 lu2 eš5 \"three men\") It has also been observed that until the Ur III period, the marker generally isn't used in a noun phrase in the absolutive case, [153] [154] [155] unless this is necessary for disambiguation [154] [155] Instead, the plurality of the absolutive participant is commonly expressed only by the form of the verb in the clause: [155] [153] e.g 𒇽𒁀𒀄𒀄𒌍 lu2 ba-zaḫ3-zaḫ3-eš \"the men ran away\", 𒇽𒈬𒅇𒆪𒁉𒌍 lu2 mu-u3-dab5-be2-eš \"I caught the men\" The plural marker is not used when referring to a group of people, because a group of people is treated as inanimate; e.g 𒀳 engar \"farmer\" with no plural marker may refer to \"(the group of) farmers\" [152]\n\n\nCase\nThe generally recognized case markers are: [165]\n\n\nCase markers\nThe generally recognized case markers are: [165]\n\n\nCase usage\nThe uses of the ergative and absolutive case are those typical of ergative languages The subject of an intransitive verb such as \"come\" is in the same case as the object of a transitive verb such as \"build\", namely the so-called absolutive case In contrast, the subject of a transitive verb has a different case, which is termed ergative This can be illustrated with the following examples:\n\n\nPronouns\nThe attested personal pronouns are:\n\n\nAdjectives\nIt is controversial whether Sumerian has adjectives at all, since nearly all stems with adjectival meaning are also attested as verb stems and may be conjugated as verbs: 𒈤 maḫ \"great\" > 𒎏𒀠𒈤 nin al-maḫ \"the lady is great\" [219] [220] Jagersma believes that there is a distinction in that the few true adjectives cannot be negated, and a few stems are different depending on the part of speech: 𒃲 gal \"big\", but 𒄖𒌌 gu-ul \"be big\" [221] Furthermore, stems with adjective-like meaning sometimes occur with the nominalizing suffix /-a/, but their behaviour varies  in this respect Some stems appear to require the suffix always: e.g 𒆗𒂵 kalag-ga \"mighty\", 𒊷𒂵 sag9-ga \"beautiful\", 𒁍𒁕 gid2-da \"long\" [222] [223] (these are verbs with adjectival meaning according to Jagersma [224]) Some never take the suffix: e.g 𒃲 gal \"big\", 𒌉 tur \"small\" and 𒈤 maḫ \"great\" [225] (these are genuine adjectives according to Jagersma [226]) Finally, some alternate: 𒍣 zid \"right\" often occurs as 𒍣𒁕 zid-da (these are pairs of adjectives and verbs derived from them, respectively, according to Jagersma [227]) In the latter case, attempts have been made to find a difference of meaning between the forms with and without -a; it has been suggested that the form with -a expresses a kind of determination, [228] e.g zid \"righteous, true\" vs zid-da \"right (not left)\", or restrictiveness, e.g 𒂍𒉋 e2 gibil \"a new house\" vs 𒂍𒉋𒆷 e2 gibil-la \"the new house (as contrasted with the old one)\", \"a/the newer (kind of) house\" or \"the newest house\", as well as nominalization, e.g tur-ra \"a/the small one\" or \"a small thing\" [229] Other scholars have remained sceptical about the posited contrasts [230]\n\n\nAdverbs and adverbial expressions\nMost commonly, adverbial meanings are expressed by noun phrases in a certain case, e.g 𒌓 ud-ba \"then\", lit \"at that time\" [232]\n\n\nNumerals\nSumerian has a combination decimal and sexagesimal system (for example, 600 is 'ten sixties'), so that the Sumerian lexical numeral system is sexagesimal with 10 as a subbase [237] The cardinal numerals and ways of forming composite numbers are as follows: [238] [239] [240]\n\n\nVerbal morphology\nThe Sumerian finite verb distinguishes a number of moods and agrees (more or less consistently) with the subject and the object in person, number and gender The verb chain may also incorporate pronominal references to the verb's other modifiers, which has also traditionally been described as \"agreement\", although, in fact, such a reference and the presence of an actual modifier in the clause need not co-occur: not only 𒂍𒂠𒌈𒌈𒅆𒁺𒌦 e2-še3 ib2-ši-du-un \"I'm going to the house\", but also 𒂍𒂠𒉌𒁺𒌦 e2-še3 i3-du-un \"I'm going to the house\" and simply 𒌈𒅆𒁺𒌦 ib2-ši-du-un \"I'm going to it\" are possible [139] [245] [246] Hence, the term \"cross-reference\" instead of \"agreement\" has been proposed This article will predominantly use the term \"agreement\" [247] [248]\n\n\nGeneral\nThe Sumerian finite verb distinguishes a number of moods and agrees (more or less

has been proposed This article will predominantly use the term \"agreement\" [247] [248]\n\n\nModal prefixes\nThe modal prefixes express modality Some of them are generally combined with certain TAs; in other cases, the meaning of a modal prefix can depend on the TA.\n\n\n\"Conjugation prefixes\"\nThe meaning, structure, identity and even the number of the various \"conjugation prefixes\" have always been a subject of disagreements The term \"conjugation prefix\" simply alludes to the fact that a Sumerian finite verb in the indicative mood must (nearly) always contain one of them Which of these prefixes is used seems to have, more often than not, no effect on its translation into European languages [284] Proposed explanations of the choice of conjugation prefix usually revolve around the subtleties of spatial grammar, information structure (focus [285]), verb valency, and, most recently, voice [286] The following description primarily follows the analysis of Jagersma (2010), largely seconded by Zólyomi (2017) and Sallaberger (2023), in its specifics; nonetheless, most of the interpretations in it are held widely, if not universally [287]\n\n\nPronominal and dimensional prefixes\nThe dimensional prefixes of the verb chain basically correspond to, and often repeat, the case markers of the noun phrase Like the case markers of the noun phrase, the first dimensional prefix is normally attached to a preceding \"head\" – a pronominal prefix, which expresses the person, gender and number of its referent [336] The first dimensional prefix may be followed by up to two other dimensional prefixes, [337] but unlike the first one, these prefixes never have an explicit \"head\" and cannot refer to animate nouns [338] The other slot where a pronominal prefix can occur is immediately before the stem, where it can have a different allomorph and expresses the person, gender and absolutive or the ergative participant (the transitive subject, the intransitive subject or the direct object), depending on the TA and other factors, as explained below.\n\n\nPronominal prefixes\nThe forms of the pronominal prefixes are the following: [343]\n\n\nDimensional prefixes\nThe generally recognized dimensional prefixes are shown in the table below; if several occur within the same verb complex, they are placed in the order they are listed in  \n\n\nDifferences and combinations between dimensional prefixes and noun case markers\nWhile the meanings of the prefixes are generally the same as those of the corresponding nominal case markers, there are some differences:\n\n\nUse of the ventive as a 1st person marker\nWhen the dimensional prefix is dative -/a/-, the personal prefix of the 1st person appears to be absent, but the 1st person reference is expressed by the choice of the ventive conjugation prefix /mu/- The sequence that expresses the 1st person dative is then: /mu-/ + /-a-/ → 𒈠 ma- [376] [377] [378] When the intended meaning is that of the directive -/i/~/e/- (\"on me\", \"in contact with me\", etc.), it seems that the ventive conjugation prefix 𒈬 mu- alone serves to express it [376] [377]\n\n\nSyncope of /i/ in -/ni/- and -/bi/-\nTwo special phenomena occur if there is no absolutive–ergative pronominal prefix in the pre-stem position.\n\n\nExpression of the directive by a pre-stem personal prefix\nA superficially very similar, but distinct phenomenon is that if there isn't already an absolutive–ergative pronominal prefix in pre-stem position, the personal prefix of the directive participant does not receive the dimensional prefix -/i/~/e/- at all and is moved to the pre-stem position For example, the normal position of the directive participant is seen in:\n\n\nAbsence of {-b-}\nIn some cases, the 3rd person inanimate prefix -b- appears to be unexpectedly absent.\n\n\nPronominal suffixes\nThe pronominal suffixes are as follows:\n\n\nPronominal agreement with subjects and direct objects\nSumerian verbal agreement follows a nominative–accusative pattern in the 1st and 2nd persons of the marû tense-aspect, but an ergative–absolutive pattern in most other forms of the indicative mood Because of this presence of both patterns, Sumerian is considered a language with split ergativity [388] The general principle is that in the ḫamṭu TA, the transitive subject is expressed by the prefix, and the direct object by the suffix, and in the marû TA it is the other way round For example, {i-b-dab-en} can be a ḫamṭu form meaning \"it caught me\", where {-b-} expresses the subject \"it\" and {-en} expresses the object \"I\" However, it can also be a marû form meaning \"I will catch it\", where {-en} expresses the subject \"I\" and {-b-} expresses the object \"it\" As for the intransitive subject, it is expressed, in both TAs, by the suffixes For example, {i-kaš-en} is \"I ran\", and {i-kaš-ed-en} can be \"I will run\" This means that the intransitive subject is treated like the object in ḫamṭu (which makes the ḫamṭu pattern ergative) and like the subject in marû (which makes the marû pattern nominative-accusative).\n\n\nStem\nThe verbal stem itself can also express grammatical distinctions within the categories number and tense-aspect In a number of verbs, this involves suppletion or morphonological alternations that are not fully predictable.\n\n\nThe modal or imperfective suffix -/ed/\nBefore the pronominal suffixes, a suffix -/ed/ or -/d/ can be inserted (the /d/ is only realized if other vowels follow, in which case the /e/ in turn may be elided): e.g 𒉌𒀄(𒂊)𒉈𒂗 i3-zaḫ3(-e)-de3-en {i-zaḫ-ed-en} \"I will/must escape\", 𒉌𒀄𒂊 i3-zaḫ3-e {i-zaḫ-ed} \"he will/must escape\" This suffix is considered to account for occurrences of -e in the third-person singular marû of intransitive forms by those who do not accept the theory that -e itself is a marû stem formant [417]\n\n\nUse of the tense-aspect forms\nJagersma systematizes the use of the tense-aspect forms in the following patterns: [425]\n\n\nThe imperative mood\nThe imperative mood construction is produced with a ḫamṭu stem, but using the marû agreement pattern, by turning all prefixes into suffixes [432] In the plural, the second person plural ending is attached in a form that differs slightly from the indicative: it is /-(n)zen/, with the -/n/- appearing only after vowels The stem is singular even in the plural imperative [433] Compare the following indicative-imperative pairs: \n\n\nParticiples\nSumerian participles can function both as verbal adjectives and as verbal nouns As verbal adjectives, they can describe any participant involved in the action or state expressed by the verb: for instance, 𒋧𒈠 šum2-ma may mean either \"(which was) given (to someone)\", \"who was given (something)\" or \"who gave\" [438] As verbal nouns, they denote the action or state itself, so 𒋧𒈠 šum2-ma may also mean  '(the act of) giving' or 'the fact that X gave Y' [438] Participles are formed in the following ways:\n\n\nCopula verb\nThe copula verb /me/ \"to be\" is mostly used in an enclitic form Its conjugation is as follows: \n\n\nPassive voice\nSome scholars believe that it is possible to speak of a passive voice in Sumerian Jagersma (2010) distinguishes three attested passive constructions [455] In each case, the ergative participant and the corresponding agreement marker on the verb are removed, so that the verb is inflected intransitively, but there may also be some additional cues to ensure a passive interpretation The passive may be formed:\n\n\nCausative construction\nSumerian doesn't have dedicated causative morphology Causativity is expressed syntactically in two ways, depending on the transitivity of the verb.\n\n\nPhrasal verbs\nA specific problem of Sumerian syntax is posed by the numerous phrasal verbs (traditionally called \"compound verbs\" in Sumerology in spite of the fact that they are not compounds, but idiomatic combinations [469]) They usually involve a noun immediately before the verb, forming a lexical/idiomatic unit: [470] e.g 𒅆...𒂃 igi ...du8, lit \"open the eye\" = \"see, look\" Their case government and agreement patterns vary depending on the specific verb [471] [364] [cc] The component noun is usually in the absolutive case, but may be in the directive If the phrasal verb takes another noun as a \"logical object\", the verbal infix is typically the directive, while the noun case is most commonly either the directive (dative if animate), which otherwise has the meaning \"at / with respect to\", or the locative (dative if animate), which otherwise has the meaning \"on\":\n\n\nSyntax\nThe basic word order is subject–object–verb; verb finality is only violated in rare instances, in poetry The moving of a constituent towards the beginning of the phrase may be a way to highlight it, [485] as may the addition of the copula to it Modifiers (adjectives, genitive phrases etc.) are normally placed after the noun: 𒂍𒉋 e2 gibil \"a new house\" 𒂍𒈗𒆷 e2 lugal-la \"the house of the owner\" However, the so-called anticipatory genitive (𒂍𒀀𒈗𒉈 e2-a lugal-bi \"the owner of the house\", lit \"of the house, its owner\") is common and may signal the possessor's topicality [485] There are no adpositions, but noun phrases in a certain case may resemble prepositions and have a similar function: [486]\n\n\nGeneral features\nThe basic word order is subject–object–verb; verb finality is only violated in rare instances, in poetry The moving of a constituent towards the beginning of the phrase may be a way to highlight it, [485] as may the addition of the copula to it Modifiers (adjectives, genitive phrases etc.) are normally placed after the noun: 𒂍𒉋 e2 gibil \"a new house\" 𒂍𒈗𒆷 e2

possessor's topicality [485] There are no adpositions, but noun phrases in a certain case may resemble prepositions and have a similar function: [486]\n\n\nSubordinate clauses\nThere are various ways to express subordination Many of them include the nominalization of a finite verb with the suffix -/a/, which is also used to form participles, as shown above Like the participles, this nominalized clause can either modify a noun, as adjectives do, or refer to the event itself, as nouns do It usually functions as a relative clause, corresponding to an English clause with \"which ...\" or \"who ...\", as in the following example:\n\n\nCoordination\nCoordinating conjunctions are rarely used The most common way to express the sense of \"and\" is by simple juxtaposition Nominal phrases may be conjoined, perhaps emphatically, by adding 𒁉 -bi to the second one: 𒀭𒂗𒆤𒀭𒎏𒆤𒉌 en-lil2 nin-lil2-bi \"both Enlil and Ninlil\"; sometimes the enclitic is further reinforced by 𒁕 -da \"with\" More surprisingly, 𒋫 -ta \"from\" is also sometimes used in the sense of \"and\" [502] The word 𒅇 u3 \"and\" was borrowed from Akkadian in the Old Akkadian period and occurs mostly in relatively colloquial texts; [503] Old Babylonian Sumerian also borrowed from Akkadian the enclitic 𒈠 -ma \"and\" [504] There is no conjunction \"or\" and its sense can also be expressed by simple juxtaposition; a more explicit and emphatic alternative is the repetition of 𒃶𒅎 ḫe2-em, \"let it be\": 𒇻𒃶𒅎𒈧𒃶𒅎 udu ḫe2-em maš ḫe2-em  \"(be it) a sheep or a goat\" [505]\n\n\nOther issues\nA quotative particle -/(e)še/ or -/ši/ \"saying\", variously spelt 𒂠 -eše2, 𒅆 -ši or 𒀪𒊺 -e-še, has been identified [506] Its use is not obligatory and it is attested only or almost only in texts from the Old Babylonian period or later [507] Another, rarely attested, particle, 𒄑(𒊺)𒂗 -g̃eš(-še)-en, apparently expresses irrealis modality: \"were it that ...\" [508]\n\n\nWord formation\nDerivation by affixation is largely non-existent [514] [515] An exception may be a few nouns ending in -/u/ denoting the object of a corresponding verb: 𒊬𒊒 sar-ru \"document\" < 𒊬 sar \"write\" [516] Compounding, on the other hand, is common in nouns Compounds are normally left-headed The dependent may be:\n\n\nDialects\nThe standard variety of Sumerian was Emegir (𒅴𒂠: eme-gir15) A notable variety or sociolect was Emesal (𒅴𒊩: eme-sal), possibly to be interpreted as \"fine tongue\" or \"high-pitched voice\" [524] Other apparent terms for registers or dialects were eme-galam \"high tongue\", eme-si-sa2 \"straight tongue\", eme-te-na2 \"oblique [?] tongue\", [525] emesukudda, emesuha, emesidi [526] [527] and emeku [528] Recently, a regional differentiation into a Northern and a Southern Sumerian dialect area has been posited [3]\n\n\nEmesal\nEmesal is used exclusively by female characters in some literary texts In addition, it is dominant in certain genres of cult songs such as the hymns sung by Gala priests [529] [530] [531] It has been argued that it might have been a female language variety of the kind that exists or has existed in some cultures, such as among the Chukchis and the Garifuna Alternatively, it has been contended that it must have been originally a regional dialect, since instances of apparent Emesal-like forms are attested in the area of late 3rd millennium Lagash, [532] and some loanwords into Akkadian appear to come from Emesal rather than Emegir [533] Apart from such isolated glosses, Emesal is first attested in writing in the early Old Babylonian period [534] It is typically written with syllable signs rather than logograms A text is often not written consistently in Emesal, but contains apparent Emegir forms as well.\n\n\nSouthern and Northern Sumerian\nBram Jagersma [538] and Gábor Zólyomi [539] distinguish two regional dialects of Sumerian: the Southern Sumerian dialect of Lagash, Umma, Ur and Uruk, which eventually formed the basis for the common standard of the Neo-Sumerian (Ur III) period, and the Northern Sumerian dialect as seen in texts from Nippur, Adab, Isin and Shuruppak (although eventually texts in the standard variety begin to be produced in that area as well) The differences that he finds between the two varieties are:\n\n\nOld Babylonian Sumerian\nThe dominant Sumerian variety of the Old Babylonian period, in turn, reflected a different regional dialect from the standard Neo-Sumerian of the Ur III period:\n\n\nInterference from Akkadian and other late phenomena\nIn the Old Babylonian period and after it, the Sumerian used by scribes was influenced by their mother tongue, Akkadian, and sometimes more generally by imperfect acquisition of the language As a result, various deviations from its original structure occur in texts or copies of texts from these times The following effects have been found in the Old Babylonian period: [23]\n\n\nSyllabary\nThe table below shows signs used for simple syllables of the form CV or VC As

Sumer, which is now modern-day southern Iraq. It is one of the earliest known languages and was the first language to be written, with a written record dating back to around 3200 BC.\n\n# Stages\n\nThe history of written Sumerian can be divided into several periods:\n\n## Early Dynastic Period\n\nDuring this period, Sumerian was the dominant language of the region, and it was used for both literary and administrative purposes. The earliest known Sumerian texts date back to around 3200 BC, during the Protoliterate period.\n\n## Akkadian Period\n\nDuring the Akkadian period, Sumerian continued to be used as a literary language, but it was gradually replaced by Akkadian as the language of government and commerce.\n\n## Old Babylonian Period\n\nDuring the Old Babylonian period, Sumerian was used as a literary language, and it was also used for liturgical and ceremonial purposes.\n\n## Neo-Sumerian Period\n\nDuring the Neo-Sumerian period, Sumerian was used as a literary language, and it was also used for administrative purposes.\n\n# Classification\n\nSumerian is widely accepted to be a language isolate, meaning that it does not belong to any known language family. It has been proposed that Sumerian may be related to other languages, such as the Austroasiatic, Dravidian, Uralic, and Sino-Tibetan languages, but these proposals are not widely accepted.\n\n# Writing System\n\nThe Sumerian writing system was a complex system of logograms and phonograms that was used to write the Sumerian language. The earliest known Sumerian texts date back to around 3200 BC, and they were written in a pictographic script. Over time, the script evolved into a more complex system of logograms and phonograms.\n\n## Pictographic Proto-Writing\n\nThe earliest known Sumerian texts date back to around 3200 BC, and they were written in a pictographic script. This script was used to represent objects and ideas, rather than words or sounds.\n\n## Cuneiform\n\nAround 2800 BC, the Sumerian writing system evolved into a more complex system of logograms and phonograms. This system, known as cuneiform, was used to write the Sumerian language for over 3,000 years.\n\n## Cuneiform Symbols\n\nCuneiform symbols were used to represent a wide range of concepts, including objects, ideas, and sounds. The symbols were written in a wedge-shaped style, using a reed stylus to impress the shapes into wet clay.\n\n## Logographic Signs\n\nLogographic signs were used to represent objects and concepts, rather than sounds. These signs were often used in combination with phonograms to form words.\n\n## Logosyllabic Script\n\nBy around 2600 BC, the large set of logographic signs had been simplified into a logosyllabic script, comprising several hundred signs.\n\n# Phonology\n\nThe Sumerian language had a complex phonology, with a range of consonant and vowel sounds.\n\n## Consonants\n\nEarly Sumerian is conjectured to have had at least the consonants listed in the table below.\n\n## Vowels\n\nThe vowels that are clearly distinguished by the cuneiform script are /a/, /e/, /i/, and /u/. Various researchers have posited the existence of more vowel phonemes, such as /o/ and /ɛ/, but these are not universally accepted.\n\n## Stress\n\nSumerian stress is usually presumed to have been dynamic, meaning that it caused vowel elisions on many occasions. The placement of stress is not universally agreed upon, but it is thought to have been on the last syllable of the word, at least in its citation form.\n\n# Grammar\n\nThe Sumerian language had a complex grammar, with a range of grammatical features.\n\n## Nouns\n\nSumerian nouns typically consisted of a one or two-syllable root, although there were also some roots with three syllables. The language had two semantically predictable grammatical genders, which have traditionally been called animate and inanimate.\n\n## Case\n\nThe Sumerian language had a range of case markers, including the absolutive, ergative, and dative cases.\n\n## Verbs\n\nSumerian verbs distinguished a number of moods and agreed with the subject and object in person, number, and gender.\n\n## Tense-Aspect\n\nThe Sumerian language had a complex system of tense-aspect, which was expressed through a range of suffixes and prefixes.\n\n# Syntax\n\nThe Sumerian language had a basic word order of subject-object-verb, although this could be modified by the use of suffixes and prefixes.\n\n## Coordination\n\nCoordinating conjunctions were rarely used in Sumerian, and the language instead used simple juxtaposition to express coordination.\n\n## Subordination\n\nSubordination was expressed through a range of strategies, including the use of nominalization and the use of subordinate clauses.\n\n# Dialects\n\nThe Sumerian language had a range of dialects, including Emegir and Emesal.\n\n## Emegir\n\nEmegir was the standard variety of Sumerian, and it was used for both literary and administrative purposes.\n\n## Emesal\n\nEmesal was used exclusively by female characters in some literary texts, and it was also used for liturgical and ceremonial purposes.\n\n# Old Babylonian Sumerian\n\nThe Old Babylonian period saw a significant change in the Sumerian language, with the introduction of Akkadian loanwords and the use of Sumerian in a more limited range of contexts.\n\n## Syllabary\n\nThe Old Babylonian period saw the introduction of a new syllabary, which simplified the cuneiform script and made it easier to write.\n\n## Vocabulary\n\nThe Old Babylonian period saw a significant shift in the vocabulary of Sumerian, with the introduction of Akkadian loanwords and the use of Sumerian in a more limited range of contexts.\n\n# Sample Text\n\nThe following is a sample text in Sumerian, written in cuneiform script.\n\n## Inscription by Entemena of Lagaš\n\nThis text was inscribed on a small clay cone c. 2400 BC, and it recounts the beginning of a war between the city-states of Lagaš and Umma during the Early Dynastic III period.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Sumerian language\n* Cuneiform script\n* Akkadian language\n* Old Babylonian period\n* Neo-Sumerian period\n*

periods: [10] [11] [12] [13]\n\n\nClassification\nSumerian is widely accepted to be a local language isolate [46] [47] [48] [49] Sumerian was at one time widely held to be an Indo-European language, but that view has been almost universally rejected [50] Since its decipherment in the early 20th century, scholars have tried to relate Sumerian to a wide variety of languages Because Sumerian has prestige as the first attested written language, proposals for linguistic affinity sometimes have a nationalistic flavour [51] Attempts have been made to link Sumerian with a range of widely disparate groups such as the Austroasiatic languages, [52] Dravidian languages, [53] Uralic languages such as Hungarian and Finnish, [54] [55] [56] [57] Sino-Tibetan languages [58] and Turkic languages (the last being promoted by Turkish nationalists as part of the Sun language theory [59] [60]) Additionally, long-range proposals have attempted to include Sumerian in broad macrofamilies [61] [62] Such proposals enjoy virtually no support among modern linguists, Sumerologists and Assyriologists and are typically seen as fringe theories [51]\n\n\nWriting system\nPictographic proto-writing was used starting in c 3300 BC It is unclear what underlying language it encoded, if any By c 2800 BC, some tablets began using syllabic elements that clearly indicated a relation to the Sumerian language Around 2600 BC, [67] [68] cuneiform symbols were developed using a wedge-shaped stylus to impress the shapes into wet clay This cuneiform (\"wedge-shaped\") mode of writing co-existed with the proto-cuneiform archaic mode Deimel (1922) lists 870 signs used in the Early Dynastic IIIa period (26th century) In the same period the large set of logographic signs had been simplified into a logosyllabic script comprising several hundred signs Rosengarten (1967) lists 468 signs used in Sumerian (pre-Sargonian) Lagash.\n\n\nDevelopment\nPictographic proto-writing was used starting in c 3300 BC It is unclear what underlying language it encoded, if any By c 2800 BC, some tablets began using syllabic elements that clearly indicated a relation to the Sumerian language Around 2600 BC, [67] [68] cuneiform symbols were developed using a wedge-shaped stylus to impress the shapes into wet clay This cuneiform (\"wedge-shaped\") mode of writing co-existed with the proto-cuneiform archaic

several hundred signs Rosengarten (1967) lists 468 signs used in Sumerian (pre-Sargonian) Lagash.\n\n\nTransliteration\nDepending on the context, a cuneiform sign can be read either as one of several possible logograms, each of which corresponds to a word in the Sumerian spoken language, as a phonetic syllable (V, VC, CV, or CVC), or as a determinative (a marker of semantic category, such as occupation or place) (See the article Cuneiform.) Some Sumerian logograms were written with multiple cuneiform signs These logograms are called diri-spellings, after the logogram 𒋛𒀀 DIRI which is written with the signs 𒋛 SI and 𒀀 A The text transliteration of a tablet will show just the logogram, such as the word dirig, not the separate component signs.\n\n\nHistoriography\nThe key to reading logosyllabic cuneiform came from the Behistun inscription, a trilingual cuneiform inscription written in Old Persian, Elamite and Akkadian (In a similar manner, the key to understanding Egyptian hieroglyphs was the bilingual  [Greek and Egyptian with the Egyptian text in two scripts] Rosetta stone and Jean-François Champollion's transcription in 1822.)\n\n\nPhonology\nAssumed phonological and morphological forms will be between slashes // and curly brackets {}, respectively, with plain text used for the standard Assyriological transcription of Sumerian Most of the following examples are unattested Note also that, not unlike most other pre-modern orthographies, Sumerian cuneiform spelling is highly variable, so the transcriptions and the cuneiform examples will generally show only one or at most a few common graphic forms out of many that may occur Spelling practices have also changed significantly in the course of the history of Sumerian: the examples in the article will use the most phonetically explicit spellings attested, which usually means Old Babylonian or Ur III period spellings except where an authentic example from another period is used.\n\n\nConsonants\nEarly Sumerian is conjectured to have had at least the consonants listed in the table below The consonants in parentheses are reconstructed by some scholars based on indirect evidence; if they existed, they were lost around the Ur III period in the late 3rd millennium BC.\n\n\nVowels\nThe vowels that are clearly distinguished by the cuneiform script are /a/, /e/, /i/, and /u/ Various researchers have posited the existence of more vowel phonemes such as /o/ and even /ɛ/ and /ɔ/, which would have been concealed by the transmission through Akkadian, as that language does not distinguish them [99] [100] That would explain the seeming existence of numerous homophones in transliterated Sumerian, as well as some details of the phenomena mentioned in the next paragraph [101] These hypotheses are not yet generally accepted [87] Phonemic vowel length has also been posited by many scholars based on vowel length in Sumerian loanwords in Akkadian, [102] [103] occasional so-called plene spellings with extra vowel signs, and some internal evidence from alternations [f] [103] [105] However, scholars who believe in the existence of phonemic vowel length do not consider it possible to reconstruct the length of the vowels in most Sumerian words [106] [g]\n\n\nStress\nSumerian stress is usually presumed to have been dynamic, since it seems to have caused vowel elisions on many occasions Opinions vary on its placement As argued by Bram Jagersma [114] and confirmed by other scholars, [115] [116] the adaptation of Akkadian words of Sumerian origin seems to suggest that Sumerian stress tended to be on the last syllable of the word, at least in its citation form The treatment of forms with grammatical morphemes is less clear Many cases of apheresis in forms with enclitics have been interpreted as entailing that the same rule was true of the phonological word on many occasions, i.e that the stress could be shifted onto the enclitics; however, the fact that many of these same enclitics have allomorphs with apocopated final vowels (e.g /‑še/ ~ /-š/) suggests that they were, on the contrary, unstressed when these allomorphs arose [114] It has also been conjectured that the frequent assimilation of the vowels of non-final syllables to the vowel of the final syllable of the word may be due to stress on it [117] However, a number of suffixes and enclitics consisting of /e/ or beginning in /e/ are also assimilated and reduced [118]\n\n\nOrthography\nSumerian writing expressed pronunciation only roughly It was often morphophonemic, so much of the allomorphic variation could be ignored [124] Especially in earlier Sumerian, coda consonants were also often ignored in spelling; e.g /mung̃areš/ 'they put it here' could be written 𒈬𒃻𒌷 mu-g̃ar-re2 The use of VC signs for that purpose, producing more elaborate spellings such as 𒈬𒌦𒃻𒌷𒌍 mu-un-g̃ar-re2-eš3, became more common only in the Neo-Sumerian and especially in the Old Babylonian period [125]\n\n\nGrammar\nEver since its decipherment, research of Sumerian has been made difficult not only by the lack of any native speakers, but also by the relative sparseness of linguistic data, the apparent lack of a closely related language, and the features of the writing system A further oft-mentioned and paradoxical problem for the study of Sumerian is that the most numerous and varied texts written in the most phonetically explicit and precise orthography are only dated to periods when the scribes themselves were no longer native speakers and often demonstrably had less-than-perfect command of the language they were writing in; conversely, for much of the time during which Sumerian was still a living language, the surviving sources are few, unvaried and/or written in an orthography that is more difficult to interpret [135]\n\n\nNominal morphology\nThe Sumerian noun is typically a one or two-syllable root (𒅆 igi \"eye\", 𒂍 e2 \"house, household\", 𒎏 nin \"lady\"), although there are also some roots with three syllables like 𒆠𒇴 šakanka \"market\" There are two semantically predictable grammatical genders, which have traditionally been called animate and inanimate, although these names do not express their membership exactly, as explained below.\n\n\nNoun phrases\nThe Sumerian noun is typically a one or two-syllable root (𒅆 igi \"eye\", 𒂍 e2 \"house, household\", 𒎏 nin \"lady\"), although there are also some roots with three syllables like 𒆠𒇴 šakanka \"market\" There are two semantically predictable grammatical genders, which have traditionally been called animate and inanimate, although these names do not express their membership exactly, as explained below.\n\n\nGender\nThe two genders have been variously called animate and inanimate, [140] [141] [142] [143] human and non-human, [144] [145] or personal/person and impersonal/non-person [146] [147] Their assignment is semantically predictable: the first gender includes humans and gods, while the second one includes animals, plants, non-living objects, abstract concepts, and groups of humans Since the second gender includes animals, the use of the terms animate and inanimate is somewhat misleading [146] and conventional, [141] but it is most common in the literature, so it will be maintained in this article.\n\n\nNumber\nThe plural marker proper is (𒂊)𒉈 /-(e)ne/ [l] It is used only with nouns of the animate gender and its use is optional It is often omitted when other parts of the clause indicate the plurality of the referent [152] Thus, it is not used if the noun is modified by a numeral (𒇽𒁹𒁹𒁹 lu2 eš5 \"three men\") It has also been observed that until the Ur III period, the marker generally isn't used in a noun phrase in the absolutive case, [153] [154] [155] unless this is necessary for disambiguation [154] [155] Instead, the plurality of the absolutive participant is commonly expressed only by the form of the verb in the clause: [155] [153] e.g 𒇽𒁀𒀄𒀄𒌍 lu2 ba-zaḫ3-zaḫ3-eš \"the men ran away\", 𒇽𒈬𒅇𒆪𒁉𒌍 lu2 mu-u3-dab5-be2-eš \"I caught the men\" The plural marker is not used when referring to a group of people, because a group of people is treated as inanimate; e.g 𒀳 engar \"farmer\" with no plural marker may refer to \"(the group of) farmers\" [152]\n\n\nCase\nThe generally recognized case markers are: [165]\n\n\nCase markers\nThe generally recognized case markers are: [165]\n\n\nCase usage\nThe uses of the ergative and absolutive case are those typical of ergative languages The subject of an intransitive verb such as \"come\" is in the same case as the object of a transitive verb such as \"build\", namely the so-called absolutive case In contrast, the subject of a transitive verb has a different case, which is termed ergative This can be illustrated with the following examples:\n\n\nPronouns\nThe attested personal pronouns are:\n\n\nAdjectives\nIt is controversial whether Sumerian has adjectives at all, since nearly all stems with adjectival meaning are also attested as verb stems and may be conjugated as verbs: 𒈤 maḫ \"great\" > 𒎏𒀠𒈤 nin al-maḫ \"the lady is great\" [219] [220] Jagersma believes that there is a distinction in that the few true adjectives cannot be negated, and a few stems are different depending on the part of speech: 𒃲 gal \"big\", but 𒄖𒌌 gu-ul \"be big\" [221] Furthermore, stems with adjective-like meaning sometimes occur with the nominalizing suffix /-a/, but their behaviour varies  in this respect Some stems appear to require the suffix always: e.g 𒆗𒂵 kalag-ga \"mighty\", 𒊷𒂵 sag9-ga \"beautiful\", 𒁍𒁕 gid2-da \"long\" [222] [223] (these are verbs with adjectival meaning according to Jagersma [224]) Some never take the suffix: e.g 𒃲 gal \"big\", 𒌉 tur \"small\" and 𒈤 maḫ \"great\" [225] (these are genuine adjectives according to Jagersma [226]) Finally, some alternate: 𒍣 zid \"right\" often occurs as 𒍣𒁕 zid-da (these are pairs of adjectives and verbs derived from them, respectively, according to Jagersma [227]) In the latter case, attempts have been made to find a difference of meaning between the forms with and without -a; it has been suggested that the form with -a expresses a kind of determination, [228] e.g zid \"righteous, true\" vs zid-da \"right (not left)\", or restrictiveness, e.g 𒂍𒉋 e2 gibil \"a new house\" vs 𒂍𒉋𒆷 e2 gibil-la \"the new house (as contrasted with the old one)\", \"a/the newer (kind of) house\" or \"the newest house\", as well as nominalization, e.g tur-ra \"a/the small one\" or \"a small thing\" [229] Other scholars have remained sceptical about the posited contrasts [230]\n\n\nAdverbs and adverbial expressions\nMost commonly, adverbial meanings are expressed by noun phrases in a certain case, e.g 𒌓 ud-ba \"then\", lit \"at that time\" [232]\n\n\nNumerals\nSumerian has a combination decimal and sexagesimal system (for example, 600 is 'ten sixties'), so that the Sumerian lexical numeral system is sexagesimal with 10 as a subbase [237] The cardinal numerals and ways of forming composite numbers are as follows: [238] [239] [240]\n\n\nVerbal morphology\nThe Sumerian finite verb distinguishes a number of moods and agrees (more or less consistently) with the subject and the object in person, number and gender The verb chain may also incorporate pronominal references to the verb's other modifiers, which has also traditionally been described as \"agreement\", although, in fact, such a reference and the presence of an actual modifier in the clause need not co-occur: not only 𒂍𒂠𒌈𒌈𒅆𒁺𒌦 e2-še3 ib2-ši-du-un \"I'm going to the house\", but also 𒂍𒂠𒉌𒁺𒌦 e2-še3 i3-du-un \"I'm going to the house\" and simply 𒌈𒅆𒁺𒌦 ib2-ši-du-un \"I'm going to it\" are possible [139] [245] [246] Hence, the term \"cross-reference\" instead of \"agreement\" has been proposed This article will predominantly use the term \"agreement\" [247] [248]\n\n\nGeneral\nThe Sumerian finite verb distinguishes a number of moods and agrees (more or less consistently) with the subject and the object in person, number and gender The verb chain may also incorporate pronominal references to the verb's other modifiers, which has also traditionally been described as \"agreement\", although, in fact, such a reference and the presence of an actual modifier in the clause need not co-occur: not only 𒂍𒂠𒌈𒌈𒅆𒁺𒌦 e2-še3 ib2-ši-du-un \"I'm going to the house\", but also 𒂍𒂠𒉌𒁺𒌦 e2-še3 i3-du-un \"I'm going to the house\" and simply 𒌈𒅆𒁺𒌦 ib2-ši-du-un \"I'm going to it\" are possible [139] [245] [246] Hence, the term \"cross-reference\" instead of \"agreement\" has been proposed This article will predominantly use the term \"agreement\" [247] [248]\n\n\nModal prefixes\nThe modal prefixes express modality Some of them are generally combined with certain TAs; in other cases, the meaning of a modal prefix can depend on the TA.\n\n\n\"Conjugation prefixes\"\nThe meaning, structure, identity and even the number of the various \"conjugation prefixes\" have always been a subject of disagreements The term \"conjugation prefix\" simply alludes to the fact that a Sumerian finite verb in the indicative mood must (nearly) always contain one of them Which of these prefixes is used seems to have, more often than not, no effect on its translation into European languages [284] Proposed explanations of the choice of conjugation prefix usually revolve around the subtleties of spatial grammar, information structure (focus [285]), verb valency, and, most recently, voice [286] The following description primarily follows the analysis of Jagersma (2010), largely seconded by Zólyomi (2017) and Sallaberger (2023), in its specifics; nonetheless, most of the interpretations in it are held widely, if not universally [287]\n\n\nPronominal and dimensional prefixes\nThe dimensional prefixes of the verb chain basically correspond to, and often repeat, the case markers of the noun phrase Like the case markers of the noun phrase, the first dimensional prefix is normally attached to a preceding \"head\" – a pronominal prefix, which expresses the person, gender and number of its referent [336] The first dimensional prefix may be followed by up to two other dimensional prefixes, [337] but unlike the first one, these prefixes never have an explicit \"head\" and cannot refer to animate nouns [338] The other slot where a pronominal prefix can occur is immediately before the stem, where it can have a different allomorph and expresses the person, gender and absolutive or the ergative participant (the transitive subject, the intransitive subject or the direct object), depending on the TA and other factors, as explained below.\n\n\nPronominal prefixes\nThe forms of the pronominal prefixes are the following: [343]\n\n\nDimensional prefixes\nThe generally recognized dimensional prefixes are shown in the table below; if several occur within the same verb complex, they are placed in the order they are listed in  \n\n\nDifferences and combinations between dimensional prefixes and noun case markers\nWhile the meanings of the prefixes are generally the same as those of the corresponding nominal case markers, there are some differences:\n\n\nUse of the ventive as a 1st person marker\nWhen the dimensional prefix is dative -/a/-, the personal prefix of the 1st person appears to be absent, but the 1st person reference is expressed by the choice of the ventive conjugation prefix /mu/- The sequence that expresses the 1st person dative is then: /mu-/ + /-a-/ → 𒈠 ma- [376] [377] [378] When the intended meaning is that of the directive -/i/~/e/- (\"on me\", \"in contact with me\", etc.), it seems that the ventive conjugation prefix 𒈬 mu- alone serves to express it [376] [377]\n\n\nSyncope of /i/ in -/ni/- and -/bi/-\nTwo special phenomena occur if there is no absolutive–ergative pronominal prefix in the pre-stem position.\n\n\nExpression of the directive by a pre-stem personal prefix\nA superficially very similar, but distinct phenomenon is that if there isn't already an absolutive–ergative pronominal prefix in pre-stem position, the personal prefix of the directive participant does not receive the dimensional prefix -/i/~/e/- at all and is moved to the pre-stem position For example, the normal position of the directive participant is seen in:\n\n\nAbsence of {-b-}\nIn some cases, the 3rd person inanimate prefix -b- appears to be unexpectedly absent.\n\n\nPronominal suffixes\nThe pronominal suffixes are as follows:\n\n\nPronominal agreement with subjects and direct objects\nSumerian verbal agreement follows a nominative–accusative pattern in the 1st and 2nd persons of the marû tense-aspect, but an ergative–absolutive pattern in most other forms of the indicative mood Because of this presence of both patterns, Sumerian is considered a language with split ergativity [388] The general principle is that in the ḫamṭu TA, the transitive subject is expressed by the prefix, and the direct object by the suffix, and in the marû TA it is the other way round For example, {i-b-dab-en} can be a ḫamṭu form meaning \"it caught me\", where {-b-} expresses the subject \"it\" and {-en} expresses the object \"I\" However, it can also be a marû form meaning \"I will catch it\", where {-en} expresses the subject \"I\" and {-b-} expresses the object \"it\" As for the intransitive subject, it is expressed, in both TAs, by the suffixes For example, {i-kaš-en} is \"I ran\", and {i-kaš-ed-en} can be \"I will run\" This means that the intransitive subject is treated like the object in ḫamṭu (which makes the ḫamṭu pattern ergative) and like the subject in marû (which makes the marû pattern nominative-accusative).\n\n\nStem\nThe verbal stem itself can also express grammatical distinctions within the categories number and tense-aspect In a number of verbs, this involves suppletion or morphonological alternations that are not fully predictable.\n\n\nThe modal or imperfective suffix -/ed/\nBefore the pronominal suffixes, a suffix -/ed/ or -/d/ can be inserted (the /d/ is only realized if other vowels follow, in which case the /e/ in turn may be elided): e.g 𒉌𒀄(𒂊)𒉈𒂗 i3-zaḫ3(-e)-de3-en {i-zaḫ-ed-en} \"I will/must escape\", 𒉌𒀄𒂊 i3-zaḫ3-e {i-zaḫ-ed} \"he will/must escape\" This suffix is considered to account for occurrences of -e in the third-person singular marû of intransitive forms by those who do not accept the theory that -e itself is a marû stem formant [417]\n\n\nUse of the tense-aspect forms\nJagersma systematizes the use of the tense-aspect forms in the following patterns: [425]\n\n\nThe imperative mood\nThe imperative mood construction is produced with a ḫamṭu stem, but using the marû agreement pattern, by turning all prefixes into suffixes [432] In the plural, the second person plural ending is attached in a form that differs slightly from the indicative: it is /-(n)zen/, with the -/n/- appearing only after vowels The stem is singular even in the plural imperative [433] Compare the following indicative-imperative pairs: \n\n\nParticiples\nSumerian participles can function both as verbal adjectives and as verbal nouns As verbal adjectives, they can describe any participant involved in the action or state expressed by the verb: for instance, 𒋧𒈠 šum2-ma may mean either \"(which was) given (to someone)\", \"who was given (something)\" or \"who gave\" [438] As verbal nouns, they denote the action or state itself, so 𒋧𒈠 šum2-ma may also mean  '(the act of) giving' or 'the fact that X gave Y' [438] Participles are formed in the following ways:\n\n\nCopula verb\nThe copula verb /me/ \"to be\" is mostly used in an enclitic form Its conjugation is as follows: \n\n\nPassive voice\nSome scholars believe that it is possible to speak of a passive voice in Sumerian Jagersma (2010) distinguishes three attested passive constructions [455] In each case, the ergative participant and the corresponding agreement marker on the verb are removed, so that the verb is inflected intransitively, but there may also be some additional cues to ensure a passive interpretation The passive may be formed:\n\n\nCausative construction\nSumerian doesn't have dedicated causative morphology Causativity is expressed syntactically in two ways, depending on the transitivity of the verb.\n\n\nPhrasal verbs\nA specific problem of Sumerian syntax is posed by the numerous phrasal verbs (traditionally called \"compound verbs\" in Sumerology in spite of the fact that they are not compounds, but idiomatic combinations [469]) They usually involve a noun immediately before the verb, forming a lexical/idiomatic unit: [470] e.g 𒅆...𒂃 igi ...du8, lit \"open the eye\" = \"see, look\" Their case government and agreement patterns vary depending on the specific verb [471] [364] [cc] The component noun is usually in the absolutive case, but may be in the directive If the phrasal verb takes another noun as a \"logical object\", the verbal infix is typically the directive, while the noun case is most commonly either the directive (dative if animate), which otherwise has the meaning \"at / with respect to\", or the locative (dative if animate), which otherwise has the meaning \"on\":\n\n\nSyntax\nThe basic word order is subject–object–verb; verb finality is only violated in rare instances, in poetry The moving of a constituent towards the beginning of the phrase may be a way to highlight it, [485] as may the addition of the copula to it Modifiers (adjectives, genitive phrases etc.) are normally placed after the noun: 𒂍𒉋 e2 gibil \"a new house\" 𒂍𒈗𒆷 e2 lugal-la \"the house of the owner\" However, the so-called anticipatory genitive (𒂍𒀀𒈗𒉈 e2-a lugal-bi \"the owner of the house\", lit \"of the house, its owner\") is common and may signal the possessor's topicality [485] There are no adpositions, but noun phrases in a certain case may resemble prepositions and have a similar function: [486]\n\n\nGeneral features\nThe basic word order is subject–object–verb; verb finality is only violated in rare instances, in poetry The moving of a constituent towards the beginning of the phrase

possessor's topicality [485] There are no adpositions, but noun phrases in a certain case may resemble prepositions and have a similar function: [486]\n\n\nSubordinate clauses\nThere are various ways to express subordination Many of them include the nominalization of a finite verb with the suffix -/a/, which is also used to form participles, as shown above Like the participles, this nominalized clause can either modify a noun, as adjectives do, or refer to the event itself, as nouns do It usually functions as a relative clause, corresponding to an English clause with \"which ...\" or \"who ...\", as in the following example:\n\n\nCoordination\nCoordinating conjunctions are rarely used The most common way to express the sense of \"and\" is by simple juxtaposition Nominal phrases may be conjoined, perhaps emphatically, by adding 𒁉 -bi to the second one: 𒀭𒂗𒆤𒀭𒎏𒆤𒉌 en-lil2 nin-lil2-bi \"both Enlil and Ninlil\"; sometimes the enclitic is further reinforced by 𒁕 -da \"with\" More surprisingly, 𒋫 -ta \"from\" is also sometimes used in the sense of \"and\" [502] The word 𒅇 u3 \"and\" was borrowed from Akkadian in the Old Akkadian period and occurs mostly in relatively colloquial texts; [503] Old Babylonian Sumerian also borrowed from Akkadian the enclitic 𒈠 -ma \"and\" [504] There is no conjunction \"or\" and its sense can also be expressed by simple juxtaposition; a more explicit and emphatic alternative is the repetition of 𒃶𒅎 ḫe2-em, \"let it be\": 𒇻𒃶𒅎𒈧𒃶𒅎 udu ḫe2-em maš ḫe2-em  \"(be it) a sheep or a goat\" [505]\n\n\nOther issues\nA quotative particle -/(e)še/ or -/ši/ \"saying\", variously spelt 𒂠 -eše2, 𒅆 -ši or 𒀪𒊺 -e-še, has been identified [506] Its use is not obligatory and it is attested only or almost only in texts from the Old Babylonian period or later [507] Another, rarely attested, particle, 𒄑(𒊺)𒂗 -g̃eš(-še)-en, apparently expresses irrealis modality: \"were it that ...\" [508]\n\n\nWord formation\nDerivation by affixation is largely non-existent [514] [515] An exception may be a few nouns ending in -/u/ denoting the object of a corresponding verb: 𒊬𒊒 sar-ru \"document\" < 𒊬 sar \"write\" [516] Compounding, on the other hand, is common in nouns Compounds are normally left-headed The dependent may be:\n\n\nDialects\nThe standard variety of Sumerian was Emegir (𒅴𒂠: eme-gir15) A notable variety or sociolect was Emesal (𒅴𒊩: eme-sal), possibly to be interpreted as \"fine tongue\" or \"high-pitched voice\" [524] Other apparent terms for registers or dialects were eme-galam \"high tongue\", eme-si-sa2 \"straight tongue\", eme-te-na2 \"oblique [?] tongue\", [525] emesukudda, emesuha, emesidi [526] [527] and emeku [528] Recently, a regional differentiation into a Northern and a Southern Sumerian dialect area has been posited [3]\n\n\nEmesal\nEmesal is used exclusively by female characters in some literary texts In addition, it is dominant in certain genres of cult songs such as the hymns sung by Gala priests [529] [530] [531] It has been argued that it might have been a female language variety of the kind that exists or has existed in some cultures, such as among the Chukchis and the Garifuna Alternatively, it has been contended that it must have been originally a regional dialect, since instances of apparent Emesal-like forms are attested in the area of late 3rd millennium Lagash, [532] and some loanwords into Akkadian appear to come from Emesal rather than Emegir [533] Apart from such isolated glosses, Emesal is first attested in writing in the early Old Babylonian period [534] It is typically written with syllable signs rather than logograms A text is often not written consistently in Emesal, but contains apparent Emegir forms as well.\n\n\nSouthern and Northern Sumerian\nBram Jagersma [538] and Gábor Zólyomi [539] distinguish two regional dialects of Sumerian: the Southern Sumerian dialect of Lagash, Umma, Ur and Uruk, which eventually formed the basis for the common standard of the Neo-Sumerian (Ur III) period, and the Northern Sumerian dialect as seen in texts from Nippur, Adab, Isin and Shuruppak (although eventually texts in the standard variety begin to be produced in that area as well) The differences that he finds between the two varieties are:\n\n\nOld Babylonian Sumerian\nThe dominant Sumerian variety of the Old Babylonian period, in turn, reflected a different regional dialect from the standard Neo-Sumerian of the Ur III period:\n\n\nInterference from Akkadian and other late phenomena\nIn the Old Babylonian period and after it, the Sumerian used by scribes was influenced by their mother tongue, Akkadian, and sometimes more generally by imperfect acquisition of the language As a result, various deviations from its original structure occur in texts or copies of texts from these times The following effects have been found in the Old Babylonian period: [23]\n\n\nSyllabary\nThe table below shows signs used for simple syllables of the form CV or VC As used for the Sumerian language, the cuneiform script was in principle capable of distinguishing at least 16 consonants, [551] [552] transliterated as\n\n\nSample text\nThis text was inscribed on a

Rosenberg's activism took her to the forefront of feminist causes, the Puerto Rican independence movement, and the fight against the FBI's COINTELPRO program.\n\nRosenberg joined the May 19th Communist Organization, a female-led clandestine group that worked in support of the Black Liberation Army and its offshoots, including assistance in armored truck robberies, the Weather Underground, and other revolutionary organizations. This involvement marked a significant turning point in Rosenberg's life, as she became embroiled in the complex and often fraught world of radical politics.\n\nCharges and Imprisonment\n------------------------\n\nRosenberg was charged with a role in bombings at the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. National War College, and the New York Patrolmen's Benevolent Association building. However, these charges were dropped as part of a plea deal by other members of her group. Rosenberg was subsequently convicted of various crimes related to her involvement in the May 19th Communist Organization and sentenced to 58 years in prison.\n\nRelease\n-------\n\nRosenberg's sentence was commuted by President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001, his last day in office, to the more than 16 years' time served. This commutation was met with criticism from police and New York elected officials, who saw it as a lenient sentence for a convicted felon.\n\nWriting\n--------\n\nIn 2011, Rosenberg published a memoir of her time in prison called An American Radical: A Political Prisoner In My Own Country. The book provides a firsthand account of her experiences as a political prisoner and offers insights into the complexities of her life and activism. Kirkus Reviews praised the book, stating, \"Articulate and clear-eyed, Rosenberg's memoir memorably records the struggles of a woman determined to be the agent of her own life.\"\n\nLegacy\n-------\n\nSusan Rosenberg's life and activism have left a lasting impact on the world of social justice and politics. Her commitment to fighting for human rights and her willingness to take risks have inspired countless individuals and movements. Despite the challenges she faced during her imprisonment, Rosenberg remains a powerful voice for social change and a testament to the enduring power of activism.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* May 19th Communist Organization\n* Black Liberation Army\n* Weather Underground\n* COINTELPRO\n* Puerto Rican independence movement\n* Feminist movement\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Susan Rosenberg's official website\n* An American Radical: A Political Prisoner In My Own Country (memoir)\n* Democracy Now interview with Susan Rosenberg", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Susan_Rosenberg\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nRosenberg was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Manhattan Her father was a dentist and her mother a theatrical producer She attended the progressive Walden School and later went to Barnard College at Columbia University [11] She left Barnard and became a drug counselor at Lincoln Hospital in The Bronx, eventually becoming licensed in the practice of Chinese medicine and acupuncture [11] She also worked as an anti-drug counselor and acupuncturist at health centers in Harlem, including the Black Acupuncture Advisory of North America [12]\n\n\nActivism and imprisonment\nIn an interview with the radio show Democracy Now, Rosenberg said that she was \"totally and profoundly influenced by the revolutionary movements of the '60s and '70s\" She became active in feminist causes, and worked in support of the Puerto Rican independence movement and the fight against the FBI's COINTELPRO program [9] [13] Rosenberg joined the May 19th Communist Organization, a female-led clandestine group working in support of the Black Liberation Army and its offshoots (including assistance in armored truck robberies), the Weather Underground and other revolutionary organizations [14]\nRosenberg was charged with a role in bombings at the U.S Capitol, the U.S National War College and the New York Patrolmen's Benevolent Association building, but these charges were dropped as part of a plea deal by other members of her group [15] [10] [16]\n\n\nRelease\nRosenberg's sentence was commuted by President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001, his last day in office, to the more than 16 years' time served Her commutation produced a wave of criticism by police and New York elected officials [25]\n\n\nWriting\nIn 2011, Rosenberg published a memoir of her time in prison called, An American Radical: A Political Prisoner In My Own Country Kirkus Reviews said of the book, \"Articulate and clear-eyed, Rosenberg's memoir memorably records the struggles of a woman determined to be the agent of her own life.\" [30] [31]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

originally spelled \"Griesmann\", before being changed to \"Griezmann\" [10] His mother, Isabelle Lopes, a former hospital staff member supervising the cleaning team, is of Portuguese descent, and her father Amaro Lopes was a Portuguese footballer for Paços de Ferreira [7] Amaro Lopes moved from Portugal to France with his wife Carolina to work in construction in 1957, where Isabelle was born, and

Griezmann lodged with the club's French scout while attending school across the border in Bayonne, training in the evenings at the club's headquarters in San Sebastián [11] It took him time to break into Real Sociedad's first team, but after four years in the club's youth system he made his debut, called up by Martín Lasarte for Real Sociedad's 2009–10 pre-season campaign In the pre-season, he scored five goals in four appearances and an injury to the team's regular left-winger led to Lasarte selecting him for the start of the season (unusually for a youth graduate, bypassing the reserve team altogether) [11]\n\n\nReal Sociedad\nWhen he first arrived at Real Sociedad, Griezmann lodged with the club's French scout while attending school across the border in Bayonne, training in the

[11]\n\n\n2009–2011: Development and breakthrough\nOn 2 September 2009, Griezmann made his competitive debut in the team's Copa del Rey match against Rayo Vallecano appearing as a substitute in the 77th minute of a 2–0 defeat [13] Four days later, he made his league debut appearing as a substitute against Real Murcia On 27 September, he made his first professional start and also scored his first professional goal against Huesca in a 2–0 win [14] Two weeks later, Griezmann scored his second goal of the campaign in a 2–0 win over Salamanca [15] In November 2009, he scored goals in back-to-back matches against Hércules and Recreativo de Huelva [16] The goal against the latter club was the only goal of the match [17] Griezmann appeared consistently in the team for the rest of the season, scoring two more goals in wins over Cádiz and Numancia as Real Sociedad earned promotion to La Liga for the 2010–11 season as league winners [18] [19] [20] On 8 April 2010, Griezmann signed his first professional contract agreeing to a five-year deal with the club until 2015 with a release clause of €30 million [21] Prior to signing the contract, he drew considerable interest from Ligue 1 clubs Lyon, Saint-Étienne and Auxerre [22] As he developed with a Basque club, he was also potentially available to play for local rivals Athletic Bilbao, in spite of being born and growing up in the non-Basque areas of France [23] [24] [25]\n\n\n2011–2014: Individual success\nAfter sitting out the first league match of the 2011–12 campaign, in Griezmann's first competitive match of the season against the defending champions Barcelona two weeks later, he scored the equalising goal in a 2–2 draw [34]\n\n\nAtlético Madrid\nOn 28 July 2014, Atlético Madrid reached an agreement with Real Sociedad for the transfer of Griezmann, for a fee believed to be close to his €30 million (£24 million) buy-out clause [38] [39] He passed the medical examination the same day and signed a six-year contract on 29 July [40] [41] He made his debut in the first leg of the 2014 Supercopa de España on 19 August, a 1–1 draw away to Real Madrid, replacing Saúl after 57 minutes [42] On 17 September, he

Sociedad for the transfer of Griezmann, for a fee believed to be close to his €30 million (£24 million) buy-out clause [38] [39] He passed the medical examination the same day and signed a six-year contract on 29 July [40] [41] He made his debut in the first leg of the 2014 Supercopa de España on 19 August, a 1–1 draw away to Real Madrid, replacing Saúl after 57 minutes [42] On 17 September, he

Liga Player of the Month for January 2015 despite appearing in only three of Atlético's five matches [46]\n\n\n2015–2017: Rise to prominence\nOn 22 August 2015, Griezmann scored the only goal as Atlético began the season with a home victory over promoted Las Palmas [51] He scored both of the goals on 15 September, as they won at Galatasaray in the Champions League group stage [52] A week later, he repeated the feat to defeat local neighbours Getafe and put Atlético on top of the league [53] On 18 October, in his return to Real Sociedad, Griezmann chipped goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli in the ninth minute of a 2–0 away win (as in the fixture six months earlier, he did not celebrate the goal) [54]\n\n\n2017–18: UEFA Europa League win\nOn 19 August 2017, Griezmann earned his first red card during a draw against Girona and received a two-match ban He was initially booked for diving in the penalty box, then his reaction of using foul language toward the referee earned him a second booking [64] He was named La Liga Player of the Month for February 2018 after registering eight goals and two assists during the period, including scoring seven in four days (a hat-trick against Sevilla and four against Leganés) [65] His second in the 4–0 win against the latter was his 100th goal for Atletico, becoming only the third player of the 21st century to do so, after Sergio Agüero and Fernando Torres [66]\n\n\n2018–19: Final season of first stint with Atlético\nOn 15 August, Griezmann started in Atlético's 4–2 extra-time win over Real Madrid in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup in

competition at the Westfalenstadion [74] In the following game he again scored the second goal in a 2–0 win against French side Monaco, to ensure his team's qualification for the next round of the Champions League [75]\n\n\nBarcelona\nOn 12 July 2019, Barcelona announced the signing of Griezmann to a five-year contract after activating his €120 million buy-out clause [81] Later that day, however, Atlético Madrid disputed Barcelona's deal to sign the player, stating that the fee paid falls €80 million short of his release clause, claiming that Griezmann had agreed to move to the Nou Camp before 1 July 2019, when his €200 million buy-out clause was lowered to €120 million [82] Atlético later stated they have \"started the procedures it considers appropriate for the defense of its legitimate rights and interests\" as a result of any deal, with reports in Spanish media suggesting the club planned to go to football's governing body FIFA to argue their case [83] [84] On 14 July, he was presented at the Camp Nou and was handed the number 17 shirt, and made his debut in a pre-season friendly in Japan against Chelsea [85] On the same day, some Atlético Madrid fans defaced Griezmann's plaque outside the Metropolitano Stadium, [86] as the club officially submitted a complaint to La Liga, whose president Javier Tebas later stated \"it is possible to block  [Griezmann's] transfer\", but also noted \"La Liga have  [yet] to decide  [the] course of action\" [69] The transfer was eventually upheld.\n\n\n2019–21: Decline in form and Copa del Rey\nGriezmann made his debut for Barcelona on 16 August 2019 in a 1–0 defeat to Athletic Bilbao [87] On 25 August, Griezmann scored a brace and assisted during his home debut, which ended in a 5–2 win against Real Betis [88] [89]

Lionel Messi In their 2019–20 Supercopa de España match against Atlético Madrid, Griezmann scored his side's second goal against his former club in an eventual 2–3 defeat [90] Griezmann became the first player of the season to score in every major competition for Barcelona when he netted a brace in the Copa del Rey against Ibiza in a narrow 2–1 win [91] On 25 February 2020, Griezmann scored Barcelona's equaliser in their 1–1 Champions League round of 16 draw against Napoli, becoming the first Barcelona player other than Messi to score a Champions League away goal in the knockout stage since 2015 [92]\n\n\nReturn to Atlético Madrid\nOn 31 August 2021, Griezmann returned to Atlético Madrid on a one-year loan, with the option to extend the loan by a further year, and complete with a conditional permanent transfer clause worth €40 million to be activated by 2023 [98] [99] [100] He scored his first goal in his second spell at the club on 28 September, in a 2–1 comeback victory away

I couldn't stop thinking My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going.\" [78] At that time, he told Lyall that he had taken two Ambien pills, after taking just one had not sufficed, and those left him in \"a stupor, only to wake up an hour later, his mind still racing\" [30]\n\n\nDeath\nAt around 3 p.m Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday, 22 January 2008, Ledger was found naked and lying face down unresponsive in his bed by his housekeeper, Teresa Solomon, and his massage therapist, Diana Wolozin, in his loft at 421 Broome Street in the SoHo neighbourhood of Manhattan [6] [4] [85]\n\n\nAutopsy and toxicology report\nOn 6 February 2008, the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York released its conclusions Those conclusions were based on an initial autopsy that occurred 23 January 2008, and a subsequent complete toxicological analysis [7] [88] [89] The report concluded that Ledger died \"as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam and doxylamine\" It added: \"We have concluded that the manner of death is accident [al], resulting from the abuse of prescribed medications.\" [7] [9]\n\n\nFederal investigation\nLate in February 2008, a DEA investigation of medical professionals relating to Ledger's death exonerated two American physicians, who practice in Los Angeles and Houston, of any wrongdoing, determining that \"the doctors in question had prescribed Ledger other medications – not the pills that killed him.\" [95] [96]\n\n\nControversy over will\nAfter Ledger's death, in response to some press reports about his will, filed in New York City on 28 February 2008, [103] [104] and his daughter's access to his financial legacy, his father, Kim Ledger, said that he considered the financial well-being of Heath's daughter Matilda Rose an \"absolute priority,\" whilst also stating that her mother, Michelle Williams, was \"an integral part of our family\" He added, \"They will be taken care of and that's how Heath would want it to be\" [105] Some of Ledger's relatives may be challenging the legal status of his will signed in 2003, prior to his involvement with Williams and the birth of their daughter and not updated to include them, which divides half of his estate between his parents and half among his siblings; they claim that there is a second, unsigned will, which leaves most of that estate to Matilda Rose [106] [107] Williams' father, Larry Williams, has also joined the controversy about Ledger's will, as it was filed in New York City soon after his death [108]\n\n\nLegacy\nAs the news of Ledger's death became public, throughout the night of 22 January 2008, and the following day, media crews, mourners, fans, and other onlookers began gathering outside his apartment building, with some leaving flowers or other memorial tributes [118] [119]\n\n\nMemorial tributes and services\nAs the news of Ledger's death became public, throughout the night of 22 January 2008, and the following day, media crews, mourners, fans, and other onlookers began gathering outside his apartment building, with some leaving flowers or other memorial tributes [118] [119]\n\n\nMethod and style\n\"You know when you see the preachers down South? And they grab a believer and they go, 'Bwoom! I touch you with the hand of God!' And they believe so strongly, they're on the ground shaking and spitting And fuck's sake, that's the power of belief.. Now, I don't believe in Jesus, but I believe in my performance And if you can understand that the power of belief is one of the great tools of our time and that a lot of acting comes from it, you can do anything.\"\n\n\nPosthumous films and awards\nLedger's death affected the marketing campaign for Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008) [11] [33] and also both the production and marketing of Terry Gilliam's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, with both directors intending to celebrate and pay tribute to his work in these films [33] [34] [147] [148] Although Gilliam temporarily suspended production on the latter film, [34] he expressed determination to \"salvage\" it, perhaps using computer-generated imagery (CGI), and dedicated it to Ledger [79] [149] [150] In February 2008, as a \"memorial tribute to the man many have called one of the best actors of his generation,\" Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell signed on to take over Ledger's role, becoming multiple incarnations of his character, Tony, transformed in this \"magical re-telling of the Faust story\" [151] [152] [153] The three actors donated their fees for the film to Ledger's and Williams's daughter [154]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nMusic videos\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Blair Witch Project began in 1993 [5] While film students at the University of Central Florida, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez were inspired to make the film after realizing that they found documentaries on paranormal phenomena scarier than traditional horror films The two decided to create a film that combined the styles of both In order to produce the project, they, along with Gregg

film Häxan (English: Witchcraft Through the Ages) [6]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on October 23, 1997, in Maryland and lasted eight days, overseen by cinematographer Neal Fredericks, who provided a CP-16 film camera [6] [12] [16] The three actors shot all the footage shown in the film, except for one interview about Rustin Parr's murders [17] The \"found footage\" was shot with a Hi8 camcorder [16] [18] Most of the film was shot in Seneca Creek State Park in Montgomery County, Maryland A few scenes were filmed in the historic town of Burkittsville [citation needed] Some of the townspeople interviewed in the film were not actors, and some were planted actors, unknown to the main cast [16] Donahue had never operated a camera before and spent two days in a \"crash course\" Donahue said she modeled her character after a director she had once worked with, noting her character's \"self-assuredness\" when everything went as planned, and confusion during crisis [19]\n\n\nPost-production\nAfter filming, the 20 hours of raw footage had to be cut down to 81 minutes; the editing process took more than eight months The directors screened the first cut in small film festivals in order to get feedback and make changes that would ensure that it appealed to as large an audience as possible [5] Originally, it was hoped that the film would make it on to cable television, and the directors did not anticipate a wide release [5] The final version was submitted to Sundance Film Festival [31]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe Blair Witch Project is thought to be the first

across the Internet over whether the film was a real-life documentary or a work of fiction [36] [37] Some of the footage was screened during the Florida Film Festival in June [8] During screenings, the filmmakers made advertising efforts to promulgate the events in the film as factual, including the distribution of flyers at festivals such as Sundance, asking viewers to come forward with any information about the \"missing\" students [38] [39] The campaign tactic was that viewers were being told, through missing persons posters, that the characters were missing while researching in the woods for the mythical Blair Witch [40] The IMDb page also listed the actors as \"missing, presumed dead\" in the first year of the film's availability [41] The film's website contains materials of actors posing as police and investigators giving testimony about their casework, and shared childhood photos of the actors to add a sense of realism [42] By August 1999, the website had received 160 million hits [34]\n\n\nFictional legend\nThe backstory for the film is a legend fabricated by Sánchez and Myrick which is detailed in the Curse of the Blair Witch, a mockumentary broadcast on the

Blair Witch Project is a 1999 American found-footage horror film written, directed, and edited by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez. The film tells the story of three film students who venture into the Black Hills Forest in Maryland to make a documentary about the local legend of the Blair Witch, only to find themselves hunted by a supernatural force.\n\nPlot\nThe film purports to be footage found in the discarded cameras of three young filmmakers who had gone missing. The story follows Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard as they embark on a journey into the Black Hills Forest to document the legend of the Blair Witch. They interview local residents and delve deeper into the forest, eventually getting lost and separated from each other.\n\n## Development of the Legend\n\nThe backstory for the film is a legend fabricated by Sánchez and Myrick, which is detailed in the Curse of the Blair Witch, a mockumentary broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel in 1999. According to the legend, a woman named Elly Kedward was accused of witchcraft and banished from the village of Blair, Maryland, in the 18th century.

Garth Ennis had worked with numerous times before, [8] and Keith Burns, a friend of McCrea's of whom he has said: \"Keith's strengths are my weaknesses and vice versa.\" [9] [10] The series is The Boys version of the big 'event' storylines but, according to Ennis \"while we're having a pop at the notion of mass crossovers within a shared universe, we're not picking on 'Crisis' or 'Secret Wars' or 'Countdown' or whatever in particular.\" [11] The idea for the mini-series came about because the first part of the story does not involve the team and focuses on the superheroes, but will affect the main series:\n\n\nPremise\nHerogasm starts off with the Homelander making a public announcement that the heroes and villains of the world have united to face an alien threat, which was responsible for destroying the G-Men They then fly off to a island resort where high class prostitutes are paid $100k to entertain them for several days and the Super Heroes and Villains largely engage in a drunken, drug fuelled Orgy as an annual all expenses paid vacation The alien threat is confirmed to not actually exist and was just for PR purposes.\n\n\nPart One: Babylon\nHerogasm starts off with

vacation The alien threat is confirmed to not actually exist and was just for PR purposes.\n\n\nPart Two: Amsterdam\nThe next day, a naked man resembling Homelander [a] destroys a passenger jet in mid air with his eye beams, killing everyone on board Afterwards, the Vought officer tells Homelander that Vic will become the president within a year, implying that they will have the President assassinated so that Vic can become president The Vought officer then talks to Payback to get them to take care of a troublesome group, implied to be The Boys, and suggests that if they are able to accomplish this, they will no longer be regarded as second best and that that they will no longer need to keep trying to join The Seven.\n\n\nPart Three: Vegas\nAt night, The Boys mount an operation They drug and throw Doofer from the Fantastico, a parody team of the Fantastic Four, off the hotel's roof to create a distraction, then abduct Agent Lucero from the Vice President's security detail Everyone present assumes Doofer overdosed on drugs and fell off the roof by himself as he has a history of using too many drugs.\n\n\nPart Four: Sparta\nAgent Lucero reveals he had some concerns about Vought's infiltration of the White House and that several members of the Vice President's security detail are actually from Vought's Red River paramilitary force, and that the last plane on 9/11 wasn't shot down because Vic had hit the President over the head with a fire extinguisher and ordered the planes be called off, so that the Seven could mount a rescue operation, which failed because they had no training and no way to fly the plane after boarding it The plane then hit the Houston Bridge, causing a far higher death toll than if it had been shot down This incident was covered up because nobody actually saw Vic hit the President, and officially the President was in full command from start to finish.\n\n\nPart Five: Hollywood\nDuring the Super Hero award ceremony, a prostitute attempts to keep the Vought Guy occupied at a bar, but he quickly discerns her true intentions and demands to know who hired her Homelander receives an award, admits he did \"something\" the other day for no reason other than because he felt he could, heavily implied to be the destruction of the passenger jet He is about to reveal that he destroyed the passenger jet when the Vought officer walks in, causing Homelander to quickly end his speech, walk off stage and destroy his award in a fit of rage Godfrey, The Vice-President's Chief of Staff who works for Vought, overhears Agent Lucero saying he might have done something to fix the problem with Red River members infilitrating the security detail, and he orders a search of the island.\n\n\nPart Six: Golgotha\nThe Boys detain the Red River members of the security detail with the help of Agents Lucero and Dubisher, another member of the US Secret Service, and order them to keep reporting that there is nothing wrong with the search every hour Herogasm ends and all the Superheroes fly off, with the smarter ones wondering what Homelander's real speech was supposed to be Eventually the Red River agents realise they will be killed once they are no longer useful, and rush Agents Lucero and Dubisher In the ensuing struggle, both agents are killed, but not before Lucero kills Godfrey Two Red River agents attempt to escape in a plane but the Female damages the aircraft, causing it to crash and kill everyone onboard The series ends with The Boys flying off with the corpse of Agent Lucero wrapped in a US Flag, and the main series

streaming television adaptation of The Boys, confirmed that Herogasm would be adapted as the sixth episode of the series' third season, featuring Jensen Ackles portraying Soldier Boy, a character introduced in Herogasm [5] Unlike the source material in which Soldier Boy is depicted as a superhero who has yearly sex with Homelander in an attempt to gain membership in The Seven, Soldier Boy was depicted as the \"Homelander before Homelander\", a superhero from World War II brought out of retirement [6] [7] In addition, the \"Herogasm\" event was held by Soldier Boy's teammates the TNT Twins at their house.\n\n\nReception\nHerogasm opened to largely positive reviews by critics In 2017, CBR ranked Herogasm as the comic book showing the fourth-most nudity in the 2000s, praising its depiction of \"bedroom proclivities that rival their inhuman abilities.\" [12] [13] Will Morgan of The Slings & Arrows praised the \"overall tone  [a]s gleeful, as Ennis strives for ever more depraved and ludicrous situations for the series’ colour-splashed supporting cast to get into, taking irreverent jabs at the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, several of Batman's Rogue's Gallery, and scores more Artist John McCrea's talent for amiable goonery has seldom been deployed to better effect; even the most horrible and heinous acts are presented with a chirpy patina which offsets the darker scenes masterfully.\" [14] Screen Rant lauded the miniseries' \"controversial\" aspects, describing it as \"a shocking storyline, even by the standards of The Boys monthly comic\" but praising the decision

{"title": "Christmas", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe English word Christmas is a shortened form of 'Christ's Mass' [3] The word is recorded as Crīstesmæsse in 1038 and Cristes-messe in 1131 [4] Crīst (genitive Crīstes) is from the Greek Χριστός (Khrīstos, 'Christ'), a translation of the Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ‎ (Māšîaḥ, 'Messiah'), meaning 'anointed'; [5] [6] and mæsse is from the Latin missa, the celebration of the Eucharist [7]\n\n\nOther names\nThe holiday has had various other English names throughout its history The Anglo-Saxons referred to the feast as \"midwinter\", [11] [12] or, more rarely, as Nātiuiteð (from the Latin nātīvitās below) [11] [13] Nativity, meaning 'birth', is from the Latin nātīvitās [14] In Old English, Gēola ('Yule') referred to the period corresponding to December and January, which was eventually equated with Christian Christmas [15] 'Noel' (also 'Nowel' or 'Nowell', as in \"The First Nowell\") entered English in the late 14th century and is from the Old French noël or naël, itself ultimately from the Latin nātālis (diēs) meaning 'birth (day)' [16]\n\n\nNativity\nThe gospels of Luke and Matthew describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary In the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem in order to be counted for a census, and Jesus is born there and placed in a manger [18] Angels proclaim him a savior for all people, and three shepherds come to adore him In the Gospel of Matthew, by contrast, three magi follow a star to Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the king of the Jews King Herod orders the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in Bethlehem, but the family flees to Egypt and later returns to Nazareth [19]\n\n\nHistory\nIn the 2nd century, the \"earliest church records\" indicate that \"Christians were remembering and celebrating the birth of the Lord\", an \"observance  [that] sprang up organically from the authentic devotion of ordinary believers\"; although \"they did not agree upon a set date\" [20] The earliest evidence of Christ's birth being marked on December 25 is a sentence in the Chronograph of 354 [21] [22] [23] Liturgical historians generally agree that this part of the text was written in Rome in AD 336 [22] Though Christmas did not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and Tertullian, [4] the early Church Fathers John Chrysostom, Augustine of Hippo, and Jerome attested to December 25 as the date of Christmas toward the end of the fourth century [20] December 25 was the traditional date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire, [24] where most Christians lived, and the Roman festival Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (birthday of Sol Invictus, the 'Invincible Sun') had been held on this date since 274 AD [25]\n\n\nEarly and medieval era\nIn the 2nd century, the \"earliest church records\" indicate that \"Christians were remembering and celebrating the birth of the Lord\", an \"observance  [that] sprang up organically from the authentic devotion of ordinary believers\"; although \"they did not agree upon a set date\" [20] The earliest evidence of Christ's birth being marked on December 25 is a sentence in the Chronograph of 354 [21] [22] [23] Liturgical historians generally agree that this part of the text was written in Rome in AD 336 [22] Though Christmas did not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and Tertullian, [4] the early Church Fathers John Chrysostom, Augustine of Hippo, and Jerome attested to December 25 as the date of Christmas toward the end of the fourth century [20] December 25 was the traditional date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire, [24] where most Christians lived, and the Roman festival Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (birthday of Sol Invictus, the 'Invincible Sun') had been held on this date since 274 AD [25]\n\n\n17th and 18th centuries\nFollowing the Protestant Reformation, many of the new denominations, including the Anglican Church and Lutheran Church, continued to celebrate Christmas [39] In 1629, the Anglican poet John Milton penned On the Morning of Christ's Nativity, a poem that has since been read by many during Christmastide [40] Donald Heinz, a professor at California State University, Chico, states that Martin Luther \"inaugurated a period in which Germany would produce a unique culture of Christmas, much copied in North America.\" [41] Among the congregations of the Dutch Reformed Church, Christmas was celebrated as one of the principal evangelical feasts [42]\n\n\n19th century\nIn the early 19th century, Christmas festivities and services became widespread with the rise of the Oxford Movement in the Church of England that emphasized the centrality of Christmas in Christianity and charity to the poor, [62] along with Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, and other authors emphasizing family, children, kind-heartedness, gift-giving, and Santa Claus (for Irving), [62] or Father Christmas (for Dickens) [63]\n\n\n20th and 21st centuries\nDuring the First World War and particularly (but not exclusively) in 1914, [85] a series of informal truces took place for Christmas between opposing armies The truces, which were organised spontaneously by fighting men, ranged from promises not to shoot (shouted at a distance in order to ease the pressure of war for the day) to friendly socializing, gift giving and even sport between enemies [86] These incidents became a well known and semi-mythologised part of popular memory [87] They have been described as a symbol of common humanity even in the darkest of situations and used to demonstrate to children the ideals of Christmas [88]\n\n\nObservance and traditions\nChristmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and public holiday in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g Hong Kong); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the cultural aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees A similar example is in Turkey, being Muslim-majority and with a small number of Christians, where Christmas trees and decorations tend to line public streets during the festival [98]\n\n\nChurch attendance\nChristmas Day (inclusive of its vigil, Christmas Eve), is a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, a solemnity in the Roman Catholic Church, and a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communion Other Christian denominations do not rank their feast days but nevertheless place importance on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, as with other Christian feasts like Easter, Ascension Day, and Pentecost [109] As such, for Christians, attending a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day church service plays an important part in the recognition of the Christmas season Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance A 2010 survey by LifeWay Christian Resources found that six in ten Americans attend church services during this time [110] In the United Kingdom, the Church of England reported an estimated attendance of 2.5 million people at Christmas services in 2015 [111]\n\n\nDecorations\nNativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome They were popularised by Saint Francis of Assisi from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe [112] Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources, and can vary from simple representations of the crib to far more elaborate sets – renowned manger scene traditions include the colourful Kraków szopka in Poland, [113] which imitate Kraków's historical buildings as settings, the elaborate Italian presepi (Neapolitan  [it], Genoese  [it] and Bolognese  [it]), [114] [115] [116] [117] or the Provençal crèches in southern France, using hand-painted terracotta figurines called santons [118] In certain parts of the world, notably Sicily, living nativity scenes following the tradition of Saint Francis are a popular alternative to static crèches [119] [120] [121] The first commercially produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, inspired by paper chains made by children [122] In countries where a representation of the Nativity scene is very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family heirloom [123]\n\n\nNativity play\nFor the Christian celebration of Christmas, the viewing of the Nativity play is one of the oldest Christmastime traditions, with the first reenactment of the Nativity of Jesus taking place in 1223 AD in the Italian town of Greccio [150] In that year, Francis of Assisi assembled a Nativity scene outside of his church in Italy and children sung Christmas carols celebrating the birth of Jesus [150] Each year, this grew larger and people travelled from afar to see Francis's depiction of the Nativity of Jesus that came to feature drama and music [150] Nativity plays eventually spread throughout all of Europe, where they remain popular Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services often came to feature Nativity plays, as did schools and theatres [150] In France, Germany, Mexico and Spain, Nativity plays are often reenacted outdoors in the streets [150]\n\n\nMusic and carols\nThe earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in fourth-century Rome Latin hymns such as \"Veni redemptor gentium\", written by Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to Arianism \"Corde natus ex Parentis\" (\"Of the Father's love begotten\") by the Spanish poet Prudentius (died 413) is still sung in some churches today [151] In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas \"Sequence\" or \"Prose\" was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under Bernard of Clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional Christmas carol Christmas carols in English appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay who lists twenty five \"caroles of Cristemas\", probably sung by groups of 'wassailers', who went from house to house [152]\n\n\nTraditional cuisine\nA special Christmas family meal is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food served varies greatly from country to country Some regions have special meals for Christmas Eve, such as Sicily, where 12 kinds of fish are served In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread, and cider Special desserts are also prepared, such as Christmas pudding, mince pies, fruit cake and Yule log cake [158] [159]\n\n\nCards\nChristmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day The traditional greeting reads \"wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\", much like that of the first commercial Christmas card, produced by Sir Henry Cole in London in 1843 [163] The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging E-cards [164] [165]\n\n\nCommemorative stamps\nA number of nations have issued commemorative stamps at Christmastide [168] Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail Christmas cards, and they are popular with philatelists [169] These stamps are regular postage stamps, unlike Christmas seals, and are valid for postage year-round They usually go on sale sometime between early October and early December and are printed in considerable quantities.\n\n\nChristmas seals\nChristmas seals were first issued to raise funding to fight and bring awareness to tuberculosis The first Christmas seal was issued in Denmark in 1904, and since then other countries have issued their own Christmas seals [170]\n\n\nGift giving\nThe exchanging of gifts is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for retailers and businesses throughout the world On Christmas, people exchange gifts based on the Christian tradition associated with Saint Nicholas, [171] and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh which were given to the baby Jesus by the Magi [172] [173] The practice of gift giving in the Roman celebration of Saturnalia may have influenced Christian customs, but on the other hand the Christian \"core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event\", because it was the Biblical Magi, \"together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life.\" [174] However, Thomas J Talley holds that the Roman Emperor Aurelian placed the alternate festival on December 25 in order to compete with the growing rate of the Christian Church, which had already been celebrating Christmas on that date first [175]\n\n\nGift-bearing figures\nA number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts Among these are Father Christmas, also known as Santa Claus (derived from the Dutch for Saint Nicholas), Père Noël, and the Weihnachtsmann; Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas; the Christkind; Kris Kringle; Joulupukki; tomte/nisse; Babbo Natale; Saint Basil; and Ded Moroz The Scandinavian tomte (also called nisse) is sometimes depicted as a gnome instead of Santa Claus.\n\n\nSport\nChristmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival with annual indulgences included the sporting [38] When Puritans outlawed Christmas in England in December 1647 the crowd brought out footballs as a symbol of festive misrule [46] The Orkney Christmas Day Ba' tradition continues [184] In the former top tier of English football, home and away Christmas Day and Boxing Day double headers were often played guaranteeing football clubs large crowds by allowing many working people their only chance to watch a game [185] Champions Preston North End faced Aston Villa on Christmas Day 1889 [186] and the last December 25 fixture was in 1965 in England, Blackpool beating Blackburn Rovers 4–2 [185] One of the most memorable images of the Christmas truce during World War I was the games of football played between the opposing sides on Christmas Day 1914 [187]\n\n\nChoice of date\nThere are two main theories behind December 25 becoming the traditional date for Christmas, although Theology professor Susan Roll says that \"No liturgical historian  [...] goes so far as to deny that it has any sort of relation with the sun, the winter solstice and the popularity of solar worship in the later Roman Empire\" [190] December 25 was the date of the winter solstice in the Roman calendar [24] Some early Christian writers noted the solar symbolism in placing Jesus's birthday at the winter solstice and John's birthday at the summer solstice [25] [191]\n\n\nDate according to Julian calendar\nSome jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, including those of Russia, Georgia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Jerusalem, mark feasts using the older Julian calendar As of 2024 [update], there is a difference of 13 days between the Julian calendar and the modern Gregorian calendar, which is used internationally for most secular purposes As a result, December 25 on the Julian calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the calendar used by most governments and people in everyday life Therefore, the aforementioned Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the day that is internationally considered to be January 7 [196]\n\n\nTable of dates\nThere are four different dates used by different Christian groups to mark the birth of Christ, given in the table below.\n\n\nVenezuela\nIn September 2024, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro declared Christmas to be brought forward from December 25 to October 1 [207]\n\n\nEconomy\nChristmas is typically a peak selling season for retailers in many nations around the world since sales increase dramatically during this time as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies to celebrate In the United States, the \"Christmas shopping season\" starts as early as October [208] [209] In Canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns just before Halloween (October 31), and step up their marketing following Remembrance Day on November 11 In the UK and Ireland, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid-November, around the time when high street Christmas lights are turned on [210] [211] A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store in Liverpool, England in 1879 [212] In the United States, it has been calculated that a quarter of all personal spending takes place during the Christmas/holiday shopping season [213] Figures from the US Census Bureau reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8 billion in November 2004 to $31.9 billion in December 2004, an increase of 54 percent In other sectors, the pre-Christmas increase in spending was even greater, there being a November–December buying surge of 100 percent in bookstores and 170 percent in jewelry stores In the same year employment in American retail stores rose from 1.6 million to 1.8 million in the two months leading up to Christmas [214] Industries completely dependent on Christmas include Christmas cards, of which 1.9 billion are sent in the United States each year, and live Christmas trees, of which 20.8 million were cut in the US in 2002 [215] For 2019, the average US adult was projected to spend $920 on gifts alone [216] In the UK in 2010, up to £8 billion was expected to be spent online at Christmas, approximately a quarter of total retail festive sales [211]\n\n\nControversies\nChristmas has at times been the subject of controversy and attacks from various sources, both Christian and non-Christian Historically, it was prohibited by Puritans during their ascendency in the Commonwealth of England (1647–1660), and in Colonial New England where the Puritans outlawed the celebration of Christmas in 1659 on the grounds that Christmas was not mentioned in Scripture and therefore violated the Reformed regulative principle of worship [222] [223] The Parliament of Scotland, which was dominated by Presbyterians, passed a series of acts outlawing the observance of Christmas between 1637 and 1690; Christmas Day did not become a public holiday in Scotland until 1871 [51] [224] [225] Today, some conservative Reformed denominations such as the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America likewise reject the celebration of Christmas based on the regulative principle and what they see as its non-Scriptural origin [226] [227] Christmas celebrations have also been prohibited by atheist states such as the Soviet Union [228] and more recently majority Muslim states such as Somalia, Tajikistan and Brunei [229]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays,

celebrated by Christians around the world to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ. It is observed on December 25 and has a rich history dating back to the early Christian era. The holiday has evolved over the centuries, influenced by various cultures and traditions. Christmas is now celebrated by people of many different faiths and backgrounds, and has become a significant event in the global calendar.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe English word Christmas is a shortened form of 'Christ's Mass'. The word is recorded as Crīstesmæsse in 1038 and Cristes-messe in 1131. Crīst (genitive Crīstes) is from the Greek Χριστός (Khrīstos, 'Christ'), a translation of the Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ‎ (Māšîaḥ, 'Messiah'), meaning 'anointed'; and mæsse is from the Latin missa, the celebration of the Eucharist.\n\n**Other Names**\n\nThe holiday has had various other English names throughout its history. The Anglo-Saxons referred to the feast as \"midwinter\", or, more rarely, as Nātiuiteð (from the Latin nātīvitās below). Nativity, meaning 'birth', is from the Latin nātīvitās. In Old English, Gēola ('Yule') referred to the period corresponding to December and January, which was eventually equated with Christian Christmas. 'Noel' (also 'Nowel' or 'Nowell', as in \"The First Nowell\") entered English in the late 14th century and is from the Old French noël or naël, itself ultimately from the Latin nātālis (diēs) meaning 'birth (day)'.\n\n**Nativity**\n\nThe gospels of Luke and Matthew describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary. In the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem in order to be counted for a census, and Jesus is born there and placed in a manger. Angels proclaim him a savior for all people, and three shepherds come to adore him. In the Gospel of Matthew, by contrast, three magi follow a star to Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the king of the Jews. King Herod orders the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in Bethlehem, but the family flees to Egypt and later returns to Nazareth.\n\n**History**\n\nIn the 2nd century, the \"earliest church records\" indicate that \"Christians were remembering and celebrating the birth of the Lord\", an \"observance [that] sprang up organically from the authentic devotion of ordinary believers\"; although \"they did not agree upon a set date\". The earliest evidence of Christ's birth being marked on December 25 is a sentence in the Chronograph of 354. Liturgical historians generally agree that this part of the text was written in Rome in AD 336. Though Christmas did not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and Tertullian, the early Church Fathers John Chrysostom, Augustine of Hippo, and Jerome attested to December 25 as the date of Christmas toward the end of the fourth century. December 25 was the traditional date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire, where most Christians lived, and the Roman festival Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (birthday of Sol Invictus, the 'Invincible Sun') had been held on this date since 274 AD.\n\n**Early and Medieval Era**\n\nIn the 2nd century, the \"earliest church records\" indicate that \"Christians were remembering and celebrating the birth of the Lord\", an \"observance [that] sprang up organically from the authentic devotion of ordinary believers\"; although \"they did not agree upon a set date\".

In 1629, the Anglican poet John Milton penned On the Morning of Christ's Nativity, a poem that has since been read by many during Christmastide. Donald Heinz, a professor at California State University, Chico, states that Martin Luther \"inaugurated a period in which Germany would produce a unique culture of Christmas, much copied in North America.\" Among the congregations of the Dutch Reformed Church, Christmas was celebrated as one of the principal evangelical feasts.\n\n**19th Century**\n\nIn the early 19th century, Christmas festivities and services became widespread with the rise of the Oxford Movement in the Church of England that emphasized the centrality of Christmas in Christianity and charity to the poor, along with Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, and other authors emphasizing family, children, kind-heartedness, gift-giving, and Santa Claus (for Irving), or Father Christmas (for Dickens).\n\n**20th and 21st Centuries**\n\nDuring the First World War and particularly (but not exclusively) in 1914, a series of informal truces took place for Christmas between opposing armies. The truces, which were organised spontaneously by fighting men, ranged from promises not to shoot (shouted at a distance in order to ease the pressure of war for the day) to friendly socializing, gift giving and even sport between enemies. These incidents became a well-known and semi-mythologized part of popular memory. They have been described as a symbol of common humanity even in the darkest of situations and used to demonstrate to children the ideals of Christmas.\n\n**Observance and Traditions**\n\nChristmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and public holiday in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. Hong Kong); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the cultural aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees. A similar example is in Turkey, being Muslim-majority and with a small number of Christians, where Christmas trees and decorations tend to line public streets during the festival.\n\n**Church Attendance**\n\nChristmas Day (inclusive of its vigil, Christmas Eve), is a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, a solemnity in the Roman Catholic Church, and a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communion. Other Christian denominations do not rank their feast days but nevertheless place importance on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, as with other Christian feasts like Easter, Ascension Day, and Pentecost. As such, for Christians, attending a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day church service plays an important part in the recognition of the Christmas season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. A 2010 survey by LifeWay Christian Resources found that six in ten Americans attend church services during this time. In the United Kingdom, the Church of England reported an estimated attendance of 2.5 million people at Christmas services in 2015.\n\n**Decorations**\n\nNativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome. They were popularized by Saint Francis of Assisi from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe. Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources, and can vary from simple representations of the crib to far more elaborate sets. Renowned manger scene traditions include the colorful Kraków szopka in Poland, which imitate Kraków's historical buildings as settings, the elaborate Italian presepi (Neapolitan, Genoese, and Bolognese), or the Provençal crèches in southern France, using hand-painted terracotta figurines called santons. In certain parts of the world, notably Sicily, living nativity scenes following the tradition of Saint Francis are a popular alternative to static crèches.\n\n**Nativity Play**\n\nFor the Christian celebration of Christmas, the viewing of the Nativity play is one of the oldest Christmastime traditions. The first reenactment of the Nativity of Jesus took place in 1223 AD in the Italian town of Greccio. In that year, Francis of Assisi assembled a Nativity scene outside of his church in Italy and children sang Christmas carols celebrating the birth of Jesus. Each year, this grew larger and people traveled from afar to see Francis's depiction of the Nativity of Jesus that came to feature drama and music. Nativity plays eventually spread throughout all of Europe, where they remain popular Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services often came to feature Nativity plays, as did schools and theaters. In France, Germany, Mexico, and Spain, Nativity plays are often reenacted outdoors in the streets.\n\n**Music and Carols**\n\nThe earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in fourth-century Rome. Latin hymns such as \"Veni redemptor gentium,\" written by Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to Arianism. \"Corde natus ex Parentis\" (\"Of the Father's love begotten\") by the Spanish poet Prudentius (died 413) is still sung in some churches today. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas \"Sequence\" or \"Prose\" was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under Bernard of Clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas. In the 12th century, the Parisian monk Adam of St Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional Christmas carol. Christmas carols in English appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay, who lists twenty-five \"caroles of Cristemas,\" probably sung by groups of 'wassailers,' who went from house to house.\n\n**Traditional Cuisine**\n\nA special Christmas family meal is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions have special meals for Christmas Eve, such as Sicily, where 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose, or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread, and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as Christmas pudding, mince pies, fruit cake, and Yule log cake.\n\n**Cards**\n\nChristmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads \"wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year,\" much like that of the first commercial Christmas card, produced by Sir Henry Cole in London in 1843. The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging E-cards.\n\n**Commemorative Stamps**\n\nA number of nations have issued commemorative stamps at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail Christmas cards, and they are popular with philatelists. These stamps are regular postage stamps, unlike Christmas seals, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale sometime between early October and early December and are printed in considerable quantities.\n\n**Gift Giving**\n\nThe exchanging of gifts is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for retailers and businesses throughout the world. On Christmas, people exchange gifts based on the Christian tradition associated with Saint Nicholas, and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh which were given to the baby Jesus by the Magi. The practice of gift giving in the Roman celebration of Saturnalia may have influenced Christian customs, but on the other hand, the Christian \"core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event.\" However, Thomas J Talley holds that the Roman Emperor Aurelian placed the alternate festival on December 25 in order to compete with the growing rate of the Christian Church, which had already been celebrating Christmas on that date first.\n\n**Gift-Bearing Figures**\n\nA number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are Father Christmas, also known as Santa Claus (derived from the Dutch for Saint Nicholas), Père Noël, and the Weihnachtsmann; Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas; the Christkind; Kris Kringle; Joulupukki; tomte/nisse; Babbo Natale; Saint Basil; and Ded Moroz. The Scandinavian tomte (also called nisse) is sometimes depicted as a gnome instead of Santa Claus.\n\n**Sport**\n\nChristmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival with annual indulgences included the sporting. When Puritans outlawed Christmas in England in December 1647, the crowd brought out footballs as a symbol of festive misrule. The Orkney Christmas Day Ba' tradition continues. In the former top tier of English football, home and away Christmas Day and Boxing Day double headers were often played, guaranteeing football clubs large crowds by allowing many working people their only chance to watch a game. Champions Preston North End faced Aston Villa on Christmas Day 1889, and the last December 25 fixture was in 1965 in England, Blackpool beating Blackburn Rovers 4–2. One of the most memorable images of the Christmas truce during World War I was the games of football played between the opposing sides on Christmas Day 1914.\n\n**Choice of Date**\n\nThere are two main theories behind December 25 becoming the traditional date for Christmas, although Theology professor Susan Roll says that \"No liturgical historian [...goes] so far as to deny that it has any sort of relation with the sun, the winter solstice, and the popularity of solar worship in the later Roman Empire.\" December 25 was the date of the winter solstice in the Roman calendar. Some early Christian writers noted the solar symbolism in placing Jesus's birthday at the winter solstice and John's birthday at the summer solstice.\n\n**Date According to Julian Calendar**\n\nSome jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, including those of Russia, Georgia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Jerusalem, mark feasts using the older Julian calendar. As of 2024, there is a difference of 13 days between the Julian calendar and the modern Gregorian calendar, which is used internationally for most secular purposes. As a result, December 25 on the Julian calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the calendar used by most governments and people in everyday life. Therefore, the aforementioned Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the day that is internationally considered to be January 7.\n\n**Table of Dates**\n\nThere are four different dates used by different Christian groups to mark the birth of Christ, given in the table below.\n\n| Christian Group | Date of Birth of Christ |\n| --- | --- |\n| Western Christianity | December 25 |\n| Eastern Orthodox Church | January 7 |\n| Oriental Orthodox Church | January 6 or 7 |\n| Syriac Orthodox Church | January 6 |\n| Assyrian Church of the East | April 14 |\n\n**Venezuela**\n\nIn September 2024, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro declared Christmas to be brought forward from December 25 to October 1.\n\n**Economy**\n\nChristmas is typically a peak selling season for retailers in many nations around the world, since sales increase dramatically during this time, as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies to celebrate. In the United States, the \"Christmas shopping season\" starts as early as October. In Canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns just before Halloween (October 31), and step up their marketing following Remembrance Day on November 11. In the UK and Ireland, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid-November, around the time when high street Christmas lights are turned on.\n\nA concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store in Liverpool, England in 1879. In the United States, it has been calculated that a quarter of all personal spending takes place during the Christmas/holiday shopping season. Figures from the US Census Bureau reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8 billion in November 2004 to $31.9 billion in December 2004, an increase of 54 percent. In other sectors, the pre-Christmas increase in spending was even greater, there being a November–December buying surge of 100 percent in bookstores and 170 percent in jewelry stores.\n\nIn the same year, employment in American retail stores rose from 1.6 million to 1.8 million in the two months leading up to Christmas. Industries completely dependent on Christmas include Christmas cards, of which 1.9 billion are sent in the United States each year, and live Christmas trees, of which 20.8 million were cut in the US in 2002. For 2019, the average US adult was projected to spend $920 on gifts alone.\n\nIn the UK in 2010, up to £8 billion was expected to be spent online at Christmas, approximately a quarter of total retail festive sales.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nChristmas has at times been the subject of controversy and attacks from various sources, both Christian and non-Christian. Historically, it was prohibited by Puritans during their ascendency in the Commonwealth of England (1647–1660), and in Colonial New England where the Puritans outlawed the celebration of Christmas in 1659 on the grounds that Christmas was not mentioned in Scripture and therefore violated the Reformed regulative principle of worship.\n\nThe Parliament of Scotland, which was dominated by Presbyterians, passed a series of acts outlawing the observance of Christmas between 1637 and 1690; Christmas Day did not become a public holiday in Scotland until 1871. Today, some conservative Reformed denominations such as the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America likewise reject the celebration of Christmas based on the regulative principle and what they see as its non-Scriptural origin.\n\nChristmas celebrations have also been prohibited by atheist states such as the Soviet Union and more recently majority Muslim states such as Somalia, Tajikistan, and Brunei.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Christmas Day\n* Christmas Eve\n* Advent\n* Epiphany\n* Twelfth Night\n* Nativity play\n* Christmas carols\n* Christmas music\n* Christmas traditions\n* Christmas decorations\n* Christmas lights\n* Christmas trees\n* Christmas stockings\n* Christmas cards\n* Christmas seals\n* Christmas stamps\n* Christmas gift-giving\n* Christmas Day in popular culture\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Christmas\".

shortened form of 'Christ's Mass' [3] The word is recorded as Crīstesmæsse in 1038 and Cristes-messe in 1131 [4] Crīst (genitive Crīstes) is from the Greek Χριστός (Khrīstos, 'Christ'), a translation of the Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ‎ (Māšîaḥ, 'Messiah'), meaning 'anointed'; [5] [6] and mæsse is from the Latin missa, the celebration of the Eucharist [7]\n\n\nOther names\nThe holiday has had various other English names throughout its history The Anglo-Saxons referred to the feast as \"midwinter\", [11] [12] or, more rarely, as Nātiuiteð (from the Latin nātīvitās below) [11] [13] Nativity, meaning 'birth', is from the Latin nātīvitās [14] In Old English, Gēola ('Yule') referred to the period corresponding to December and January, which was eventually equated with Christian Christmas [15] 'Noel' (also 'Nowel' or 'Nowell', as in \"The First Nowell\") entered English in the late 14th century and is from the Old French noël or naël, itself ultimately from the Latin nātālis (diēs) meaning 'birth (day)' [16]\n\n\nNativity\nThe gospels of Luke and Matthew describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary In the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem in order to be counted for a census, and Jesus is born there and placed in a manger [18] Angels proclaim him a savior for all people, and three shepherds come to adore him In the Gospel of Matthew, by contrast, three magi follow a star to Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the king of the Jews King Herod orders the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in Bethlehem, but the family flees to Egypt and later returns to Nazareth [19]\n\n\nHistory\nIn the 2nd century, the \"earliest church records\" indicate that \"Christians were remembering and celebrating the birth of the Lord\", an \"observance  [that] sprang up organically from the authentic devotion of ordinary believers\"; although \"they did not agree upon a set date\" [20] The earliest evidence of Christ's birth being marked on December 25 is a sentence in the Chronograph of 354 [21] [22] [23] Liturgical historians generally agree that this part of the text was written in Rome in AD 336 [22] Though Christmas did not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and Tertullian, [4] the early Church Fathers John Chrysostom, Augustine of Hippo, and Jerome attested to December 25 as the date of Christmas toward the end of the fourth century [20] December 25 was the traditional date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire, [24] where most Christians lived, and the Roman festival Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (birthday of Sol Invictus, the 'Invincible Sun') had been held on this date since 274 AD [25]\n\n\nEarly and medieval era\nIn the 2nd century, the \"earliest church records\" indicate that \"Christians were remembering and celebrating the birth of the Lord\", an \"observance  [that] sprang up organically from the authentic devotion of ordinary believers\";

this date since 274 AD [25]\n\n\n17th and 18th centuries\nFollowing the Protestant Reformation, many of the new denominations, including the Anglican Church and Lutheran Church, continued to celebrate Christmas [39] In 1629, the Anglican poet John Milton penned On the Morning of Christ's Nativity, a poem that has since been read by many during Christmastide [40] Donald Heinz, a professor at California State University, Chico, states that Martin Luther \"inaugurated a period in which Germany would produce a unique culture of Christmas, much copied in North America.\" [41] Among the congregations of the Dutch Reformed Church, Christmas was celebrated as one of the principal evangelical feasts [42]\n\n\n19th century\nIn the early 19th century, Christmas festivities and services became widespread with the rise of the Oxford Movement in the Church of England that emphasized the centrality of Christmas in Christianity and charity to the poor, [62] along with Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, and other authors emphasizing family, children, kind-heartedness, gift-giving, and Santa Claus (for Irving), [62] or Father Christmas (for Dickens) [63]\n\n\n20th and 21st centuries\nDuring the First World War and particularly (but not exclusively) in 1914, [85] a series of informal truces took place for Christmas between opposing armies The truces, which were organised spontaneously by fighting men, ranged from promises not to shoot (shouted at a distance in order to ease the pressure of war for the day) to friendly socializing, gift giving and even sport between enemies [86] These incidents became a well known and semi-mythologised part of popular memory [87] They have been described as a symbol of common humanity even in the darkest of situations and used to demonstrate to children the ideals of Christmas [88]\n\n\nObservance and traditions\nChristmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and public holiday in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g Hong Kong); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the cultural aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees A similar example is in Turkey, being Muslim-majority and with a small number of Christians, where Christmas trees and decorations tend to line public streets during the festival [98]\n\n\nChurch attendance\nChristmas Day (inclusive of its vigil, Christmas Eve), is a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, a solemnity in the Roman Catholic Church, and a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communion Other Christian denominations do not rank their feast days but nevertheless place importance on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, as with other Christian feasts like Easter, Ascension Day, and Pentecost [109] As such, for Christians, attending a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day church service plays an important part in the recognition of the Christmas season Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance A 2010 survey by LifeWay Christian Resources found that six in ten Americans attend church services during this time [110] In the United Kingdom, the Church of England reported an estimated attendance of 2.5 million people at Christmas services in 2015 [111]\n\n\nDecorations\nNativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome They were popularised by Saint Francis of Assisi from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe [112] Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources, and can vary from simple representations of the crib to far more elaborate sets – renowned manger scene traditions include the colourful Kraków szopka in Poland, [113] which imitate Kraków's historical buildings as settings, the elaborate Italian presepi (Neapolitan  [it], Genoese  [it] and Bolognese  [it]), [114] [115] [116] [117] or the Provençal crèches in southern France, using hand-painted terracotta figurines called santons [118] In certain parts of the world, notably Sicily, living nativity scenes following the tradition of Saint Francis are a popular alternative to static crèches [119] [120] [121] The first commercially produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, inspired by paper chains made by children [122] In countries where a representation of the Nativity scene is very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family heirloom [123]\n\n\nNativity play\nFor the Christian celebration of Christmas, the viewing of the Nativity play is one of the oldest Christmastime traditions, with the first reenactment of the Nativity of Jesus taking place in 1223 AD in the Italian town of Greccio [150] In that

seals\nChristmas seals were first issued to raise funding to fight and bring awareness to tuberculosis The first Christmas seal was issued in Denmark in 1904, and since then other countries have issued their own Christmas seals [170]\n\n\nGift giving\nThe exchanging of gifts is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for retailers and businesses throughout the world On Christmas, people exchange gifts based on the Christian tradition associated with Saint Nicholas, [171] and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh which were given to the baby Jesus by the Magi [172] [173] The practice of gift giving in the Roman celebration of Saturnalia may have influenced Christian customs, but on the other hand the Christian \"core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event\", because it was the Biblical Magi, \"together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life.\" [174] However, Thomas J Talley holds that the Roman Emperor Aurelian placed the alternate festival on December 25 in order to compete with the growing rate of the Christian Church, which had already been celebrating Christmas on that date first [175]\n\n\nGift-bearing figures\nA number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts Among these are Father Christmas, also known as Santa Claus (derived from the Dutch for Saint Nicholas), Père Noël, and the Weihnachtsmann; Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas; the Christkind; Kris Kringle; Joulupukki; tomte/nisse; Babbo Natale; Saint Basil; and Ded Moroz The Scandinavian tomte (also called

he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people, white for purity, and green for hope [17]\n\n\nFinal adoption\nA few days before India gained its independence in August 1947, the Constituent Assembly was formed To select a flag for independent India, on 23 June 1947, the assembly set up an ad hoc committee headed by Rajendra Prasad and including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sarojini Naidu, C Rajagopalachari, K M Munshi and B R Ambedkar as its members [21]\n\n\nTimeline of official flags\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2 All three horizontal bands of the flag (saffron, white and green) are equally sized The Ashoka Chakra has twenty-four evenly spaced spokes [21]\n\n\nState flags\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2 All three horizontal bands of the flag (saffron, white and green) are equally sized The Ashoka Chakra has twenty-four evenly spaced spokes [21]\n\n\nArmy flags\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2 All three horizontal bands of the flag (saffron, white and green) are equally sized The Ashoka Chakra has twenty-four evenly spaced spokes [21]\n\n\nNavy flags\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2 All three horizontal bands of the flag (saffron, white and green) are equally sized The Ashoka Chakra has twenty-four evenly spaced spokes [21]\n\n\nAir force flags\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2 All three horizontal bands of the flag (saffron, white and green) are equally sized The Ashoka Chakra has twenty-four evenly spaced spokes [21]\n\n\nCivil and state ensigns\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2 All three horizontal bands of the flag (saffron, white and green) are equally sized The Ashoka Chakra has twenty-four evenly spaced spokes [21]\n\n\nDesign\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2 All three horizontal bands of the flag (saffron, white and green) are equally sized The Ashoka Chakra has twenty-four evenly spaced spokes [21]\n\n\nSpecifications\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2 All three horizontal bands of the flag (saffron, white and green) are equally sized The Ashoka Chakra has twenty-four evenly spaced spokes [21]\n\n\nConstruction Sheets\nBoth the Flag code and IS1 call for the Ashoka Chakra to be printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue [26] [21] Below is the list of specified shades for all colours used on the national flag, with the exception of navy blue, from \"IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag\" as defined in the 1931 CIE Colour Specifications with illuminant C [26] The navy blue colour can be found in the standard IS:1803–1973 [26]\n\n\nColours\nBoth the Flag code and IS1 call for the Ashoka Chakra to be printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue [26] [21] Below is the list of specified shades for all colours used on the national flag, with the exception of navy blue, from \"IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag\" as defined in the 1931 CIE Colour Specifications with illuminant C [26] The navy blue colour can be found in the standard IS:1803–1973 [26]\n\n\nSymbolism\nGandhi first proposed a flag to the Indian National Congress in 1921 The flag was designed by Pingali Venkayya In the centre was a traditional spinning wheel, symbolising Gandhi's goal of making Indians self-reliant by fabricating their own clothing, between a red stripe for Hindus and a green stripe for Muslims The design was then modified to replace red with saffron and to include a white stripe in the centre for other religious communities (as well to symbolise peace between the communities) and provide a background for the spinning wheel However, to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme, the three bands were later reassigned new meanings: courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively [31]\n\n\nProtocol\nDisplay and usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 (successor to the Flag Code – India, the original flag code);

all other flags remain at normal height.\n\n\nManufacturing process\nThe design and manufacturing process for the national flag is regulated by three documents issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) All of the flags are made out of khadi cloth of silk or cotton The standards were created in 1968 and were updated in 2008 [38] Nine standard sizes of the flag are specified by law [27]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCited Sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Flag of India**\n\nThe flag of India, also known as the Tiranga, is a horizontal tricolor of saffron, white, and green, with a blue chakra in the center. The flag is a symbol of the country's rich history, culture, and values. The design of the flag was chosen through a series of events and decisions that reflect the country's struggle for independence and its commitment to democracy and secularism.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea of a single Indian flag was first raised by the British rulers of India after the rebellion of 1857, which resulted in the establishment of direct imperial rule. The first flag, whose design was based on western heraldic standards, was similar to the flags of other British colonies, including Canada and South Africa.

Subsequently, all the Indian princely states received flags with symbols based on the heraldic criteria of Europe, including the right to fly defaced British red ensigns.\n\n**Pre-independence movement**\n\nA number of flags with varying designs were used in the period preceding the Indian independence movement by the rulers of different princely states. In 1921, Mahatma Gandhi wrote in his journal Young India about the need for an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the charkha or spinning wheel at the center.

This flag symbolized independence. During the French Revolution, in 1790, Le Tricolore, a blue, white, and red flag, was adopted to symbolize republicanism. The flag of the Netherlands inspired the flag of France, which in turn inspired many further tricolour flags in countries around the world.\n\n**Gandhi's activism**\n\nIn 1921, Gandhi proposed a flag to the Indian National Congress, which was designed by Pingali Venkayya. The flag was composed of three horizontal stripes of red, white, and green, with a spinning wheel in the center. The design was meant to represent the country's struggle for independence and its commitment to self-reliance.\n\nHowever, to avoid sectarian associations with the color scheme, the three bands were later reassigned new meanings: courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively. The flag was later modified to include a blue chakra in the center, which was meant to represent the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\n**Final adoption**\n\nA few days before India gained its independence in August 1947, the Constituent Assembly was formed to select a flag for independent India. On June 23, 1947, the assembly set up an ad hoc committee headed by Rajendra Prasad and including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sarojini Naidu, C Rajagopalachari, K M Munshi, and B R Ambedkar as its members.\n\nThe committee reviewed the proposals for the flag and decided to adopt the design that was proposed by Pingali Venkayya in 1921, with some modifications. The flag was officially adopted on July 22, 1947, and was first hoisted on August 15, 1947, at the Red Fort in Delhi.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe flag of India is a horizontal tricolor of saffron, white, and green, with a blue chakra in the center. The saffron color represents courage and sacrifice, the white color represents peace and truth, and the green color represents faith and chivalry. The blue chakra represents the country's rich cultural heritage and its commitment to democracy and secularism.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe flag of India is specified by the Flag Code of India, which outlines the rules and regulations for the display and use of the flag. The flag is made of khadi cloth of silk or cotton and is manufactured according to the standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).\n\nThe flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2 and has three horizontal bands of equal size. The Ashoka Chakra is printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue, and the colors of the flag are specified by the IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag.\n\n**Manufacturing process**\n\nThe manufacturing process for the national flag is regulated by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and involves several steps. The flag is made of khadi cloth of silk or cotton, and the colors are specified by the IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag.\n\nThe flag is manufactured according to the standards set by the BIS, and the Ashoka Chakra is printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue. The flag is then folded and packaged for distribution to various government institutions and organizations.\n\n**Display**\n\nThe flag of India is displayed on various occasions, including national holidays, international events, and government functions. The flag is hoisted on flagpoles or flown from aircraft, and it is displayed in public places such as schools, offices, and government buildings.\n\nThe flag is also displayed in a special way on certain occasions, such as the Republic Day and Independence Day celebrations. On these occasions, the flag is displayed in a rectangular shape with the saffron color on top and the green color on the bottom.\n\n**Half-mast**\n\nThe flag of India is flown at half-mast on certain occasions, such as the death of a national leader or a state funeral. The flag is flown at half-mast as a sign of respect and mourning, and it is flown for a specified period of time.\n\nOnly the Indian flag is flown at half-mast, and all other flags remain at normal height. The decision to fly the flag at half-mast is made by the President of India, who also decides the period of time for which the flag will be flown at half-mast.\n\n**Protocol**\n\nThe display and use of the flag of India are governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 (successor to the Flag Code – India, the original flag code); the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honor Act, 1971.\n\nInsults to the national flag, including gross affronts or indignities to it, as well as using it in a manner so as to violate the provisions of the Flag Code, are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Indian National Congress\n* Mahatma Gandhi\n* Pingali Venkayya\n* Flag Code of India\n* Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)\n* Ashoka Chakra\n* Saffron\n* White\n* Green\n* Blue\n* Navy blue\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The flag of India is a symbol of the country's rich history, culture, and values.\n* The design of the flag was chosen through a series of events and decisions that reflect the country's struggle for independence and its commitment to democracy and secularism.\n* The flag is made of khadi cloth of silk or cotton and is manufactured according to the standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).\n* The flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2 and has three horizontal bands of equal size.\n* The Ashoka Chakra is printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue, and the colors of the flag are specified by the IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag.\n\n**References**\n\n* Indian National Congress.

Italian American to make the film \"ethnic to the core\" [23] [24] Paramount's latest mafia movie, The Brotherhood, had done very poorly at the box office; [11] [25] Evans believed that the reason for

first choice to direct the film [26] [27] Leone turned down the option, in order to work on his own gangster film Once Upon a Time in America [26] [27] Peter Bogdanovich was then approached but he also declined the offer because he was not interested in the mafia [28] [29] [30] In addition, Peter Yates, Richard Brooks, Arthur Penn, Franklin J Schaffner, Costa-Gavras, and Otto Preminger were all offered the position and declined [31] [32] [33] Evans' chief assistant Peter Bart suggested Francis Ford Coppola, as a director of Italian ancestry who would work for a low sum and budget after the poor performance of his latest film The Rain People [34] [23] Coppola initially turned down the job because he found Puzo's novel sleazy and sensationalist, describing it as \"pretty cheap stuff\" [15] [35] At the time Coppola's studio, American Zoetrope, [36] owed over $400,000 to Warner Bros for budget overruns with the film THX 1138 and when coupled with his poor financial standing, along with advice from friends and family, Coppola reversed his initial decision and took the job [32] [37] [38] [39] Coppola was officially announced as director of the film on September 28, 1970 [40]  Coppola agreed to receive $125,000 and six percent of the gross rentals [41] [42] Coppola later found a deeper theme for the material and decided that the film should not be about organized crime but a family chronicle, a metaphor for capitalism in America [23]\n\n\nCoppola and Paramount\nBefore The Godfather was in production, Paramount had been going through an unsuccessful period [11] In addition to the failure of The Brotherhood, other recent films that were produced or co-produced by Paramount had greatly exceeded their budgets: Darling Lili, [21] Paint Your Wagon, and Waterloo [11] [25] The budget for the film was originally $2.5 million but as the book grew in popularity Coppola argued for and ultimately received a larger budget [N 1] [31] [43] [45] Paramount executives wanted the movie to be set in contemporary Kansas City and shot in the studio backlot in order to cut down on costs [31] [21] [43] Coppola objected and wanted to set the movie in the same time period as the novel, the 1940s and 1950s; [21] [31] [38] [40] Coppola's reasons included Michael Corleone's spell in the wartime Marine Corps, the emergence of corporate America, and America in the years after World War II [40] The novel was becoming increasingly successful and so Coppola's wishes were eventually granted [21] [43] The studio heads subsequently let Coppola film on location in New York City and Sicily [51]\n\n\nWriting\nOn April 14, 1970, it was revealed that Puzo was hired by Paramount for $100,000, along with a percentage of the film's profits, to work on the screenplay for the film [22] [56] [57] Working from the book, Coppola wanted to have the themes of culture, character, power, and family at the forefront of the film, whereas Puzo wanted to retain aspects from his novel [58] and his initial draft of 150 pages was finished on August 10, 1970 [56] [57] After Coppola was hired as director, both Puzo and Coppola worked on the screenplay, but separately [59] Puzo worked on his draft in Los Angeles, while Coppola wrote his version in San Francisco [59] Coppola created a book where he tore pages out of Puzo's book and pasted them into his book [60] [59] There, he made notes about each of the book's fifty scenes, which related to major themes prevalent in the scene, whether the scene should be included in the film, along with ideas and concepts that could be used when filming to make the film true to Italian culture [59] [52] The two remained in contact while they wrote their respective screenplays and made decisions on what to include and what to remove for the final version [59] A second draft was completed on March 1, 1971, and was 173 pages long [56] [61] The final screenplay was finished on March 29, 1971, [57] and wound up being 163 pages long, [56] [59] 40 pages over what Paramount had asked for [62] When filming, Coppola referred to the notebook he had created over the final draft of the screenplay [59] [52] Screenwriter Robert Towne did uncredited work on the script, particularly on the Pacino-Brando garden scene [63] Despite finishing the third draft, some scenes in the film were still not written yet and were written during production [64]\n\n\nCasting\nPuzo was first to show interest in having Marlon Brando portray Don Vito Corleone by sending a letter to Brando in which he stated Brando was the \"only actor who can play the Godfather\" [70] Despite Puzo's wishes, the executives at Paramount were against having Brando, [36] partly because of the poor performance of his recent films and also his short temper [43] [71] Brando was hesitant about getting back into acting, but his secretary Alice Marchak persuaded him to audition [72] Coppola favored Brando or Laurence Olivier for the role, [73] [74] but Olivier's agent refused the role claiming Olivier was sick; [75] however, Olivier went on to star in Sleuth later that year [74] Evans pushed for either Carlo Ponti or Ernest Borgnine to receive the part [73] [76] Bluhdorn proposed Charles Bronson for the role [76] Others considered were George C Scott, Richard Conte, Anthony Quinn and Orson Welles [73] [77] [78] Welles was Paramount's preferred choice for the role [79]\n\n\nFilming\nBefore the filming began, the cast received a two-week period for rehearsal, which included a dinner where each actor and actress had to assume character for its duration [122] Filming was scheduled to begin on March 29, 1971, with the scene between Michael Corleone and Kay Adams as they leave Best & Co in New York City after shopping for Christmas gifts [123] [124] The weather on March 23 predicted snow flurries, which caused Ruddy to move the filming date forward; snow did not materialize and a snow machine was used [124] Principal filming in New York continued until July 2, 1971 [125] [126] Coppola asked for a three-week break before heading overseas to film in Sicily [125] Following the crew's departure for Sicily, Paramount announced that the release date would be moved to early 1972 [127]\n\n\nMusic\nCoppola hired Italian composer Nino Rota to create the underscore for the film, including \"Love Theme from The Godfather\" [157] [158] For the score, Rota was to relate to the situations and characters in the film [157] [158] Rota synthesized new music for the film and took some parts from his 1958 Fortunella film score, in order to create an Italian feel and evoke the tragedy within the film [159] Paramount executive Evans found the score to be too \"highbrow\" and did not want to use it; however, it was used after Coppola managed to get Evans to agree [157] [158] Coppola believed that Rota's musical piece gave the film even more of an Italian feel [158] Coppola's father, Carmine, created some additional music for the film, [160] particularly the music played by the band during the opening wedding scene [158] [159]\n\n\nRelease\nThe world premiere for The Godfather took place at Loews's State Theatre in New York City on Tuesday, March 14, 1972, almost three months after the planned release date of Christmas Day in 1971, [167] [168] [8] with profits from the premiere donated to The Boys Club of New York [169] Before the film premiered, the film had already made $15 million from advance rentals from over 400 theaters [43] The following day, [36] the film opened in five theaters in New York (Loew's State I and II, Orpheum, Cine and Tower East) [170] [23] [8] Next was the Imperial Theatre in Toronto [167] on March 17 [171] and then Los Angeles at two theaters on March 22 [172] The Godfather was released on March 24, 1972, throughout the rest of the United States [170] [8] reaching 316 theaters five days later [173]\n\n\nTheatrical\nThe world premiere for The Godfather took place at Loews's State Theatre in

$10 million to NBC for one showing over two nights [174] The theatrical version of The Godfather debuted on American network television on NBC with only minor edits [175] The first half of the film aired on Saturday, November 16, 1974, and the second half two days later [176] The television airings attracted a large audience with an average Nielsen rating of 38.2 and audience share of 59% making it the eighth most-watched film on television, with the broadcast of the second half getting the third-best rating for a film on TV behind Airport and Love Story with a rating of 39.4 and 57% share [176] The broadcast helped generate anticipation for the upcoming sequel [175] The next year, Coppola created The Godfather Saga expressly for American television in a release that combined The Godfather and The Godfather Part II with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its NBC debut on November 18, 1977 [177] In 1981, Paramount released the Godfather Epic boxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities [177] The Godfather Trilogy was released in 1992, in which the films are fundamentally in chronological order [178]\n\n\nThe Godfather: The Coppola Restoration\nDuring the film's original theatrical release, the original negatives were worn down due to the reel being printed so much to meet demand [181] [182] In addition, the duplicate negative was lost in Paramount archives [182] In 2006 Coppola contacted Steven Spielberg—whose studio DreamWorks had recently been bought out by Paramount—about restoring The Godfather [181] [182] Robert A Harris was hired to oversee the restoration of The Godfather and its two sequels, with the film's cinematographer Willis participating in the restoration [183] [184] Work began in November 2006 by repairing the negatives so they could go through a digital scanner to produce high-resolution 4K files If a negative were damaged and discolored, work was done digitally to restore it to its original look [181] [182] After a year and a half of working on the restoration, the project was complete [182] Paramount called the finished product The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration and released it to the public on September 23, 2008, on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc [183] [184] Dave Kehr of The New York Times believed the restoration brought back the \"golden glow of their original theatrical screenings\" [183] As a whole, the restoration of the film was well received by critics and Coppola [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration contains several new special features that play in high definition, (including additional scenes, behind the scenes footage, etc.) [185]\n\n\nReception\nThe Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film

of showings increased from four times a day to seven times a day [167] The film grossed $61,615 in Toronto for the weekend [167] and $240,780 in New York, [188] for an opening weekend gross of

million, the fastest film to reach that milestone [194] [195] Some news articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America, [172] but such accounts are erroneous; this record belongs to The Sound of Music, released in 1965 [196] It remained at number one in the US for another five weeks to bring its total to 23 consecutive weeks at number one before

the picture to be directed by an Italian American to make the film \"ethnic to the core\" [23] [24] Paramount's latest mafia movie, The Brotherhood, had done very poorly at the box office; [11] [25] Evans believed that the reason for its failure was its almost complete lack of cast members or creative personnel of Italian descent (the director Martin Ritt and star Kirk Douglas were not Italian) [15] Sergio Leone was Paramount's first choice to direct the film [26] [27] Leone turned down the option, in order to work on his own gangster film Once Upon a Time in America [26] [27] Peter Bogdanovich was then approached but he also declined the offer because he was not interested in the mafia [28] [29] [30] In addition, Peter Yates, Richard Brooks, Arthur Penn, Franklin J Schaffner, Costa-Gavras, and Otto Preminger were all offered the position and declined [31] [32] [33] Evans' chief assistant Peter Bart suggested Francis Ford Coppola, as a director of Italian ancestry who would work for a low sum and budget after the poor performance of his latest film The Rain People [34] [23] Coppola initially turned down the job because he found Puzo's novel sleazy and sensationalist, describing it as \"pretty cheap stuff\" [15] [35] At the time Coppola's studio, American Zoetrope, [36] owed over $400,000 to Warner Bros for budget overruns with the film THX 1138 and when coupled with his poor financial standing, along with advice from friends and family, Coppola reversed his initial decision and took the job [32] [37] [38] [39] Coppola was officially announced as director of

through an unsuccessful period [11] In addition to the failure of The Brotherhood, other recent films that were produced or co-produced by Paramount had greatly exceeded their budgets: Darling Lili,

set the movie in the same time period as the novel, the 1940s and 1950s; [21] [31] [38] [40] Coppola's reasons included Michael Corleone's spell in the wartime Marine Corps, the emergence of corporate America, and America in the years after World War II [40] The novel was becoming increasingly successful and so Coppola's wishes were eventually granted [21] [43] The studio heads subsequently let Coppola film on location in New York City and Sicily [51]\n\n\nWriting\nOn April 14, 1970, it was revealed that Puzo was hired by Paramount for $100,000, along with a percentage of the film's profits, to work on the screenplay for the film [22] [56] [57] Working from the book, Coppola wanted to have the themes of culture, character, power, and family at the forefront of the film, whereas Puzo wanted to retain aspects from his novel [58] and his initial draft of 150 pages was finished on August 10, 1970 [56] [57] After Coppola was hired as director, both Puzo and Coppola worked on the screenplay, but separately [59] Puzo worked on his draft in Los Angeles, while Coppola wrote his version in San Francisco [59] Coppola created a book where he tore pages out of Puzo's book and pasted them into his book [60] [59] There, he made notes about each of the book's fifty scenes, which related to major themes prevalent in the scene, whether the scene should be included in the film, along with ideas and concepts that could be used when filming to make the film true to Italian culture [59] [52] The two remained in contact while they wrote their respective screenplays and made decisions on what to include and what to remove for the final version [59] A second draft was completed on March 1, 1971, and was 173 pages long [56] [61] The final screenplay was finished on March 29, 1971, [57] and wound up being 163 pages long, [56] [59] 40 pages over what Paramount had asked for [62] When filming, Coppola referred to the notebook he had created over the final draft of the screenplay [59] [52] Screenwriter Robert Towne did uncredited work on the script, particularly on the Pacino-Brando garden scene [63] Despite finishing the third draft, some scenes in the film were still not written yet and were written during production [64]\n\n\nCasting\nPuzo was first to show interest in having Marlon Brando portray Don Vito Corleone by sending a letter to Brando in which he stated Brando was the \"only actor who can play the Godfather\" [70] Despite Puzo's wishes, the executives at Paramount were against having Brando, [36] partly because of the poor performance of his recent films and also his short temper [43] [71] Brando was hesitant about getting back into acting, but his secretary Alice Marchak persuaded him to audition [72] Coppola favored Brando or Laurence Olivier for the role, [73] [74] but Olivier's agent refused the role claiming Olivier was sick; [75] however, Olivier went on to star in Sleuth later that year [74] Evans pushed for either Carlo Ponti or Ernest Borgnine to receive the part [73] [76] Bluhdorn proposed Charles Bronson for the role [76] Others considered were George C Scott, Richard Conte, Anthony Quinn and Orson Welles [73] [77] [78] Welles was Paramount's preferred choice for the role [79]\n\n\nFilming\nBefore the filming began, the cast received a two-week period for rehearsal, which included a dinner where each actor and actress had to assume character for its duration [122] Filming was scheduled to begin on March 29, 1971, with the scene between Michael Corleone and Kay Adams as they leave Best & Co in New York City after shopping for Christmas gifts [123] [124] The weather on March 23 predicted snow flurries, which caused Ruddy to move the filming date forward; snow did not materialize and a snow machine was used [124] Principal filming in New York continued until July 2, 1971 [125] [126] Coppola asked for a three-week break before heading overseas to film in Sicily [125] Following the crew's departure for Sicily, Paramount announced that the release date would be moved to early 1972 [127]\n\n\nMusic\nCoppola hired Italian composer Nino Rota to create the underscore for the film, including \"Love Theme from The Godfather\" [157] [158] For the score, Rota was to relate to the situations and characters in the film [157] [158] Rota synthesized new music for the film and took some parts from his 1958 Fortunella film score, in order to create an Italian feel and evoke the tragedy within the film [159] Paramount executive Evans found the score to be too \"highbrow\" and did not want to use it; however, it was used after Coppola managed to get Evans to agree [157] [158] Coppola believed that Rota's musical piece gave the film even more of an Italian feel [158] Coppola's father, Carmine, created some additional music for the film, [160] particularly the music played by the band during the opening wedding scene [158] [159]\n\n\nRelease\nThe world premiere for The Godfather took place at Loews's State Theatre in New York City on Tuesday, March 14, 1972, almost three months after the planned release date of Christmas Day in 1971, [167] [168] [8] with profits from the premiere donated to The Boys Club of New York [169] Before the film premiered, the film had already made $15 million from advance rentals from over 400 theaters [43] The following day, [36] the film opened in five theaters in New York (Loew's State I and II, Orpheum, Cine and Tower East) [170] [23] [8] Next was the Imperial Theatre in Toronto [167] on March 17 [171] and then Los Angeles at two theaters on March 22 [172] The Godfather was released on March 24, 1972, throughout the rest of the United States [170] [8] reaching 316 theaters five days later [173]\n\n\nTheatrical\nThe world premiere for The Godfather took place at Loews's State Theatre in New York City on Tuesday, March 14, 1972, almost three months after the planned release date of Christmas Day in 1971, [167] [168] [8] with profits

at two theaters on March 22 [172] The Godfather was released on March 24, 1972, throughout the rest of the United States [170] [8] reaching 316 theaters five days later [173]\n\n\nHome media\nThe television rights were sold for a record $10 million to NBC for one showing over two nights [174] The theatrical version of The Godfather debuted on American network television on NBC with only minor edits [175] The first half of the film aired on Saturday, November 16, 1974, and the second half two days later [176] The television airings attracted a large audience with an average Nielsen rating of 38.2 and audience share of 59% making it the eighth most-watched film on television, with the broadcast of the second half getting the third-best rating for a film on TV behind Airport and Love Story with a rating of 39.4 and 57% share [176] The broadcast helped generate anticipation for the upcoming sequel [175] The next year, Coppola created The Godfather Saga expressly for American television in a release that combined The Godfather and The Godfather Part II with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its NBC debut on November 18, 1977 [177] In 1981, Paramount released the Godfather Epic boxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities [177] The Godfather Trilogy was released in 1992, in which the films are fundamentally in chronological order [178]\n\n\nThe Godfather: The Coppola Restoration\nDuring the film's original theatrical release, the original negatives were worn down due to the reel being printed so much to meet demand [181] [182] In addition, the duplicate negative was lost in Paramount archives [182] In 2006 Coppola contacted Steven Spielberg—whose studio DreamWorks had recently been bought out by Paramount—about restoring The Godfather [181] [182] Robert A Harris was hired to oversee the restoration of The Godfather and its two sequels, with the film's cinematographer Willis participating in the restoration [183] [184] Work began in November 2006 by repairing the negatives so they could go through a digital scanner to produce high-resolution 4K files If a negative were damaged and discolored, work was done digitally to restore it to its original look [181] [182] After a year and a half of working on the restoration, the project was complete [182] Paramount called the finished product The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration and released it to the public on September 23, 2008, on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc [183] [184] Dave Kehr of The New York Times believed the restoration brought back the \"golden glow of their original theatrical screenings\" [183] As a whole, the restoration of the film was well received by critics and Coppola [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration contains several new special features that play in high definition, (including additional scenes, behind the scenes footage, etc.) [185]\n\n\nReception\nThe Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972 [187] The film's opening day gross from five theaters was $57,829 with ticket prices increased from $3 to $3.50 [167] Prices in New York increased further at the weekend to $4, and the number of showings increased from four times a day to seven times a day [167] The film grossed $61,615 in Toronto for the weekend [167] and $240,780 in New York, [188] for an opening weekend gross of $302,395 The film grossed $454,000 for the week in New York [167] and $115,000 in Toronto [171] for a first week gross of $568,800, which made it number one at the U.S box office for the week [189] In its first five days of national release, it grossed $6.8 million, taking its gross up to $7,397,164 [190] A week later its gross had reached $17,291,705 [191] with the one week gross of around $10 million being an industry record [192] It grossed another $8.7 million by April 9 to take its gross to $26,000,815 [193] After 18 weeks at number one in the United States, the film had grossed $101 million, the fastest film to reach that milestone [194] [195] Some news articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America, [172] but such accounts are erroneous; this record belongs to The Sound of Music, released in 1965 [196] It remained at number one in the US for another five weeks to bring its total to 23 consecutive weeks at number one before being unseated by Butterflies Are Free for one week before becoming number one for another three weeks [197] [198]\n\n\nBox office\nThe Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box

received overwhelming critical acclaim and is seen as one of the greatest and most influential films of all time, particularly of the gangster genre [205] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 9.4/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema.\" [206] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a score of 100 out of 100 based on 16 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [207]\n\n\nAccolades\n\nThe Godfather was nominated for seven awards at the 30th Golden Globe Awards: Best

January 28, 1973, the film had won the categories for: Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor – Drama (Brando), Best Original Score, and Best Picture – Drama [224] [225]\n\n\nRecognition\nAlthough many films about gangsters preceded The Godfather, Coppola steeped his film in Italian immigrant culture, and his portrayal of mobsters as persons of considerable psychological depth and complexity was unprecedented [274] Coppola took it further with The Godfather Part II, and the success of those two films, critically, artistically and financially, was a catalyst for the production of numerous

Born in Toronto, Ontario, Wiggins is the son of former NBA player Mitchell Wiggins and former Olympic track and field sprinter Marita Payne-Wiggins. He rose to prominence as a high school player, leading his team to a provincial championship and earning a reputation as one of the top prospects in the country.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAndrew Wiggins was born on February 23, 1995, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. His parents, Mitchell Wiggins and Marita Payne-Wiggins, met while they were both student athletes at Florida State University. Mitchell Wiggins played in the NBA from 1983 to 1987, while Marita Payne-Wiggins was a member of the Canadian national track and field team. Andrew Wiggins grew up in the nearby city of Vaughan, where he attended Glen Shields Public School for elementary school and Vaughan Secondary School for high school.\n\n**High School Career**\n\nWiggins attended Vaughan Secondary School for his first two years of high school. During his sophomore year, he led the school's AAAA basketball team to a 44-1 record, winning the Ontario provincial championship. In the championship game, he scored 25 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, despite facing chants of \"Over-rated!\" from the crowd.

Before making his decision, he had narrowed his choices to Florida State, Kentucky, Kansas, and North Carolina. He joined the Kansas team on June 19, 2013, and played for the Jayhawks during the 2013-2014 season. However, he eventually decided to forgo his remaining two years of college eligibility and enter the 2014 NBA draft.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nWiggins declared for the 2014 NBA draft on March 31, 2014. He was selected first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers on June 26, 2014. However, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves on August 23, 2014, along with Anthony Bennett, in exchange for Kevin Love and a 2015 first-round draft pick. Wiggins became the second player since the ABA-NBA merger to be drafted as the number one pick and traded without playing a single game for the team that drafted him.\n\n**Minnesota Timberwolves (2014-2020)**\n\nWiggins played for the Minnesota Timberwolves from 2014 to 2020.

He averaged just 18.2 points per game, his lowest average since his rookie season. However, he also showed flashes of brilliance, including a 32-point performance against the Los Angeles Clippers. The Warriors ultimately finished with a 15-50 record, the worst in the league.\n\n**First All-Star Selection and NBA Championship**\n\nOn December 6, 2021, Wiggins scored a career-high 28 points on eight three-pointers made in a 126-95 win over the Orlando Magic. On January 27, 2022, he was named a Western Conference starter for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game, his first All-Star selection. Wiggins also became the first No. 1 overall draft pick in the modern draft era to earn his first All-Star selection in his eighth season or later.\n\n**National Team Career**\n\nWiggins participated in the 2010 FIBA Under-17 World Championship and 2012 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship, helping the Canadian junior national team win a bronze medal in each tournament.

{"title": "Abercrombie_&_Fitch", "content": "\nHistory\nThe original Abercrombie & Fitch was founded in 1892 in New York City by David T Abercrombie as an outfitter for the elite outdoorsman Ezra Fitch—a wealthy lawyer, real estate developer, and devoted Abercrombie customer—bought a significant stake in the business in 1900 [3]  In 1904, it was incorporated and renamed \"Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\"  Fitch eventually bought out Abercrombie's share of the business, becoming its sole owner from 1907 to 1928 [3]  The company was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents [3] It outfitted Theodore Roosevelt's safari and Admiral Richard E Byrd's expedition to Antarctica  Ernest Hemingway was also a regular customer; the gun with which he committed suicide in 1961 was purchased from Abercrombie & Fitch [4] Following Hemingway's death, his wife placed several of his guns on consignment with the company [5]\n\n\n2007–present\nThe company overhauled its merchandise mix and closed several underperforming stores [15] Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries resigned in December 2014, after 22 years with the company [16] Fran Horowitz took over as CEO in February 2017 [17]\n\n\nMarket value\nIn April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650 million and about $420 million cash on hand In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself Potential buyers included rivals Express (a fellow former L Brands subsidiary) and American Eagle Outfitters, and private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management However, negotiations failed by early July, contributing to a 21% drop in A&F's stock price [20]\n\n\nHeadquarters\nThe company's headquarters (aka \"The Home Office\") is located outside Columbus, Ohio in New Albany, Ohio, a small farm town that expanded into a wealthy community planned and developed by L Brands founder Les Wexner The Home Office was designed as a campus and internally referred to as such, sitting on 350-acres and consisting of 11 two-story buildings (some connected by skybridge) The company's two merchandise distribution centers (1 million square feet each) are located on campus to help ensure brand protection Also on campus are model stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layouts, merchandising and atmosphere are developed and tested [21] In January 2017, A&F announced it was terminating 150 Home Office employees [22]\n\n\nMarketing, advertising and brand identity\nA&F was once known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber [24] It was black and white and set outdoors, usually with partially nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the \"A&F Casting\" feature on its website The website also provides a gallery of current photography Framed copies at company stores will sometimes name the model and store.\n\n\nStore staff\nThe company is noted for its use of \"brand representatives\" (aka \"models\") as in-store customer service staff [18] Previously, the models were required to buy and wear only A&F clothing at work However, after a 2003 settlement with California state labor regulators, A&F allowed brand reps to wear any logo-free clothing, as long as it corresponded with the season and A&F's style The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing [34] An \"Impact Team\" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and strictly maintain and enforce company standards Bigger and higher volume stores have a \"Full Time Stock\" who trains Impact associates, processes shipments, maintains stock room standards, and can even act as a manager if the store is short on management staff Stores' general manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations, and ensuring brand reps comply with the company's \"look policy\" [35]\n\n\nProducts\nWomen's Wear Daily calls the company's clothing classically \"neo-preppy\", with an \"edgy tone and imagery\" [36]\nThe company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven There is heavy promotion of \"Premium Jeans\" In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.\n\n\nProduct criticism\nIn 2002, the company sold a shirt featuring the slogan \"Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White,\" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, an offensive depiction of 19th century Chinese immigrants to the U.S [41] A&F discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by a Stanford University Asian American student group [42] That same year, Abercrombie Kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests The underwear included phrases like \"Eye Candy\" and \"Wink Wink\" printed on the front [43]\n\n\nBrand protection\nBecause of extensive counterfeiting of its products, the company launched a brand protection program in 2006 to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with law enforcement globally The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all the company's brands The company says that the program \"will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products.\" [49]\n\n\nJeffries' 2006 target demographic quote\nIn 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with then-CEO Mike Jeffries went viral, causing public backlash against A&F's marketing practices [53] [54] [55] Jeffries comments – that his brand is only suitable for \"the good-looking, cool kids,\" and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes, namely, overweight people – came under fire [56] [57]\n\n\nStores\nThe exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers From 2013 to 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except from certain flagship stores which had windows above street level The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing [62] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears [63]\n\n\nInternational expansion\nThe company's brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide \"at a deliberate pace\" [65] [66]  After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co brand in 2012 [67] [68]\n\n\nRemembrance poppy prohibition in the UK\nIn November 2010, the Southampton, England, store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November  The official reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited [76]  The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: \"As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day.\"\n\n\nAbercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row\nIn 2012, the company announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes [77]  The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of its main store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with This eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012 [78] [79] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of the company's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans \"utterly unacceptable.\" [80] [81] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014 [82] The following year, the company was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made in the Grade II-listed building were illegal [83]\n\n\nAbercrombie opens college campus stores\nIn an attempt to more effectively reach the brand's ideal \"college-age\" customer, the company tested two experimental campus stores in August 2018, both of which have since closed [84]\n\n\nBrands\nThe company has operated four concept brands apart from its namesake over the years; they have been referred to as subsidiaries, but operate as divisions under the company's umbrella.\n\n\nLegal issues\nThe company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.\n\n\nEmployment practices\nIn a 2004 lawsuit González v Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives before the settlement and Models after) and store management positions to Caucasian males [88] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year [89] [90] [91]\n\n\nCustomer issues\nIn 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room The amount of the fine reflected \"pushback\" by the company according to Michael K Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights [102]\n\n\nLawsuits against other parties\nIn 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied the company's garment designs, among other things The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked the company's products' visual appearance and packaging Specifically, it claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even its product catalog Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle [106]\n\n\nPrivacy concerns\nIn February 2019, TechCrunch reported that the Abercrombie & Fitch mobile app in the iOS App Store was using session-replay functionality to record users' activities and send the data to Israeli firm Glassbox without the users' informed consent, compromising users' privacy and contravening the rules of the iOS App Store [108] [109]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n",

Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.\n\n**Lawsuits against other parties**\n\nIn 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied the company's garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked the company's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, it claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even its product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.\n\n**Privacy concerns**\n\nIn February 2019, TechCrunch reported that the

compromising users' privacy and contravening the rules of the iOS App Store.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Abercrombie_&_Fitch\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe original Abercrombie & Fitch was founded in 1892 in New York City by David T Abercrombie as an outfitter for the elite outdoorsman Ezra Fitch—a wealthy lawyer, real estate developer, and devoted Abercrombie customer—bought a significant stake in the business in 1900 [3]  In 1904, it was incorporated and renamed \"Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\"  Fitch eventually bought out Abercrombie's share of the business, becoming its sole owner from 1907 to 1928 [3]  The company was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents [3] It outfitted Theodore Roosevelt's safari and Admiral Richard E Byrd's expedition to Antarctica  Ernest Hemingway was also a regular customer; the gun with which he committed suicide in 1961 was purchased from Abercrombie & Fitch [4] Following Hemingway's death, his wife placed several of his guns on consignment with the company [5]\n\n\n2007–present\nThe company overhauled its merchandise mix and closed several underperforming stores [15] Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries resigned in December 2014, after 22 years with the company [16] Fran Horowitz took over as CEO in February 2017 [17]\n\n\nMarket value\nIn April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650 million and about $420 million cash on hand In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself Potential buyers included rivals Express (a fellow former L Brands subsidiary) and American Eagle Outfitters, and private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management However, negotiations failed by early July, contributing to a 21% drop in A&F's stock price [20]\n\n\nHeadquarters\nThe company's headquarters (aka \"The Home Office\") is located outside Columbus, Ohio in New Albany, Ohio, a small farm town that expanded into a wealthy community planned and developed by L Brands founder Les Wexner The Home Office was designed as a campus and internally referred to as such, sitting on 350-acres and consisting of 11 two-story buildings (some connected by skybridge) The company's two merchandise distribution centers (1 million square feet each) are located on campus to help ensure brand protection Also on campus are model stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layouts, merchandising and atmosphere are developed and tested [21] In January 2017, A&F announced it was terminating 150 Home Office employees [22]\n\n\nMarketing, advertising and brand identity\nA&F was once known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber [24] It was black and white and set outdoors, usually with partially nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the \"A&F Casting\" feature on its website The website also provides a gallery of current photography Framed copies at company stores will sometimes name the model and store.\n\n\nStore staff\nThe company is noted for its use of \"brand representatives\" (aka \"models\") as in-store customer service staff [18] Previously, the models were required to buy and wear only A&F clothing at work However, after a 2003 settlement with California state labor regulators, A&F allowed brand reps to wear any logo-free clothing, as long as it corresponded with the season and A&F's style The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing [34] An \"Impact Team\" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and strictly maintain and enforce company standards Bigger and higher volume stores have a \"Full Time Stock\" who trains Impact associates, processes shipments, maintains stock room standards, and can even act as a manager if the store is short on management staff Stores' general manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations, and ensuring brand reps comply with the company's \"look policy\" [35]\n\n\nProducts\nWomen's Wear Daily calls the company's clothing classically \"neo-preppy\", with an \"edgy tone and imagery\" [36]\nThe company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven There is heavy promotion of \"Premium Jeans\" In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.\n\n\nProduct criticism\nIn 2002, the company sold a shirt featuring the slogan \"Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White,\" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, an offensive depiction of 19th century Chinese immigrants to the U.S [41] A&F discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by a Stanford University Asian American student group [42] That same year, Abercrombie Kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests The underwear included phrases like \"Eye Candy\" and \"Wink Wink\" printed on the front [43]\n\n\nBrand protection\nBecause of extensive counterfeiting of its products, the company launched a brand protection program in 2006 to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with law enforcement globally The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all the company's brands The company says that the program \"will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products.\" [49]\n\n\nJeffries' 2006 target demographic quote\nIn 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with then-CEO Mike Jeffries went viral, causing public backlash against A&F's marketing practices [53] [54] [55] Jeffries comments – that his brand is only suitable for \"the good-looking, cool kids,\" and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes, namely, overweight people – came under fire [56] [57]\n\n\nStores\nThe exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers From 2013 to 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except from certain flagship stores which had windows above street level The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing [62] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears [63]\n\n\nInternational expansion\nThe company's brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide \"at a deliberate pace\" [65] [66]  After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co brand in 2012 [67] [68]\n\n\nRemembrance poppy prohibition in the UK\nIn November 2010, the Southampton, England, store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November  The official reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited [76]  The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: \"As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day.\"\n\n\nAbercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row\nIn 2012, the company announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes [77]  The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of its main store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with This eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012 [78] [79] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of the company's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans \"utterly unacceptable.\" [80] [81] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014 [82] The following year, the company was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made in the Grade II-listed building were illegal [83]\n\n\nAbercrombie opens college campus stores\nIn an attempt to more effectively reach the brand's ideal \"college-age\" customer, the company tested two experimental campus stores in August 2018, both of which have since closed [84]\n\n\nBrands\nThe company has operated four concept brands apart from its namesake over the years; they have been referred to as subsidiaries, but operate as divisions under the company's umbrella.\n\n\nLegal issues\nThe company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.\n\n\nEmployment practices\nIn a 2004 lawsuit González v Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives before the settlement and Models after) and store management positions to Caucasian males [88] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year [89] [90] [91]\n\n\nCustomer issues\nIn 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room The amount of the fine reflected \"pushback\" by the company according to Michael K Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights [102]\n\n\nLawsuits against other parties\nIn 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied the company's garment designs, among other things The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had

He was born on July 21, 1942, in Varawatti, Bhalki Taluk, Bidar district, Karnataka, in a Dalit family to Saibavva and Mapanna Kharge. Throughout his life, Kharge has been a prominent figure in Indian politics, serving in various positions and making significant contributions to the country's development.\n\n**Early Life and Background**\n\nMallikarjun Kharge was born in a humble family in a rural area of Karnataka. His father, Mapanna Kharge, was a farmer, and his mother, Saibavva, was a homemaker. Kharge's early life was marked by hard work and dedication to education. He completed his primary education in a local school and later attended the Karnataka High School in Bidar. After completing his intermediate education, Kharge moved to Hyderabad to pursue his higher education.\n\nKharge's entry into politics was influenced by his family's involvement in the freedom struggle. His father was a close associate of B.R. Ambedkar, the founder of the Bahujan Samaj Party, and was a key figure in the Dalit movement. Kharge's exposure to the politics of social justice and equality had a profound impact on his life and shaped his future career.\n\n**Role in National Politics**\n\nKharge's entry into national politics began in the 1970s when he joined the Indian National Congress party. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a member of the party's youth wing and later serving as the president of the Karnataka Youth Congress. In 1991, Kharge was elected to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, representing the Chittapur constituency.

He has been a strong advocate for social justice and equality, and has worked tirelessly to promote the welfare of marginalized communities. Under his leadership, the party has made significant gains in various state elections, including the formation of governments in Himachal Pradesh in 2022 and Telangana in 2023.\n\n**Election for President**\n\nThe election for president of the INC was a closely contested affair, with two prominent candidates vying for the top spot.

He has been elected to the Lok Sabha ten times consecutively, starting from 2009. His electoral performances have been marked by a strong focus on social justice and equality, and he has worked tirelessly to promote the welfare of marginalized communities.\n\nIn 2019, Kharge was re-elected to the Lok Sabha from the Gulbarga constituency, defeating his closest rival, Suresh Channabasappa Kale.

Adipose are aliens composed of living fat, featured in the episode \"Partners in Crime\" (2008) Their breeding world, Adipose 3, was lost, causing them to turn to \"Miss Foster\" in order to create new Adipose children [13] She formulated a drug that would cause human fat to morph by parthenogenesis into Adipose children The process is generally harmless to the host beyond the loss of body fat; but in emergencies the process can be accelerated, converting the host's entire body, which is fatal to the host and produces ill and weak Adipose children This is illegal under the laws of the Shadow Proclamation, an inter-galactic law body, and the Adipose abandoned Foster to die in order to hide their crimes, taking the infant Adipose with them [14] In the parallel universe created in \"Turn Left\" (2008), in which The Doctor is killed fighting another alien menace prior to encountering the Adipose, the Adipose incident happened in America instead of the United Kingdom, as London was

a pit to face the Judgement of Aggedor Peladon's High Priest, Hepesh, secretly captured a remaining Aggedor, and used it to attempt to generate superstition about the \"curse\" of Aggedor in order to stop Peladon from joining the Galactic Federation, an intergalactic alliance of planets The Aggedor killed Hepesh, and the same Aggedor later returned in The Monster of Peladon (1974) [19] In both of

\"Love & Monsters\" (2006), that can absorb any living thing into its body by touch They are from the planet Clom, the twin planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius, the home planet of the Slitheen family [7] An Abzorbalovian disguised itself as \"Victor Kennedy\" and infiltrated L.I.N.D.A – a group of people trying to track down The Doctor – although it planned to absorb the Doctor's knowledge It is killed when Elton Pope, a member of L.I.N.D.A, broke its cane, causing the Earth to absorb it [8]\n\n\nAbzorbaloff\nThe Abzorbaloff is an alien creature seen in \"Love & Monsters\" (2006), that can

L.I.N.D.A, broke its cane, causing the Earth to absorb it [8]\n\n\nAdipose\nThe Adipose are aliens composed of living fat, featured in the episode \"Partners in Crime\" (2008) Their breeding world, Adipose 3, was lost, causing them to turn to \"Miss Foster\" in order to create new Adipose children [13] She formulated a drug that would cause human fat to morph by parthenogenesis into Adipose children The process is generally harmless to the host beyond the loss of body fat; but in emergencies the process can be accelerated, converting the host's entire body, which is fatal to the host and produces ill and weak Adipose children This is illegal under the laws of the Shadow Proclamation, an inter-galactic law body, and the Adipose abandoned Foster to die in order to hide their crimes, taking the infant Adipose with them [14] In the parallel universe created in \"Turn Left\" (2008), in which The Doctor is killed fighting another alien menace prior to encountering the Adipose, the Adipose incident happened in America instead of the United Kingdom, as London was destroyed when the space-faring version of the Titanic crashed into Buckingham Palace and caused much of the southern United Kingdom to become an irradiated wasteland Over 60 million Americans were killed in this timeline as a result [15]\n\n\nAggedor\nAggedor is the Sacred Royal Beast of the planet Peladon, first seen in The Curse of Peladon (1972) [18] The real creature upon which the legend is based is a large, hairy beast with a single horn Hunted to near extinction, one Aggedor beast roamed the tunnels below the citadel and, at one stage, was used to judge prisoners who were cast into a pit to face the Judgement of Aggedor Peladon's High Priest, Hepesh, secretly captured a remaining Aggedor, and used it to attempt to generate superstition about the \"curse\" of Aggedor in order to stop Peladon from joining the Galactic Federation, an intergalactic alliance of planets The Aggedor killed Hepesh, and the same Aggedor later returned in The Monster of Peladon (1974) [19] In both of Aggedor's appearances, Aggedor is portrayed by actor Nick Hobbs [20] [21]\n\n\nAxons\nThe golden-skinned humanoid Axons attempt to take over the Earth by distributing Axonite, actually pieces of a single creature named Axos; they were encountered in The Claws of Axos (1971) They pose as a friendly family who wished to aid humanity, but are able to shapeshift into monstrous forms in order to aid Axos The Axons are later trapped in a time loop alongside Axos [23] The Axons are portrayed by Bernard Holley, Patricia Gordino, John Hicks, and Debbie Lee London [24]\n\n\nB\nThe Bandrils are a reptilian species encountered in the serial Timelash (1985) A villain known as the Borad seeks to start a war between them and the people of Karfel The Sixth Doctor is able to thwart the plot The Bandril Ambassador that appears in the episode was portrayed by actor Martin Gower [26]\n\n\nBandril\nThe

seen in \"Flatline\" (2014) The Boneless harness the energy from the TARDIS, the Doctor's ship, in an attempt to infiltrate the Doctor's universe Clara Oswald and a community service worker named Rigsy are able to trick the Boneless into restoring the TARDIS, allowing the Doctor to send them back to their home dimension [27]\n\n\nC\nThe Carrionites are creatures who hail from \"The Dark Times,\" a time before the universe, and fought against the Time Lords in the past They appear in \"The Shakespeare Code\" (2007) Three Carrionites- Bloodtide, Doomfinger, and Lilith- attempt to release their species from a prison using the power of words and witchcraft They attempt to manipulate William Shakespeare into writing the key to their escape into Love's Labour's Won, but the Tenth Doctor and Shakespeare were able to reverse the process, sending the Carrionites back into their prison and trapping Lilith, Bloodtide, and Doomfinger into a crystal ball [29] They reappeared, this time facing against the Sixth Doctor, in the audio drama The Carrionite Curse [30]\n\n\nCarrionite\nThe Carrionites are creatures who hail from \"The Dark Times,\" a time before the universe, and

feline facial features and retractable claws [31] Their young resemble typical domestic kittens, with humanoid features emerging after ten months [32]\n\n\nChameleons\nChameleons are aliens with no features or identities of their own seen in The Faceless Ones (1967), who can imprint on individual humans and take on their appearance The Chameleons lost their identities and faces in a massive explosion on their home planet As a result, their scientists created a device that would allow them to adopt the identities of other beings In the late 1960s, they ran a fake airline, Chameleon Tours, to kidnap human subjects for that purpose The Second Doctor was able to convince them to seek another solution [36] The Chameleons later re-appeared in the spin-off book Short Trips and Side Steps, appearing in a short story in the book titled Face Value In the story, the Chameleons began to infiltrate and replace the people of the planet Krennos after their last defeat by the Second Doctor The Sixth Doctor discovered their plan and put a stop to it [37]\n\n\nCheetah People\nCheetah People are feline humanoids greatly resembling cheetahs who enjoy hunting humans; the Doctor and the Master encountered them in Survival (1989) The Cheetah People were once humanoids resembling humans, but they made bonds with cat-like creatures known as Kitlings, which caused the people to mutate into more wild creatures The Cheetah People frequently fought each other, which weakened their home planet and caused it to slowly reach a breaking point The Master became stranded on the planet, and slowly began to mutate as well He attempted to use the Cheetah People to escape, kidnapping several of Ace's friends and mutating them into Cheetah People The Seventh Doctor was able to stop the Master, leaving him stranded on the Cheetah People's dying planet [38]\n\n\nChronovores\nChronovores are glowing white creatures that live outside time; the Doctor encountered one, Kronos, in The Time Monster (1972) The Master attempted to use Kronos for one of his schemes, infiltrating the lost kingdom of Atlantis, which worshipped Kronos, in order to revive and control the deity After Kronos destroyed Atlantis, the Third Doctor was able to free Kronos, thwarting the Master's plans [40]\n\n\nChuldur\nThe Chuldur are a race of shape shifting bird-like aliens who appeared in the Fifteenth Doctor story \"Rogue\" (2024) The Chuldur appeared in 1813, where they infiltrated a ball in order to \"cosplay\" as those from the nineteenth century [42] The Fifteenth Doctor is able to trap the Chuldur within a sealing device, which banished them to another dimension, but at the sacrifice of Rogue, a bounty hunter the Doctor had fallen in love with [43]\n\n\nCryons\nCryons are a species of alien first seen in Attack of the Cybermen (1985) Cryons appear to be an all female race who cannot exist at temperatures above zero degrees The Cryons lived on Telos until the Cybermen took control of the planet, and allied with the mercenary Lytton in order to defeat them The Cryons were later destroyed by an attack by the Cybermen [44] Director Matthew Robinson elected to make the Cryons an all-female race, as otherwise Attack of the Cybermen would have had an all-male cast barring the Sixth Doctor's companion Peri Brown Sarah Berger, Esther Frued, Faith Brown, and Sarah Greene all portrayed various Cryons in the episode [45]\n\n\nCyberman\nThe original Cybermen were a race of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas, first seen in The Tenth Planet (1966) [46] As they implanted more and more artificial parts into their bodies as a means of self-preservation, they became coldly logical and calculating, with emotion all but deleted from their minds [46] The Cyberman concept was created by Dr Kit Pedler (the unofficial scientific advisor to the programme) and Gerry Davis in 1966, based around the ideas of the ethical issues present in innovations in prosthesis [47] The Cybermen were portrayed by tall actors in order to portray the Cybermen's menace, with the actors being over six feet in height The costumes were hot and bulky, and it was difficult for the actors to see These initial Cybermen used cloth masks, and had a zombie-like appearance, with flesh-based hands They additionally had individual names [47] The Cybermen were brought back as recurring antagonists in other serials following this, and were an effort by the production team to find replacement antagonists due to the Daleks being planned to be featured in an American television series at the time [48] The Cybermen's design would change frequently from episode to episode, and grew more mechanical and bulky in design Despite their popularity, the Cybermen were not brought back for any episode starring Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor, and only had one appearance alongside Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor Producer John Nathan-Turner brought the Cybermen back for the serial Earthshock (1982), wanting to feature a returning antagonist but not wanting to use the Daleks Turner kept the reveal of the Cybermen a secret from the public prior to the airing of the episode, [49] after which they reprised their role as consistent antagonists until the series' cancellation in 1989 [47]\n\n\nD\nA race of humanoids from the planet Dæmos, seen in The Dæmons (1971) They resemble demons, and inspired the concept of demons in humanity The Dæmons have great power, and the antagonist the Master attempts to obtain the power of a Dæmon named Azal Azal is the last of his kind, and eventually decides to give his power to the Master as he threatens to kill the Third Doctor The Doctor's companion, Jo Grant, steps in the way in an act of self-sacrifice This confuses Azal due to its illogical nature, causing his powers to reverse on him, killing him [53]\n\n\nDæmon\nA race of humanoids from the planet Dæmos, seen in The Dæmons (1971) They resemble demons, and inspired the concept of demons in humanity The

killing him [53]\n\n\nDalek\nThe Daleks are a warmongering, xenophobic race of mutant creatures who live within mobile battle armour first appearing in The Daleks (1963-64), the second Doctor Who serial [57] The Daleks were created by a scientist named Davros as a way to survive and win a war between themselves and a species known as the Thals [58] They are life-long enemies of The Doctor, and he is the only being whom they fear The Daleks see themselves as the superior lifeforms in the universe, and seek to eliminate all other life for being \"impure.\" The creatures inside of their casings resemble squids, with a single eye, exposed brain and many tentacles [57] The Daleks acted as a highly recurring foe during Doctor Who's classic era, and were among its most popular During the 1960s, public popularity for the Daleks was high, with this era being referred to as \"Dalekmania.\" Despite The Beatles going on-air during the Daleks' second appearance, the return of the Daleks saw a higher viewer count The Daleks were merchandised heavily during this period and grew wildly popular [57] Dalekmania declined following the airing of The Daleks' Master Plan, a twelve part serial [59] Two movie spin-offs of Dalek serials, starring actor Peter Cushing as the Doctor, titled Dr Who and the Daleks and Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D., were adaptations of other Dalek serials and produced at the highlight of Dalekmania [60]\n\n\nDominator\nThe Dominators are a race of aggressive warlords, first seen in The Dominators (1968) They attempted to capture the planet Dulkis utilizing their robotic servants the Quarks, but were thwarted by the Second Doctor [83]\n\n\nDraconian\nThe Draconians (also called Dragons, a derogatory term in their culture) are a humanoid race seen in

\"Voyage of the Damned\" (2007) featured a Zocci named Bannakaffalatta, who aids the Tenth Doctor in attempting to stop a space-faring version of the Titanic from crashing into the Earth [266] In \"The End of Time\" (2009-10), a species related to the Zocci,  except green and more human-like in size, known as the Vinvocci, appeared A pair of them attempted to take a Vinvocci medical device away from a human, named Joshua Naismith, who attempted to re-program the device to make his daughter immortal They later aided the Tenth Doctor in stopping the Master after he used the device to turn

season in a row in which a tropical cyclone developed before the official start of the season Alicia strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 15 November, rapidly weakened due to the vertical wind shear and cool waters, and dissipated on 17 November On 14 November, another tropical disturbance formed off the coast of Madagascar; however, on 16 November the system failed to organize due to unfavourable vertical wind shear according to JTWC It rapidly weakened and dissipated the next day The basin remained quiet until, on 30 November, a tropical low crossed over from the Australian region It strengthened into a moderate tropical storm, then to a severe tropical storm, and was named Bongoyo Two additional lows formed, one formed but exited the basin on 20 December and another Zone of Disturbed Weather formed near Diego Garcia, which strengthened to Severe Tropical Storm Chalane, which made landfall on Madagascar and Mozambique, the first tropical cyclone for this season to make landfall The same Zone of Disturbed Weather which exited on 20 December, again re-entered on 28 December, following with another Zone of Disturbed Weather, designated 06.\n\n\nSystems\nOn 12 November, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) also began tracking a tropical disturbance as it moved slowly westwards over the central Indian Ocean [1] Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert [2] The disturbance slowly consolidated as thunderstorms wrapped around the center of circulation, and it became a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on 13 November [3] The depression continued to become more organized over the day with flaring convection over the center, and thus was upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Alicia at 18:00 UTC that same day [4] On 14 November at 06:00 UTC, Alicia strengthened into a severe tropical storm [5] Alicia generally moved rapidly in a southwesterly direction due to the steering flow of a mid-level subtropical ridge to the storm's southeast [6] The severe tropical storm intensified into Tropical Cyclone Alicia at 00:00 UTC on 16 November, after very deep convection developed near its center [7]\nSoon after Alicia entered a region with high wind shear and cooler waters Due to these unfavorable conditions, Alicia began to rapidly weaken, weakening to a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC on 16 November [8] At 09:00 UTC on 17 November, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning on the storm [9]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Alicia\nOn 12 November, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) also began tracking a tropical disturbance as it moved slowly westwards over the central Indian Ocean [1] Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert [2] The disturbance slowly consolidated as thunderstorms wrapped around the center of circulation, and it became a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on 13 November [3] The depression continued to become more organized over the day with flaring convection

generally moved rapidly in a southwesterly direction due to the steering flow of a mid-level subtropical ridge to the storm's southeast [6] The severe tropical storm intensified into Tropical Cyclone Alicia at 00:00 UTC on 16 November, after very deep convection developed near its center [7]\nSoon after Alicia entered a region with high wind shear and cooler waters Due to these unfavorable conditions, Alicia began to rapidly weaken, weakening to a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC on 16 November [8] At 09:00 UTC on 17 November, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning on the storm [9]\n\n\nTropical Depression 02\nOn 12 November, along with the precursor disturbance of Cyclone Alicia, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) began to monitor another monsoonal disturbance to the west of Cyclone Alicia's precursor for potential tropical cyclogenesis [10] By 14 November, an area of disturbed weather had formed but struggled to centralize its thunderstorm activity, despite consolidating a low level circulation [11] With improvements in further consolidation, the MFR initiated advisories for a tropical depression in the northeast of Madagascar at 18:00 UTC on 15 November [12] The storm struggled to intensify much due to strong easterly shear from its close proximity to Tropical Cyclone Alicia's outflow, and thus had its thunderstorm activity sheared to its west for most of its lifetime [13] Due to this, the JTWC cancelled the Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on 16 November [14] It rapidly weakened and the last advisory was issued by the MFR on 16 November as well [15]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Bongoyo\nDuring 30 November, Tropical Low 01U moved into the basin from the Australian region, where it was classified as a Zone of Disturbed Weather by RSMC La Réunion [16] Early on 4 December, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system [17] After meandering slowly to the west and northwest for several days with little change in strength, the system began to take a more southerly track and at 06:00 UTC on 6 December was upgraded to Tropical Disturbance 03 by MFR as the low level circulation became tighter and convection consolidated near the center [18] On 7 December, the disturbance intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Bongoyo as an ASCAT pass revealed gale-force winds on the southern half of the circulation [19] At this time, the JTWC cited a favorable environment for further intensification as Bongoyo headed southwest [20] While Bongoyo gained a distinct mid-level eye and strong bursts of convection were maintained near the center as the storm further strengthened to severe tropical storm status at 00:00 UTC on 8 December [21]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Chalane\nOn 19 December, RSMC La Réunion began monitoring a zone of disturbed weather situated approximately 830 km (515 mi) southwest of Diego Garcia [27] The system was located in a favourable environment for intensification due to the presence of a Kelvin wave and an equatorial Rossby wave, as well as warm sea surface temperatures, low to moderate vertical wind shear and good upper-level outflow [28] Conditions began to somewhat deteriorate over the next several days as the system meandered to the west, but the storm still managed to reach tropical depression status on 23 December, as northerly wind shear began to affect the storm, causing most of the thunderstorm activity and winds to be localized to the south of the center [29] Approximately a day later, at 06:00 UTC 24 December, the depression had strengthened to Moderate Tropical Storm Chalane as a scatterometer pass revealed gale-force winds on the southern side of the highly asymmetric wind field [30] Chalane began to strengthen, with winds reaching 75 km/h (45 mph), as wind shear decreased due to storm becoming aligned with the subtropical ridge Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert [31] [32] At 21:00 UTC that day, the JTWC designated Chalane as Tropical Storm 07S [33]\n\n\nTropical Depression 05\nOn 17 December, RSMC La Réunion began monitoring a sheared low-pressure area located in the far northeastern corner of the basin, about 1,250 km (775 mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands [47] The system began moving slowly towards the southeast, and on the following day it was classified as a tropical disturbance by RSMC La Réunion [48] At the time, the system's central atmospheric pressure was estimated at 1005 hPa (29.68 inHg) and satellite scatterometer data from just after 02:00 UTC on 18 December indicated maximum 10-minute sustained winds of up to 55 km/h (35 mph) in the disturbance's northern semicircle [48] Environmental conditions were assessed as being marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) and low vertical wind shear, but only weak outflow in the upper troposphere [49] The tropical disturbance crossed into the Australian region by 20 December, where it was classified as Tropical Low 04U by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology [50] [51] After meandering outside the basin for several days, the system re-entered the MFR's area of responsibility as a zone of disturbed weather on 28 December, before being upgraded to Tropical Depression 05 on 31 December [52] However, the system was unable to intensify significantly, due to the outflow from Severe Tropical Storm Danilo to the northwest On 2 January, Tropical Depression 05 began undergoing a Fujiwhara interaction with Danilo, before merging into the stronger system on 3 January [53]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Danilo\nOn 28 December, a Zone of Disturbed Weather formed near the Chagos Archipelago [54] It gradually organized over a sheared but moist environment for the next several days before eventually strengthening into Moderate Tropical Storm Danilo at 12:00 UTC 1 January [55] As Danilo tracked north, it continued to strengthen with the appearance of very deep convection and a mid-level eye feature becoming apparent by the next day [56] Around this time, Danilo began a fujiwhara interaction with Tropical Depression 05 to the east [57] The storm reached its initial peak intensity with sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) on 3 January with the development of a well-defined central dense overcast [58] Around the time of reaching peak strength, Danilo continued to absorb what remained of Tropical Depression 05, which was inflicting some southeasterly wind shear on the storm [58] The interaction between the two systems caused Danilo to rapidly weaken back to moderate tropical storm strength on 06:00 UTC 4 January [59] Danilo re-strengthened by the end of the day as 05 had been completely absorbed, regaining severe tropical storm strength at 06:00 UTC 5 January under an improvement in surrounding environment conditions peaking with winds of 100 km/h (60 mph) and a pressure of 981 hPa [60] A sudden increase in northerly shear, lack of outflow, and an interaction with the subtropical jet caused Danilo to take a sharp turn to the west and weaken to a moderate tropical storm [61] Danilo displayed a highly sheared pattern by 5 January and failed to retain any long-lasting bursts of convection as much of the thunderstorm activity became sheared to the south [62] Danilo fell to tropical depression status later that day [63] The persisting storm maintained a westward track, becoming a remnant low on 9 January with a fully exposed circulation on approach to the Mascarene Islands [64] Danilo passed north of Mauritius as a dissipating system on 11 January before the system was last noted on 12 January [65]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Eloise\nOn 14 January, a zone of disturbed weather formed over the central South Indian Ocean to the east of another system while gradually organizing and moving westward [66] On 16 January, the system organized into a tropical depression [67] With the presence of persisting deep convection, the system strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Eloise on 17 January [68] Initially, Eloise struggled to develop further due to the presence of strong easterly shear and dry air, which caused Eloise's thunderstorm activity to be displaced to the west [69] Despite the presence of this shear and mid-level dry air, Eloise continued to intensify further, with convection wrapping into an eye feature and outflow becoming increasingly defined, marking the intensification of Eloise into a severe tropical storm on 19 January, while heading westward towards Madagascar [70] This intensification trend did not last for a particularly long time, as Eloise made a small turn to the north and then made landfall in Antalaha, Madagascar, whilst weakening back to a moderate tropical storm, due to land interaction with the mountains of Madagascar [71] The next day, Eloise weakened due to land interaction, with deep convection over its center eroded, though it maintained flaring convection over the northern semicircle [72]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Joshua\nOn 16 January, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) first noted the presence of a tropical low in the Australian region which was expected to strengthen as it passed 90°E into the South-West Indian Ocean [82] On 17 January, the system, which had become Tropical Cyclone Joshua the previous day, crossed into the MFR's area of responsibility (AOR) [83] Joshua's convection fluctuated on 18 January, but the storm held onto moderate tropical storm status [84] However, Joshua soon entered an even more hostile environment with lots of dry air and high wind shear, causing Joshua's thunderstorms to rapidly dissipate; Joshua weakened to tropical depression status the next day [85] By 18:00 UTC 19 January, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and MFR both issued their final warning on Joshua [86] [87]\n\n\nTropical Depression 09\n\nOn 27 January, Tropical Low 10U from the Australian region entered the basin was designated as Tropical Depression 09 [88] Moving through a very hostile environment with dry air and high wind shear, the system struggled to maintain its strength with a mostly exposed circulation and only weak convection over the south side of the system [89] A short time after entering the basin, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) issued their last warning on 12:00 UTC 28 January as the system had become highly disorganized [90]\n\nVery Intense Tropical Cyclone Faraji\nEarly on 4 February, MFR began to track a well-defined surface circulation developing southeast of the Chagos Archipelago [91] Initially only in a moderately favorable environment, the disturbance unexpectedly and rapidly developed into a tropical depression 18 hours later [92] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued their first warning on the system as Tropical Cyclone 19S at 09:00 UTC that day [93] The depression further intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Faraji at 12:00 UTC on 5 February [94] The storm had an intense band of intense deep convection wrapping in from the western side to the northern side whilst rapidly consolidating [95] Afterward, Faraji began its first rapid intensification with a well-defined core structure developing throughout the day, marking the storm's intensification to severe tropical storm strength early on 6 February [96] Soon afterward, Faraji developed a pinhole eye as it continued to intensify, becoming a tropical cyclone several hours later [97] The cyclone's eye quickly became more pronounced on infrared satellite imagery while Faraji drifted over waters with high ocean heat content, and low vertical wind shear, indicating more strengthening had occurred [98] Faraji remained in a state of rapid intensification, and at 06:00 UTC 7 February Faraji became the first intense tropical cyclone of the season, with a clear, well-defined eye surrounded by deep, persisting convection as the cyclone began to slow down significantly [99] At this time, the JTWC upgraded Faraji to a Category 4-equivalent tropical cyclone, with 1-minute sustained winds at 215 km/h (135 mph) [100]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Guambe\nOn 10 February, a disturbance developed off the coast of Mozambique On 12 February, Météo-France La Réunion noted that the system had transitioned into a subtropical depression and had made landfall near Inhambane, Mozambique The storm was also slowly moving inland, without having developed any sustained convection [112] The next day, the system was designated as an overland tropical depression, while bringing locally heavy rainfall across areas of southern Mozambique [113] For the next few days, the system made a slow clockwise loop over Mozambique, while slowly organizing By 15 February, the meandering system had turned back eastward and was expected to re-emerge into the Mozambique Channel [114] At 06:00 UTC on 16 February, the system re-emerged over warm open water and was designated as Tropical Disturbance 11 [115] The storm continued organizing, and at 18:00 UTC that day, MFR upgraded the system to a tropical depression [116] On 17 February, the depression strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Guambe at 12:00 UTC that day, with the northern section of the storm becoming enveloped in deep convection [117]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Marian\nAt 06:00 UTC on 1 March, Severe Tropical Cyclone Marian entered the area of responsibility of Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) after crossing the 90th meridian east from the Australian region [127] At the time, the system was assessed as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (95 mph) and a central atmospheric pressure of 964 hPa (28.47 inHg) [127] Upon entering the South-West Indian Ocean (SWIO) basin, the system was classified as a tropical cyclone by MFR [128] Due to the short period of time that Marian was expected to stay in the SWIO basin before returning to the Australian region, it was agreed that the MFR would defer responsibility for providing official information on the system to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) [128] [129] Upon entering the basin, Marian become slow-moving in a competing steering environment, caught between ridges of high pressure to the north and south [130] After a plateau in intensity lasting for more than a day, marked by an eyewall replacement cycle and periodic waxing and waning of deep convection around the core, [131] [132] Marian began to strengthen again on 2 March [133] Maximum 10-minute sustained winds increased to 155 km/h, with gusts to 220 km/h and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 955 hPa (28.20 inHg) [134] [135] The increase in intensity proved short-lived, however, and the cyclone began to gradually weaken as it commenced a slow track back towards the east [136] Marian exited the SWIO basin just before 12:00 UTC on 2 March [137] [138]\n\n\nVery Intense Tropical Cyclone Habana\nOn 2 March, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) began to monitor a disturbance associated with the convergence of the easterly monsoon flow and the trade winds [139] This was soon followed by the JTWC issuing a TCFA on the disturbance, which had previously been designated as Invest 90S, early the next day [140] Early by the next day, the system was designated as a zone of disturbed weather [141] As the system slowly developed a discernible core, it was designated Moderate Tropical Storm Habana at 12:00 UTC 4 March [142] Around the same time, the JTWC designated the system as a tropical storm [143] Under the influence of a near equatorial ridge, Habana was slowly steered east-southeastward and continued steady strengthening [144] Habana reached severe tropical storm strength on 5 March, with a shallow eye reforming [145] Forecasts at the time showed a weakening system, but Habana underwent explosive intensification in exponentially better conditions from a 95 km/h (60 mph) severe tropical storm to an intense tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) in 12 hours that same day [146] It reached its peak strength with a pressure of 938 mb (27.69 inHg) on 6 March The storm's strengthening trend slowed down, but it maintained a very well-defined pinhole eye and compact core structure, while the JTWC assessed Habana as having 1-minute sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph) at the time, equivalent to a mid-level Category 4 hurricane [147] On 7 March, the storm encountered some dry air and limited outflow and began to weaken, with the JTWC downgrading it to a Category 3-equivalent on the SSHWS as the eye collapsed entirely Around the same time, MFR downgraded Habana back down to a tropical cyclone as the structure quickly deteriorated [148] The intrusion of dry air lead to Habana to continue rapidly weakening, with the storm's winds dropping to 120 km/h (75 mph) by 8 March [149]\n\n\nModerate Tropical Storm Iman\nOn 2 March, a weak tropical disturbance quickly formed within the monsoonal flow in the Mozambique Channel [158] The weak system slowly became more organized despite moderate wind shear, strengthening to a tropical depression by the next day [159] Before the system could strengthen in relatively favorable conditions, it made landfall in Madagascar around 09:50 UTC 5 March as a tropical depression and began to rapidly weaken [160] After accelerating through the Malagasy landmass, the system re-emerged over water near Vatomandry on 6 March, with the circulation of the storm having become elongated [161] As the storm passed to the southwest of the Mascarene Islands on 7 March, it strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Iman at 00:00 UTC that day, with the development of a rainband and a central dense overcast [162] Iman began to accelerate southeastward, steered by a mid-latitude trough, while maintaining its strength with little change in structure [163] On the next day, as the storm continued to accelerate, wind shear skyrocketed and the storm quickly deteriorated in structure Thus, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system later that day [164] All convection eventually dissipated, and MFR also issued their final warning at 12:00 UTC 8 March [165]\n\n\nTropical Depression 15\n\nOn 23 March, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) first noted that the development of a closed low southwest of Diego Garcia was possible under the influence of north-westerly winds being enhanced by the equatorial side of a regenerating monsoon trough [173] The system was first noted as a zone of disturbed weather on 25 March as convection grew more organized [174] By 26 March, the system had developed a broad closed low level circulation with a curved band pattern but was namely struggling due to moderate wind shear [175] Despite this, the circulation intensified to warrant an upgrade to Tropical Depression 15 at 06:00 UTC 27 March while the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert around the same time [176] [177] As shear strengthened, the system continued developing large but short lived bursts of convection attempting to cover the exposed circulation at the time [178] All thunderstorms associated with the low level circulation eventually collapsed by midday on 28 March and the last advisory was issued by MFR at that time [179] The JTWC also cancelled their Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, early the next day [180]\n\nTropical Cyclone Jobo\nAs far back as 10 April, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) had begun to monitor a broad clockwise circulation which had formed east of the Chagos Archipelago [181] The poorly defined disturbance tracked westward for several days, and by 15 April, had established some minimal thunderstorm activity [182] However, despite highly unfavorable low-level convergence, via the enhancement of an equatorial Rossby wave it had allowed the system to sustain a cyclonic circulation [183] By 12:00 UTC on 19 April, the system had consolidated into a zone of disturbed weather, according to MFR [184] The disturbance rather quickly increased in organization as environmental conditions improved by early on 20 April, meeting the criteria to be designated a tropical depression [185] The very small system further strengthened, earning the name Jobo at 18:00 UTC that day as it reached moderate tropical storm strength about 215 km (133 mi) north-northeast of Andranovondronina, Madagascar [186]\n\n\nStorm names\nTropical depressions and subtropical depressions are assigned a name when they intensify to have 10-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) as assessed by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center on La Réunion Island, France (RSMC La Réunion) [199] The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Mauritius assigns a name to a cyclone if it intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 55°E and 90°E A cyclone is assigned a name by the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Madagascar if it intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 30°E and 55°E Storm names are taken from three pre-determined lists of names, which rotate on a triennial basis, with any names that have been used automatically removed Therefore, all storm names used this year will be removed from the rotation and replaced with a new name for the 2023–24 season, while the unused names will remain on the list [200] New names this season were: Alicia, Bongoyo, Chalane, Danilo, Eloise, and Faraji They replaced names used during the 2017–18 season – Ava, Berguitta, Cebile, Dumazile, Eliakim, and Fakir.\n\n\nSeason effects\nThis table lists all of the tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones that were monitored during the 2020–2021 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season Information on their intensity, duration, name, areas affected, primarily comes from RSMC La Réunion Death and damage reports come from either press reports or the relevant national disaster management agency while the damage totals are given in 2020 or 2021 USD.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**2020–21 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season**\n\nThe 2020–21 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was a period of the year when tropical cyclones formed in the southern Indian Ocean. This season was a relatively quiet one, with only a few storms reaching significant intensity.\n\n**Seasonal summary**\n\nThe season began on 12 November, when Tropical Cyclone Alicia formed on the extreme northeast section of the basin. This formation marked the third season in a row in which a tropical cyclone developed before the official start of the season. Alicia strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 15 November, rapidly weakened due to the vertical wind shear and cool waters, and dissipated on 17 November. On 14 November, another tropical disturbance formed off the coast of Madagascar, but failed to organize due to unfavorable vertical wind shear. The basin remained quiet until 30 November, when a tropical low crossed over from the Australian region and strengthened into Tropical Cyclone Bongoyo. Two additional lows formed, one of which exited the basin on 20 December and another re-entered on 28 December, followed by another Zone of Disturbed Weather designated 06.\n\n**Systems**\n\n**Tropical Cyclone Alicia**\n\nOn 12 November, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) began tracking a tropical disturbance as it moved slowly westwards over the central Indian Ocean. Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The disturbance slowly consolidated as thunderstorms wrapped around the center of circulation, and it became a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on 13 November. The depression continued to become more organized over the day with flaring convection over the center, and thus was upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Alicia at 18:00 UTC that same day. Alicia strengthened into a severe tropical storm on 14 November at 06:00 UTC, and intensified into Tropical Cyclone Alicia at 00:00 UTC on 16 November, after very deep convection developed near its center. Soon after Alicia entered a region with high wind shear and cooler waters, it began to rapidly weaken, weakening to a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC on 16 November.\n\n**Tropical Depression 02**\n\nOn 12 November, along with the precursor disturbance of Cyclone Alicia, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) began to monitor another monsoonal disturbance to the west of Cyclone Alicia's precursor for potential tropical cyclogenesis. By 14 November, an area of disturbed weather had formed but struggled to centralize its thunderstorm activity, despite consolidating a low-level circulation. With improvements in further consolidation, the MFR initiated advisories for a tropical depression in the northeast of Madagascar at 18:00 UTC on 15 November. The storm struggled to intensify much due to strong easterly shear from its close proximity to Tropical Cyclone Alicia's outflow, and thus had its thunderstorm activity sheared to its west for most of its lifetime. Due to this, the JTWC cancelled the Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on 16 November.\n\n**Severe Tropical Storm Bongoyo**\n\nDuring 30 November, Tropical Low 01U moved into the basin from the Australian region, where it was classified as a Zone of Disturbed Weather by RSMC La Réunion. Early on 4 December, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system. After meandering slowly to the west and northwest for several days with little change in strength, the system began to take a more southerly track and at 06:00 UTC on 6 December was upgraded to Tropical Disturbance 03 by MFR as the low-level circulation became tighter and convection consolidated near the center. On 7 December, the disturbance intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Bongoyo as an ASCAT pass revealed gale-force winds on the southern half of the circulation. At this time, the JTWC cited a favorable environment for further intensification as Bongoyo headed southwest.\n\n**Severe Tropical Storm Chalane**\n\nOn 19 December, RSMC La Réunion began monitoring a zone of disturbed weather situated approximately 830 km (515 mi) southwest of Diego Garcia. The system was located in a favourable environment for intensification due to the presence of a Kelvin wave and an equatorial Rossby wave, as well as warm sea surface temperatures, low to moderate vertical wind shear and good upper-level outflow. Conditions began to somewhat deteriorate over the next several days as the system meandered to the west, but the storm still managed to reach tropical depression status on 23 December. Approximately a day later, at 06:00 UTC 24 December, the depression had strengthened to Moderate Tropical Storm Chalane as a scatterometer pass revealed gale-force winds on the southern side of the highly asymmetric wind field. Chalane began to strengthen, with winds reaching 75 km/h (45 mph), as wind shear decreased due to storm becoming aligned with the subtropical ridge. At 21:00 UTC that day, the JTWC designated Chalane as Tropical Storm 07S.\n\n**Tropical Depression 05**\n\nOn 17 December, RSMC La Réunion began monitoring a sheared low-pressure area located in the far northeastern corner of the basin, about 1,250 km (775 mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands. The system began moving slowly towards the southeast, and on the following day it was classified as a tropical disturbance by RSMC La Réunion. At the time, the system's central atmospheric pressure was estimated at 1005 hPa (29.68 inHg) and satellite scatterometer data from just after 02:00 UTC on 18 December indicated maximum 10-minute sustained winds of up to 55 km/h (35 mph) in the disturbance's northern semicircle. Environmental conditions were assessed as being marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) and low vertical wind shear, but only weak outflow in the upper troposphere. The tropical disturbance crossed into the Australian region by 20 December, where it was classified as Tropical Low 04U by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.\n\n**Severe Tropical Storm Danilo**\n\nOn 28 December, a Zone of Disturbed Weather formed near the Chagos Archipelago. It gradually organized over a sheared but moist environment for the next several days before eventually strengthening into Moderate Tropical Storm Danilo at 12:00 UTC 1 January. As Danilo tracked north, it continued to strengthen with the appearance of very deep convection and a mid-level eye feature becoming apparent by the next day. Around this time, Danilo began a fujiwhara interaction with Tropical Depression 05 to the east. The storm reached its initial peak intensity with sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) on 3 January with the development of a well-defined central dense overcast. Around the time of reaching peak strength, Danilo continued to absorb what remained of Tropical Depression 05, which was inflicting some southeasterly wind shear on the storm. The interaction between the two systems caused Danilo to rapidly weaken back to moderate tropical storm strength on 06:00 UTC 4 January.\n\n**Tropical Cyclone Eloise**\n\nOn 14 January, a zone of disturbed weather formed over the central South Indian Ocean to the east of another system while gradually organizing and moving westward. On 16 January, the system organized into a tropical depression. With the presence of persisting deep convection, the system strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Eloise on 17 January. Initially, Eloise struggled to develop further due to the presence of strong easterly shear and dry air, which caused Eloise's thunderstorm activity to be displaced to the west. Despite the presence of this shear and mid-level dry air, Eloise continued to intensify further, with convection wrapping into an eye feature and outflow becoming increasingly defined, marking the intensification of Eloise into a severe tropical storm on 19 January. This intensification trend did not last for a particularly long time, as Eloise made a small turn to the north and then made landfall in Antalaha, Madagascar, whilst weakening back to a moderate tropical storm, due to land interaction with the mountains of Madagascar.\n\n**Severe Tropical Storm Joshua**\n\nOn 16 January, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) first noted the presence of a tropical low in the Australian region which was expected to strengthen as it passed 90°E into the South-West Indian Ocean. On 17 January, the system, which had become Tropical Cyclone Joshua the previous day, crossed into the MFR's area of responsibility (AOR). Joshua's convection fluctuated on 18 January, but the storm held onto moderate tropical storm status. However, Joshua soon entered an even more hostile environment with lots of dry air and high wind shear, causing Joshua's thunderstorms to rapidly dissipate; Joshua weakened to tropical depression status the next day. By 18:00 UTC 19 January, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and MFR both issued their final warning on Joshua.\n\n**Tropical Depression 09**\n\nOn 27 January, Tropical Low 10U from the Australian region entered the basin was designated as Tropical Depression 09. Moving through a very hostile environment with dry air and high wind shear, the system struggled to maintain its strength with a mostly exposed circulation and only weak convection over the south side of the system. A short time after entering the basin, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) issued their last warning on 12:00 UTC 28 January as the system had become highly disorganized.\n\n**Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Faraji**\n\nEarly on 4 February, MFR began to track a well-defined surface circulation developing southeast of the Chagos Archipelago. Initially only in a moderately favorable environment, the disturbance unexpectedly and rapidly developed into a tropical depression 18 hours later. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued their first warning on the system as Tropical Cyclone 19S at 09:00 UTC that day. The depression further intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Faraji at 12:00 UTC on 5 February. The storm had an intense band of intense deep convection wrapping in from the western side to the northern side while rapidly consolidating. Afterward, Faraji began its first rapid intensification with a well-defined core structure developing throughout the day, marking the storm's intensification to severe tropical storm strength early on 6 February. Soon afterward, Faraji developed a pinhole eye as it continued to intensify, becoming a tropical cyclone several hours later. The cyclone's eye quickly became more pronounced on infrared satellite imagery while Faraji drifted over waters with high ocean heat content, and low vertical wind shear, indicating more strengthening had occurred. Faraji remained in a state of rapid intensification, and at 06:00 UTC 7 February Faraji became the first intense tropical cyclone of the season, with a clear, well-defined eye surrounded by deep, persisting convection as the cyclone began to slow down significantly. At this time, the JTWC upgraded Faraji to a Category 4-equivalent tropical cyclone, with 1-minute sustained winds at 215 km/h (135 mph).\n\n**Tropical Cyclone Guambe**\n\nOn 10 February, a disturbance developed off the coast of Mozambique. On 12 February, Météo-France La Réunion noted that the system had transitioned into a subtropical depression and had made landfall near Inhambane, Mozambique. The storm was also slowly moving inland, without having developed any sustained convection. The next day, the system was designated as an overland tropical depression, while bringing locally heavy rainfall across areas of southern Mozambique. For the next few days, the system made a slow clockwise loop over Mozambique, while slowly organizing. By 15 February, the meandering system had turned back eastward and was expected to re-emerge into the Mozambique Channel. At 06:00 UTC on 16 February, the system re-emerged over warm open water and was designated as Tropical Disturbance 11. On 17 February, the depression strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Guambe at 12:00 UTC that day, with the northern section of the storm becoming enveloped in deep convection.\n\n**Tropical Cyclone Marian**\n\nAt 06:00 UTC on 1 March, Severe Tropical Cyclone Marian entered the area of responsibility of Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) after crossing the 90th meridian east from the Australian region. At the time, the system was assessed as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (95 mph) and a central atmospheric pressure of 964 hPa (28.47 inHg). Upon entering the South-West Indian Ocean (SWIO) basin, the system was classified as a tropical cyclone by MFR. Due to the short period of time that Marian was expected to stay in the SWIO basin before returning to the Australian region, it was agreed that the MFR would defer responsibility for providing official information on the system to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). Upon entering the basin, Marian become slow-moving in a competing steering environment, caught between ridges of high pressure to the north and south. After a plateau in intensity lasting for more than a day, marked by an eyewall replacement cycle and periodic waxing and waning of deep convection around the core, Marian began to strengthen again on 2 March. Maximum 10-minute sustained winds increased to 155 km/h, with gusts to 220 km/h and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 955 hPa (28.20 inHg). The increase in intensity proved short-lived, however, and the cyclone began to gradually weaken as it commenced a slow track back towards the east. Marian exited the SWIO basin just before 12:00 UTC on 2 March.\n\n**Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Habana**\n\nOn 2 March, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) began to monitor a disturbance associated with the convergence of the easterly monsoon flow and the trade winds. This was soon followed by the JTWC issuing a TCFA on the disturbance, which had previously been designated as Invest 90S, early the next day. Early by the next day, the system was designated as a zone of disturbed weather. As the system slowly developed a discernible core, it was designated Moderate Tropical Storm Habana at 12:00 UTC 4 March. Around the same time, the JTWC designated the system as a tropical storm. Under the influence of a near equatorial ridge, Habana was slowly steered east-southeastward and continued steady strengthening. Habana reached severe tropical storm strength on 5 March, with a shallow eye reforming. Forecasts at the time showed a weakening system, but Habana underwent explosive intensification in exponentially better conditions from a 95 km/h (60 mph) severe tropical storm to an intense tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) in 12 hours that same day. It reached its peak strength with a pressure of 938 mb (27.69 inHg) on 6 March. The storm's strengthening trend slowed down, but it maintained a very well-defined pinhole eye and compact core structure, while the JTWC assessed Habana as having 1-minute sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph) at the time, equivalent to a mid-level Category 4 hurricane. On 7 March, the storm encountered some dry air and limited outflow and began to weaken, with the JTWC downgrading it to a Category 3-equivalent on the SSHWS as the eye collapsed entirely. Around the same time, MFR downgraded Habana back down to a tropical cyclone as the structure quickly deteriorated. The intrusion of dry air lead to Habana to continue rapidly weakening, with the storm's winds dropping to 120 km/h (75 mph) by 8 March.\n\n**Moderate Tropical Storm Iman**\n\nOn 2 March, a weak tropical disturbance quickly formed within the monsoonal flow in the Mozambique Channel. The weak system slowly became more organized despite moderate wind shear, strengthening to a tropical depression by the next day. Before the system could strengthen in relatively favorable conditions, it made landfall in Madagascar around 09:50 UTC 5 March as a tropical depression and began to rapidly weaken. After accelerating through the Malagasy landmass, the system re-emerged over water near Vatomandry on 6 March, with the circulation of the storm having become elongated. As the storm passed to the southwest of the Mascarene Islands on 7 March, it strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Iman at 00:00 UTC that day, with the development of a rainband and a central dense overcast. Iman began to accelerate southeastward, steered by a mid-latitude trough, while maintaining its strength with little change in structure. On the next day, as the storm continued to accelerate, wind shear skyrocketed and the storm quickly deteriorated in structure. Thus, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system later that day. All convection eventually dissipated, and MFR also issued their final warning at 12:00 UTC 8 March.\n\n**Tropical Depression 15**\n\nOn 23 March, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) first noted that the development of a closed low southwest of Diego Garcia was possible under the influence of north-westerly winds being enhanced by the equatorial side of a regenerating monsoon trough. The system was first noted as a zone of disturbed weather on 25 March as convection grew more organized. By 26 March, the system had developed a broad closed low-level circulation with a curved band pattern but was namely struggling due to moderate wind shear. Despite this, the circulation intensified to warrant an upgrade to Tropical Depression 15 at 06:00 UTC 27 March while the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert around the same time. As shear strengthened, the system continued developing large but short-lived bursts of convection attempting to cover the exposed circulation at the time. All thunderstorms associated with the low-level circulation eventually collapsed by midday on 28 March and the last advisory was issued by MFR at that time. The JTWC also cancelled their Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early the next day.\n\n**Tropical Cyclone Jobo**\n\nAs far back as 10 April, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) had begun to monitor a broad clockwise circulation which had formed east of the Chagos Archipelago. The poorly defined disturbance tracked westward for several days, and by 15 April, had established some minimal thunderstorm activity. However, despite highly unfavorable low-level convergence, via the enhancement of an equatorial Rossby wave it had allowed the system to sustain a cyclonic circulation. By 12:00 UTC on 19 April, the system had consolidated into a zone of disturbed weather, according to MFR. The disturbance rather quickly increased in organization as environmental conditions improved by early on 20 April, meeting the criteria to be designated a tropical depression. The very small system further strengthened, earning the name Jobo at 18:00 UTC that day as it reached moderate tropical storm strength about 215 km (133 mi) north-northeast of Andranovondronina, Madagascar.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2020–21_South-West_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season\" following this outline:\n\n\nSeasonal summary\nOn 12 November, Alicia formed on the extreme northeast section of the basin This formation marked the third season in a row in which a tropical cyclone developed before the official start of the season Alicia strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 15 November, rapidly weakened due to the vertical wind shear and cool waters, and dissipated on 17 November On 14 November, another tropical disturbance formed off the coast of Madagascar; however, on 16 November the system failed to organize due to unfavourable vertical wind shear according to JTWC It rapidly weakened and dissipated the next day The basin remained quiet until, on 30 November, a tropical low crossed over from the Australian region It strengthened into a moderate tropical storm, then to a severe tropical storm, and was named Bongoyo Two additional lows formed, one formed but exited the basin on 20 December and another Zone of Disturbed Weather formed near Diego Garcia, which strengthened to Severe Tropical Storm Chalane, which made landfall on Madagascar and Mozambique, the first tropical cyclone for this season to make landfall The same Zone of Disturbed Weather which exited on 20 December, again re-entered on 28 December, following with another Zone of Disturbed Weather, designated 06.\n\n\nSystems\nOn 12 November, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) also began tracking a tropical disturbance as it moved slowly westwards over the central Indian Ocean [1] Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert [2] The disturbance slowly consolidated as thunderstorms wrapped around the center of circulation, and it became a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on 13 November [3] The depression continued to become more organized over the day with flaring convection over the center, and thus was upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Alicia at 18:00 UTC that same day [4] On 14 November at 06:00 UTC, Alicia strengthened into a severe tropical storm [5] Alicia generally moved rapidly in a southwesterly direction due to the steering flow of a mid-level subtropical ridge to the storm's southeast [6] The severe tropical storm intensified into Tropical Cyclone Alicia at 00:00 UTC on 16 November, after very deep convection developed near its center [7]\nSoon after Alicia entered a region with high wind shear and cooler waters Due to these unfavorable conditions, Alicia began to rapidly weaken, weakening to a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC on 16 November [8] At 09:00 UTC on 17 November, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning on the storm [9]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Alicia\nOn 12 November, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) also began tracking a tropical disturbance as it moved slowly westwards over the central Indian Ocean [1] Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert [2] The disturbance slowly consolidated as thunderstorms wrapped around the center of circulation, and it became a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on 13 November [3] The depression continued to become more organized over the day with flaring convection over the center, and thus was upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Alicia at 18:00 UTC that same day [4] On 14 November at 06:00 UTC, Alicia strengthened into a severe tropical storm [5] Alicia generally moved rapidly in a southwesterly direction due to the steering flow of a mid-level subtropical ridge to the storm's southeast [6] The severe tropical storm intensified into Tropical Cyclone Alicia at 00:00 UTC on 16 November, after very deep convection developed near its center [7]\nSoon after Alicia entered a region with high wind shear and cooler waters Due to these unfavorable conditions, Alicia began to rapidly weaken, weakening to a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC on 16 November [8] At 09:00 UTC on 17 November, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final warning on the storm [9]\n\n\nTropical Depression 02\nOn 12 November, along with the precursor disturbance of Cyclone Alicia, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) began to monitor another monsoonal disturbance to the west of Cyclone Alicia's precursor for potential tropical cyclogenesis [10] By 14 November, an area of disturbed weather had formed but struggled to centralize its thunderstorm activity, despite consolidating a low level circulation [11] With improvements in further consolidation, the MFR initiated advisories for a tropical depression in the northeast of Madagascar at 18:00 UTC on 15 November [12] The storm struggled to intensify much due to strong easterly shear from its close proximity to Tropical Cyclone Alicia's outflow, and thus had its thunderstorm activity sheared to its west for most of its lifetime [13] Due to this, the JTWC cancelled the Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on 16 November [14] It rapidly weakened and the last advisory was issued by the MFR on 16 November as well [15]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Bongoyo\nDuring 30 November, Tropical Low 01U moved into the basin from the Australian region, where it was classified as a Zone of Disturbed Weather by RSMC La Réunion [16] Early on 4 December, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system [17] After meandering slowly to the west and northwest for several days with little change in strength, the system began to take a more southerly track and at 06:00 UTC on 6 December was upgraded to Tropical Disturbance 03 by MFR as the low level circulation became tighter and convection consolidated near the center [18] On 7 December, the disturbance intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Bongoyo as an ASCAT pass revealed gale-force winds on the southern half of the circulation [19] At this time, the JTWC cited a favorable environment for further intensification as Bongoyo headed southwest [20] While Bongoyo gained a distinct mid-level eye and strong bursts of convection were maintained near the center as the storm further strengthened to severe tropical storm status at 00:00 UTC on 8 December [21]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Chalane\nOn 19 December, RSMC La Réunion began monitoring a zone of disturbed weather situated approximately 830 km (515 mi) southwest of Diego Garcia [27] The system was located in a favourable environment for intensification due to the presence of a Kelvin wave and an equatorial Rossby wave, as well as warm sea surface temperatures, low to moderate vertical wind shear and good upper-level outflow [28] Conditions began to somewhat deteriorate over the next several days as the system meandered to the west, but the storm still managed to reach tropical depression status on 23 December, as northerly wind shear began to affect the storm, causing most of the thunderstorm activity and winds to be localized to the south of the center [29] Approximately a day later, at 06:00 UTC 24 December, the depression had strengthened to Moderate Tropical Storm Chalane as a scatterometer pass revealed gale-force winds on the southern side of the highly asymmetric wind field [30] Chalane began to strengthen, with winds reaching 75 km/h (45 mph), as wind shear decreased due to storm becoming aligned with the subtropical ridge Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert [31] [32] At 21:00 UTC that day, the JTWC designated Chalane as Tropical Storm 07S [33]\n\n\nTropical Depression 05\nOn 17 December, RSMC La Réunion began monitoring a sheared low-pressure area located in the far northeastern corner of the basin, about 1,250 km (775 mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands [47] The system began moving slowly towards the southeast, and on the following day it was classified as a tropical disturbance by RSMC La Réunion [48] At the time, the system's central atmospheric pressure was estimated at 1005 hPa (29.68 inHg) and satellite scatterometer data from just after 02:00 UTC on 18 December indicated maximum 10-minute sustained winds of up to 55 km/h (35 mph) in the disturbance's northern semicircle [48] Environmental conditions were assessed as being marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) and low vertical wind shear, but only weak outflow in the upper troposphere [49] The tropical disturbance crossed into the Australian region by 20 December, where it was classified as Tropical Low 04U by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology [50] [51] After meandering outside the basin for several days, the system re-entered the MFR's area of responsibility as a zone of disturbed weather on 28 December, before being upgraded to Tropical Depression 05 on 31 December [52] However, the system was unable to intensify significantly, due to the outflow from Severe Tropical Storm Danilo to the northwest On 2 January, Tropical Depression 05 began undergoing a Fujiwhara interaction with Danilo, before merging into the stronger system on 3 January [53]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Danilo\nOn 28 December, a Zone of Disturbed Weather formed near the Chagos Archipelago [54] It gradually organized over a sheared but moist environment for the next several days before eventually strengthening into Moderate Tropical Storm Danilo at 12:00 UTC 1 January [55] As Danilo tracked north, it continued to strengthen with the appearance of very deep convection and a mid-level eye feature becoming apparent by the next day [56] Around this time, Danilo began a fujiwhara interaction with Tropical Depression 05 to the east [57] The storm reached its initial peak intensity with sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) on 3 January with the development of a well-defined central dense overcast [58] Around the time of reaching peak strength, Danilo continued to absorb what remained of Tropical Depression 05, which was inflicting some southeasterly wind shear on the storm [58] The interaction between the two systems caused Danilo to rapidly weaken back to moderate tropical storm strength on 06:00 UTC 4 January [59] Danilo re-strengthened by the end of the day as 05 had been completely absorbed, regaining severe tropical storm strength at 06:00 UTC 5 January under an improvement in surrounding environment conditions peaking with winds of 100 km/h (60 mph) and a pressure of 981 hPa [60] A sudden increase in northerly shear, lack of outflow, and an interaction with the subtropical jet caused Danilo to take a sharp turn to the west and weaken to a moderate tropical storm [61] Danilo displayed a highly sheared pattern by 5 January and failed to retain any long-lasting bursts of convection as much of the thunderstorm activity became sheared to the south [62] Danilo fell to tropical depression status later that day [63] The persisting storm maintained a westward track, becoming a remnant low on 9 January with a fully exposed circulation on approach to the Mascarene Islands [64] Danilo passed north of Mauritius as a dissipating system on 11 January before the system was last noted on 12 January [65]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Eloise\nOn 14 January, a zone of disturbed weather formed over the central South Indian Ocean to the east of another system while gradually organizing and moving westward [66] On 16 January, the system organized into a tropical depression [67] With the presence of persisting deep convection, the system strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Eloise on 17 January [68] Initially, Eloise struggled to develop further due to the presence of strong easterly shear and dry air, which caused Eloise's thunderstorm activity to be displaced to the west [69] Despite the presence of this shear and mid-level dry air, Eloise continued to intensify further, with convection wrapping into an eye feature and outflow becoming increasingly defined, marking the intensification of Eloise into a severe tropical storm on 19 January, while heading westward towards Madagascar [70] This intensification trend did not last for a particularly long time, as Eloise made a small turn to the north and then made landfall in Antalaha, Madagascar, whilst weakening back to a moderate tropical storm, due to land interaction with the mountains of Madagascar [71] The next day, Eloise weakened due to land interaction, with deep convection over its center eroded, though it maintained flaring convection over the northern semicircle [72]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Joshua\nOn 16 January, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) first noted the presence of a tropical low in the Australian region which was expected to strengthen as it passed 90°E into the South-West Indian Ocean [82] On 17 January, the system, which had become Tropical Cyclone Joshua the previous day, crossed into the MFR's area of responsibility (AOR) [83] Joshua's convection fluctuated on 18 January, but the storm held onto moderate tropical storm status [84] However, Joshua soon entered an even more hostile environment with lots of dry air and high wind shear, causing Joshua's thunderstorms to rapidly dissipate; Joshua weakened to tropical depression status the next day [85] By 18:00 UTC 19 January, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and MFR both issued their final warning on Joshua [86] [87]\n\n\nTropical Depression 09\n\nOn 27 January, Tropical Low 10U from the Australian region entered the basin was designated as Tropical Depression 09 [88] Moving through a very hostile environment with dry air and high wind shear, the system struggled to maintain its strength with a mostly exposed circulation and only weak convection over the south side of the system [89] A short time after entering the basin, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) issued their last warning on 12:00 UTC 28 January as the system had become highly disorganized [90]\n\nVery Intense Tropical Cyclone Faraji\nEarly on 4 February, MFR began to track a well-defined surface circulation developing southeast of the Chagos Archipelago [91] Initially only in a moderately favorable environment, the disturbance unexpectedly and rapidly developed into a tropical depression 18 hours later [92] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued their first warning on the system as Tropical Cyclone 19S at 09:00 UTC that day [93] The depression further intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Faraji at 12:00 UTC on 5 February [94] The storm had an intense band of intense deep convection wrapping in from the western side to the northern side whilst rapidly consolidating [95] Afterward, Faraji began its first rapid intensification with a well-defined core structure developing throughout the day, marking the storm's intensification to severe tropical storm strength early on 6 February [96] Soon afterward, Faraji developed a pinhole eye as it continued to intensify, becoming a tropical cyclone several hours later [97] The cyclone's eye quickly became more pronounced on infrared satellite imagery while Faraji drifted over waters with high ocean heat content, and low vertical wind shear, indicating more strengthening had occurred [98] Faraji remained in a state of rapid intensification, and at 06:00 UTC 7 February Faraji became the first intense tropical cyclone of the season, with a clear, well-defined eye surrounded by deep, persisting convection as the cyclone began to slow down significantly [99] At this time, the JTWC upgraded Faraji to a Category 4-equivalent tropical cyclone, with 1-minute sustained winds at 215 km/h (135 mph) [100]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Guambe\nOn 10 February, a disturbance developed off the coast of Mozambique On 12 February, Météo-France La Réunion noted that the system had transitioned into a subtropical depression and had made landfall near Inhambane, Mozambique The storm was also slowly moving inland, without having developed any sustained convection [112] The next day, the system was designated as an overland tropical depression, while bringing locally heavy rainfall across areas of southern Mozambique [113] For the next few days, the system made a slow clockwise loop over Mozambique, while slowly organizing By 15 February, the meandering system had turned back eastward and was expected to re-emerge into the Mozambique Channel [114] At 06:00 UTC on 16 February, the system re-emerged over warm open water and was designated as Tropical Disturbance 11 [115] The storm continued organizing, and at 18:00 UTC that day, MFR upgraded the system to a tropical depression [116] On 17 February, the depression strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Guambe at 12:00 UTC that day, with the northern section of the storm becoming enveloped in deep convection [117]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Marian\nAt 06:00 UTC on 1 March, Severe Tropical Cyclone Marian entered the area of responsibility of Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) after crossing the 90th meridian east from the Australian region [127] At the time, the system was assessed as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (95 mph) and a central atmospheric pressure of 964 hPa (28.47 inHg) [127] Upon entering the South-West Indian Ocean (SWIO) basin, the system was classified as a tropical cyclone by MFR [128] Due to the short period of time that Marian was expected to stay in the SWIO basin before returning to the Australian region, it was agreed that the MFR would defer responsibility for providing official information on the system to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) [128] [129] Upon entering the basin, Marian become slow-moving in a competing steering environment, caught between ridges of high pressure to the north and south [130] After a plateau in intensity lasting for more than a day, marked by an eyewall replacement cycle and periodic waxing and waning of deep convection around the core, [131] [132] Marian began to strengthen again on 2 March [133] Maximum 10-minute sustained winds increased to 155 km/h, with gusts to 220 km/h and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 955 hPa (28.20 inHg) [134] [135] The increase in intensity proved short-lived, however, and the cyclone began to gradually weaken as it commenced a slow track back towards the east [136] Marian exited the SWIO basin just before 12:00 UTC on 2 March [137] [138]\n\n\nVery Intense Tropical Cyclone Habana\nOn 2 March, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) began to monitor a disturbance associated with the convergence of the easterly monsoon flow and the trade winds [139] This was soon followed by the JTWC issuing a TCFA on the disturbance, which had previously been designated as Invest 90S, early the next day [140] Early by the next day, the system was designated as a zone of disturbed weather [141] As the system slowly developed a discernible core, it was designated Moderate Tropical Storm Habana at 12:00 UTC 4 March [142] Around the same time, the JTWC designated the system as a tropical storm [143] Under the influence of a near equatorial ridge, Habana was slowly steered east-southeastward and continued steady strengthening [144] Habana reached severe tropical storm strength on 5 March, with a shallow eye reforming [145] Forecasts at the time showed a weakening system, but Habana underwent explosive intensification in exponentially better conditions from a 95 km/h (60 mph) severe tropical storm to an intense tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) in 12 hours that same day [146] It reached its peak strength with a pressure of 938 mb (27.69 inHg) on 6 March The storm's strengthening trend slowed down, but it maintained a very well-defined pinhole eye and compact core structure, while the JTWC assessed Habana as having 1-minute sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph) at the time, equivalent to a mid-level Category 4 hurricane [147] On 7 March, the storm encountered some dry air and limited outflow and began to weaken, with the JTWC downgrading it to a Category 3-equivalent on the SSHWS as the eye collapsed entirely Around the same time, MFR downgraded Habana back down to a tropical cyclone as the structure quickly deteriorated [148] The intrusion of dry air lead to Habana to continue rapidly weakening, with the storm's winds dropping to 120 km/h (75 mph) by 8 March [149]\n\n\nModerate Tropical Storm Iman\nOn 2 March, a weak tropical disturbance quickly formed within the monsoonal flow in the Mozambique Channel [158] The weak system slowly became more organized despite moderate wind shear, strengthening to a tropical depression by the next day [159] Before the system could strengthen in relatively favorable conditions, it made landfall in Madagascar around 09:50 UTC 5 March as a tropical depression and began to rapidly weaken [160] After accelerating through the Malagasy landmass, the system re-emerged over water near Vatomandry on 6 March, with the circulation of the storm having become elongated [161] As the storm passed to the southwest of the Mascarene Islands on 7 March, it strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Iman at 00:00 UTC that day, with the development of a rainband and a central dense overcast [162] Iman began to accelerate southeastward, steered by a mid-latitude trough, while maintaining its strength with little change in structure [163] On the next day, as the storm continued to accelerate, wind shear skyrocketed and the storm quickly deteriorated in structure Thus, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system later that day [164] All convection eventually dissipated, and MFR also issued their final warning at 12:00 UTC 8 March [165]\n\n\nTropical Depression 15\n\nOn 23 March, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) first noted that the development of a closed low southwest of Diego Garcia was possible under the influence of north-westerly winds being enhanced by the equatorial side of a regenerating monsoon trough [173] The system was first noted as a zone of disturbed weather on 25 March as convection grew more organized [174] By 26 March, the system had developed a broad closed low level circulation with a curved band pattern but was namely struggling due to moderate wind shear [175] Despite this, the circulation intensified to warrant an upgrade to Tropical Depression 15 at 06:00 UTC 27 March while the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert around the same time [176] [177] As shear strengthened, the system continued developing large but short lived bursts of convection attempting to cover the exposed circulation at the time [178] All thunderstorms associated with the low level circulation eventually collapsed by midday on 28 March and the last advisory was issued by MFR at that time [179] The JTWC also cancelled their Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, early the next day [180]\n\nTropical Cyclone Jobo\nAs far back as 10 April, Météo-France La Réunion (MFR) had begun to monitor a broad clockwise circulation which had formed east of the Chagos Archipelago [181] The poorly defined disturbance tracked westward for several days, and by 15 April, had established some minimal thunderstorm activity [182] However, despite highly unfavorable low-level convergence, via the enhancement of an equatorial Rossby wave it had allowed the system to sustain a cyclonic circulation [183] By 12:00 UTC on 19 April, the system had consolidated into a zone of disturbed weather, according to MFR [184] The disturbance rather quickly increased in organization as environmental conditions improved by early on 20 April, meeting the criteria to be designated a tropical depression [185] The very small system further strengthened, earning the name Jobo at 18:00 UTC that day as it reached moderate tropical storm strength about 215 km (133 mi) north-northeast of Andranovondronina, Madagascar [186]\n\n\nStorm names\nTropical depressions and subtropical depressions are assigned a name when they intensify to have 10-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) as assessed by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center on La Réunion Island, France (RSMC La Réunion) [199] The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Mauritius assigns a name to a cyclone if it intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 55°E and 90°E A cyclone is assigned a name by the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Madagascar if it intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 30°E and 55°E Storm names are taken from three pre-determined lists of names, which rotate on a triennial basis, with any names that have been used automatically removed Therefore, all storm names used this year will be removed from the rotation and replaced with a new name for the 2023–24 season, while the unused names will remain on the list [200] New names this season were: Alicia, Bongoyo, Chalane, Danilo, Eloise, and Faraji They replaced names used during the 2017–18 season – Ava, Berguitta, Cebile, Dumazile, Eliakim, and Fakir.\n\n\nSeason effects\nThis table lists all of the tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones that were monitored during the 2020–2021 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season Information on their intensity, duration, name, areas affected, primarily comes from RSMC La Réunion Death and damage reports come from either press reports or the relevant national disaster management agency while the damage totals are given in 2020 or 2021 USD.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

Shadow and Bone was a critical and commercial success, and was nominated for several awards, including the Romantic Times Book Award and the South Carolina Children's Book Award. The novel was also named an Indie Next List Book and reviewed in The New York Times.\n\nThe success of Shadow and Bone led to the publication of the second and third books in the Grisha trilogy, Siege and Storm and Ruin and Rising, which were published in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Both books continued the story of Alina and her friends, exploring themes of power, loyalty, and identity.\n\n## Adaptations\n\nIn 2012, DreamWorks acquired the movie rights to Shadow and Bone, with David Heyman and Jeffrey Clifford producing. However, the project was not realized. In 2019, Netflix ordered an eight-episode series based on the Shadow and Bone and Six of Crows book series. Bardugo made a cameo appearance in episode three of the series.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nIn the acknowledgments section of Six of Crows, Bardugo reveals that she has osteonecrosis, a condition that causes bone tissue to die. She also mentions that she sometimes needs to use a cane, which was a source of inspiration for one of the story's six protagonists, master thief and gang boss Kaz Brekker, who uses a cane.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n### The Grishaverse\n\n* Shadow and Bone trilogy:\n\t+ Shadow and Bone (2012)\n\t+ Siege and Storm (2013)\n\t+ Ruin and Rising (2014)\n* Six of Crows duology:\n\t+ Six of Crows (2015)\n\t+ Crooked Kingdom (2016)\n* King of Scars duology:\n\t+ King of Scars (2019)\n\t+ Rule of Wolves (2021)\n\n### Alex Stern series\n\n* Ninth House (2019)\n* Hell Bent (2022)\n\n### Companion books\n\n* The Language of Thorns: Stories from the Vault of Magic Akademía (2017)\n* The Lives of Saints (2017)\n\n### Other titles\n\n* Wonder Woman: Warbringer (2016)\n* Three Dark Crowns (2018)\n\n## Critical Studies and Reviews of Bardugo's Work\n\nBardugo's works have been widely praised for their unique blend of fantasy and historical elements, as well as their strong female protagonists and complex world-building.

{"title": "UEFA_Euro_2020", "content": "\nBid process\nWhile some countries such as Belgium, [12] Bulgaria and Romania, [13] Germany, [14] [15] Hungary and Romania, [16] Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, [17] the Netherlands, [18] and Turkey [19] had already expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament, then-UEFA president Michel Platini suggested at a press conference on 30 June 2012, a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, that instead of having one host country, or joint hosting by multiple countries, the tournament could be spread over \"12 or 13 cities\" across the continent, as was done for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship's elite round, where each of the seven groups was hosted by a different country [20]\n\n\nEuropean format decision\nOn 6 December 2012, UEFA announced the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament [21] [22] The selection of the host cities did not guarantee an automatic qualifying berth to the national team of that country UEFA reasoned that the pan-European staging of the tournament was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty, such as the European debt crisis [23] [24] Reaction to UEFA's plan was mixed across Europe [25] Critics cited the expanded format (from 31 matches featuring 16 nations to 51 featuring 24) and its associated additional costs as the decisive factor for only one nation (Turkey) having put forward a serious bid [26]\n\n\nBidding venues\nThe final list of bids was published by UEFA on 26 April 2014, with a decision on the hosts being made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014 There were two bids for the Finals Package (of which one was successful, marked with dark green for semi-finals and final) and 19 bids for the Standard Package (of which 12 were initially successful, marked with light green for quarter-finals and group stage, and yellow for round of 16 and group stage); Brussels, marked with red, were initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 7 December 2017 [27] [11] [28] Dublin, marked in red, was initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 23 April 2021 On the same day, UEFA also announced the matches in Spain would be moved from Bilbao to Seville [10]\n\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic\nIn early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe triggered concerns regarding its potential effect on players, staff and visitors to the twelve host cities of the tournament [29] At the UEFA Congress in early March, UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin said the organisation was confident that the situation could be dealt with, while general secretary Theodore Theodoridis stated that UEFA was maintaining contact with the World Health Organization and national governments regarding the coronavirus [30] The impact on football grew later that month, as numerous domestic and UEFA competition matches began taking place behind closed doors By 13 March 2020, upcoming UEFA competition fixtures were postponed, while major European leagues were suspended, including the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, Premier League, and Serie A [31]\n\n\nStart of the pandemic and postponement\nIn early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe triggered concerns regarding its potential effect on players, staff and visitors to the twelve host cities of the tournament [29] At the UEFA Congress in early March, UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin said the organisation was confident that the situation could be dealt with, while general secretary Theodore Theodoridis stated that UEFA was maintaining contact with the World Health Organization and national governments regarding the coronavirus [30] The impact on football grew later that month, as numerous domestic and UEFA competition matches began taking place behind closed doors By 13 March 2020, upcoming UEFA competition fixtures were postponed, while major European leagues were suspended, including the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, Premier League, and Serie A [31]\n\n\nSpectator plans and venue changes\nIn May 2020, Čeferin stated that in principle the tournament would take place in the twelve selected host cities However, he did not rule out the possibility of reducing the number of cities, as three hosts were unsure if matches could be held under the new schedule [38] The tournament venues and match schedule was reviewed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 17 June 2020 [39] At the meeting, UEFA confirmed that all twelve original host venues would remain as hosts for the tournament in 2021, and approved the revised match schedule [40] [41] However, Čeferin stated in October 2020 that it was still possible that the tournament could be played in fewer than the planned twelve host countries [42] The following month, UEFA stated that it \"intends to hold Euro 2020 in the format and the venues confirmed earlier this year and we are working closely with all host cities on preparations\" [43] It was also announced that each host was discussing with UEFA and local health authorities on whether the venue could host matches at full capacity, between 100% and 50% capacity, at 33% capacity or behind closed doors Each host city was asked to draw up two or three plans from the four options The restrictions could also involve only local spectators to be permitted at matches A final decision on which scenario would be applied individually at each venue was originally to be made on 5 March 2021 [44] [45] In October 2020, it was announced that UEFA matches would be suspended from taking place in Armenia and Azerbaijan until further notice due to the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war [46] However, this did not affect the planning of Euro 2020 matches to be held in Baku [47] This restriction was lifted in December 2020 following a ceasefire agreement between the countries [48]\n\n\nSemi-final and final venue\nWembley Stadium's hosting of both the semi-finals and the final was threatened over quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom that fans and 2,500 VIPs would be subject to The Puskás Aréna in Budapest was considered as an alternative venue, as Hungary would have no entry restrictions for travel within the Schengen Area and could host the matches at full capacity [70] A spokesman for the Hungarian Football Federation said the organisation was \"ready to host any high-level football event\" [71] However, UEFA remained confident that Wembley could host the final, as the organisation and the UK government discussed quarantine exemptions, [72] but did not rule out a change in venue [73] Minister Kit Malthouse said the government was doing \"as much as we possibly can\" to host the final, [74] while prime minister Boris Johnson stated they would try to make \"sensible accommodations\" for UEFA while still prioritising public health [75] Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the final should be held in Rome due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom [76] The following week, it was reported that officials and executives travelling for the matches would not need to self-isolate, though they would be subject to restrictions and required to remain in \"football bubbles\" [77] [78]\n\n\nRule changes\nOn 31 March 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of a maximum of five substitutions in matches at the tournament (with a sixth allowed in extra time) [7] However, each team are only given three opportunities to make substitutions, with a fourth opportunity allowed in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time [79] The use of five substitutes has been permitted by IFAB during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resulting fixture congestion, which has created a greater burden on players [80]\n\n\nSpecial rules due to COVID-19\nOn 4 May 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved special rules for the final tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: [83] [86]\n\n\nQualification\nThere was no automatic qualifying berth, and all 55 UEFA national teams, including the twelve national teams whose countries were selected to stage matches, had to compete in the qualifiers for the 24 places at the finals tournament [87] [88] As the host cities were appointed by UEFA in September 2014, before the qualifiers, it was possible for the national teams from the host cities to fail to qualify for the finals tournament The qualifying draw was held on 2 December 2018 at the Convention Centre Dublin in Dublin, Ireland [89]\n\n\nQualified teams\nOf the 24 teams that qualified for the tournament, 19 were returning from the 2016 edition Among them were Belgium and Italy, who both had recorded flawless qualifying campaigns (ten wins in ten matches), [94] [95] defending European champions Portugal and world champions France, with Germany also qualifying for a record 13th straight European Championship [96] Finland and North Macedonia made their European Championship debuts, having never previously qualified for a major tournament [97] [98] Scotland, a co-host of the tournament, qualified for their first major international tournament since the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and their first European Championship since 1996 [99] The Netherlands and Denmark returned after missing out in 2016, with the Dutch featuring in a major tournament for the first time since the 2014 FIFA World Cup [100] [101] For the first time, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, and Wales reached successive European Championship tournaments [102] [103] Greece, winners in 2004, were the only former champions that failed to qualify, missing their second straight European Championship and third consecutive major tournament [104] Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and Romania failed to qualify after appearing in the 2016 finals [105]\n\n\nVenues\nThe 13 original venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014 [111] However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of Eurostadium The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to Wembley Stadium in London [9] On 23 April 2021, UEFA announced that due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Aviva Stadium in Dublin was removed as a tournament host Their four matches were reallocated to Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg for the three group stage matches, and Wembley Stadium in London for the round of 16 fixture Similarly, UEFA reassigned the four matches in Spain elsewhere in the country, with Estadio La Cartuja in Seville replacing San Mamés Stadium in Bilbao [10]\n\n\nGroup stage hosts\nThe host cities were divided into six pairings, established on the basis of sporting strength (assuming all host teams qualify), geographical considerations and security/political constraints The pairings were allocated to groups by means of a random draw on 7 December 2017 Each qualified host country played a minimum of two matches at home The following group venue pairings were announced: [9]\n\n\nSpectator limits\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions on public gatherings, many of the venues at the tournament were unable to operate at full capacity UEFA asked each host to devise a spectator plan in conjunction with their local/national government and health authorities The hosts were given a deadline of 7 April 2021 to communicate their plans with UEFA On 9 April, UEFA announced that eight of the tournament hosts had confirmed their stadium capacities, ranging from 25% to 100% The remaining four hosts (Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome) were given an extension until 23 April to submit their venue capacities [58] On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had also confirmed its venue capacity [59] On 23 April, the venue capacity for Munich was also confirmed, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville, which could guarantee spectators In addition, Dublin was removed as a host, as it was unable to ensure spectators could attend [10]\n\n\nTeam base camps\nEach team chose a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases Unlike previous tournaments, each team could set up their base camp anywhere due to the pan-European format, without any obligation of staying in any of the host countries [126]\n\n\nFinal draw\nThe draw for the final tournament was held on 30 November 2019, 18:00 CET (19:00 local time, EET) at Romexpo in Bucharest, Romania [134] [135] [136] [106] The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four The identity of the four play-off teams were not known at the time of the draw and were identified as play-off winners A to D [137] Should there have been groups that could not be finalised at the time of the final tournament draw, another draw would have been held after the play-offs on 1 April 2020, [1] but UEFA confirmed the additional draw was not necessary after the identity of the 20 directly qualified teams and the 16 play-offs teams was known [115]\n\n\nPlay-off path group allocation\nDue to the format of the play-offs, which made anticipating all possible scenarios impossible, the UEFA administration had to wait to solve issues relating to the final tournament draw until the completion of the qualifying group stage [113] It was not possible for UEFA to prevent one of the play-off paths from containing two host teams, resulting in Romania (Group C hosts) and Hungary (Group F hosts) being drawn together in Path A Therefore, the winner of this play-off path needed to be assigned two groups in the final tournament draw To allow for this, Path A was paired with Path D (which does not contain a host), therefore providing a clear scenario for each possible qualified team A draw took place on 22 November 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland (along with the play-offs draw), which decided on the order of priority for the allocation of Path A to the final tournament groups [115]\n\n\nSeeding\nThe following was the composition of the pots, with teams divided and seeded as per their European Qualifiers overall ranking: [141]\n\n\nDraw results and group fixtures\nThe draw resulted in the following groups (teams in italics are play-off winners whose identity was not known at the time of the draw):\n\n\nSquads\nTo lessen the load on players due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in case of an outbreak within a team, squad sizes were increased from 23 (used at every European Championship since 2004) to 26 However, the maximum number of players permitted on the match sheet for each tournament fixture remained 23 [83] Each nation's squad, which had to include three goalkeepers, was submitted at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament (by 1 June 2021) If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player; [1] however, goalkeepers could still be replaced after their team's first match due to physical incapacity [83]\n\n\nMatch officials\nOn 27 September 2018, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) system for the first time at the UEFA European Championship [8] On 12 February 2020, UEFA and CONMEBOL signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance collaboration, including the possibility of a team of South American match officials appointed for the group stage of the tournament [142]\n\n\nOpening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy, on 11 June 2021 at 20:35 (CEST) prior to the first match of the tournament Italian

was a virtual one amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and was filmed at motion-control studios in London and at the Stadio Olimpico to recreate the stadium environment in 3D [149]\n\n\nGroup stage\nUEFA announced the original tournament schedule on 24 May 2018, which only included kick-off times for the opening match and quarter-finals onward [150] [151] The kick-off times of the remaining group stage and round of 16 matches were announced on 30 November 2019 following the final draw [152] On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced the revised match schedule for the tournament in 2021 [153] [154] All match dates, kick-off times and venues remained identical, but shifted one day earlier so matches would remain on the same day of the week (i.e from 12 to 11 June for the opening match to remain on a Friday) On 23 April 2021, UEFA revised the venue assignments of the match schedule after one stadium was removed from the tournament and another was replaced [155]\n\n\nTiebreakers\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied: [1]\n\n\nGroup A\n\n\n\nGroup B\n\n\n\nGroup C\n\n\n\nGroup D\n\n\n\nGroup

territory by Ukraine and the United Nations The shirt carried the slogan \"Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that it was a Ukrainian nationalist slogan that imitated a Nazi one Russian Deputy Dmitry Svishchev called UEFA to intervene because the shirt was \"totally inappropriate\" [261] UEFA said there was no dispute for the map of Ukraine, as it reflected the borders recognized by the United Nations, while it ordered the removal of the phrase, as \"specific combination of the two slogans is deemed to be clearly political in nature, having historic and militaristic significance.\" [262]\n\n\nUkraine kit\nThe team of Ukraine presented its shirt for the championship, decorated with a map of national borders, including Crimea The peninsula was annexed by the Russian Federation in 2014 but is still considered part of its territory by Ukraine and the United Nations The shirt carried the slogan \"Glory to Ukraine!

complaint with UEFA after the game, demanding a clear penalty The UEFA Control Committee then opened an investigation, Arnautović was banned from the next game by UEFA for \"insulting another player\", and was unable to play in Netherlands vs Austria, the group's second game [273]\n\n\nRemoving marketing drink bottles\nAt a press conference before Hungary vs Portugal on 14 June 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo removed Coca-Cola bottles from the table and then held a water bottle in front of the camera to highlight that water, healthier than Coca-Cola, is his ideal drink; [274] [275] it was thought that Ronaldo's actions were behind the collapse of Coca-Cola market value, but it was later found it had nothing to do with it [276] [277] [278] After France vs Germany, France's Paul Pogba, a practising Muslim, [279] moved bottles of non-alcoholic Heineken beer from the table at a press conference [280] After these two actions, UEFA spoke with each team participating in the European

run-up to the France vs Germany on 15 June 2021 in Munich, a man with a paramotor got stuck on a fixed rope during a flight over the stadium, fell into a descent, grazed the spectator stands, and landed on the pitch In the action planned as a protest by Greenpeace against car manufacturer Volkswagen, in which only a large ball with a label was supposed to be thrown onto the field, two people in the stands suffered head injuries and had to receive medical care [282] The campaign provoked strong criticism due to the endangerment of viewers; UEFA criticised it as a \"reckless and dangerous action\" that could have had serious consequences for many people [283] The German Football Association (DFB), the Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder, and other politicians made similar statements, and Greenpeace apologised A total flight ban was issued over the stadium for the duration of the European Championship The Munich police investigated the paramotor pilot for dangerous bodily harm, trespassing, and violation of the Aviation Act [284] [285] The 40 year old pilot was later convicted of endangering air traffic and negligent bodily harm and fined €7,200 for parachuting into the

rainbow armband\nIn connection with Pride Month, the German team used related symbolism Team captain Manuel Neuer wore a captain's armband in rainbow colours in a friendly against Latvia on 7 June and continued to wear the armband in Germany's subsequent games An investigation by UEFA followed during the group stage of the tournament They assessed the armband as a \"team symbol for diversity\" and \"a good cause.\" UEFA decided not to impose a penalty because of the rule broken by Neuer, which obliges team captains to wear UEFA captains' armbands [287]\n\n\nIllumination of the Allianz Arena in rainbow colours\nBefore the Germany vs Hungary group stage match on 23 June 2021, Munich City Council applied to UEFA to have the façade of the stadium illuminated in rainbow colours as a sign of diversity and tolerance Since the project was understood as a protest against a law passed by the Hungarian Parliament that, according to its critics, restricts the \"information rights\" of young people with regard to homosexuality and gender transitioning, [288] UEFA rejected the application with reference to its status as a politically and religiously neutral organisation [289] After initially approving the illumination of the stadium in rainbow colours, the German Football Association joined the UEFA position The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter criticised these decisions and described the illumination not as a political measure but as what he called a sign of humanity and a symbol for the acceptance of equality between people [290] In contrast, the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Péter Szijjártó welcomed UEFA's decision \"not to be involved in a political provocation against Hungary.\" [291]\n\n\nConfiscation of rainbow flag in Baku\nOn 3 July 2021, UEFA began an investigation after two fans had a rainbow flag confiscated during the quarter-final match between the Czech Republic and Denmark at the Baku Olympic Stadium in Azerbaijan [298] [299] Photos emerged while the match was being played, showing two stewards taking a rainbow flag, waved in support of the LGBTQ+ community, being taken [300] In a statement, UEFA said: \"UEFA never instructed stewards in Baku – or in any other stadium – to confiscate rainbow flags We are currently investigating what happened and we will of course contact the UEFA delegate, UEFA security officer and local authorities to clear this up The rainbow flag is a symbol that embodies UEFA core values, promoting everything that we believe in – a more just and egalitarian society, tolerant of everyone and UEFA has ensured that the flag was returned to the supporter.\" [301]\n\n\nEngland vs Denmark incidents\nIn the 104th minute in the England vs Denmark semi-final match, on-field referee Danny Makkelie awarded a penalty kick to England after adjudging Danish defender Joakim Mæhle to have fouled English player Raheem Sterling in the penalty area Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel stopped Harry Kane's penalty kick, but Kane was able to score from the rebound In a press conference shortly after the match, Danish coach Kasper Hjulmand expressed his dissatisfaction with the penalty decision, [302] as well as the fact that there were two balls on the pitch when the foul was given [303] Non-English commentators such as Arsène Wenger, José Mourinho, and Dietmar Hamann criticised the penalty decision during and after the match, arguing that the penalty should not have been awarded when checked by VAR, while Roy Keane described it as \"very, very soft\" [304] [305] Former England forward Alan Shearer also described the penalty decision as \"soft\", and said he would be \"pretty angry if that penalty was given against England\", while former England full-back Gary Neville said: \"If we're being fair, you'd be absolutely devastated if you lost to a penalty like that.\" Match official and current ESPN rules analyst Mark Clattenburg, who refereed the UEFA Euro 2016 Final, said he would not have awarded a penalty kick for a tackle of this sort \"in such a key moment.\" [306] [307]\n\n\nItaly vs England incidents\nOn the day of the UEFA Euro 2020 final between Italy and England,

[347]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**UEFA Euro 2020**\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2020 was the 16th edition of the UEFA European Football Championship, the quadrennial international football tournament organized by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). The tournament was held in 12 cities across Europe, from 11 June to 11 July 2021.\n\n**Bid process**\n\nThe bid process for the tournament began in 2012, with several countries expressing interest in hosting the event. On 30 June 2012, UEFA president Michel Platini suggested that the tournament could be spread across 12 or 13 cities in Europe, rather than having a single host country. This idea was met with a mixed reaction from European football associations.\n\n**European format decision**\n\nOn 6 December 2012, UEFA announced that the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe, marking the 60th anniversary of the tournament. The selection of host cities did not guarantee an automatic qualifying berth to the national team of that country. UEFA reasoned that the pan-European staging of the tournament was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty, such as the European debt crisis.\n\n**Bidding venues**\n\nThe final list of bids was published by UEFA on 26 April 2014, with a decision on the hosts being made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014. There were two bids for the Finals Package, with one successful bid, marked with dark green for semi-finals and final, and 19 bids for the Standard Package, with 12 initially successful bids, marked with light green for quarter-finals and group stage, and yellow for round of 16 and group stage.\n\n**Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic**\n\nIn early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe triggered concerns regarding its potential effect on players, staff, and visitors to the twelve host cities of the tournament. UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin said the organisation was confident that the situation could be dealt with, while general secretary Theodore Theodoridis stated that UEFA was maintaining contact with the World Health Organization and national governments regarding the coronavirus.\n\n**Spectator limits**\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions on public gatherings, many of the venues at the tournament were unable to operate at full capacity. UEFA asked each host to devise a spectator plan in conjunction with their local/national government and health authorities. The hosts were given a deadline of 7 April 2021 to communicate their plans with UEFA.\n\n**Group stage hosts**\n\nThe host cities were divided into six pairings, established on the basis of sporting strength, geographical considerations, and security/political constraints. The pairings were allocated to groups by means of a random draw on 7 December 2017. Each qualified host country played a minimum of two matches at home.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nAll 55 UEFA national teams, including the twelve national teams whose countries were selected to stage matches, had to compete in the qualifiers for the 24 places at the finals tournament. The qualifying draw was held on 2 December 2018 at the Convention Centre Dublin in Dublin, Ireland.\n\n**Draw results and group fixtures**\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:\n\n**Group A**\n\n* Turkey\n* Italy\n* Wales\n* Switzerland\n\n**Group B**\n\n* Denmark\n* Finland\n* Belgium\n* Russia\n\n**Group C**\n\n* Netherlands\n* Ukraine\n* Austria\n* North Macedonia\n\n**Group D**\n\n* Croatia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Poland\n\n**Group E**\n\n* Germany\n* France\n* Portugal\n* Hungary\n\n**Group F**\n\n* England\n* Scotland\n* Czech Republic\n* Croatia\n\n**Group G**\n\n* Portugal\n* France\n* Germany\n* Hungary\n\n**Group H**\n\n* Czech Republic\n* England\n* Croatia\n* Scotland\n\n**Group I**\n\n* Ukraine\n* Netherlands\n* Austria\n* North Macedonia\n\n**Group J**\n\n* Denmark\n* Finland\n* Belgium\n* Russia\n\n**Group K**\n\n* Wales\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Italy\n\n**Group L**\n\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Poland\n* Croatia\n\n**Group M**\n\n* Germany\n* France\n* Portugal\n* Hungary\n\n**Group N**\n\n* England\n* Scotland\n* Czech Republic\n* Croatia\n\n**Group O**\n\n* Ukraine\n* Netherlands\n* Austria\n* North Macedonia\n\n**Group P**\n\n* Denmark\n* Finland\n* Belgium\n* Russia\n\n**Group Q**\n\n* Wales\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Italy\n\n**Group R**\n\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Poland\n* Croatia\n\n**Group S**\n\n* Germany\n* France\n* Portugal\n* Hungary\n\n**Group T**\n\n* England\n* Scotland\n* Czech Republic\n* Croatia\n\n**Group U**\n\n* Ukraine\n* Netherlands\n* Austria\n* North Macedonia\n\n**Group V**\n\n* Denmark\n* Finland\n* Belgium\n* Russia\n\n**Group W**\n\n* Wales\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Italy\n\n**Group X**\n\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Poland\n* Croatia\n\n**Group Y**\n\n* Germany\n* France\n* Portugal\n* Hungary\n\n**Group Z**\n\n* England\n* Scotland\n* Czech Republic\n* Croatia\n\n**Group AA**\n\n* Ukraine\n* Netherlands\n* Austria\n* North Macedonia\n\n**Group BB**\n\n* Denmark\n* Finland\n* Belgium\n* Russia\n\n**Group CC**\n\n* Wales\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Italy\n\n**Group DD**\n\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Poland\n* Croatia\n\n**Group EE**\n\n* Germany\n* France\n* Portugal\n* Hungary\n\n**Group FF**\n\n* England\n* Scotland\n* Czech Republic\n* Croatia\n\n**Group GG**\n\n* Ukraine\n* Netherlands\n* Austria\n* North Macedonia\n\n**Group HH**\n\n* Denmark\n* Finland\n* Belgium\n* Russia\n\n**Group II**\n\n* Wales\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Italy\n\n**Group JJ**\n\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Poland\n* Croatia\n\n**Group KK**\n\n* Germany\n* France\n* Portugal\n* Hungary\n\n**Group LL**\n\n* England\n* Scotland\n* Czech Republic\n* Croatia\n\n**Group MM**\n\n* Ukraine\n* Netherlands\n* Austria\n* North Macedonia\n\n**Group NN**\n\n* Denmark\n* Finland\n* Belgium\n* Russia\n\n**Group OO**\n\n* Wales\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Italy\n\n**Group PP**\n\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Poland\n* Croatia\n\n**Group QQ**\n\n* Germany\n* France\n* Portugal\n* Hungary\n\n**Group RR**\n\n* England\n* Scotland\n* Czech Republic\n* Croatia\n\n**Group SS**\n\n* Ukraine\n* Netherlands\n* Austria\n* North Macedonia\n\n**Group TT**\n\n* Denmark\n* Finland\n* Belgium\n* Russia\n\n**Group UU**\n\n* Wales\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Italy\n\n**Group VV**\n\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Poland\n* Croatia\n\n**Group WW**\n\n* Germany\n* France\n* Portugal\n* Hungary\n\n**Group XX**\n\n* England\n* Scotland\n* Czech Republic\n* Croatia\n\n**Group YY**\n\n* Ukraine\n* Netherlands\n* Austria\n* North Macedonia\n\n**Group ZZ**\n\n* Denmark\n* Finland\n* Belgium\n* Russia\n\n**Knockout stage**\n\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each), with each team being allowed to make a sixth substitution.

Netherlands, [18] and Turkey [19] had already expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament, then-UEFA president Michel Platini suggested at a press conference on 30 June 2012, a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, that instead of having one host country, or joint hosting by multiple countries, the tournament could be spread over \"12 or 13 cities\" across the continent, as was done for

initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 7 December 2017 [27] [11] [28] Dublin, marked in red, was initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 23 April 2021 On the same day, UEFA also announced the matches in Spain would be moved from Bilbao to Seville [10]\n\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic\nIn early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe triggered concerns regarding its potential effect on players, staff and visitors to the twelve host cities of the tournament [29] At the UEFA Congress in early March, UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin said the organisation was confident that the situation could be dealt with, while general secretary Theodore Theodoridis stated that UEFA was maintaining contact with the World Health Organization and national governments regarding the coronavirus [30] The impact on football grew later that month, as numerous domestic and UEFA competition matches began taking place behind closed doors By 13 March 2020, upcoming UEFA competition fixtures were postponed, while major European leagues were suspended, including the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, Premier League, and Serie A [31]\n\n\nStart of the pandemic and postponement\nIn early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe triggered concerns regarding its potential effect on players, staff and visitors to the twelve host cities of the tournament [29] At the UEFA Congress in early March, UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin said the organisation was confident that the situation could be dealt with, while general secretary Theodore Theodoridis stated that UEFA was maintaining contact with the World Health Organization and national governments regarding the coronavirus [30] The impact on football grew later that month, as numerous domestic and UEFA competition matches began taking place behind closed doors By 13 March 2020, upcoming UEFA competition fixtures were postponed, while major European leagues were suspended, including the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, Premier League, and Serie A [31]\n\n\nSpectator plans and venue changes\nIn May 2020, Čeferin stated that in principle the tournament would take place in the twelve selected host cities However, he did not rule out the possibility of reducing the number of cities, as three hosts were unsure if matches could be held under the new schedule [38] The tournament venues and match schedule was reviewed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 17 June 2020 [39] At the meeting, UEFA confirmed that all twelve original host venues would remain as hosts for the tournament in 2021, and approved the revised match schedule [40] [41] However, Čeferin stated in October 2020 that it was still possible that the tournament could be played in fewer than the planned twelve host countries [42] The following month, UEFA stated that it \"intends to hold Euro 2020 in the format and the venues confirmed earlier this year and we are working closely with all host cities on preparations\" [43] It was also announced that each host was discussing with UEFA and local health authorities on whether the venue could host matches at full capacity, between 100% and 50% capacity, at 33% capacity or behind closed doors Each host city was asked to draw up two or three plans from the four options The restrictions could also involve only local spectators to be permitted at matches A final decision on which scenario would be applied individually at each venue was originally to be made on 5 March 2021 [44] [45] In October 2020, it was announced that UEFA matches would be suspended from taking place in Armenia and Azerbaijan until further notice due to the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war [46] However, this did not affect the planning of Euro 2020 matches to be held in Baku [47] This restriction was lifted in December 2020 following a ceasefire agreement between the countries [48]\n\n\nSemi-final and final venue\nWembley Stadium's hosting of both the semi-finals and the final was threatened over quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom that fans and 2,500 VIPs would be subject to The Puskás Aréna in Budapest was considered as an alternative venue, as Hungary would have no entry restrictions for travel within the Schengen Area and could host the matches at full capacity [70] A spokesman for the Hungarian Football Federation said the organisation was \"ready to host any high-level football event\" [71] However, UEFA remained confident that Wembley could host the final, as the organisation and the UK government discussed quarantine exemptions, [72] but did not rule out a change in venue [73] Minister Kit Malthouse said the government was doing \"as much as we possibly can\" to host the final, [74] while prime minister Boris Johnson stated they would try to make \"sensible accommodations\" for UEFA while still prioritising public health [75] Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the final should be held in Rome due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom [76] The following week, it was reported that officials and executives travelling for the matches would not need to self-isolate, though they would be subject to restrictions and required to remain in \"football bubbles\" [77] [78]\n\n\nRule changes\nOn 31 March 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of a maximum of five substitutions in matches at the tournament (with a sixth allowed in extra time) [7] However, each team are only given three opportunities to make substitutions, with a fourth opportunity allowed in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time [79] The use of five substitutes has been permitted by IFAB during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resulting fixture congestion, which has created a greater burden on players [80]\n\n\nSpecial rules due to COVID-19\nOn 4 May 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved special rules for the final tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: [83] [86]\n\n\nQualification\nThere was no automatic qualifying berth, and all 55 UEFA national teams, including the twelve national teams whose countries were selected to stage matches, had to compete in the qualifiers for the 24 places at the finals tournament [87] [88] As the host cities were appointed by UEFA in September 2014, before the qualifiers, it was possible for the national teams from the host cities to fail to qualify for the finals tournament The qualifying draw was held on 2 December 2018 at the Convention Centre Dublin in Dublin, Ireland [89]\n\n\nQualified teams\nOf the 24 teams that qualified for the tournament, 19 were returning from the 2016 edition Among them were Belgium and Italy, who both had recorded flawless qualifying campaigns (ten wins in ten matches), [94] [95] defending European champions Portugal and world champions France, with Germany also qualifying for a record 13th straight European Championship [96] Finland and North Macedonia made their European Championship debuts, having never previously qualified for a major tournament [97] [98] Scotland, a co-host of the tournament, qualified for their first major international tournament since the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and their first European Championship since 1996 [99] The Netherlands and Denmark returned after missing out in 2016, with the Dutch featuring in a major tournament for the first time since the 2014 FIFA World Cup [100] [101] For the first time, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, and Wales reached successive European Championship tournaments [102] [103] Greece, winners in 2004, were the only former champions that failed to qualify, missing their second straight European Championship and third consecutive major tournament [104] Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and Romania failed to qualify after appearing in the 2016 finals [105]\n\n\nVenues\nThe 13 original venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014 [111] However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of Eurostadium The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to Wembley Stadium in London [9] On 23 April 2021, UEFA announced that due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Aviva Stadium in Dublin was removed as a tournament host Their four matches were reallocated to Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg for the three group stage matches, and Wembley Stadium in London for the round of 16 fixture Similarly, UEFA reassigned the four matches in Spain elsewhere in the country, with Estadio La Cartuja in Seville replacing San Mamés Stadium in Bilbao [10]\n\n\nGroup stage hosts\nThe host cities were divided into six pairings, established on the basis of sporting strength (assuming all host teams qualify), geographical considerations and security/political constraints The pairings were allocated to groups by means of a random draw on 7 December 2017 Each qualified host country played a minimum of two matches at home The following group venue pairings were announced: [9]\n\n\nSpectator limits\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions on public gatherings, many of the venues at the tournament were unable to operate at full capacity UEFA asked each host to devise a spectator plan in conjunction with their local/national government and health authorities The hosts were given a deadline of 7 April 2021 to communicate their plans with UEFA On 9 April, UEFA announced that eight of the tournament hosts had confirmed their stadium capacities, ranging from 25% to 100% The remaining four hosts (Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome) were given an extension until 23 April to submit their venue capacities [58] On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had also confirmed its venue capacity [59] On 23 April, the venue capacity for Munich was also confirmed, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville, which could guarantee spectators In addition, Dublin was removed as a host, as it was unable to ensure spectators could attend [10]\n\n\nTeam base camps\nEach team chose a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases Unlike previous tournaments, each team could set up their base camp anywhere due to the pan-European format, without any obligation of staying in any of the host countries [126]\n\n\nFinal draw\nThe draw for the final tournament was held on 30 November 2019, 18:00 CET (19:00 local time, EET) at Romexpo in Bucharest, Romania [134] [135] [136] [106] The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four The identity of the four play-off teams were not known at the time of the draw and were identified as play-off winners A to D [137] Should there have been groups that could not be finalised at the time of the final tournament draw, another draw would have been held after the play-offs on 1 April 2020, [1] but UEFA confirmed the additional draw was not necessary after the identity of the 20 directly qualified teams and the 16 play-offs teams was known [115]\n\n\nPlay-off path group allocation\nDue to the format of the play-offs, which made anticipating all possible scenarios impossible, the UEFA administration had to wait to solve issues relating to the final tournament draw until the completion of the qualifying group stage [113] It was not possible for UEFA to prevent one of the play-off paths from containing two host teams, resulting in Romania (Group C hosts) and Hungary (Group F hosts) being drawn together in Path A Therefore, the winner of this play-off path needed to be assigned two groups in the final tournament draw To allow for this, Path A was paired with Path D (which does not contain a host), therefore providing a clear scenario for each possible qualified team A draw took place on 22 November 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland (along with the play-offs draw), which decided on the order of priority for the allocation of Path A to the final tournament groups [115]\n\n\nSeeding\nThe following was the composition of the pots, with teams divided and seeded as per their European Qualifiers overall ranking: [141]\n\n\nDraw results and group fixtures\nThe draw resulted in the following groups (teams in italics are play-off winners whose identity was not known at the time of the draw):\n\n\nSquads\nTo lessen the load on players due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in case of an outbreak within a team, squad sizes were increased from 23 (used at every European Championship since 2004) to 26 However, the maximum number of players permitted on the match sheet for each tournament fixture remained 23 [83] Each nation's squad, which had to include three goalkeepers, was submitted at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament (by 1 June 2021) If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player; [1] however, goalkeepers could still be replaced after their team's first match due to physical incapacity [83]\n\n\nMatch officials\nOn 27 September 2018, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) system for the first time at the UEFA European Championship [8] On 12 February 2020, UEFA and CONMEBOL signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance collaboration, including the possibility of a team of South American match officials appointed for the group stage of the tournament [142]\n\n\nOpening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy, on 11 June 2021 at 20:35 (CEST) prior to the first match of the tournament Italian opera tenor Andrea Bocelli performed the song \"Nessun dorma\" [148] Martin Garrix, Bono and the Edge also featured, performing the tournament's official anthem, \"We Are the People\" The performance was a virtual one amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and was filmed at motion-control studios in London and at the Stadio Olimpico to recreate the stadium environment in 3D [149]\n\n\nGroup stage\nUEFA announced the original tournament schedule on 24 May 2018, which only included kick-off times for the opening match and quarter-finals onward [150] [151] The kick-off times of the remaining group stage and round of 16 matches were announced on 30 November 2019 following the final draw [152] On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced the revised match schedule for the tournament in 2021 [153] [154] All match dates, kick-off times and venues remained identical, but shifted one day earlier so matches would remain on the same day of the week (i.e from 12 to 11 June for the opening match to remain on a Friday) On 23 April 2021, UEFA revised the venue assignments of the match schedule after one stadium was removed from the tournament and another was replaced [155]\n\n\nTiebreakers\nIf

complaint with UEFA after the game, demanding a clear penalty The UEFA Control Committee then opened an investigation, Arnautović was banned from the next game by UEFA for \"insulting another player\", and was unable to play in Netherlands vs Austria, the group's second game [273]\n\n\nRemoving marketing drink bottles\nAt a press conference before Hungary vs Portugal on 14 June 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo removed Coca-Cola bottles from the table and then held a water bottle in front of the camera to highlight that water, healthier than Coca-Cola, is his ideal drink; [274] [275] it was thought that Ronaldo's actions were behind the collapse of Coca-Cola market value, but it was later found it had nothing to do with it [276] [277] [278] After France vs Germany, France's Paul Pogba, a practising Muslim, [279] moved bottles of non-alcoholic Heineken beer from the table at a press conference [280] After these two actions, UEFA spoke with each team participating in the European

run-up to the France vs Germany on 15 June 2021 in Munich, a man with a paramotor got stuck on a fixed rope during a flight over the stadium, fell into a descent, grazed the spectator stands, and landed on the pitch In the action planned as a protest by Greenpeace against car manufacturer Volkswagen, in which only a large ball with a label was supposed to be thrown onto the field, two people in the stands suffered head injuries and had to receive medical care [282] The campaign provoked strong criticism due to the endangerment of viewers; UEFA criticised it as a \"reckless and dangerous action\" that could have had serious consequences for many people [283] The German Football Association (DFB), the Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder, and other politicians made similar statements, and Greenpeace apologised A total flight ban was issued over the stadium for the duration of the European Championship The Munich police investigated the paramotor pilot for dangerous bodily harm, trespassing, and violation of the Aviation Act [284] [285] The 40 year old pilot was later convicted of endangering air traffic and negligent bodily harm and fined €7,200 for parachuting into the

\"a good cause.\" UEFA decided not to impose a penalty because of the rule broken by Neuer, which obliges team captains to wear UEFA captains' armbands [287]\n\n\nIllumination of the Allianz Arena in rainbow colours\nBefore the Germany vs Hungary group stage match on 23 June 2021, Munich City Council applied to UEFA to have the façade of the stadium illuminated in rainbow colours as a sign of diversity and tolerance Since the project was understood as a protest against a law passed by the Hungarian Parliament that, according to its critics, restricts the \"information rights\" of young people with regard to homosexuality and gender transitioning, [288] UEFA rejected the application with reference to its status as a politically and religiously neutral organisation [289] After initially approving the illumination of the stadium in rainbow colours, the German Football Association joined the UEFA position The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter criticised these decisions and described the illumination not as a political measure but as what he called a sign of humanity and a symbol for the acceptance of equality between people [290] In contrast, the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Péter Szijjártó welcomed UEFA's decision \"not to be involved in a political provocation against Hungary.\" [291]\n\n\nConfiscation of rainbow flag in Baku\nOn 3 July 2021, UEFA began

emerged while the match was being played, showing two stewards taking a rainbow flag, waved in support of the LGBTQ+ community, being taken [300] In a statement, UEFA said: \"UEFA never instructed stewards in Baku – or in any other stadium – to confiscate rainbow flags We are currently investigating what happened and we will of course contact the UEFA delegate, UEFA security officer and local authorities to clear this up The rainbow flag is a symbol that embodies UEFA core values, promoting everything that we believe in – a more just and egalitarian society, tolerant of everyone and UEFA has ensured that the flag was returned to the supporter.\" [301]\n\n\nEngland vs Denmark incidents\nIn the 104th minute in the England vs Denmark semi-final match, on-field referee Danny Makkelie awarded a penalty kick to England after adjudging Danish defender Joakim Mæhle to have fouled English player Raheem Sterling in the penalty area Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel stopped Harry Kane's penalty kick, but Kane was able to score from the rebound In a press conference shortly after the match, Danish coach Kasper Hjulmand expressed his dissatisfaction with the penalty decision, [302] as well as the fact that there were two balls on the pitch when the foul was given [303] Non-English commentators such as Arsène Wenger, José Mourinho, and Dietmar Hamann criticised the penalty decision during and after the match, arguing that the penalty should not have been awarded when checked by VAR, while Roy Keane described it as \"very, very soft\" [304] [305] Former England forward Alan Shearer also described the penalty decision as \"soft\", and said he would be \"pretty angry if that penalty was given against England\", while former England full-back Gary Neville said: \"If we're being fair, you'd be absolutely devastated if you lost to a penalty like that.\" Match official and current ESPN rules analyst Mark Clattenburg, who refereed the UEFA Euro 2016 Final, said he would not have awarded a penalty kick for a tackle of this sort \"in such a key moment.\" [306] [307]\n\n\nItaly vs England incidents\nOn the day of the UEFA Euro 2020 final between Italy and England,

The show's concept is unique, as contestants meet and fall in love in a completely blind environment, without seeing each other until they get engaged. The series follows 15 men and 15 women as they navigate this unconventional approach to romance.\n\n## Format\n\nThe series follows the same format for each season. The show begins with a pool of eligible contestants, who are initially paired in a speed-dating format. They participate in short, timed dates, known as \"pod sessions,\" where they can talk to each other through a speaker but not see each other. The contestants can then choose to extend their dates, spending more time getting to know each other in the pods.\n\nDuring the pod sessions, the contestants can ask each other questions, share their interests, and learn about each other's values and goals. The goal is to form a deep emotional connection with someone, without being influenced by physical appearance. Once a couple feels a strong connection, they can propose to each other through the speaker, without seeing each other.\n\nThe engaged couples then meet face-to-face for the first time, often with a mix of excitement and nervousness. They spend time getting to know each other, sharing their hopes and fears, and learning about each other's personalities. The couples then participate in a week-long retreat, where they can work on their relationships and build a deeper connection.\n\n## Production\n\nThe production team for Love Is Blind is responsible for creating a safe and supportive environment for the contestants.

Cooper, has said that she looks for contestants who are \"authentic, genuine, and unapologetic about who they are.\" The casting process involves a combination of online applications, social media outreach, and in-person interviews.\n\nThe show's casting team also works to create a pool of contestants with diverse backgrounds and experiences.

The novel is set in 17th-century Japan and follows the story of John Blackthorne, an English pilot who becomes embroiled in the politics of the shogunate. Shōgun is a sweeping epic that explores themes of power, loyalty, and cultural clashes between East and West.\n\n**Premise**\n\nFor nearly 30 years, Japan had been fractured by dynastic clashes and was without a Shogun (central ruler). Japan was also interfered with militarily and politically by Catholic Portugal in concert with the Roman Papacy and its Jesuits stationed in Japan and elsewhere in North East Asia. Their prime interests in Japan were to control trade with Europe and to propagate Roman Catholicism. Portugal had profited well as Japan's exclusive European trading partner for more than 50 years, but it was made uneasy when newly arrived Protestant Dutch threatened that exclusivity.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe clandestine mission of the Dutch ship Erasmus was to compete with Portugal for Japan and the rest of the lucrative far East Asian trade. After much of its crew, including its captain, dies, it ends up marooned in Izu Harbor, the survivors thereby becoming the first Protestants to set foot in Japan. John Blackthorne, the protagonist of the novel, is a skilled pilot and navigator who becomes embroiled in the politics of the shogunate. He is forced to navigate the complexities of Japanese culture and politics, where he must confront the powerful warlords and the samurai class.\n\n**Characters**\n\nShōgun is a work of historical fiction based upon the power struggle between the successors of Toyotomi Hideyoshi that led to the founding of the Tokugawa shogunate. Clavell based each character on a historical figure, but changed their names in order to add narrative deniability to the story. The characters in the novel are well-developed and complex, with each one bringing their own unique perspective to the story. From the enigmatic and powerful Toranaga to the beautiful and alluring Mariko, the characters in Shōgun are expertly crafted to bring the world of 17th-century Japan to life.\n\n**Historical accuracy**\n\nBlackthorne's interactions with Toranaga are closely based upon accounts in the diaries of William Adams, an Englishman who served in Tokugawa's army at Sekigahara. However, while Adams served in Tokugawa's army at Sekigahara, he did not become a retainer or a samurai until after the battle. Clavell took creative liberties with the historical events to create a more compelling narrative, but the core of the story is rooted in historical fact.\n\n**Background**\n\nClavell was an officer in the Royal Artillery during World War II and was a prisoner of war at Changi Prison in Singapore from 1942 to 1945. An experience that formed the basis of his first novel, King Rat. Despite this experience, Clavell admired Japan and the Japanese people, and described Shōgun as \"passionately pro-Japanese.\" Clavell's love of Japan and its culture is evident throughout the novel, as he brings the world of 17th-century Japan to life in vivid detail.\n\n**Reception**\n\nShōgun was a critical and commercial success, becoming a best-seller in many countries. The New York Times's Webster Schott wrote, \"I can't remember when a novel has seized my mind like this one... It's almost impossible not to continue to read Shōgun once having opened it.\" In addition to becoming a best-seller, with more than six million copies of the novel in 14 hardcover and 38 paperback printings by 1980, Shōgun had great impact on westerners' knowledge of, and interest in, Japanese history and culture. Henry Smith, editor of Learning from Shōgun: Japanese History and Western Fantasy, estimated that 20 to 50% of all students in American college-level courses about Japan had read the novel. He described the book as \"a virtual encyclopedia of Japanese history and culture; somewhere among those half-million words, one can find a brief description of virtually everything one wanted to know about Japan\", and stated that \"In sheer quantity, Shōgun has probably conveyed more information about Japan to more people than all the combined writings of scholars, journalists, and novelists since the Pacific War.\"\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nIn 1976 Clavell employed Robert Bolt to write a screenplay. In 1978, he selected Eric Bercovici to write a miniseries for NBC. Clavell and Bercovici decided to simplify the story for an American television audience by omitting one of the two major plot lines of the novel, the struggle between Toranaga and the other warlords, and focusing on the adventures of Blackthorne and his romance with Mariko. Due to the focus on Blackthorne's perspective, most of the Japanese dialogue was not subtitled or dubbed. This nine-hour television miniseries aired in 1980, starring Richard Chamberlain, Toshiro Mifune, Yoko Shimada, and John Rhys-Davies. This was edited into a two-hour theatrical release. A 5-disc DVD release appeared in 2003 and a 3-disc Blu-ray release in 2014.\n\n**Television**\n\nIn 1976 Clavell employed Robert Bolt to write a screenplay.

{"title": "San_Marino", "content": "\nHistory\nAccording to legendary accounts that are first recorded centuries after he is suggested to have lived, [15] [16] Saint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\n\n\n20th century onwards\nDuring World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino [29]\n\n\nGeography\nSan Marino is surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, i.e almost completely by the province of Rimini in the region of Emilia Romagna and, only on a stretch of about three kilometres in the south, by the province of Pesaro and Urbino in the Marche region San Marino lies about ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini Its hilly topography, with no substantial naturally flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level; the lowest, the Ausa River (ending in the Marecchia), [44] is 55 m (180 ft) San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\n\n\nClimate\nSan Marino has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa), with some continental influences It has warm to hot summers and cool winters, typical of inland areas of the central Italian Peninsula Precipitation is scattered throughout the year with no real dry month Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400–500 m (1,300–1,600 feet) of elevation.\n\n\nGovernment\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are heads of state, [48] and there is a pluriform multi-party system Executive power is exercised by the government Although there is no formal head of government, the secretary for foreign and political affairs is in many ways equal to the prime minister in other countries [49] Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nSan Marino is geographically divided into nine castelli (lit. 'castles', equivalent to a municipality), [53] each of which contains a capital (capoluogo), with other population centres sorted into curazie (equivalent to Italian frazioni) Each castello is led by a Castle Captain (Italian: Capitano di Castello) and a Castle Council (Giunta di Castello), elected every five years [54]\n\n\nMilitary\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces Different branches have varied functions, including performing ceremonial duties, patrolling borders, mounting guard at government buildings, and assisting police in major criminal cases The police are not

Marino\n\nIntroduction\nSan Marino is a small, independent republic located in the Apennine Mountains, surrounded by Italy. With a population of approximately 33,000 people, it is one of the smallest countries in the world. San Marino has a unique history, dating back to the 4th century, and is known for its stunning landscapes, rich culture, and strong sense of national identity.\n\nHistory\nAccording to legendary accounts that are first recorded centuries after he is suggested to have lived, Saint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\n\n20th century onwards\nDuring World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce. Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.\n\nGeography\nSan Marino is surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, i.e almost completely by the province of Rimini in the region of Emilia Romagna and, only on a stretch of about three kilometres in the south, by the province of Pesaro and Urbino in the Marche region. San Marino lies about ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no substantial naturally flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level; the lowest, the Ausa River (ending in the Marecchia), is 55 m (180 ft). San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\n\nClimate\nSan Marino has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa), with some continental influences. It has warm to hot summers and cool winters, typical of inland areas of the central Italian Peninsula. Precipitation is scattered throughout the year with no real dry month. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400–500 m (1,300–1,600 feet) of elevation.\n\nGovernment\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are heads of state, and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Although there is no formal head of government, the secretary for foreign and political affairs is in many ways equal to the prime minister in other countries. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nSan Marino is geographically divided into nine castelli (lit. 'castles', equivalent to a municipality), each of which contains a capital (capoluogo), with other population centres sorted into curazie (equivalent to Italian frazioni). Each castello is led by a Castle Captain (Italian: Capitano di Castello) and a Castle Council (Giunta di Castello), elected every five years.\n\nMilitary\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including performing ceremonial duties, patrolling borders, mounting guard at government buildings, and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\nCrossbow Corps\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval.

diocese of Montefeltro The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino The country's high Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the

{"title": "Animal", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe word animal comes from the Latin noun animal of the same meaning, which is itself derived from Latin animalis 'having breath or soul' [6] The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia [7] In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals [8] [9] [10] [11] The term metazoa is derived from Ancient Greek μετα (meta) 'after' (in biology, the prefix meta- stands for 'later') and ζῷᾰ (zōia) 'animals', plural of ζῷον zōion 'animal' [12] [13]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nAnimals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular [14] Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own nutrients, [15] animals are heterotrophic, [16] [17] feeding on organic material and digesting it internally [18] With very few exceptions, animals respire aerobically [a] [20] All animals are motile [21] (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile The blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to animals, allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs [22]\n\n\nStructure\nAll animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins [23] During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules [24] In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth [25] Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes [26]\n\n\nReproduction and development\nNearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction [29] They produce haploid gametes by meiosis; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova [30] These fuse to form zygotes, [31] which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge [32] In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement [33] It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm [34] In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops between them [35] These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs [36]\n\n\nEcology\nAnimals are categorised into ecological groups depending on their trophic levels and how they consume organic material Such groupings include carnivores (further divided into subcategories such as piscivores, insectivores, ovivores, etc.), herbivores (subcategorized into folivores, graminivores, frugivores, granivores, nectarivores, algivores, etc.), omnivores, fungivores, scavengers/detritivores, [42] and parasites [43] Interactions between animals of each biome form complex food webs within that ecosystem In carnivorous or omnivorous species, predation is a consumer–resource interaction where the predator feeds on another organism, its prey, [44] who often evolves anti-predator adaptations to avoid being fed upon Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey, resulting in various antagonistic/competitive coevolutions [45] [46] Almost all multicellular predators are animals [47] Some consumers use multiple methods; for example, in parasitoid wasps, the larvae feed on the hosts' living tissues, killing them in the process, [48] but the adults primarily consume nectar from flowers [49] Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles which mainly eat sponges [50]\n\n\nDiversity\nThe blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal that has ever lived, weighing up to 190 tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long [61] [62] [63] The largest extant terrestrial animal is the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), weighing up to 12.25 tonnes [61] and measuring up to 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) long [61] The largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as Argentinosaurus, which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes, and Supersaurus which may have reached 39 meters [64] [65] Several animals are microscopic; some Myxozoa (obligate parasites within the Cnidaria) never grow larger than 20 μm, [66] and one of the smallest species (Myxobolus shekel) is no more than 8.5 μm when fully grown [67]\n\n\nSize\nThe blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal that has ever lived, weighing up to 190 tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long [61] [62] [63] The largest extant terrestrial animal is the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), weighing up to 12.25 tonnes [61] and measuring up to 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) long [61] The largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as Argentinosaurus, which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes, and Supersaurus which may have reached 39 meters [64] [65] Several animals are microscopic;

much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction, and these can vary wildly For instance, around 25,000–27,000 species of nematodes have been described, while published estimates of the total number of nematode species include 10,000–20,000; 500,000; 10 million; and 100 million [72] Using patterns within the taxonomic hierarchy, the total number of animal species—including those not yet described—was calculated to be about 7.77 million in 2011 [73] [74] [b]\n\n\nEvolutionary origin\nEvidence of animals is found as long ago as the Cryogenian period 24-Isopropylcholestane (24-ipc) has been found in rocks from roughly 650 million years ago; it is only produced by sponges and pelagophyte algae Its likely origin is from sponges based on molecular clock estimates for the origin of 24-ipc production in both groups Analyses of pelagophyte algae consistently recover a Phanerozoic origin, while analyses of sponges recover a Neoproterozoic origin, consistent with the appearance of 24-ipc in the fossil record [90] [91]\n\n\nPhylogeny\nAnimals are monophyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor Animals are the sister group to the choanoflagellates, with which they form the Choanozoa [112] The dates on the phylogenetic tree indicate approximately how many millions of years ago (mya) the lineages split [113] [114] [115] [116] [117]\n\n\nExternal phylogeny\nAnimals are monophyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor Animals are the sister group to the choanoflagellates, with which they form the Choanozoa [112] The dates on the phylogenetic tree indicate approximately how many millions of years ago (mya) the lineages split [113] [114] [115] [116] [117]\n\n\nInternal phylogeny\n\n\n\nNon-bilateria\nSeveral animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry These are the Porifera (sea sponges), Placozoa, Cnidaria (which includes jellyfish, sea anemones, and corals), and Ctenophora (comb jellies).\n\n\nBilateria\nThe remaining animals, the great majority—comprising some 29 phyla and over a million species—form the Bilateria clade, which have a bilaterally symmetric body plan The Bilateria are triploblastic, with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues form distinct organs The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and there is an internal body cavity, a coelom or pseudocoelom These animals have a head end (anterior) and a tail end (posterior), a back (dorsal) surface and a belly (ventral) surface, and a left and a right side [145] [146]\n\n\nProtostomes and deuterostomes\nProtostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways Early in development, deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while many protostomes (the Spiralia) undergo spiral cleavage [152]\nAnimals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract, but in protostomes the first opening of the embryonic gut develops into the mouth, and the anus forms secondarily In deuterostomes, the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily [153] [154] Most protostomes have schizocoelous development, where cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm In deuterostomes, the mesoderm forms by enterocoelic pouching, through invagination of the endoderm [155]\n\n\nEcdysozoa\nThe Ecdysozoa are protostomes, named after their shared trait of ecdysis, growth by moulting [162] They include the largest animal phylum, the Arthropoda, which contains insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin All of these have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum Roundworms are typically microscopic and occur in nearly every environment where there is water; [163] some are important parasites [164] Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom [165]\n\n\nSpiralia\nThe Spiralia are a large group of protostomes that develop by spiral cleavage in the early embryo [166] The Spiralia's phylogeny has been disputed, but it contains a large clade, the superphylum Lophotrochozoa, and smaller groups of phyla such as the Rouphozoa which includes the gastrotrichs and the flatworms All of these are grouped as the Platytrochozoa, which has a sister group, the Gnathifera, which includes the rotifers [167] [168]\n\n\nHistory of classification\nIn the classical era, Aristotle divided animals, [e] based on his own observations, into those with blood (roughly, the vertebrates) and those without The animals were then arranged on a scale from man (with blood, 2 legs, rational soul) down through the live-bearing tetrapods (with blood, 4 legs, sensitive soul) and other groups such as crustaceans (no blood, many legs, sensitive soul) down to spontaneously generating creatures like sponges (no blood, no legs, vegetable soul) Aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and locomotion, or plants, which did not: he knew that sponges could sense touch and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks, but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about [174]\n\n\nIn human culture\nThe human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species [181] [182] Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food A smaller number of species are farmed commercially [181] [183] [184] Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined [185]\n\n\nPractical uses\nThe human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species [181] [182] Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food A smaller number of species are farmed commercially [181] [183] [184] Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined [185]\n\n\nSymbolic uses\nThe signs of the Western and Chinese zodiacs are based on animals [217] [218] In China and Japan, the butterfly has been seen as the personification of a person's soul, [219] and in classical representation the butterfly is also the symbol of the soul [220] [221]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Animal\n\n## Introduction\n\nAnimals are a diverse group of organisms that have been on Earth for millions of years. They are characterized by their ability to move, feed, and reproduce. Animals can be found in almost every environment on Earth, from the freezing tundra to the hottest deserts. They come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, from the tiny microorganisms that live in the soil to the massive blue whale that can grow up to 33 meters long.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe word \"animal\" comes from the Latin noun \"animal,\" which is itself derived from \"animalis,\" meaning \"having breath or soul.\" The biological definition of an animal includes all members of the kingdom Animalia. In colloquial usage, the term \"animal\" is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nAnimals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things. They are eukaryotic and multicellular, meaning that their cells have a nucleus and are composed of more than one cell. Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own nutrients, animals are heterotrophic, meaning that they feed on organic material and digest it internally. With very few exceptions, animals respire aerobically, meaning that they use oxygen to produce energy. All animals are motile, meaning that they can move their bodies spontaneously, although some animals, such as sponges and corals, later become sessile. The blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to animals, allowing cells to be differentiated into specialized tissues and organs.\n\n## Structure\n\nAll animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins. During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized, making the formation of complex structures possible. This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules. In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms, primarily algae, plants, and fungi, are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.\n\n## Reproduction and Development\n\nNearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction. They produce haploid gametes by meiosis; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova. These fuse to form zygotes, which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm. In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.\n\n## Ecology\n\nAnimals are categorized into ecological groups depending on their trophic levels and how they consume organic material. Such groupings include carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, fungivores, scavengers/detritivores, and parasites. Interactions between animals of each biome form complex food webs within that ecosystem. In carnivorous or omnivorous species, predation is a consumer-resource interaction where the predator feeds on another organism, its prey, who often evolves anti-predator adaptations to avoid being fed upon. Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey, resulting in various antagonistic/competitive coevolutions.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe blue whale is the largest animal that has ever lived, weighing up to 190 tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 meters long. The largest extant terrestrial animal is the African bush elephant, weighing up to 12.25 tonnes and measuring up to 10.67 meters long. Several animals are microscopic; some Myxozoa never grow larger than 20 μm, and one of the smallest species, Myxobolus shekel, is no more than 8.5 μm when fully grown.\n\n## Size\n\nThe blue whale is the largest animal that has ever lived, weighing up to 190 tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 meters long.

Species estimates shown here are based on numbers described scientifically; much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction, and these can vary wildly.\n\n## Evolutionary origin\n\nEvidence of animals is found as long ago as the Cryogenian period. 24-Isopropylcholestane (24-ipc) has been found in rocks from roughly 650 million years ago. It is only produced by sponges and pelagophyte algae. Its likely origin is from sponges based on molecular clock estimates for the origin of 24-ipc production in both groups.\n\n## Phylogeny\n\nAnimals are monophyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor. Animals are the sister group to the choanoflagellates, with which they form the Choanozoa.\n\n## External phylogeny\n\nAnimals are monophyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor. Animals are the sister group to the choanoflagellates, with which they form the Choanozoa.\n\n## Internal phylogeny\n\n## Non-bilateria\n\nSeveral animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry. These are the Porifera, Placozoa, Cnidaria, and Ctenophora.\n\n## Bilateria\n\nThe remaining animals, the great majority, form the Bilateria clade. They have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria are triploblastic, with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues form distinct organs.\n\n## Protostomes and deuterostomes\n\nProtostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways. Early in development, deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while many protostomes undergo spiral cleavage. Animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract, but in protostomes the first opening of the embryonic gut develops into the mouth, and the anus forms secondarily. In deuterostomes, the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily.\n\n## Ecdysozoa\n\nThe Ecdysozoa are protostomes, named after their shared trait of ecdysis, growth by moulting. They include the largest animal phylum, the Arthropoda, which contains insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin.\n\n## Spiralia\n\nThe Spiralia are a large group of protostomes that develop by spiral cleavage in the early embryo.\n\n## History of classification\n\nIn the classical era, Aristotle divided animals, based on his own observations, into those with blood and those without. The animals were then arranged on a scale from man down through the live-bearing tetrapods and other groups. Aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and locomotion, or plants, which did not.\n\n## In human culture\n\nThe human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species. Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food. A smaller number of species are farmed commercially.\n\n## Practical uses\n\nThe human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species. Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food. A smaller number of species are farmed commercially.\n\n## Symbolic uses\n\nThe signs of the Western and Chinese zodiacs are based on animals. In China and Japan, the butterfly has been seen as the personification of a person's soul, and in classical representation the butterfly is also the symbol of the soul.\n\n## See also\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n## External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Animal\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word animal comes from the Latin noun animal of the same meaning, which is itself derived from Latin animalis 'having breath or soul' [6] The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia [7] In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals [8] [9] [10] [11] The term metazoa is derived from Ancient Greek μετα (meta) 'after' (in biology, the prefix meta- stands for 'later') and ζῷᾰ (zōia) 'animals', plural of ζῷον zōion 'animal' [12] [13]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nAnimals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular [14] Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own nutrients, [15] animals are heterotrophic, [16] [17] feeding on organic material and digesting it internally [18] With very few exceptions, animals respire aerobically [a] [20] All animals are motile [21] (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile The blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to animals, allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs [22]\n\n\nStructure\nAll animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins [23] During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules [24] In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth [25] Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes [26]\n\n\nReproduction and development\nNearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction [29] They produce haploid gametes by meiosis;

[163] some are important parasites [164] Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom [165]\n\n\nSpiralia\nThe Spiralia are a large group of protostomes that develop by spiral cleavage in the early embryo [166] The Spiralia's phylogeny has been disputed, but it contains a large clade, the superphylum Lophotrochozoa, and smaller groups of phyla such as the Rouphozoa which includes the gastrotrichs and the flatworms All of these are grouped as the Platytrochozoa, which has a sister group, the Gnathifera, which includes the rotifers [167] [168]\n\n\nHistory of classification\nIn the classical era, Aristotle divided animals, [e] based on his own observations, into those with blood (roughly, the vertebrates) and those without The animals were then arranged on a scale from man (with blood, 2 legs, rational soul) down through the live-bearing tetrapods (with blood, 4 legs, sensitive soul) and other groups such as crustaceans (no blood, many legs, sensitive soul) down to spontaneously generating creatures like sponges (no blood, no legs, vegetable soul) Aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and locomotion, or plants, which did not: he knew that sponges could sense touch and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks, but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about [174]\n\n\nIn human culture\nThe human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species [181] [182] Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food A smaller number of species are farmed commercially [181] [183] [184] Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined [185]\n\n\nPractical uses\nThe human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species [181] [182] Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food A smaller number of species are farmed commercially [181] [183] [184] Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined [185]\n\n\nSymbolic uses\nThe signs of the Western and Chinese zodiacs are based on animals [217] [218] In China and Japan, the butterfly has been seen as the personification of a person's soul, [219] and in classical representation the butterfly is also the symbol of the soul [220] [221]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
