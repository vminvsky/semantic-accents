The season began on 14 August 2021 and concluded on 22 May 2022.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season saw a number of significant events, including the Newcastle United takeover, COVID-19 outbreaks forcing postponements, and Abramovich sanctions. The season was also marked by a closely contested title race, with Manchester City ultimately emerging as champions. In this article, we will provide an overview of the season, including the title race, managerial changes, and other notable events.\n\n**The race for first place**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League title race was one of the most closely contested in recent history. Manchester City, who had won the title in the previous two seasons, were considered favorites to retain their crown. However, they faced stiff competition from Liverpool, who had finished second in the previous season, and Chelsea, who had undergone a significant transformation under new manager Thomas Tuchel.\n\nThe title race was marked by a number of dramatic twists and turns, including a 4-1 defeat for Manchester City at the hands of Liverpool in January 2022, which left the title race wide open. However, Manchester City ultimately recovered from this setback to win the title with a 3-2 victory over Aston Villa on the final day of the season.\n\n**Newcastle takeover**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was also marked by a significant development in the world of English football: the takeover of Newcastle United by a Saudi-led consortium. The takeover, which was finalized in October 2021, marked the end of a period of turmoil at the club, during which time Newcastle had struggled to attract investment and talent.\n\nThe takeover was widely seen as a major coup for the club, and it marked a new era of investment and ambition at Newcastle United. The club's new owners, who were led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, pledged to invest heavily in the club and to bring in top talent in the transfer market.\n\n**COVID-19 outbreaks force postponements**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was also marked by a number of COVID-19 outbreaks, which forced a number of postponements throughout the season. The outbreaks, which were caused by the Omicron variant of the virus, led to a number of high-profile cancellations, including a match between Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nThe postponements caused significant disruption to the schedule, and they left a number of teams struggling to cope with the demands of the season. However, the Premier League was praised for its handling of the crisis, with the league introducing a number of measures to help teams cope with the pandemic.\n\n**Abramovich sanctions**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was also marked by a significant development in the world of English football: the imposition of sanctions on Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea. The sanctions, which were imposed by the UK government in response to the invasion of Ukraine, prohibited Abramovich from owning a stake in the club or from benefiting from its revenue.\n\nThe sanctions marked a significant blow to Chelsea, who had relied heavily on Abramovich's investment in recent years. However, the club was able to continue operating under a special license, and they were able to secure a new investment deal with the US-based investment firm Clearlake Capital.\n\n**Final day climax**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season came to a dramatic conclusion on the final day of the season, with a number of teams competing for the title, European qualification, and relegation. Manchester City, who had won the title in the previous two seasons, were considered favorites to retain their crown, but they faced stiff competition from Liverpool and Chelsea.\n\nIn the end, Manchester City emerged as champions, winning the title with a 3-2 victory over Aston Villa. The victory marked a fourth Premier League title for the club, and it secured a place in the Champions League for next season.\n\n**Title**\n\n* Champions: Manchester City (4th Premier League title)\n* Runners-up: Liverpool (2nd Premier League title)\n* Third place: Chelsea (1st Premier League title under Thomas Tuchel)\n\n**Relegation**\n\n* Relegated: Norwich City, Watford, and Burnley\n\n**Champions League, Europa League and Conference League spots**\n\n* Champions League: Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur\n* Europa League: Arsenal, Manchester United, Leicester City, West Ham United\n* Conference League: Brighton & Hove Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Everton, Aston Villa\n\n**Other teams**\n\n* Top four finishers: Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur\n* European qualification: Arsenal, Manchester United, Leicester City, West Ham United\n* Relegation: Norwich City, Watford, Burnley\n* FA Cup winners: Liverpool\n* League Cup winners: Liverpool\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe 20 teams that competed in the 2021–22 Premier League season were:\n\n1.

The election was the first to be held under a new electoral law that introduced a mixed-majority system, with half of the seats allocated by single-member constituencies and the other half allocated by proportional representation.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 legislative election was held in the context of a pandemic and a period of social and economic uncertainty in France. President Emmanuel Macron's government had introduced a series of austerity measures and reforms that were seen as unpopular by many voters. The election was also seen as a test of Macron's ability to win a second term as president, as well as a referendum on his government's policies.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe electoral system used in the 2022 legislative election was a mixed-majority system, which combined elements of both single-member constituencies and proportional representation. Under this system, 289 deputies were elected in single-member constituencies, while the remaining 288 deputies were allocated by proportional representation.\n\nThe proportional representation system used a national list of candidates, with voters able to choose between different lists. The lists were led by parties or coalitions, and voters could also choose to vote for individual candidates. The seats were allocated to the lists using the Sainte-Laguë method, which is a proportional representation system that allocates seats to parties according to the number of votes they receive.\n\n**Dates**\n\nThe election was held in two rounds, on 12 and 19 June 2022. The first round was held on 12 June, with voters able to choose between different candidates and lists. The second round was held on 19 June, with voters able to choose between the top two candidates in each constituency.\n\n**Major parties and alliances**\n\nSeveral major parties and alliances contested the 2022 legislative election. The main parties included:\n\n* **La République En Marche! (LREM)**: The party of President Emmanuel Macron, which had won a majority of seats in the 2017 legislative election.\n* **La France Insoumise (LFI)**: A left-wing party that had emerged as a major force in French politics in recent years.\n* **La République Souveraine (LR)**: A right-wing party that had emerged from the merger of several smaller parties.\n* **Rassemblement National (RN)**: A far-right party that had been led by Marine Le Pen since 2011.\n\n**Deputies not standing for reelection**\n\nSeveral deputies who had been elected in the 2017 legislative election chose not to stand for reelection in 2022. These included:\n\n* **Laurent Wauquiez**: A former leader of the opposition, who had been elected in the constituency of Haute-Loire.\n* **Nicolas Dupont-Aignan**: A right-wing deputy who had been elected in the constituency of Essonne.\n* **Jean-Marie Le Guen**: A left-wing deputy who had been elected in the constituency of Nord.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls suggested that the 2022 legislative election would be a close contest between the parties. The polls suggested that LREM would win a majority of seats, but that the party would face a strong challenge from LFI and RN.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the 2022 legislative election were as follows:\n\n### First round\n\nThe first round of the election was held on 12 June 2022. The results were as follows:\n\n* **La République En Marche! (LREM)**: 24.2% of the vote, 126 seats\n* **La France Insoumise (LFI)**: 18.7% of the vote, 93 seats\n* **La République Souveraine (LR)**: 15.8% of the vote, 74 seats\n* **Rassemblement National (RN)**: 9.1% of the vote, 47 seats\n\n### Second round\n\nThe second round of the election was held on 19 June 2022. The results were as follows:\n\n* **La République En Marche! (LREM)**: 29.9% of the vote, 155 seats\n* **La France Insoumise (LFI)**: 20.2% of the vote, 112 seats\n* **La République Souveraine (LR)**: 16.5% of the vote, 84 seats\n* **Rassemblement National (RN)**: 10.6% of the vote, 61 seats\n\n### National results\n\nThe national results of the election were as follows:\n\n* **Turnout**: 53.7%\n* **Valid votes**: 97.2%\n* **Invalid votes**: 2.8%\n\n### Results by constituency\n\nThe results of the election varied by constituency. Some of the key contests included:\n\n* **Haute-Loire**: The constituency of Laurent Wauquiez, who had chosen not to stand for reelection. The winner was a candidate from LREM.\n* **Essonne**: The constituency of Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who had chosen not to stand for reelection. The winner was a candidate from LFI.\n* **Nord**: The constituency of Jean-Marie Le Guen, who had chosen not to stand for reelection.

The electorate was estimated to be around 48 million people.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the 2022 legislative election was marked by a period of uncertainty and negotiations between the parties. The election had resulted in a hung parliament, with no party able to win a majority of seats.\n\n### Formation of parliamentary groups\n\nThe formation of parliamentary groups was a key issue in the aftermath of the election. The parties were able to form groups in the National Assembly, but the groups were not able to agree on a government.\n\n* **La République En Marche!

The parties were able to vote on a motion of no confidence in the government, but the motion was not successful.\n\n* **La République En Marche! (LREM)**: The party of President Emmanuel Macron, which opposed the motion of no confidence.\n* **La France Insoumise (LFI)**: The left-wing party, which supported the motion of no confidence.\n* **La République Souveraine (LR)**: The right-wing party, which opposed the motion of no confidence.\n* **Rassemblement National (RN)**: The far-right party, which opposed the motion of no confidence.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **French general election, 2022**\n* **French presidential election, 2022**\n* **French legislative election, 2017**\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a summary of the 2022 French legislative election.

The film is the sequel to the 2018 film Halloween and the 13th installment in the Halloween franchise.\n\n## Plot\nThe film takes place four years after the events of the previous installment. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has been living in hiding, but when a series of murders takes place in Haddonfield, Illinois, she is forced to confront Michael Myers once again. As the bodies pile up, Laurie must use her experience and skills to take down Michael and put an end to the killing spree.\n\n## Cast\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode\n* Andi Matichak as Allyson Nelson\n* Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace\n* Judy Greer as Karen Nelson\n* Will Patton as Frank Hawkins\n* Rohan Campbell as Corey Cunningham\n* Dylan Arnold as Chris Halloway\n* Kyle Gallner as Aaron\n* Thom Gossom Jr. as Deputies\n* Michaela McManus as Erin\n* Tony Moran as Michael Myers\n\n## Production\n### Development\nThe idea for Halloween Ends was first conceived in 2019, shortly after the release of the previous film. David Gordon Green, who directed the previous two films, began working on the script with his long-time collaborator Danny McBride. The two writers aimed to create a story that would be a fitting conclusion to the franchise.\n\n### Writing\nGreen and McBride spent several months working on the script, drawing inspiration from the previous films and the original 1978 film. They wanted to create a story that would be both a tribute to the franchise's past and a commentary on the current state of the world. The script went through several drafts before the filmmakers were satisfied with the final product.\n\n### Casting\nCasting for Halloween Ends began in early 2020, with Jamie Lee Curtis returning to reprise her role as Laurie Strode. Andi Matichak, who had played Allyson Nelson in the previous film, also returned for the sequel. The film's cast also includes a number of newcomers, including Rohan Campbell and Dylan Arnold.\n\n### Filming\nPrincipal photography for Halloween Ends began in March 2021 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in Illinois, with the production team using a combination of practical and CGI effects to bring the film's horror elements to life. The film's score was composed by John Carpenter, who had previously scored the original 1978 film.\n\n### Post-production\nPost-production on Halloween Ends began in the summer of 2021, with the film's editors working to assemble the final cut of the film. The film's visual effects were handled by a team of experts, who used a combination of practical and CGI effects to create the film's horror elements.\n\n### Music\nThe film's score was composed by John Carpenter, who had previously scored the original 1978 film. The score features a number of haunting and atmospheric tracks, which help to create a sense of tension and unease throughout the film.\n\n## Release\n### Home Media\nHalloween Ends was released on digital platforms on October 19, 2022, and on Blu-ray and DVD on November 1, 2022.\n\n## Reception\n### Audience Viewership\nHalloween Ends received a mixed reaction from audiences, with some critics praising the film's suspenseful and atmospheric elements, while others criticized the film's pacing and plot.\n\n### Box Office\nHalloween Ends performed moderately well at the box office, grossing over $130 million worldwide.\n\n### Critical Response\nHalloween Ends received generally mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the film's suspenseful and atmospheric elements, while others criticized the film's pacing and plot. The film holds a 42% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 233 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10.\n\n### Accolades\nHalloween Ends was nominated for several awards, including a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and a Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Score.\n\n## Future\nThe future of the Halloween franchise is uncertain, although Jamie Lee Curtis has stated that she would be open to reprising her role as Laurie Strode in future films.\n\n## See also\n* Halloween (1978 film)\n* Halloween II (1981 film)\n* Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998 film)\n* Halloween: Resurrection (2002 film)\n* Halloween (2018 film)\n* Halloween Kills (2020 film)\n\n## Notes\nHalloween Ends is the final film in the Halloween franchise, although there have been rumors of a potential reboot or sequel.\n\n## References\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n## External links\n* Official website\n* Halloween Ends at IMDb", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Halloween_Ends\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n##Music\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Audience viewership\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Known for his unique blend of magical realism, historical fiction, and philosophical inquiry, Rushdie has written numerous bestselling novels, plays, and essays that have been translated into more than 40 languages.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nSalman Rushdie was born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay, India, to Anis Ahmed Rushdie, a merchant, and Negin Bhatt Rushdie, a schoolteacher. His family was of Indian Muslim descent, and he was raised in a middle-class household with a strong emphasis on literature and culture. Rushdie was educated at the Cathedral and John Connon School in Bombay and later at King's College, Cambridge, where he studied history and literature. He graduated with a degree in history in 1968 and later earned a master's degree in history from the University of East Anglia.\n\n**Career**\n\n### Copywriter\n\nBefore becoming a full-time writer, Rushdie worked as a copywriter for the London advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather from 1971 to 1976. During this period, he wrote copy for various clients, including the British government and several multinational corporations.\n\n### Literary works\n\n#### Early works and literary breakthrough, 1975–1987\n\nRushdie's debut novel, _Grimus_, was published in 1975 to moderate success. His second novel, _Midnight's Children_ (1981), was a critical and commercial breakthrough, earning him the Booker Prize in 1981. This novel, set in India during the partition of India and Pakistan, established Rushdie as a major literary talent. His next novel, _Shame_ (1983), was also well-received, and his nonfiction work, _The Jaguar Smile_ (1987), was a collection of essays on Nicaragua.\n\n#### The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990\n\nRushdie's novel _The Satanic Verses_ (1988) was his most ambitious work to date, exploring themes of identity, culture, and faith in a postmodern world. The book was published in 1988 and sparked controversy and outrage in the Muslim world, leading to the issuance of a fatwa against Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini. Rushdie's next novel, _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_ (1990), was a children's book and a exploration of the power of storytelling.\n\n#### Further works, 1990s–2000s\n\nRushdie continued to write novels, essays, and nonfiction works throughout the 1990s and 2000s. His novels, _The Moor's Last Sigh_ (1995) and _The Ground Beneath Her Feet_ (1999), were both well-received, as was his collection of essays, _Step Across This Line_ (2002). His novel _Shalimar the Clown_ (2005) was a critical and commercial success, and his nonfiction work, _Joseph Anton: A Memoir_ (2012), was a personal account of his life under the fatwa.\n\n#### Later works, novels, and essays, 2015–2024\n\nRushdie's novel _Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights_ (2015) was a retelling of the ancient fable of the 99 names of God. His next novel, _Luka and the Fire of Life_ (2017), was a sequel to _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_. His essay collection, _The State of India_ (2020), was a reflection on the state of India and its politics. Rushdie's most recent novel, _Victory City_ (2023), was a historical novel set in 15th-century India.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\nRushdie's work has been widely praised for its innovative style, philosophical inquiry, and exploration of themes such as identity, culture, and faith. His novels have been translated into more than 40 languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide. Rushdie has been awarded numerous literary prizes, including the Booker Prize, the Whitbread Book Award, and the Order of the British Empire.\n\n**Academic and other activities**\n\nRushdie has taught literature at several universities, including the University of East Anglia and New York University. He has also served as a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Rushdie has been a frequent contributor to various newspapers and journals, including _The New Yorker_ and _The Guardian_. He has also written screenplays for several films, including the Bollywood blockbuster _The Satanic Verses_ (1988).\n\n**Film and television**\n\nRushdie's work has been adapted into several films and television shows, including the Indian film _The Satanic Verses_ (1988), which was based on his novel of the same name. His novel _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_ was adapted into an animated film in 2004. Rushdie has also written screenplays for several television shows, including the BBC series _The Hour_ (2011).\n\n**The Satanic Verses and the fatwā**\n\n### Failed assassination attempt (1989)\n\nOn February 14, 1989, Rushdie was the target of a failed assassination attempt in London. The Iranian government had issued a fatwa against Rushdie in January 1989, calling for his execution for blasphemy. The fatwa was issued in response to Rushdie's novel _The Satanic Verses_, which was seen as an insult to the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n### Hezbollah's comments (2006)\n\nIn 2006, the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, reiterated the fatwa against Rushdie, calling for his execution. The Iranian government also reiterated its support for the fatwa, stating that it was a matter of national honor.\n\n### International Guerillas (1990)\n\nIn 1990, a group of international guerrillas, including members of the Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, were implicated in a plot to assassinate Rushdie. The plot was foiled by British intelligence, and several of the conspirators were arrested and charged with treason.\n\n### Al-Qaeda hit list (2010)\n\nIn 2010, it was revealed that Rushdie had been listed as a target by the Al-Qaeda terrorist organization. The list, which was discovered by British intelligence, included Rushdie's name alongside other prominent targets, including the British Prime Minister and several other prominent writers and politicians.\n\n### Jaipur Literature Festival (2012)\n\nIn 2012, Rushdie was scheduled to be the guest of honor at the Jaipur Literature Festival in India. However, the festival was cancelled at the last minute due to threats from the Iranian government and the Indian Muslim community.\n\n### Chautauqua attack (2022)\n\nOn August 12, 2022, Rushdie was attacked on stage at the Chautauqua Institution in New York, where he was scheduled to give a lecture. The attacker, Hadi Matar, was a 24-year-old man from New Jersey who was arrested at the scene. Rushdie suffered serious injuries, including damage to his eye and throat, and was hospitalized for several days.\n\n**Awards, honours, and recognition**\n\n### Knighthood\n\nIn 2007, Rushdie was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to literature. The knighthood was awarded in recognition of Rushdie's contributions to literature and his commitment to promoting freedom of speech and expression.\n\n**Religious and political beliefs**\n\n### Religious background\n\nRushdie was born into a Muslim family, but he has stated that he does not identify as a Muslim. He has also stated that he is an atheist and that he does not believe in any particular religion.\n\n### Political background\n\nRushdie has been a vocal critic of Islamic extremism and has spoken out against the use of violence and intimidation to silence critics of Islam. He has also been critical of the Iranian government and its policies towards writers and journalists.\n\n### UK politics\n\nRushdie has been a vocal critic of the UK's immigration policies and has spoken out against the idea of a multicultural society.

He has also been critical of the US media and has argued that it has been too soft in its coverage of Islamic extremism.\n\n### Against religious extremism\n\nRushdie has been a vocal critic of religious extremism and has spoken out against the use of violence and intimidation to silence critics of religion. He has also argued that the use of blasphemy laws is a threat to freedom of speech and expression.\n\n### South Asian politics and Kashmir\n\nRushdie has been a vocal critic of the Indian government's handling of the Kashmir conflict and has argued that the government's policies have exacerbated the conflict. He has also spoken out in favor of the rights of Kashmiris and has argued that they should be able to self-determine their own future.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nRushdie has been married four times and has one son, Zafar.

Her father was a writer and a close friend of author P.G. Wodehouse. The family's summer home was in Tuscany, Italy, where Clarissa spent her childhood summers.\n\nIn 1937, the family moved to Paris, where Clarissa attended the École des Roches, a boarding school in Normandy. Her time in Paris had a lasting impact on her life, shaping her love of art, fashion, and culture. During this period, she developed a close friendship with the French aristocrat, Marie Hélène de Rothschild.\n\n### Second World War: Oxford and the Foreign Office\n\nIn 1940, Clarissa's family returned to England, where she began attending Somerville College, Oxford. Her time at Oxford was marked by her involvement in the university's Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) and her work as a codebreaker at the Foreign Office.\n\n### Post-war\n\nAfter the war, Clarissa worked as a private secretary to her father and later to her husband, Anthony Eden. During this period, she became increasingly involved in high society, attending parties and events alongside some of the most influential people in England.\n\n**2007 memoir**\n\nIn 2007, Clarissa Eden published her memoir, \"Up Hill All the Way: A Personal Story\", which provides a candid account of her life, including her marriage to Anthony Eden and her experiences as the wife of a Prime Minister.\n\n**Friends and acquaintances**\n\n### Early admirers\n\nClarissa was admired by many for her intelligence, wit, and style. One of her earliest admirers was the writer, Nancy Mitford, who often sought her advice on matters of fashion and art.\n\n### Other friends\n\nThroughout her life, Clarissa maintained close friendships with many notable figures, including the artist, Lucian Freud, and the socialite, Lady Diana Mosley.\n\n**Relationship with Anthony Eden**\n\n### Winston Churchill and the wartime link\n\nClarissa met Anthony Eden in 1942, when he was working at the Foreign Office. Their relationship was encouraged by Winston Churchill, who saw potential in the union. The couple married on February 14, 1952, at Westminster Abbey.\n\n### Marriage to Eden\n\n#### Attitudes to the marriage\n\nClarissa's marriage to Anthony Eden was not without controversy. Some critics saw her as a socialite, more interested in parties and fashion than politics. However, Clarissa was a devoted wife and supporter of her husband, often accompanying him to official events and providing counsel on matters of state.\n\n#### Married life\n\nDuring their marriage, Clarissa and Anthony Eden maintained a busy social calendar, attending events and parties alongside the British aristocracy. Despite the demands of her husband's position, Clarissa was a devoted mother to their two children, Simon and Vivian.\n\n**Eden's premiership**\n\n### Chatelaine at Downing Street and Chequers\n\nWhen Anthony Eden became Prime Minister in 1955, Clarissa took on the role of chatelaine at Downing Street and Chequers, the official country residence of the Prime Minister. She was responsible for managing the household staff and ensuring that the homes were maintained to the highest standards.\n\n### Suez Crisis\n\n#### \"The Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\"\n\nDuring the Suez Crisis in 1956, Clarissa was deeply affected by the mounting tensions between her husband's government and Egypt. As the crisis escalated, she found herself caught in the midst of international diplomacy, often hosting foreign dignitaries and officials at Chequers.\n\n### Political influence\n\nThroughout her husband's premiership, Clarissa played a significant role in advising him on matters of state. Her intelligence, wit, and charm made her a valuable asset to the government, and she often acted as a liaison between her husband and key figures in the diplomatic corps.\n\n### Protective influence\n\nClarissa was also a protective influence on her husband, often tempering his more impulsive decisions with her measured counsel. This was particularly evident during the Suez Crisis, when she urged caution and restraint in the face of mounting international pressure.\n\n### Aftermath of Suez\n\n#### Goldeneye\n\nIn the aftermath of the Suez Crisis, Anthony Eden's government faced widespread criticism and opposition. The couple retreated to their country home, Goldeneye, in the Bahamas, where they attempted to recover from the ordeal.\n\n#### Eden's resignation\n\nIn January 1957, Anthony Eden announced his resignation as Prime Minister, citing ill health. Clarissa was devastated by the news, feeling that her husband's career had been ruined by the Suez Crisis.\n\n**Eden's retirement and death**\n\nAfter his resignation, Anthony Eden retired from politics, and the couple returned to England. He died on January 14, 1977, at the age of 89. Clarissa was deeply affected by his passing, but she continued to be involved in public life, using her experiences to inform her writing and advocacy work.\n\n**Widowhood**\n\n### Longevity\n\nClarissa Eden lived a long and fulfilling life, passing away on November 15, 2021, at the age of 101. Throughout her life, she maintained a deep commitment to her family, her friends, and her community, leaving a lasting legacy as a devoted wife, mother, and public figure.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nClarissa Eden has been the subject of several books, articles, and documentaries, including a BBC Radio 4 drama series based on her life. Her story has captivated the public imagination, offering a unique glimpse into the inner workings of the British aristocracy and the life of a Prime Minister's wife.\n\n**Arms**\n\n---\n\n**References**\n\n**Notes**\n\n**Citations**\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale and a depth of 10 kilometers. It was one of the most significant earthquakes to hit the Philippines in recent years, causing widespread damage and casualties.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe 2022 Luzon earthquake was a significant event that was felt throughout the northern part of Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines. The earthquake's epicenter was located in the province of Abra, near the town of Tayum. The earthquake's focal mechanism indicated that it was a left-lateral strike-slip fault, which means that the earthquake occurred as a result of movement along a fault line where the rocks on one side of the fault had moved horizontally to the left relative to the rocks on the other side.\n\nThe earthquake's magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale is considered a major earthquake, with the potential to cause significant damage and loss of life. The earthquake's depth of 10 kilometers is relatively shallow, which means that the earthquake's effects were felt more intensely on the surface.\n\n**Aftershocks**\n\nFollowing the main earthquake, a series of aftershocks occurred in the affected area. Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that occur as a result of the adjustment of rocks in the fault zone after the main earthquake. In the case of the 2022 Luzon earthquake, the aftershocks were smaller in magnitude, ranging from 3.0 to 5.0 on the Richter scale. However, they were still felt by people in the affected area and caused additional damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n**Intensity**\n\nThe intensity of the 2022 Luzon earthquake was felt throughout the northern part of Luzon, with the greatest intensity occurring in the provinces of Abra, Ilocos Sur, and Mountain Province. The earthquake's intensity was measured on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI), which ranges from I (not felt) to XII (extreme damage). The earthquake's intensity was measured to be VII (very strong shaking) in the provinces of Abra and Ilocos Sur, and VIII (severe shaking) in the province of Mountain Province.\n\n**Tsunami**\n\nA tsunami warning was issued by the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) following the earthquake, as there was a risk of a tsunami affecting the coastal areas of the affected provinces. However, the tsunami warning was later cancelled after assessment by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) showed that the earthquake did not trigger a tsunami.\n\n**Liquefaction**\n\nLiquefaction is a phenomenon that occurs when an earthquake causes water-saturated soil to lose its strength and behave like a liquid. The 2022 Luzon earthquake caused liquefaction in several areas, particularly in the province of Abra. Liquefaction can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, as well as pose a risk to people in the affected area.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe response to the 2022 Luzon earthquake was immediate and widespread. The Philippine government activated the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) to coordinate the response efforts. The NDRRMC worked closely with local government units, emergency responders, and other stakeholders to provide assistance to the affected communities.\n\n**International aid**\n\nThe international community provided significant aid to the Philippines following the earthquake. The United States, Japan, China, and other countries provided financial assistance, emergency supplies, and technical expertise to support the relief efforts.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe impact of the 2022 Luzon earthquake was significant, with widespread damage and casualties reported in the affected provinces. The earthquake damaged over 40,000 houses, leaving thousands of people homeless. The earthquake also damaged critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and communication systems.\n\n**Abra**\n\nThe province of Abra was severely affected by the earthquake, with reports of widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. The town of Tayum was particularly hard hit, with many buildings collapsed or severely damaged. The earthquake also caused significant damage to agricultural lands and crops, affecting the livelihoods of many farmers.\n\n**Baguio**\n\nThe city of Baguio was also affected by the earthquake, with reports of damage to buildings and infrastructure. The earthquake caused significant damage to the city's roads and bridges, making it difficult for people to access the city.\n\n**Ilocos Sur**\n\nThe province of Ilocos Sur was also affected by the earthquake, with reports of damage to buildings and infrastructure. The town of Vigan was particularly hard hit, with many buildings collapsed or severely damaged.\n\n**Metro Manila**\n\nThe earthquake was felt in Metro Manila, with reports of damage to buildings and infrastructure. The earthquake caused significant damage to the city's roads and bridges, making it difficult for people to access the city.\n\n**Elsewhere**\n\nThe earthquake was felt in other parts of the country, including the provinces of Mountain Province, Ifugao, and Benguet. The earthquake caused damage to buildings and infrastructure, as well as affected the livelihoods of many farmers and traders.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* A damaged building in Abra\n* A family affected by the earthquake in Ilocos Sur\n* A road damaged by the earthquake in Mountain Province\n* A bridge damaged by the earthquake in Benguet\n* A farmer affected by the earthquake in Ifugao\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2013 Bohol earthquake\n* 2019 Mindanao earthquake\n* List of earthquakes in the Philippines\n\n**References**\n\n* Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS)\n* National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC)\n* United States Geological Survey (USGS)\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)\n\n**External links**\n\n* ReliefWeb\n* International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)\n* United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Luzon_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Earthquake\n##Characteristics\n##Aftershocks\n##Intensity\n##Tsunami\n##Liquefaction\n#Response\n##International aid\n#Impact\n##Abra\n##Baguio\n##Ilocos Sur\n##Metro Manila\n##Elsewhere\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conflict resulted in significant human casualties, displacement of people, and damage to infrastructure.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has its roots in the early 20th century, when the region was part of the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution, the region became part of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, but the majority of the population was Armenian. Following the Sovietization of the region, Nagorno-Karabakh was granted autonomous status within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. However, this autonomy was revoked in 1988, leading to a series of violent clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis that resulted in the deaths of thousands of people.\n\nIn 1991, Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence from Azerbaijan, but the conflict continued, with Armenia providing military support to the breakaway region. A ceasefire was brokered by Russia in 1994, but the region remains under a fragile peace agreement.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2023 offensive, tensions between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh had been escalating. Azerbaijan had been conducting military exercises near the border with Nagorno-Karabakh, and there were reports of increased military activity by both sides. The international community had been warning of a potential conflict, with the United States, Russia, and other countries calling for restraint.\n\n**Offensive**\n\nThe Azerbaijani offensive began on September 19, 2023, when Azerbaijani forces launched a series of airstrikes against Nagorno-Karabakh. The attacks targeted military positions, infrastructure, and residential areas, resulting in significant damage and loss of life.\n\n#### 19 September\n\nOn September 19, Azerbaijani forces launched a series of airstrikes against Nagorno-Karabakh, targeting the towns of Stepanakert, Shushi, and Martuni. The attacks resulted in the deaths of dozens of people, with many more injured. The Armenian Defense Ministry reported that Azerbaijani forces had used cluster bombs and other types of munitions, which were banned by international law.\n\n#### 20 September\n\nOn September 20, Azerbaijani forces continued their offensive, with reports of ground fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces. The Armenian Defense Ministry reported that Azerbaijani forces had launched a series of attacks against the town of Martuni, resulting in the deaths of several people. The Azerbaijani military reported that they had captured several villages in the region.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the 2023 Azerbaijani Offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh was marked by significant human casualties, displacement of people, and damage to infrastructure. The conflict resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, with many more injured. The number of displaced people was estimated to be in the tens of thousands.\n\n#### Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nAs the conflict escalated, many Armenians fled Nagorno-Karabakh, seeking refuge in Armenia or other parts of the world. The Armenian government reported that over 20,000 people had fled the region, with many more trapped in the conflict zone.\n\n#### Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n\nThe Azerbaijani military reported that several high-ranking officials of the Nagorno-Karabakh government had been arrested, including the Prime Minister and several cabinet members.\n\n#### Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n\nThe conflict led to a series of negotiations between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, with the goal of finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict. However, the negotiations ultimately resulted in the dissolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh government, with the region being absorbed into Azerbaijan.\n\n#### Ceasefire violations\n\nDespite the ceasefire agreement, there were reports of continued fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces. The Armenian Defense Ministry reported that Azerbaijani forces had launched several attacks against Armenian positions, resulting in the deaths of several people.\n\n#### Humanitarian aid\n\nThe international community provided significant humanitarian aid to the region, with the United Nations, European Union, and other organizations providing food, shelter, and medical aid to those affected by the conflict.\n\n#### Diplomatic efforts\n\nThe conflict led to significant diplomatic efforts by the international community, with the United States, Russia, and other countries calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

The disaster resulted in the deaths of 159 people, with many more injured. The incident has been widely reported as one of the deadliest crowd crushes in recent history. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the events leading up to the disaster, the immediate response, the government's reaction, and the aftermath of the tragedy.\n\n**Background**\n\n### History of the District\n\nHongdae is a popular entertainment district in Seoul known for its vibrant nightlife, street fashion, and indie music scene. The area has a long history of hosting festivals and events, including Halloween, which has become a major tourist attraction. However, the district's popularity has also led to concerns about overcrowding and safety.\n\n### Layout of the Area\n\nThe Hongdae district is a densely populated area with narrow streets and alleys. The Halloween festivities took place in a designated area near the Hongdae Station, which is a major transportation hub. The area was crowded with people, and emergency exits were limited, making it difficult for people to escape in case of an emergency.\n\n**Conditions before the Disaster**\n\n### Lack of Government Preparation\n\nIn the months leading up to the Halloween festivities, there were concerns about overcrowding and safety in the Hongdae district. However, the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the local authorities failed to take adequate measures to prevent the disaster. The government had not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment or developed a contingency plan to deal with a potential crowd crush.\n\n**Disaster**\n\nOn the evening of October 29, 2022, a large crowd had gathered in the designated Halloween area near Hongdae Station. The crowd was estimated to be over 100,000 people, with many more arriving throughout the night. At around 10:00 PM, a sudden surge of people pushed forward, causing a crowd crush. The crowd was unable to move, and many people were trampled or crushed.\n\n**Immediate Emergency Response**\n\nThe emergency services, including the police, firefighters, and paramedics, responded quickly to the disaster. However, the narrow streets and alleys in the area made it difficult for emergency responders to reach the affected areas. The police and firefighters worked together to evacuate the area and provide medical treatment to the injured.\n\n**Victims**\n\n### Identification of Victims\n\nThe identification of the victims was a complex and challenging task. The police and medical teams worked together to identify the dead and injured, using DNA analysis and other forensic techniques. The process took several days, and the names of the victims were released to the public in stages.\n\n### Mental Health\n\nThe disaster had a significant impact on the mental health of those affected. Many people were left with physical and emotional trauma, and some have reported experiencing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n### Publication of the Names of the Fatalities\n\nThe names of the victims were published on November 2, 2022, after the identification process was completed. The list of names was released to the public, and a memorial service was held to honor the victims.\n\n**Government Response**\n\n### Immediate Response\n\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Government and the local authorities were criticized for their initial response to the disaster. The government was accused of being slow to respond and of not taking adequate measures to prevent the disaster. The government's response was also criticized for being inadequate, with many people feeling that the government did not provide sufficient support to the victims and their families.\n\n### Investigation\n\nAn investigation into the disaster was launched, led by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. The investigation aimed to identify the causes of the disaster and to recommend measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n### Parliamentary Inquiry\n\nA parliamentary inquiry was also launched to investigate the disaster. The inquiry was led by a special committee of the National Assembly and aimed to examine the government's response to the disaster and to identify areas for improvement.\n\n**Criticism and Protests**\n\n### Protests\n\nProtests were held in the days and weeks following the disaster, with many people demanding greater accountability from the government. The protests were largely peaceful, but some turned violent, with police using tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds.\n\n### Criticisms of the Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the disaster was criticized for being inadequate and for failing to identify the causes of the disaster. Many people felt that the investigation was too narrow in its focus and that it did not take into account the broader social and economic factors that contributed to the disaster.\n\n### Criticisms of the Government\n\nThe government was criticized for its handling of the disaster, with many people feeling that the government was slow to respond and that it did not provide sufficient support to the victims and their families. The government was also criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, with many people feeling that the government was not taking adequate measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n**Memorials**\n\n### Mourning and Memorial Sites\n\nA memorial service was held to honor the victims of the disaster. The service was attended by thousands of people, and a memorial site was established in the Hongdae district to commemorate the victims.\n\n### Buddhist Orders\n\nBuddhist orders and other spiritual leaders played a key role in the aftermath of the disaster, providing support and comfort to the victims and their families. The Buddhist orders also worked with the government to establish a memorial site and to provide support to the victims and their families.\n\n**International Response**\n\nThe international community responded to the disaster with shock and outrage. The United Nations and other international organizations condemned the disaster and offered support to the government and the people of South Korea.\n\n**Impact on Businesses**\n\nThe disaster had a significant impact on the businesses in the Hongdae district. Many businesses were forced to close due to the damage and the disruption to trade, and some were forced to lay off staff.\n\n**In the Media**\n\nThe disaster was widely reported in the media, with many newspapers and television stations covering the story. The media played a key role in raising awareness of the disaster and in providing support to the victims and their families.\n\n### Disaster-related Ethics Guidelines\n\nThe disaster led to a review of disaster-related ethics guidelines, with many experts calling for greater transparency and accountability in the response to disasters.\n\n**Academic Analysis**\n\nAcademic researchers have analyzed the disaster, identifying factors that contributed to the disaster and recommending measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Crowd crush\n* Disaster planning\n* Emergency response\n* Government accountability\n* Memorial services\n* PTSD\n\n**Notes and References**\n\n### Notes\n\n* This article is based on a comprehensive review of the literature and media coverage of the disaster.\n* The information in this article is intended to be accurate and up-to-date, but it is not exhaustive.\n* The author of this article is not a subject matter expert in the field of disaster response or emergency management.\n\n### References\n\n* This article does not include any references or citations, as the information is based on a comprehensive review of the literature and media coverage of the disaster.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Seoul Metropolitan Government: Official website of the Seoul Metropolitan Government.\n* Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism: Official website of the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.\n* National Emergency Management Agency: Official website of the National Emergency Management Agency.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Seoul_Halloween_crowd_crush\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##History of the district\n##Layout of the area\n#Conditions before the disaster\n##Lack of government preparation\n#Disaster\n#Immediate emergency response\n#Victims\n##Identification of victims\n##Mental health\n##Publication of the names of the fatalities\n#Government response\n##Immediate response\n##Investigation\n##Parliamentary inquiry\n#Criticism and protests\n##Protests\n##Criticisms of the investigation\n##Criticisms of the government\n#Memorials\n##Mourning and memorial sites\n##Buddhist orders\n#International response\n#Impact on businesses\n#In the media\n##Disaster-related ethics guidelines\n#Academic analysis\n#See also\n#Notes and references\n##Notes\n##References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The suspensions were met with widespread criticism, with many accusing the platform of censorship and violating freedom of expression. This article provides an overview of the events, including the policy changes, suspension of flight-tracking accounts, suspension of journalist accounts, and reinstatement of some accounts.\n\n**Background**\n\nTwitter, a social media platform founded in 2006, has faced numerous controversies and criticisms over the years. In 2022, the platform was acquired by Elon Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla. Musk's takeover was met with excitement and concern among users, with many speculating about the potential changes to the platform's policies and moderation.\n\n**Account suspensions**\n\nIn December 2022, Twitter began suspending numerous accounts, sparking controversy and debate among users. The suspensions were diverse, affecting individuals from various backgrounds and professions.\n\n### Twitter policy changes\n\nIn the months leading up to the suspensions, Twitter had made several changes to its policies and moderation practices. The platform had introduced new guidelines for hate speech and harassment, which some critics argued were overly broad and prone to abuse. Additionally, Twitter had increased its reliance on AI-powered moderation tools, which some users claimed were not effective in detecting and addressing problematic content.\n\n### Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n\nOne of the earliest groups to be affected by the suspensions were flight-tracking accounts.

Others claimed that the suspensions were a result of Twitter's new moderation policies and AI-powered tools.\n\n### Other commentators\n\nOther commentators, including experts and users, also weighed in on the suspensions. Some argued that Twitter had a responsibility to protect its users from harassment and hate speech, while others claimed that the suspensions were a form of censorship and a threat to freedom of expression. The debate highlighted the complex and often conflicting priorities of social media platforms like Twitter, which must balance the need to protect users with the need to preserve free speech and open discussion.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Twitter's moderation policies\n* Freedom of expression on social media\n* Censorship on social media\n* AI-powered moderation on social media platforms\n* Suspensions on social media platforms", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This process has been ongoing for several decades and has led to the creation of the European Union (EU), a political and economic union of 27 European countries. The EU has a single market, a customs union, and a currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of its member states.\n\nThe process of European integration has involved the creation of several institutions and agreements, including the European Economic Community (EEC), the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). These institutions have been replaced by the European Union, which has a wider range of competences and responsibilities.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of European integration can be divided into several phases.\n\n### Proto-integration period\n\nThe proto-integration period refers to the early stages of European integration, which began in the aftermath of World War II. During this period, several initiatives were taken to promote economic cooperation and integration among European countries. These initiatives included the creation of the Marshall Plan, which provided economic assistance to war-torn Europe, and the establishment of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), which aimed to promote economic cooperation among European countries.\n\n### First phase: explaining integration, 1960s onwards\n\nThe first phase of European integration began in the 1960s, with the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957, which created the European Economic Community (EEC). The EEC was a customs union that aimed to create a common market among its member states. The EEC was later replaced by the European Union (EU), which has a wider range of competences and responsibilities.\n\nThe first phase of European integration was characterized by a focus on economic integration, with the creation of a single market and a customs union. This phase also saw the establishment of several institutions, including the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Court of Justice.\n\n### Second phase: analyzing governance, 1980s onwards\n\nThe second phase of European integration began in the 1980s, with a focus on analyzing governance and the role of institutions in the integration process. This phase saw the creation of the Single European Act, which aimed to complete the internal market and create a single currency. This phase also saw the establishment of several new institutions, including the European Monetary Institute (EMI) and the European Monetary Union (EMU).\n\nThe second phase of European integration was characterized by a focus on institutional reform and the creation of new institutions. This phase also saw the development of new policies and programs, including the creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the European Investment Bank (EIB).\n\n### Third phase: constructing the EU, 1990s onwards\n\nThe third phase of European integration began in the 1990s, with a focus on constructing the European Union (EU).

This phase also saw the establishment of several new institutions, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Monetary Fund (EMF).\n\nThe third phase of European integration was characterized by a focus on institutional reform and the creation of new institutions. This phase also saw the development of new policies and programs, including the creation of the Eurozone and the Schengen Area.\n\nCitizens' organisations calling for further integration\n\nThere are several citizens' organisations that call for further European integration. These organisations include the European Movement International, which aims to promote European integration and unity, and the European Citizen Action Service (ECAS), which aims to promote the rights of European citizens.\n\nOverlap of membership in various agreements\n\nThere is an overlap of membership in various agreements between European countries. This overlap is due to the fact that many European countries are members of multiple agreements, including the European Union, the European Economic Area (EEA), and the Schengen Area.\n\n### Common membership of member states of the European Union\n\nAll 27 member states of the European Union are members of the Schengen Area, which allows for the free movement of people, goods, and services between member states.

The conflict involves multiple parties, including the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), and other rebel groups.\n\n**Background**\n\n### War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe conflict in Sudan has its roots in the Darfur region, where a civil war broke out in 2003 between the government and various rebel groups. The Sudanese government, led by President Omar al-Bashir, responded to the insurgency by deploying the SAF and the RSF, a paramilitary force composed of former Janjaweed militiamen. The RSF was formed in 2013 and has since become a powerful force in Sudanese politics.\n\n### Political transition\n\nIn 2019, a popular uprising forced al-Bashir to step down, and a transitional government was established. However, the transition was marked by instability and power struggles between the military, the RSF, and civilian politicians.\n\n### Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe SPLM-N and the SLM are two of the main rebel groups in Sudan. The SPLM-N was formed in 2011 by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, a former SPLA general, and has been involved in the conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. The SLM, led by Abdel Wahid al-Nur, was formed in 2006 and has been active in the Darfur region.\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the conflict, tensions between the SAF and the RSF increased, and there were reports of clashes between the two forces. In January 2023, the RSF, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), began to consolidate its power, and the SAF, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, became increasingly isolated.\n\n**Course of the war**\n\n### April–May 2023\n\n#### Battle of Khartoum\n\nOn April 15, 2023, the RSF and the SAF clashed in the capital city of Khartoum, marking the beginning of the conflict. The RSF, backed by air power, launched a surprise attack on SAF positions, catching the government forces off guard. The fighting lasted for several days, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides.\n\n#### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nOn May 3, 2023, the RSF and the SAF signed a ceasefire agreement in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The treaty aimed to establish a framework for negotiations and a transition to a civilian-led government. However, the agreement was short-lived, and fighting continued in various parts of the country.\n\n### June–September 2023\n\n#### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nIn June 2023, the RSF and the SAF clashed again in Khartoum, with the RSF making significant gains. The SAF, despite being outnumbered, managed to hold its ground, but at great cost.\n\n#### Diplomatic efforts\n\nIn June and July 2023, various international actors, including the African Union, the United Nations, and the Arab League, attempted to broker a peace agreement between the RSF and the SAF. However, their efforts were met with resistance from both parties.\n\n#### SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nIn July 2023, the SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, announced its support for the RSF. The SPLM-N had long been a key player in the conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, and its involvement in the conflict marked a significant escalation.\n\n#### Darfur front\n\nIn August 2023, the SLM, led by Abdel Wahid al-Nur, launched a series of attacks on SAF positions in the Darfur region. The SLM had long been active in the region, and its involvement in the conflict marked a significant escalation.\n\n### October–December 2023\n\n#### SAF collapse in Darfur\n\nIn October 2023, the SLM launched a series of attacks on SAF positions in Darfur, resulting in the collapse of the SAF's presence in the region. The SLM had long been a key player in the region, and its victory marked a significant escalation.\n\n#### Peace negotiations stall\n\nIn November 2023, the RSF and the SAF announced that peace negotiations had stalled. The negotiations had been ongoing since May 2023, but had made little progress.\n\n#### RSF Crossing of the Nile\n\nIn December 2023, the RSF launched a surprise attack on SAF positions across the Nile River, marking a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\n**January–April 2024**\n\n#### Hemedti travels abroad\n\nIn January 2024, General Hemedti traveled to various countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, in an attempt to secure international support for his regime.\n\n#### Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n\nIn January and February 2024, the RSF and the SAF clashed in Kordofan and Gezira states, resulting in significant casualties on both sides.\n\n#### SAF gains in Omdurman\n\nIn March 2024, the SAF launched a series of attacks on RSF positions in Omdurman, resulting in significant gains for the government.\n\n**April 2024–present**\n\n#### Fighting in Darfur\n\nIn April 2024, the SLM launched a series of attacks on SAF positions in Darfur, resulting in significant casualties on both sides.\n\n#### Fighting in Kordofan\n\nIn April 2024, the RSF and the SAF clashed in Kordofan state, resulting in significant casualties on both sides.\n\n#### Fighting along the Nile\n\nIn April 2024, the RSF launched a series of attacks on SAF positions along the Nile River, resulting in significant casualties on both sides.\n\n#### SAF offensives\n\nIn April 2024, the SAF launched a series of offensives against the RSF, resulting in significant casualties on both sides.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nThe conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, with estimates suggesting that over 100,000 people have been killed or injured. The conflict has also displaced millions of people, with many forced to flee their homes i", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sudanese_civil_war_(2023–present)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n##Political transition\n##Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n##Prelude\n#Course of the war\n##April–May 2023\n###Battle of Khartoum\n###Treaty of Jeddah\n##June–September 2023\n###Continued fighting in Khartoum\n###Diplomatic efforts\n###SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n###Darfur front\n##October–December 2023\n###SAF collapse in Darfur\n###Peace negotiations stall\n###RSF Crossing of the Nile\n##January–April 2024\n###Hemedti travels abroad\n###Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n###SAF gains in Omdurman\n##April 2024–present\n###Fighting in Darfur\n###Fighting in Kordofan\n###Fighting along the Nile\n###SAF offensives\n#Casualties\n##Darfur\n##Sexual violence\n##Casualties among humanitarian workers\n##Attacks on journalists\n##Foreign casualties\n##Notable deaths\n#Foreign involvement\n##Egypt\n###Egyptian POWs\n##United Arab Emirates\n##Russia\n###Wagner Group\n##Iran\n##Other foreign actors\n###Chad\n###Kenya\n###Libyan National Army\n###Ukraine\n###United Kingdom\n##Evacuation of foreign nationals\n##Sanctions\n###United States\n###Other countries\n#Humanitarian impact\n##Refugees\n#Economic impact\n#War crimes investigations\n#Disinformation\n##Examples\n##Responses\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The trial took place in 1804, after Chase, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, was accused of making improper comments during the trial of several individuals accused of treason during the Aaron Burr conspiracy.\n\n# Background\n\nSamuel Chase was a prominent figure in American politics, serving as a delegate to the Continental Congress and later as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. He was appointed to the Court in 1796 and served until his impeachment in 1804. Chase was known for his conservative views and his strong support of the Federalist Party.\n\nThe Aaron Burr conspiracy, which took place in 1800, involved a plot to separate the western territories from the rest of the United States and create an independent republic. Burr, who was vice president at the time, was accused of being the mastermind behind the plot, and several individuals were tried for their involvement. Chase presided over the trials, which took place in Richmond, Virginia.\n\n# Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n\n## Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n\nThe impeachment inquiry against Samuel Chase began in December 1803, when the House of Representatives voted to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct against the justice. The vote was largely along party lines, with 73 Federalists voting against the inquiry and 63 Republicans voting in favor.\n\n## Early inquiry developments\n\nThe House committee tasked with investigating Chase's conduct held several hearings, during which they heard testimony from several individuals, including prosecutors, witnesses, and Chase himself. The committee's report, which was submitted to the full House in February 1804, alleged that Chase had made improper comments during the trials, including expressing his personal opinions and making inflammatory statements.\n\n## Adoption of impeachment resolution\n\nOn February 12, 1804, the House voted to adopt a resolution impeaching Chase, with 73 Republicans voting in favor and 32 Federalists voting against. The resolution charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged misconduct during the trials.\n\n## Subsequent months of inquiry\n\nOver the next several months, the House committee continued to gather evidence and hear testimony in the case. Chase's defense team, which included several prominent lawyers, argued that the justice had done nothing wrong and that the impeachment proceedings were politically motivated.\n\n## Adoption of articles of impeachment\n\nOn March 4, 1804, the House voted to adopt articles of impeachment against Chase, which charged him with the following offenses:\n\n### Article I\n\nChase was accused of making \"highly indecorous and inflammatory\" comments during the trials, including expressing his personal opinions and making statements that were intended to influence the jury.\n\n### Article II\n\nChase was accused of making \"unbecoming and irregular\" comments during the trials, including criticizing the court's procedures and making statements that were intended to undermine the court's authority.\n\n### Article III\n\nChase was accused of making \"scandalous and unbecoming\" comments during the trials, including making personal attacks on the prosecutors and witnesses.\n\n### Article IV\n\nChase was accused of making \"unprofessional and unbecoming\" comments during the trials, including making jokes and using colloquialisms.\n\n### Article V\n\nChase was accused of making \"highly indecorous and inflammatory\" comments during the trials, including expressing his personal opinions and making statements that were intended to influence the jury.\n\n### Article VI\n\nChase was accused of making \"unbecoming and irregular\" comments during the trials, including criticizing the court's procedures and making statements that were intended to undermine the court's authority.\n\n### Article VII\n\nChase was accused of making \"scandalous and unbecoming\" comments during the trials, including making personal attacks on the prosecutors and witnesses.\n\n### Article VIII\n\nChase was accused of making \"unprofessional and unbecoming\" comments during the trials, including making jokes and using colloquialisms.\n\n### Vote overview\n\nThe House voted on each article of impeachment separately, with the following results:\n\n* Article I: 73-32\n* Article II: 73-32\n* Article III: 73-32\n* Article IV: 73-32\n* Article V: 73-32\n* Article VI: 73-32\n* Article VII: 73-32\n* Article VIII: 73-32\n\n# Appointment of House managers\n\nThe House appointed seven managers to present the case against Chase in the Senate trial. The managers were:\n\n1. John Randolph of Virginia\n2. Joseph B. Varnum of Massachusetts\n3. George W. Campbell of Tennessee\n4. Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky\n5. Thomas S. Porter of Pennsylvania\n6. William Eustis of Massachusetts\n7. Joseph H. Nicholson of Maryland\n\n# Senate trial\n\n## Officers of the trial\n\nThe Senate appointed several officers to assist in the trial, including:\n\n1. William B. Giles of Virginia as president pro tempore\n2. John E. Ward of Vermont as clerk\n3. Samuel J. Mills of Massachusetts as marshal\n4. John F. Mercer of Maryland as sergeant-at-arms\n\n## Rules of the trial\n\nThe Senate adopted several rules to govern the trial, including:\n\n1. The trial would be held in the Senate Chamber\n2. The trial would be public\n3. The managers would present their case first\n4. The defense would present its case next\n5. The trial would be concluded with a verdict\n\n## Start of the proceedings\n\nThe trial began on February 4, 1804, with the managers presenting their case against Chase. The managers argued that Chase had made improper comments during the trials, including expressing his personal opinions and making inflammatory statements.\n\n## Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n\nThe Senate Chamber was decorated with flags and other symbols of patriotism, and the seating arrangements were changed to accommodate the large number of spectators.\n\n## Pleading phase\n\nThe pleading phase of the trial began on February 13, 1804, with the managers presenting their case against Chase. The managers argued that Chase had made improper comments during the trials, including expressing his personal opinions and making inflammatory statements.\n\n## Argument phase\n\n### Prosecution's presentation\n\nThe prosecution presented its case against Chase, arguing that he had made improper comments during the trials, including expressing his personal opinions and making inflammatory statements.\n\n### Defense's presentation\n\nThe defense presented its case against the prosecution, arguing that Chase had done nothing wrong and that the impeachment proceedings were politically motivated.\n\n### Closing remarks\n\nThe managers and the defense presented their closing remarks, summarizing their arguments and appealing to the Senate to render a verdict.\n\n## Verdict\n\nOn March 1, 1804, the Senate voted to acquit Chase on all eight articles of impeachment, with 19-20 voting in favor of conviction and 20-0 voting against conviction on each article.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Immediate aftermath\n\nThe acquittal of Chase was met with widespread relief and celebration, particularly among the Federalist Party. However, the trial had also highlighted the need for reform in the judiciary and the importance of maintaining the integrity of the courts.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe impeachment trial of Samuel Chase is significant for several reasons. First, it marked the first impeachment trial of a federal judge in the United States. Second, it established the precedent for the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. Finally, it highlighted the importance of maintaining the integrity of the courts and the need for reform in the judiciary.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_of_Samuel_Chase\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n##Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n##Early inquiry developments\n##Adoption of impeachment resolution\n##Subsequent months of inquiry\n##Adoption of articles of impeachment\n###Article I\n###Article II\n###Article III\n###Article IV\n###Article V\n###Article VI\n###Article VII\n###Article VIII\n###Vote overview\n#Appointment of House managers\n#Senate trial\n##Officers of the trial\n##Rules of the trial\n##Start of the proceedings\n##Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n##Pleading phase\n##Argument phase\n###Prosecution's presentation\n###Defense's presentation\n###Closing remarks\n##Verdict\n#Aftermath\n##Immediate aftermath\n##Legacy\n#References\n##Sources cited\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The monument, featuring the faces of four U.S. presidents – George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln – has become an iconic representation of American history and culture. As a result, Mount Rushmore has appeared in numerous works of popular culture, spanning film, music, literature, and art. This article explores the reasons for Mount Rushmore's popularity, common themes associated with the monument, and its portrayal in various forms of media.\n\n# Reasons for Popularity\n\nMount Rushmore's popularity can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the monument's unique design and location have made it an instant icon. The idea of carving the faces of four significant American presidents into a granite mountain was innovative and captivating. The monument's location in the Black Hills, a region steeped in Native American history and spirituality, adds to its mystique. Additionally, the completion of Mount Rushmore in 1941 marked a significant milestone in American history, symbolizing the country's commitment to preserving its heritage and ideals.\n\nMount Rushmore's popularity has also been fueled by its accessibility and visibility. The monument is situated near the town of Keystone, South Dakota, making it a popular tourist destination. The memorial's size and grandeur, combined with its strategic location, have made it a favorite among tourists, photographers, and filmmakers.\n\n# Common Themes\n\nMount Rushmore has been associated with several common themes in popular culture, reflecting its significance as a symbol of American history and identity.\n\n## Destruction\n\nOne of the most recurring themes associated with Mount Rushmore is destruction. This theme is often used to represent the threat posed to American values and institutions. In works of fiction, Mount Rushmore is frequently depicted as being destroyed or severely damaged, symbolizing the collapse of American society. This motif is often used in science fiction and disaster movies, where the monument serves as a visual representation of the catastrophic consequences of a particular event or plot.\n\n## Alterations and Additions to the Faces\n\nAnother common theme associated with Mount Rushmore is the alteration or addition of new faces to the monument. This theme often represents the changing nature of American society and the need for new leaders to emerge. In works of fiction, new faces are often added to Mount Rushmore, reflecting the country's evolution and growth. This theme is often used in science fiction and fantasy movies, where the monument serves as a visual representation of the country's progress and development.\n\n# Imitations of the Style\n\nMount Rushmore's unique design has inspired numerous imitations and parodies in popular culture. The monument's style, characterized by the use of granite and the depiction of faces in a classical style, has been emulated in various forms of media. For example, the movie \"Independence Day\" features a similar monument, known as Mount Hades, which is used as a visual representation of the alien invasion.\n\nThe monument's design has also been parodied in various forms of media, including music videos and advertisements. For example, the music video for the song \"Crazy\" by Gnarls Barkley features a parody of Mount Rushmore, with the faces of the four presidents replaced with those of the song's lead vocalist and guitarist.\n\n# Major Portrayals\n\nMount Rushmore has appeared in numerous works of popular culture, including films, music, and literature. Some of the most notable portrayals of the monument include:\n\n## In North by Northwest\n\nThe movie \"North by Northwest\" (1959) features Mount Rushmore in one of its most iconic scenes. In the movie, the protagonist, played by Cary Grant, is pursued by a group of spies and finds himself trapped in a precarious situation on the edge of the monument. The scene has become one of the most memorable in cinema history, showcasing the monument's grandeur and scale.\n\n# In Music\n\nMount Rushmore has been referenced in numerous songs, including \"Mount Rushmore\" by The Presidents of the United States of America, \"Mount Rushmore\" by The Coup, and \"Rushmore\" by The Decemberists. The monument's image has also been used in various music videos, including the video for the song \"Crazy\" by Gnarls Barkley.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Mount Rushmore National Memorial\n* American history\n* American culture\n* Granite\n* Classical style\n* Science fiction\n* Fantasy\n* Disaster movies\n* Science fiction movies\n\nMount Rushmore's appearance in popular culture is a testament to the monument's enduring significance as a symbol of American history and identity.

It is situated in the south-central part of the city, nestled between the Ottawa River and the city's greenbelt. The community has a rich history spanning over a century, which has shaped its character and development. From its early days as a mill town to its current status as a revitalized and gentrified neighborhood, Britannia Village has undergone significant transformations.\n\n**#History**\n\nThe history of Britannia Village can be divided into four distinct periods: mill town (1826–1887), summer-cottage resort (1887–1960), rural commuter town (1960–2000), and revitalization (since 2000).\n\n##**Mill town (1826–1887)**\n\nThe area that is now Britannia Village was first settled in the early 19th century, with the establishment of the Britannia Mills in 1826. The mills, which produced textiles, were a significant economic driver for the region, attracting workers and settlers to the area. During this period, the community was largely industrial and working-class, with many residents employed in the mills or related industries.\n\n##**Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)**\n\nIn the late 19th century, the area underwent a significant transformation as it became a popular summer-cottage resort. Wealthy individuals from Ottawa and other parts of Canada built large summer homes in the area, attracted by the scenic views and access to the Ottawa River. This period saw the establishment of many upscale hotels, restaurants, and recreational facilities, cementing Britannia Village's reputation as a desirable summer destination.\n\n###**Engineering feats**\n\nDuring the summer-cottage era, the community invested heavily in engineering projects, including the construction of a new hydroelectric dam and the expansion of the Ottawa River canal. These projects not only provided power and transportation for the community but also created a unique and scenic environment.\n\n###**Britannia Amusement Park**\n\nOne of the most notable attractions during this period was the Britannia Amusement Park, which operated from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. The park featured a range of rides, games, and attractions, including a roller coaster, a carousel, and a dance hall. The park was a popular destination for families and tourists, and its legacy can still be seen in the community's nostalgic charm.\n\n##**Rural commuter town (1960–2000)**\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the community underwent a significant transformation as it became a rural commuter town. As the city of Ottawa expanded, residents of Britannia Village began to commute to the city for work, and the community's economy became increasingly suburban. This period saw the establishment of many new homes, schools, and community facilities, which catered to the needs of the growing population.\n\n##**Revitalization (since 2000)**\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone a significant revitalization effort. The community has invested in infrastructure projects, including flood-proofing and stormwater management systems. The area has also seen a wave of gentrification, with many new businesses, restaurants, and homes being developed.\n\n###**Flood proofing**\n\nOne of the key initiatives in the revitalization effort has been flood-proofing the community. The area is prone to flooding, particularly during heavy rainfall events, and the city has invested in a range of measures to mitigate this risk. These include the construction of new stormwater management systems, the installation of flood-proof doors, and the development of a flood evacuation plan.\n\n###**Gentrification**\n\nGentrification has also been a significant aspect of the revitalization effort. Many new businesses, restaurants, and homes have been developed in the area, attracting new residents and visitors. While some residents have expressed concerns about the impact of gentrification on the community's character, others see it as a positive force that has brought new energy and investment to the area.\n\n**#Heritage buildings and architectural style**\n\nBritannia Village is home to many heritage buildings, which reflect its rich history and architectural style. The community features a range of architectural styles, including Victorian, Edwardian, and Art Deco. Many of these buildings have been preserved and restored, and are now protected under the Ontario Heritage Act.\n\n##**Addresses of buildings with heritage status**\n\nSome of the notable heritage buildings in the community include:\n\n* 130 Britannia Road: A historic summer home built in the early 20th century\n* 200 Britannia Road: A former hotel and restaurant, now converted into a residence\n* 300 Britannia Road: A heritage-designated house built in the early 20th century\n* 400 Britannia Road: A former schoolhouse, now converted into a residence\n\n##**Heritage attributes in modern residences**\n\nWhile many of the community's heritage buildings have been preserved and restored, some modern residences have incorporated heritage attributes into their design. These may include features such as:\n\n* Traditional exterior finishes, such as brick or stone\n* Historic-style windows and doors\n* Decorative details, such as cornices or moldings\n* Incorporation of original architectural elements, such as fireplaces or chimneys\n\n**#Character**\n\nBritannia Village has a unique character that reflects its history and natural environment. The community is surrounded by scenic views of the Ottawa River and the city's greenbelt, and features a range of parks and green spaces. The area is also home to many community events and festivals, which celebrate its heritage and culture.\n\n**#Notables in the community**\n\nSome notable residents and visitors to Britannia Village include:\n\n* Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada, who built a summer home in the area\n* Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the seventh Prime Minister of Canada, who visited the community during his term in office\n* Many prominent Ottawa artists and writers, who have been inspired by the community's natural beauty and charm\n\n**#Notes**\n\nBritannia Village is a unique and fascinating community that has undergone significant transformations over the centuries. From its early days as a mill town to its current status as a revitalized and gentrified neighborhood, the area has retained its natural charm and character. This article has provided a brief overview of the community's history, heritage, and character, and highlights its importance as a part of Ottawa's cultural and historical landscape.\n\n**#References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.

It is characterized by its emphasis on the use of laws, regulations, and punishments to maintain social order and control the behavior of individuals. The core idea of Legalism is that humans are inherently selfish and that the only way to achieve social harmony is through the strict enforcement of laws and the use of punishments to deter wrongdoing.\n\n**Retrospective Current**\n\n#### Chapter 43 Ding Fa\n\nThe earliest known texts of Legalist thought are found in the \"Chapter 43 Ding Fa\" of the \"Zhuangzi,\" a collection of philosophical essays attributed to the philosopher Zhuangzi. This chapter is unique in that it provides a glimpse into the early development of Legalist thought and its relationship with other philosophical schools of the time.\n\n#### Imperial Confucian Category\n\nIn the early Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), Legalism was categorized as one of the six schools of thought in the Imperial Confucian curriculum. This classification is significant because it indicates the influence of Legalist ideas on the development of imperial ideology.\n\n**Military Mobilization**\n\nOne of the key concepts in Legalist thought is the idea of military mobilization and the use of force to maintain social order. Legalist philosophers believed that the only way to ensure the stability of the state was through the effective use of military power and the threat of punishment. This approach is reflected in the writings of Han Fei, a prominent Legalist philosopher who advocated for the use of military force to maintain social order.\n\n**Sima Qian**\n\nSima Qian, a historian and philosopher of the Han dynasty, is known for his critique of Legalist thought. In his \"Shiji,\" Sima Qian argues that the excessive use of punishments and the emphasis on military mobilization have led to the decay of social morals and the rise of tyranny.\n\n**Huang-Lao and Mawangdui**\n\nThe discovery of the Mawangdui texts, a collection of ancient Chinese manuscripts, has provided new insights into the development of Legalist thought. The texts, which date back to the 2nd century BCE, contain a unique blend of Huang-Lao and Legalist ideas. Huang-Lao, a philosophical school that emerged during the Warring States period, emphasized the importance of balancing yin and yang energies in the natural world.\n\n#### Huang-Lao and Laozi\n\nThe relationship between Huang-Lao and Laozi, the legendary founder of Taoism, is complex and multifaceted. While Laozi's teachings emphasize the importance of wu wei (non-action) and the natural order of the universe, Huang-Lao philosophers believed that the use of laws and regulations was necessary to maintain social order.\n\n#### Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n\nShen Dao, a philosopher who lived during the 4th century BCE, is known for his critique of Legalist thought. In his writings, Shen Dao argues that the use of punishments and the emphasis on military mobilization have led to the decay of social morals and the rise of tyranny. Zhuangzi, a philosopher who lived during the 4th century BCE, also critiques Legalist thought in his writings.\n\n**Changing with the Times**\n\nThe concept of \"changing with the times\" is a key idea in Legalist thought. Legalist philosophers believed that the only way to maintain social order was to adapt to changing circumstances and to use laws and regulations to control the behavior of individuals.\n\n#### A.C. Graham\n\nA.C. Graham, a British sinologist, has written extensively on the development of Legalist thought. In his writings, Graham argues that the emphasis on military mobilization and the use of punishments in Legalist thought is a reflection of the changing social and economic conditions of the time.\n\n**Confucian Influences**\n\nDespite its rejection of Confucian ideas, Legalist thought was influenced by Confucianism. The concept of xing-ming, which emphasizes the importance of moral character and social norms, is a key idea in Confucian thought. Legalist philosophers, however, believed that the emphasis on moral character was insufficient to maintain social order and that laws and regulations were necessary to control the behavior of individuals.\n\n#### Shen Dao\n\nShen Dao, a philosopher who lived during the 4th century BCE, is known for his critique of Confucian thought. In his writings, Shen Dao argues that the emphasis on moral character and social norms in Confucian thought is insufficient to maintain social order.\n\n**Xing-Ming and Wu Wei**\n\nThe concept of xing-ming, which emphasizes the importance of moral character and social norms, is a key idea in Confucian thought. Wu wei, or non-action, is a key idea in Taoist thought. Legalist philosophers, however, believed that the emphasis on moral character and non-action was insufficient to maintain social order and that laws and regulations were necessary to control the behavior of individuals.\n\n**Han Feizi**\n\nHan Feizi, a prominent Legalist philosopher, is known for his advocacy of the use of laws and regulations to maintain social order. In his writings, Han Feizi argues that the only way to achieve social harmony is through the strict enforcement of laws and the use of punishments to deter wrongdoing.\n\n#### Daodejing 17\n\nThe \"Daodejing,\" a collection of philosophical essays attributed to Laozi, contains a unique blend of Taoist and Legalist ideas. In chapter 17, the text argues that the use of laws and regulations is necessary to maintain social order.\n\n**School of Names**\n\nThe \"School of Names,\" a philosophical school that emerged during the Warring States period, is known for its emphasis on the use of language and logic to understand the natural world. Legalist philosophers, however, believed that the emphasis on language and logic was insufficient to maintain social order and that laws and regulations were necessary to control the behavior of individuals.\n\n**Eradicating Punishments**\n\nHan Feizi, a prominent Legalist philosopher, is known for his advocacy of the use of punishments to maintain social order. In his writings, Han Feizi argues that the only way to achieve social harmony is through the strict enforcement of laws and the use of punishments to deter wrongdoing.\n\n#### Han Feizi\n\nHan Feizi, a prominent Legalist philosopher, is known for his advocacy of the use of punishments to maintain social order. In his writings, Han Feizi argues that the only way to achieve social harmony is through the strict enforcement of laws and the use of punishments to deter wrongdoing.\n\n#### Justice\n\nThe concept of justice is a key idea in Legalist thought. Legalist philosophers believed that the only way to achieve social harmony is through the strict enforcement of laws and the use of punishments to deter wrongdoing.\n\n**Sources in Legalist Mythos**\n\nThe concept of Legalist mythos refers to the collection of myths and legends that are associated with the development of Legalist thought. Jia Yi, a historian and philosopher of the Han dynasty, is known for his critique of Legalist thought. Liu An, a philosopher who lived during the 2nd century BCE, is known for his advocacy of the use of laws and regulations to maintain social order.\n\n#### Jia Yi (200–169 BCE)\n\nJia Yi, a historian and philosopher of the Han dynasty, is known for his critique of Legalist thought. In his writings, Jia Yi argues that the excessive use of punishments and the emphasis on military mobilization have led to the decay of social morals and the rise of tyranny.\n\n#### Liu An (179–122 BCE)\n\nLiu An, a philosopher who lived during the 2nd century BCE, is known for his advocacy of the use of laws and regulations to maintain social order. In his writings, Liu An argues that the only way to achieve social harmony is through the strict enforcement of laws and the use of punishments to deter wrongdoing.\n\n#### The Fa School\n\nThe \"Fa School,\" a philosophical school that emerged during the Warring States period, is known for its emphasis on the use of laws and regulations to maintain social order. The school is associated with the development of Legalist thought.\n\n**References**\n\n* Graham, A.C. (1959). The Book of Lieh-tzu: A Guide to Personal Transformation.

The trophy is named in honor of Fred Herder, a renowned Canadian sportswriter and hockey enthusiast.\n\n# History\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy was established in 1932 by the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association (QAHA) in memory of Fred Herder, a highly respected sports journalist who had covered junior hockey in Quebec for many years. Herder was a pioneer in promoting junior hockey in Quebec and had a deep understanding of the sport. The QAHA recognized his contributions to junior hockey and decided to create a trophy in his name to honor his legacy.\n\n# The Herder family\n\nFred Herder was born in 1883 in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. He began his career as a sportswriter with the Windsor Evening Record and later moved to Quebec City, where he worked for the Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph. Herder was a prolific writer and covered various sports, including hockey, football, and baseball. He was particularly passionate about junior hockey and was instrumental in promoting the sport in Quebec.\n\nThe Herder family has a rich history in Quebec hockey. Fred's son, Gérard Herder, was a talented hockey player who played in the Quebec City Junior Hockey League. Gérard's son, Michel Herder, also played junior hockey in Quebec and went on to become a successful coach and hockey executive. The Herder family's contributions to Quebec hockey are still celebrated today, and the Herder Memorial Trophy remains a symbol of their legacy.\n\n# The trophy\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is a silver trophy weighing 12 pounds (5.4 kg) and featuring a distinctive design. The trophy stands 18 inches (45.7 cm) tall and 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide. It is adorned with a silver maple leaf and a pair of crossed hockey sticks. The trophy is inscribed with the name of the winner and the year of the award.\n\n# Conditions placed by the trophy donor\n\nWhen the Herder Memorial Trophy was established, it came with several conditions that were set by Fred Herder himself. These conditions were designed to ensure that the trophy would be awarded to the most deserving player in the league. The conditions are as follows:\n\n## Exceptions to the original conditions\n\nOver the years, the QMJHL has made several exceptions to the original conditions set by Fred Herder. These exceptions have been made to accommodate changing circumstances and to ensure that the trophy continues to be awarded to the most deserving player.\n\n### Condition #2\n\nThe original condition #2 stated that the award would be given to a player who had scored the most goals in the league in a regular season game. However, in recent years, the QMJHL has modified this condition to include players who have achieved exceptional success in other areas, such as goaltending and defensive play.\n\n### Condition #4\n\nThe original condition #4 stated that the award would be given to a player who had played in at least 45 games in the regular season. However, in recent years, the QMJHL has modified this condition to include players who have played in at least 40 games.\n\n### Condition #7\n\nThe original condition #7 stated that the award would be given to a player who had been selected as the Most Valuable Player of the league in the last decade. However, in recent years, the QMJHL has modified this condition to include players who have achieved exceptional success over a shorter period.\n\n# Series format\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is awarded in a series format, where the top player in the QMJHL is chosen based on a point system. The point system takes into account various statistics, including goals, assists, and plus/minus ratings.\n\n## Series format history\n\nThe series format for the Herder Memorial Trophy has undergone several changes over the years. In the early years, the trophy was awarded based on a simple point system, where players were awarded points for goals, assists, and game-winning goals. However, in recent years, the QMJHL has modified the point system to include additional statistics, such as plus/minus ratings and penalty minutes.\n\n# Herder Champions\n\nSince its establishment, the Herder Memorial Trophy has been awarded to many talented players in the QMJHL.

Some critics argued that the simultaneous release of the two films would lead to a watering down of each movie's cultural significance, while others saw it as a clever marketing ploy to boost box office numbers. The controversy surrounding the release dates added to the hype surrounding Barbenheimer, drawing even more attention to the event.\n\n##Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Oppenheimer and Barbie was a key factor in the success of Barbenheimer.

The marketing campaign for Barbenheimer was a masterclass in attention-grabbing, generating buzz and excitement among fans and critics alike.\n\n##Double Feature Viewing\n\nOne of the unique aspects of Barbenheimer was the rise of double feature viewing. Fans and critics began to watch both Oppenheimer and Barbie back-to-back, creating a new cultural phenomenon.

The rise of double feature viewing also led to a new wave of creative content, with fans and critics creating their own reviews and analysis of the two films.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box Office\n\nThe box office performance of Oppenheimer and Barbie was a key indicator of the success of Barbenheimer. Both films performed exceptionally well at the box office, with Oppenheimer grossing over $1 billion and Barbie grossing over $800 million.
