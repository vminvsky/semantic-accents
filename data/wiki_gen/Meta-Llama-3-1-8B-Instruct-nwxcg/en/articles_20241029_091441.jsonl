The team is controlled by the French Football Federation (FFF) and is one of the most successful teams in international football, having won two FIFA World Cup titles, two UEFA European Championship titles, and one UEFA Nations League title.\n\n**History**\n\n#### Early years (1900–1930s)\n\nThe France national team was first established in 1904 and played its first international match against Belgium on January 1, 1904. The team experienced early success, winning the 1911 and 1921 editions of the British Home Championship. However, the team's fortunes declined in the interwar period, failing to qualify for the 1930 FIFA World Cup.\n\n#### 1950s–1980s\n\nFrance experienced a resurgence in the 1950s, winning the 1958 FIFA World Cup with a team led by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine, who scored 13 goals in the tournament. The team went on to win the 1960 European Nations' Cup, but failed to replicate this success in the following decades. In the 1980s, the team struggled to qualify for major tournaments, but experienced a mild resurgence in the late 1980s under the management of Michel Platini.\n\n#### Zidane era and World Champions (1996–2006)\n\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of a new generation of French players, led by Zinedine Zidane, who would become one of the greatest players in French history. With Zidane at the helm, France won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, defeating Brazil 3-0 in the final. The team followed this up with a European Championship title in 2000, but failed to defend their World Cup title in 2002. However, they won the World Cup again in 2006, with Zidane leading the team to a 5-3 victory over Italy in the final.\n\n#### Decline and rebuild (2007–2015)\n\nAfter the 2006 World Cup, the team experienced a decline in fortunes, failing to qualify for the 2010 World Cup. The team's fortunes improved under the management of Laurent Blanc, who led the team to the quarterfinals of the 2012 European Championship. However, the team struggled to replicate this success in the following years, failing to qualify for the 2014 World Cup.\n\n#### Renewed success (2016–present)\n\nUnder the management of Didier Deschamps, the team experienced a resurgence in fortunes, winning the UEFA European Championship in 2016. The team followed this up with a World Cup title in 2018, defeating Croatia 4-2 in the final. The team has continued to experience success in the following years, winning the UEFA Nations League in 2021.\n\n**Home stadium**\n\nThe France national team has played its home matches at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, since its inauguration in 1998. The stadium has a capacity of over 81,000 and is one of the largest stadiums in Europe.\n\n**Team image**\n\n#### Media coverage\n\nThe France national team has a large following in the media, with regular coverage on French television and radio. The team's matches are broadcast live on France Télévisions, and the team's performances are widely covered in French newspapers.\n\n#### Kits and crest\n\nThe team's kit is manufactured by Adidas, and features the French tricolor colors of red, blue, and white. The team's crest features the French coat of arms, and is worn on the team's jerseys and other team equipment.\n\n#### Kit sponsorship\n\nThe team's kit sponsorship deal with Adidas is one of the largest in the world, and is worth over €10 million per year. The team's kit is sold in over 100 countries worldwide.\n\n#### Kit deals\n\nThe team's kit deals are negotiated by the French Football Federation, and are worth over €10 million per year. The team's kit deals are some of the largest in the world, and are worth more than many of the top clubs in Europe.\n\n**Nickname**\n\nThe France national team is nicknamed \"Les Bleus\" (The Blues) due to the blue color of their jerseys.\n\n**Results and fixtures**\n\n#### 2023\n\nThe France national team began the year with a friendly match against Germany, which ended in a 1-1 draw. The team followed this up with a match against Austria, which ended in a 2-0 victory.\n\n#### 2024\n\nThe team is scheduled to play a match against England in March 2024, as part of the UEFA Nations League.\n\n**Coaching staff**\n\n#### Coaching history\n\nThe France national team has had several coaches throughout its history, including:\n\n* Henri Desgrange (1904-1905)\n* Gaston Barreau (1905-1906)\n* Frantz Raynaud (1906-1907)\n* Gaston Barreau (1907-1908)\n* Gaston Barreau (1908-1909)\n* Gaston Barreau (1909-1910)\n* Marcel Albérola (1910-1911)\n* Gaston Barreau (1911-1912)\n* Marcel Albérola (1912-1913)\n* Gaston Barreau (1913-1914)\n* Marcel Albérola (1914-1915)\n* Gaston Barreau (1915-1916)\n* Henri Broissin (1916-1917)\n* Gaston Barreau (1917-1918)\n* Henri Broissin (1918-1919)\n* Gaston Barreau (1919-1920)\n* Henri Broissin (1920-1921)\n* Gaston Barreau (1921-1922)\n* Henri Broissin (1922-1923)\n* Gaston Barreau (1923-1924)\n* Henri Broissin (1924-1925)\n* Gaston Barreau (1925-1926)\n* Henri Broissin (1926-1927)\n* Gaston Barreau (1927-1928)\n* Henri Broissin (1928-1929)\n* Gaston Barreau (1929-1930)\n* Henri Broissin (1930-1931)\n* Gaston Barreau (1931-1932)\n* Henri Broissin (1932-1933)\n* Gaston Barreau (1933-1934)\n* Henri Broissin (1934-1935)\n* Gaston Barreau (1935-1936)\n* Henri Broissin (1936-1937)\n* Gaston Barreau (1937-1938)\n* Henri Broissin (1938-1939)\n* Gaston Barreau (1939-1940)\n* Henri Broissin (1940-1941)\n* Gaston Barreau (1941-1942)\n* Henri Broissin (1942-1943)\n* Gaston Barreau (1943-1944)\n* Henri Broissin (1944-1945)\n* Gaston Barreau (1945-1946)\n* Henri Broissin (1946-1947)\n* Gaston Barreau (1947-1948)\n* Henri Broissin (1948-1949)\n* Gaston Barreau (1949-1950)\n* Henri Broissin (1950-1951)\n* Gaston Barreau (1951-1952)\n* Henri Broissin (1952-1953)\n* Gaston Barreau (1953-1954)\n* Henri Broissin (1954-1955)\n* Gaston Barreau (1955-1956)\n* Henri Broissin (1956-1957)\n* Gaston Barreau (1957-1958)\n* Henri Broissin (1958-1959)\n* Gaston Barreau (1959-1960)\n* Henri Broissin (1960-1961)\n* Gaston Barreau (1961-1962)\n* Henri Broissin (1962-1963)\n* Gaston Barreau (1963-1964)\n* Henri Broissin (1964-1965)\n* Gaston Barreau (1965-1966)\n* Henri Broissin (1966-1967)\n* Gaston Barreau (1967-1968)\n* Henri Broissin (1968-1969)\n* Gaston Barreau (1969-1970)\n* Henri Broissin (1970-1971)\n* Gaston Barreau (1971-1972)\n* Henri Broissin (1972-1973)\n* Gaston Barreau (1973-1974)\n* Henri Broissin (1974-1975)\n* Gaston Barreau (1975-1976)\n* Henri Broissin (1976-1977)\n* Gaston Barreau (1977-1978)\n* Henri Broissin (1978-1979)\n* Gaston Barreau (1979-1980)\n* Henri Broissin (1980-1981)\n* Gaston Barreau (1981-1982)\n* Henri Broissin (1982-1983)\n* Gaston Barreau (1983-1984)\n* Henri Broissin (1984-1985)\n* Gaston Barreau (1985-1986)\n* Henri Broissin (1986-1987)\n* Gaston Barreau (1987-1988)\n* Henri Broissin (1988-1989)\n* Gaston Barreau (1989-1990)\n* Henri Broissin (1990-1991)\n* Gaston Barreau (1991-1992)\n* Henri Broissin (1992-1993)\n* Gaston Barreau (1993-1994)\n* Henri Broissin (1994-1995)\n* Gaston Barreau (1995-1996)\n* Henri Broissin (1996-1997)\n* Jacques Santini (1997-2002)\n* Roger Lemerre (2002-2004)\n* Raymond Domenech (2004-2010)\n* Laurent Blanc (2010-2012)\n* Didier Deschamps (2012-present)\n\n**Players**\n\n#### Current squad\n\nThe current squad for the France national team is:\n\n* Goalkeepers:\n\t+ Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur)\n\t+ Steve Mandanda (Marseille)\n* Defenders:\n\t+ Raphaël Varane (Manchester United)\n\t+ Samuel Umtiti (Barcelona)\n\t+ Lucas Hernández (Atlético Madrid)\n\t+ Benjamin Pavard (Bayern Munich)\n\t+ Dayot Upamecano (RB Leipzig)\n* Midfielders:\n\t+ N'Golo Kanté (Chelsea)\n\t+ Paul Pogba (Manchester United)\n\t+ Aurélien Tchouaméni (Monaco)\n\t+ Eduardo Camavinga (Rennes)\n\t+ Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich)\n* Forwards:\n\t+ Kylian Mbappé (Paris Saint-Germain)\n\t+ Olivier Giroud (AC Milan)\n\t+ Karim Benzema (Real Madrid)\n\n#### Recent call-ups\n\nThe following players have been called up to the France national team in the last 12 months:\n\n* Goalkeepers:\n\t+ Alban Lafont (Nantes)\n\t+ Alexandre Olliero (Bordeaux)\n* Defenders:\n\t+ Presnel Kimpembe (Paris Saint-Germain)\n\t+ Jules Koundé (Sevilla)\n\t+ Léo Dubois (Lyon)\n* Midfielders:\n\t+ Jordan Veretout (Nantes)\n\t+ Adrien Rabiot (Juventus)\n\t+ Moussa Sissoko (Tottenham Hotspur)\n* Forwards:\n\t+ Alexandre Lacazette (Arsenal)\n\t+ Moussa Dembélé (Atlético Madrid)\n\n#### Player of the Year\n\nThe France Football magazine awards a \"Player of the Year\" award to the best French player of the year.

The storm was one of the most significant winter weather events in the region's history, causing widespread damage, disrupting transportation, and claiming hundreds of lives.\n\n**#Meteorological history**\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 was a classic example of a nor'easter, a type of winter storm that forms along the East Coast of North America. On December 18, 1944, a low-pressure system developed over the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of North Carolina. As the system moved northward, it absorbed moisture from the Atlantic and strengthened, eventually becoming a powerful nor'easter.\n\nThe storm's trajectory took it across the Mid-Atlantic region, where it intensified rapidly due to the presence of a cold front from the west. The cold air from the west collided with the warm air from the Atlantic, resulting in the formation of heavy precipitation bands. The storm's center of low pressure made landfall in the evening of December 18, bringing with it sustained winds of over 60 mph (97 km/h) and heavy snowfall.\n\n**#Overall impact**\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 had a profound impact on the region, paralyzing communities and causing widespread destruction. The storm dumped heavy snowfall across a vast area, with drifts reaching as high as 20 feet (6 meters) in some locations. The snow was so deep in some places that it took crews weeks to clear the roads and restore normalcy.\n\nThe storm's impact was felt across multiple states, with Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, and Ontario being the hardest hit. The storm disrupted transportation, stranding thousands of people and causing widespread power outages.\n\n**#Fatalities and injuries**\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 claimed an estimated 400 lives, with many more injured. The high number of fatalities was largely due to the severity of the storm and the fact that many people were caught off guard by its intensity. The storm also caused widespread economic losses, with estimates ranging from $100 million to $200 million (approximately $1.5 billion to $3 billion in today's dollars).\n\n**#Impacts on most affected areas**\n\n###**Ohio**\n\nOhio was one of the hardest hit states by the Great Snowstorm of 1944. The storm dumped up to 30 inches (76 cm) of snow in some areas, with drifts reaching as high as 20 feet (6 meters). The state's transportation network was severely disrupted, with many roads and highways closed due to the heavy snowfall.\n\nThe city of Toledo was particularly hard hit, with snow drifts reaching as high as 25 feet (7.6 meters) in some areas. The city's airport was closed for several days, stranding hundreds of travelers.\n\n###**Pennsylvania**\n\nPennsylvania was also severely affected by the storm, with heavy snowfall reported across the state. The city of Erie was hit particularly hard, with snow drifts reaching as high as 30 feet (9.1 meters). The city's airport was closed for several days, and many roads were impassable due to the heavy snowfall.\n\n###**Erie**\n\nErie, Pennsylvania, was one of the areas hardest hit by the Great Snowstorm of 1944. The city received over 30 inches (76 cm) of snow, with drifts reaching as high as 30 feet (9.1 meters). The city's airport was closed for several days, and many roads were impassable due to the heavy snowfall.\n\n###**Pittsburgh**\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was also affected by the storm, although to a lesser extent than Erie. The city received around 20 inches (51 cm) of snow, with drifts reaching as high as 10 feet (3 meters). The city's airport was closed for several hours, and many roads were snow-covered and slippery.\n\n###**West Virginia**\n\nWest Virginia was also hit by the Great Snowstorm of 1944, with heavy snowfall reported across the state. The city of Charleston received around 20 inches (51 cm) of snow, with drifts reaching as high as 10 feet (3 meters). The city's airport was closed for several days, and many roads were impassable due to the heavy snowfall.\n\n###**New York**\n\nNew York was also affected by the storm, with heavy snowfall reported across the state. The city of Rochester received around 30 inches (76 cm) of snow, with drifts reaching as high as 20 feet (6 meters). The city's airport was closed for several days, and many roads were impassable due to the heavy snowfall.\n\n###**Rochester**\n\nRochester, New York, was one of the areas hardest hit by the Great Snowstorm of 1944. The city received over 30 inches (76 cm) of snow, with drifts reaching as high as 20 feet (6 meters). The city's airport was closed for several days, and many roads were impassable due to the heavy snowfall.\n\n###**Ontario**\n\nOntario, Canada, was also affected by the storm, with heavy snowfall reported across the province. The city of Toronto received around 20 inches (51 cm) of snow, with drifts reaching as high as 10 feet (3 meters). The city's airport was closed for several days, and many roads were snowy and slippery.\n\n###**Toronto**\n\nToronto, Ontario, was one of the areas hardest hit by the Great Snowstorm of 1944. The city received around 20 inches (51 cm) of snow, with drifts reaching as high as 10 feet (3 meters). The city's airport was closed for several days, and many roads were snowy and slippery.\n\n###**Hamilton and Niagara**\n\nHamilton and Niagara, Ontario, were also affected by the storm, with heavy snowfall reported in both areas. The city of Hamilton received around 15 inches (38 cm) of snow, with drifts reaching as high as 5 feet (1.5 meters). The city of Niagara received around 20 inches (51 cm) of snow, with drifts reaching as high as 10 feet (3 meters).\n\n###**Quebec**\n\nQuebec was also affected by the storm, with heavy snowfall reported across the province.

The blockade has led to a humanitarian crisis, damage to infrastructure, and concerns about genocide risk factors.\n\n**Background**\n\n### First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n\nThe first blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1989, when Azerbaijan, which had been part of the Soviet Union, began to restrict access to the region. This blockade continued until 1992, when Nagorno-Karabakh declared its independence from Azerbaijan. Since then, the blockade has continued in various forms, with Azerbaijan restricting access to the region and imposing economic and other sanctions.\n\n### Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n\nThe blockade has led to numerous threats to Nagorno-Karabakh's public utility infrastructure, including its power, water, and communication systems. The region has also faced difficulties in accessing essential supplies, including food, medicine, and fuel. These challenges have had a significant impact on the daily lives of the people living in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn recent years, the blockade has taken on a new form, with Azerbaijan claiming that environmental concerns are the reason for its actions. Azerbaijan has accused Nagorno-Karabakh of carrying out \"ecological terrorism\" through its alleged environmental policies. This has led to a series of protests and demonstrations in Azerbaijan, which have been widely reported in the media.\n\n**Blockade timeline**\n\n### 2022 events\n\nIn 2022, the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to deteriorate. Azerbaijan imposed a series of restrictions on the movement of people and goods into the region, citing concerns about the spread of COVID-19. This led to a significant increase in the cost of living in Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as a shortage of essential supplies.\n\n### 2023 events\n\nIn 2023, the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to deteriorate further. Azerbaijan imposed a complete blockade on the region, restricting access to all essential supplies and services. This led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with many people in Nagorno-Karabakh facing difficulties in accessing food, water, and medicine.\n\n**Humanitarian crisis**\n\n### Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n\nThe blockade has led to a significant lack of access to essential supplies and medical care in Nagorno-Karabakh. The region has faced difficulties in accessing food, water, and fuel, as well as medical supplies and equipment. This has had a significant impact on the daily lives of the people living in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n### Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n\nDespite the efforts of the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers to transport essential supplies into Nagorno-Karabakh, the situation remains critical. The limited supplies that are transported into the region are often insufficient to meet the needs of the people living there.\n\n**Damage to infrastructure**\n\nThe blockade has also led to significant damage to Nagorno-Karabakh's infrastructure. The region's power and water systems have been severely affected, leading to power outages and water shortages. This has had a significant impact on the daily lives of the people living in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n**Genocide risk factors**\n\nThe blockade has led to significant concerns about genocide risk factors in Nagorno-Karabakh. The region's isolation and economic sanctions have made it difficult for people to access basic necessities, leading to a significant risk of starvation and dehydration.\n\n**Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers**\n\nDespite the presence of Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh, they have failed to take action to address the humanitarian crisis. The peacekeepers have been criticized for their inaction, and many have called for them to take a more active role in protecting the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n**Proposed solutions**\n\nThere are several proposed solutions to the blockade, including the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to Nagorno-Karabakh and the provision of economic assistance to the region. However, these solutions have yet to be implemented, and the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh remains critical.\n\n**Authenticity of the environmental activism claims**\n\nThere are concerns about the authenticity of the environmental activism claims made by Azerbaijan. Many have accused the Azerbaijani government of using environmental concerns as a pretext for its blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh. This has led to a series of investigations and scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns.\n\n### Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n\nThe Azerbaijani government has been accused of being involved in the environmental activism claims made against Nagorno-Karabakh. Many have accused the government of using its resources to promote the protests and demonstrations against Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n### Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n\nThere are concerns about the involvement of state employees and civil servants in the environmental activism claims made against Nagorno-Karabakh. Many have accused these individuals of using their positions to promote the protests and demonstrations against Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n### Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n\nThe blockade has made it difficult for the public and independent journalists to access Nagorno-Karabakh. This has led to a lack of information about the situation in the region and has made it difficult for people to understand the humanitarian crisis.\n\n### Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n\nThere has been scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns. Many have accused the protesters of being paid by the Azerbaijani government to promote the protests and demonstrations against Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n**Lawsuits**\n\n### International Court of Justice\n\nThere have been several lawsuits filed against Azerbaijan at the International Court of Justice. These lawsuits have accused Azerbaijan of violating international law by imposing a blockade on Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n### European Court of Human Rights\n\nThere have also been several lawsuits filed against Azerbaijan at the European Court of Human Rights. These lawsuits have accused Azerbaijan of violating the human rights of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Involved parties\n\nThe blockade has been widely condemned by the involved parties, including the government of Armenia, the Russian Federation, and the United Nations. The parties have called for the blockade to be lifted and for the humanitarian crisis to be addressed.\n\n### International\n\nThe blockade has been widely condemned by the international community, including the European Union, the United States, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The international community has called for the blockade to be lifted and for the humanitarian crisis to be addressed.\n\n### Supranational\n\nThe blockade has also been condemned by supranational organizations, including the Council of Europe and the Organization for Democracy and Economic Development. These organizations have called for the blockade to be lifted and for the humanitarian crisis to be addressed.\n\n### Non-governmental organizations\n\nThe blockade has been widely condemned by non-governmental organizations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. These organizations have called for the blockade to be lifted and for the humanitarian crisis to be addressed.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\n* Azerbaijan–Armenia relations\n* Russian peacekeeping in Nagorno-Karabakh\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the views of the authors or the organizations mentioned.\n* The article is intended for informational purposes only and may not be used for commercial purposes.\n\n**References**\n\n* Works cited:\n\t+ \"Azerbaijan Imposes Blockade on Nagorno-Karabakh\".

It is well adapted to its Arctic habitat, with a thick layer of fat and a white coat that helps it blend in with the snow and ice.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe polar bear's scientific name, _Ursus maritimus_, is derived from the Latin words \"ursus,\" meaning bear, and \"maritimus,\" meaning of the sea. This name reflects the bear's marine habitat and its ability to hunt and live on the sea ice. The polar bear is also known as the sea bear, ice bear, or northern light bear.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nThe polar bear belongs to the family Ursidae and is a member of the subfamily Ursinae. The bear's closest relatives are the brown bear (_Ursus arctos_) and the black bear (_Ursus americanus_). The polar bear is thought to have diverged from the brown bear around 200,000 years ago.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nThe polar bear's evolution is closely tied to the evolution of the Arctic environment. During the Pleistocene era, the Arctic was covered in ice and snow, and the bear's ancestors adapted to this environment by developing white fur and a layer of fat to keep warm. The bear's diet also changed over time, shifting from a primarily terrestrial diet to a more marine-based diet. The modern polar bear is thought to have evolved around 50,000 years ago.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe polar bear is a large and powerful animal, with adult males weighing up to 1,700 pounds (770 kg) and reaching lengths of up to 9 feet (2.7 meters). The bear's white coat is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. The bear's fur is transparent and helps to scatter sunlight and reflect heat. The bear's paws are large and flat, with a non-slip surface that helps the bear to walk on the ice. The bear's ears and nose are relatively small, which helps to reduce heat loss.\n\n**Distribution and habitat**\n\nThe polar bear is found in the Arctic Circle, with a range that includes the Arctic Ocean, Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. The bear's habitat includes the sea ice, which it uses as a platform to hunt and feed. The bear is also found on land, where it will occasionally venture to find food or shelter.\n\n**Behaviour and ecology**\n\n**Social life**\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, but they will occasionally gather in small groups. Female bears with cubs will often stay together for several years, while males will typically wander on their own. The bear's social structure is thought to be matriarchal, with older females playing a key role in the group.\n\n**Diet and hunting**\n\nThe polar bear is a carnivore, and its diet consists primarily of seals and other marine mammals. The bear will hunt using its keen sense of smell and speed, and will often stalk its prey on the ice. The bear will also scavenge for carrion, and will occasionally eat fish and other small animals.\n\n**Reproduction and development**\n\nPolar bears breed in the spring, and the female bear will give birth to 1-4 cubs after a gestation period of around 220 days. The cubs will nurse for several months, and will begin to accompany their mother on hunting trips at around 2 years old. The cubs will typically stay with their mother for several years, and will eventually leave to establish their own territories.\n\n**Mortality**\n\nThe polar bear's mortality rate is thought to be around 20-30% per year, with most deaths occurring in the first year of life. The bear's main predators are orcas and other polar bears, but humans are also a significant threat to the bear's survival.\n\n**Conservation status**\n\nThe polar bear is listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to the decline in its sea ice habitat. The bear's population is thought to be around 22,000-31,000, and is declining at a rate of around 3-5% per year. The main threats to the bear's survival are climate change and hunting.\n\n**Relationship with humans**\n\n**Exploitation**\n\nPolar bears have been hunted for their fur, oil, and meat for centuries. The bear's fur is highly valued, and is often used to make clothing and accessories. The bear's oil is also used in traditional medicine, and its meat is eaten by some Indigenous communities.\n\n**Conflicts**\n\nPolar bears and humans often come into conflict, particularly in areas where the bear's habitat is being developed. The bear may view humans as a threat, and may attack in self-defense. Humans may also view the bear as a threat, and may kill it in retaliation.\n\n**Captivity**\n\nPolar bears are often kept in captivity, either in zoos or in captivity programs. The bear's enclosure should be designed to mimic its natural habitat, and should provide the bear with adequate space to move and exercise.\n\n**Cultural significance**\n\nThe polar bear has significant cultural and spiritual importance for many Indigenous communities. The bear is often associated with strength, resilience, and survival, and is revered as a symbol of the Arctic environment. The bear's image is often used in art, literature, and other forms of cultural expression.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Arctic ecosystem\n* Climate change\n* Conservation\n* Habitat\n* Inuit\n* Marine mammal\n* Polar bear cub\n* Sea ice\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The polar bear is also known as the sea bear, ice bear, or northern light bear.\n* The bear's fur is transparent and helps to scatter sunlight and reflect heat.\n* The bear's paws are large and flat, with a non-slip surface that helps the bear to walk on the ice.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and is not referenced.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* This article is not referenced.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Polar bear at ARKive\n* Polar bear at Encyclopedia Britannica\n* Polar bear at National Geographic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Polar_bear\" following this outline:\n\n#Naming\n#Taxonomy\n##Evolution\n#Characteristics\n#Distribution and habitat\n#Behaviour and ecology\n##Social life\n##Diet and hunting\n##Reproduction and development\n##Mortality\n#Conservation status\n#Relationship with humans\n##Exploitation\n##Conflicts\n##Captivity\n##Cultural significance\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born around 480 AD, his life was marked by a rapid rise to power, a tragic downfall, and a legacy that would span centuries.\n\n**Early life**\n\nBoethius was born in Rome, Italy, to a family of high social standing. His father, Flavius Albinus, was a consul and a member of the Roman nobility. Boethius' early life is shrouded in mystery, but it is known that he received a classical education, studying philosophy, literature, and mathematics. He was particularly drawn to the works of Aristotle and Plato, which would later influence his own philosophical writings.\n\n**Rise to power**\n\nBoethius' career in the Roman Empire began under the patronage of King Theodoric the Great, who ruled the Ostrogothic Kingdom. Theodoric, a powerful and enigmatic figure, appointed Boethius as his magister officiorum, or chief of staff. This position gave Boethius immense power and influence, and he quickly rose through the ranks of the Roman administration. He became a prominent figure in Theodoric's court, known for his wisdom, intelligence, and integrity.\n\n**Downfall and death**\n\nBoethius' rise to power was short-lived. In 523 AD, he was accused of plotting against Theodoric, who had grown increasingly paranoid and tyrannical. The charges were likely fabricated, but Boethius was unable to clear his name. He was imprisoned, tortured, and eventually executed on October 23, 524 AD. The exact circumstances of his death are unclear, but it is believed that he was strangled or beheaded.\n\n**Major works**\n\nBoethius' literary output was prodigious, reflecting his diverse interests and talents. His works can be broadly categorized into several areas:\n\n### **De consolatione philosophiae**\n\nDe consolatione philosophiae, or The Consolation of Philosophy, is Boethius' most famous work. Written while he was in prison, it is a profound and lyrical exploration of the nature of evil, the meaning of life, and the role of philosophy in the face of adversity. The book is written in a poetic style, with Philosophy personified as a guide and mentor to Boethius. Through their conversations, Boethius grapples with the complexities of human existence, ultimately finding solace in the wisdom of Philosophy.\n\n### **De topicis differentiis**\n\nDe topicis differentiis, or On Topical Differences, is a treatise on logic and rhetoric. Boethius discusses the various topics and methods used in argumentation, including the use of syllogisms and the art of persuasion. This work showcases Boethius' expertise in logic and his ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems.\n\n### **De arithmetica**\n\nDe arithmetica, or On Arithmetic, is a comprehensive treatise on mathematics. Boethius discusses the fundamental principles of arithmetic, including the nature of numbers, the concept of proportion, and the use of mathematical reasoning in solving problems. This work reflects Boethius' deep understanding of mathematics and his ability to apply it to a wide range of applications.\n\n### **De institutione musica**\n\nDe institutione musica, or On the Institution of Music, is a treatise on music theory. Boethius discusses the fundamental principles of music, including the nature of sound, the concept of pitch, and the use of mathematical ratios in music composition. This work showcases Boethius' interest in the arts and his ability to apply mathematical principles to aesthetic problems.\n\n### **Opuscula sacra**\n\nOpuscula sacra, or Sacred Works, is a collection of theological writings that reflect Boethius' deep commitment to Christianity. These works include a commentary on the Book of Job, a treatise on the Trinity, and a series of sermons on various biblical topics. This collection showcases Boethius' expertise in theological matters and his ability to apply philosophical principles to spiritual concerns.\n\n**Dates of works**\n\nThe exact dates of Boethius' works are unclear, but it is believed that he wrote most of his major works between 515 and 524 AD. De consolatione philosophiae, his most famous work, is thought to have been written in 523-524 AD, shortly before his death.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBoethius' legacy is profound and far-reaching. His works had a significant impact on the development of medieval philosophy and theology, influencing thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas and Dante Alighieri. His philosophical system, which integrated Aristotelian and Platonic ideas with Christian theology, became a cornerstone of Western philosophy. Boethius' emphasis on the importance of reason, the role of philosophy in the face of adversity, and the nature of evil continues to inspire philosophers and theologians to this day.\n\n**Veneration**\n\nBoethius was venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, and his feast day is celebrated on October 23. He is often depicted in art as a philosopher, surrounded by books and symbols of wisdom. His veneration reflects his deep commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and his ability to find solace in the face of adversity.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nBoethius' legacy has influenced popular culture in various ways. His philosophical ideas have been referenced in literature, art, and music, reflecting his enduring impact on Western thought. His story has also been retold in various forms, including plays, films, and television shows, highlighting the tragic nature of his life and the profound wisdom of his works.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Aristotle\n* Plato\n* Thomas Aquinas\n* Dante Alighieri\n* Christian theology\n* Medieval philosophy\n* Logic\n* Rhetoric\n* Mathematics\n* Music theory\n* Theology\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a comprehensive review of Boethius' life and works.\n* The article is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone, reflecting the accuracy and objectivity of a Wikipedia-style entry.\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ Boethius.

The film stars Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, and Stephen Root. 2018 is a psychological horror-thriller that follows a black man who is abducted by two white people and held captive in their home, where he is forced to fight for his life.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a prologue that shows a series of historical events, including the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rodney King beating. The story then moves to the present day, where we meet our protagonist, Derrick Williams (Daniel Kaluuya), a young African American man who is on a blind date with Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). Despite an initial awkwardness, the two hit it off, and Derrick is invited to spend the night at Rose's family's secluded home.\n\nHowever, things take a dark turn when Derrick discovers that Rose's parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Cynthia (Catherine Keener), are not what they seem. It becomes clear that they are white supremacists who have a racial obsession with Derrick, and they intend to use him for their own twisted purposes.\n\nAs the night wears on, Derrick realizes that he is trapped and must use his wits to survive. He must also confront the dark secrets of Rose's family and the true nature of their twisted desires. In the end, Derrick must make a desperate bid for freedom and fight for his life against the Armitage family.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Daniel Kaluuya as Derrick Williams\n* Allison Williams as Rose Armitage\n* Bradley Whitford as Dean Armitage\n* Catherine Keener as Cynthia Armitage\n* Stephen Root as Detective Fannin\n* LaKeith Stanfield as Rodney\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nThe idea for 2018 was born out of a conversation between Jordan Peele and his writing partner, Alex Bustillo.

The idea was inspired by the real-life experiences of African Americans who have been subjected to racism and violence.\n\n#### Casting\n\nDaniel Kaluuya was cast as Derrick Williams after a lengthy audition process. Peele was impressed by Kaluuya's performance in the film \"Get Out,\" and he saw him as the perfect fit for the lead role. Allison Williams, who is white, was cast as Rose Armitage despite the fact that her character's actions are deeply racist. Williams has said that she was drawn to the complexity of Rose's character and the opportunity to play a role that was both compelling and disturbing.\n\n#### Filming\n\nFilming for 2018 took place over a period of 30 days in various locations in the United States. The film's cinematographer, Toby Oliver, used a combination of handheld camera work and static shots to create a sense of tension and unease. The film's score, composed by Michael Abels, added to the sense of foreboding and dread.\n\n**Release**\n\n#### Theatrical\n\n2018 was released in the United States on February 9, 2018. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its originality and others criticizing its pacing and plot. Despite the mixed reviews, the film was a commercial success, grossing over $40 million in its opening weekend.\n\n#### Home media\n\n2018 was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 29, 2018. The film's home media release included a number of special features, including deleted scenes and a behind-the-scenes documentary.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe score for 2018 was composed by Michael Abels, who is known for his work on a number of horror films. The score includes a combination of electronic and orchestral elements, and is designed to create a sense of tension and unease.\n\n**Reception**\n\n#### Box office\n\n2018 was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million worldwide.

It shares borders with Russia to the east, Belarus to the north, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west, Romania and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south. Ukraine has a rich history, diverse culture, and unique geography, making it a country of interest to scholars and travelers alike.\n\n**#Etymology and orthography**\n\nThe name \"Ukraine\" is derived from the Old East Slavic word \"ukrayina,\" which means \"borderland.\" The term was first used to describe the lands inhabited by Eastern Slavs, who settled along the Dnieper River and its tributaries. The modern Ukrainian alphabet is a variant of the Cyrillic script, with additional letters and diacritical marks to represent unique Ukrainian sounds and words.\n\n**#History**\n\n####Early history\n\nThe earliest known human settlements in Ukraine date back to the Paleolithic era, around 40,000 years ago. Archaeological findings indicate that the region was inhabited by various tribes, including the Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians. The ancient Greeks established trade and cultural links with the Scythians, who in turn influenced the development of the Kievan Rus' state.\n\n#####Golden Age of Kyiv\n\nThe Golden Age of Kyiv, which lasted from the 9th to the 11th centuries, was a period of significant cultural, economic, and military growth. The Kievan Rus' state, with its capital in Kyiv, was a powerful force in Eastern Europe, with strong trade and cultural ties to Byzantium and the Mediterranean region. During this period, Ukrainian literature, art, and architecture flourished, and the Rurik dynasty established a legacy that would shape Ukrainian history for centuries to come.\n\n#####Foreign domination\n\nFrom the 11th to the 14th centuries, Ukraine was subject to various foreign powers, including the Mongols, the Golden Horde, and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Mongol invasion of 1239-1240 had a devastating impact on Ukrainian society, leading to a decline in population, economy, and culture. The subsequent rule of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania brought some stability, but Ukraine remained a subjugated region, with its people subjected to foreign laws, taxes, and cultural influences.\n\n#####Cossack Hetmanate\n\nIn the 16th century, Ukraine began to assert its independence, with the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate, a self-governing military republic. The Cossacks, who were free riders and warriors, developed a unique cultural identity and a system of governance that emphasized democracy and social equality. The Cossacks fought against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russian Empire, defending their freedom and autonomy.\n\n#####19th and early 20th century\n\nIn the 19th century, Ukraine experienced a period of cultural revival, with the emergence of Ukrainian nationalism and a desire for independence from Russian rule. The Ukrainian Insurrection of 1917-1921, led by the Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky, aimed to establish an independent Ukrainian state, but ultimately failed. The subsequent Russian Civil War and the establishment of the Soviet Union led to the suppression of Ukrainian nationalism and culture.\n\n#####Inter-war period\n\nDuring the inter-war period, Ukraine was a Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities imposed a policy of Russification, suppressing Ukrainian language and culture. The famine of 1932-1933, known as the Holodomor, had a devastating impact on Ukrainian society, resulting in the deaths of millions of people. The Soviet authorities denied any responsibility for the famine, and it was only in 2006 that the Ukrainian parliament recognized the Holodomor as a genocide.\n\n#####World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukraine was a major battleground, with the Sovie", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology and orthography\n#History\n##Early history\n##Golden Age of Kyiv\n##Foreign domination\n##Cossack Hetmanate\n##19th and early 20th century\n##Inter-war period\n##World War II\n##Post–war Soviet Ukraine\n##Independence\n#Geography\n##Climate\n##Biodiversity\n##Urban areas\n#Politics\n##Constitution\n##Government\n##Courts and law enforcement\n##Foreign relations\n##Military\n##Administrative divisions\n#Economy\n##Agriculture\n##Tourism\n##Transport\n##Energy\n##Information technology\n#Demographics\n##Language\n##Diaspora\n##Religion\n##Health\n##Education\n##Regional differences\n#Culture\n##Libraries\n##Literature\n##Architecture\n##Weaving and embroidery\n##Music\n##Media\n##Sport\n##Cuisine\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Print sources\n##Reference books\n##Recent (since 1991)\n##History\n###World War II\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle lasted from August 2022 to January 2023, with the city of Soledar being a key location in the fighting.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014, had escalated into a full-scale conflict by 2022. The war had multiple fronts, including the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, where the Ukrainian military had been battling Russian-backed separatist forces since 2014. In February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which led to a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\nThe city of Soledar, located in the Donetsk Oblast, was an important strategic location due to its proximity to the city of Bakhmut, a key transportation hub in the region. The city of Soledar itself has a population of around 10,000 people and is situated in a valley surrounded by hills.\n\n# Battle\n\nThe Battle of Soledar began on 3 August 2022, as Russian forces launched a large-scale assault on the city. The initial Russian advances were made by the 1st and 2nd Army Corps, which are part of the Russian Wagner Group, a private military company that has been involved in the conflict.\n\n## Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n\nThe initial Russian advances were marked by a series of intense battles, with the Russian forces making significant gains in the area. The Ukrainian military, which had been preparing for the Russian assault, put up a strong defense, but the Russians were able to break through in several areas. The city of Soledar was under siege, with the Russians attempting to encircle the city and cut off the Ukrainian supply lines.\n\nDespite the initial successes, the Russian advances were slow and costly. The Ukrainian military was able to hold off the Russian attacks in several areas, and the fighting became increasingly intense. The Russian forces suffered significant casualties, but they were able to maintain their advances and continue to push forward.\n\n## Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n\nBy October 2022, the Russian advances had stalled, and the frontline had become static. The Ukrainian military had been able to hold off the Russian attacks, and the fighting had become a stalemate. The city of Soledar remained under siege, but the Russians were unable to make significant gains.\n\nThe stalemate continued for several months, with both sides suffering significant casualties. The fighting became increasingly intense, with both sides using heavy artillery and air support to try and gain an advantage. The city of Soledar was severely damaged, with many buildings destroyed or damaged.\n\n## Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n\nOn 27 December 2022, the Russian forces launched a major breakthrough attack on the city of Soledar, using a combination of artillery, air support, and infantry. The Ukrainian military was caught off guard, and the Russian forces were able to break through the Ukrainian defenses and capture the city.\n\nThe capture of Soledar was a significant blow to the Ukrainian military, as it gave the Russians control of a key strategic location. The city of Bakhmut, which was located nearby, was also under siege, and the Russian capture of Soledar made it easier for the Russians to attack the city.\n\nThe Russian breakthrough and capture of Soledar were facilitated by the use of advanced military technology, including drones and artillery. The Ukrainian military was unable to match the Russian advances, and the city of Soledar fell to the Russians.\n\n# Casualties and humanitarian impact\n\nThe Battle of Soledar was one of the bloodiest conflicts in the Russo-Ukrainian War, with significant casualties on both sides.\n\n## Military casualties\n\nThe exact number of military casualties is difficult to determine, but it is estimated that the Ukrainian military suffered between 10,000 to 20,000 casualties, while the Russian military suffered between 5,000 to 10,000 casualties.\n\n## Impact on civilians\n\nThe city of Soledar was severely damaged during the battle, with many buildings destroyed or damaged. The city's population was forced to flee, and many civilians were left without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter.\n\nThe humanitarian impact of the battle was significant, with many civilians left without access to basic necessities. The city of Soledar was left in ruins, and the population was forced to live in temporary shelters or with host families.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe Battle of Soledar was a significant conflict in the Russo-Ukrainian War, with significant military and humanitarian consequences. The battle was marked by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant casualties.\n\nThe Russian capture of Soledar was a significant blow to the Ukrainian military, as it gave the Russians control of a key strategic location. The city of Bakhmut, which was located nearby, was also under siege, and the Russian capture of Soledar made it easier for the Russians to attack the city.\n\nThe battle was also marked by the use of advanced military technology, including drones and artillery.

It is characterized by the use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, and is often associated with the country estates and villas of 16th-century Italy.\n\n**Palladio's Architecture**\n\nAndrea Palladio was born in Vicenza, Italy, and trained as a stonemason and architect. He is best known for his designs for the villas and country estates of the wealthy families of Italy, particularly the Venetian aristocracy. Palladio's architecture is characterized by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and a focus on symmetry and proportion.\n\nPalladio's designs were heavily influenced by the works of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and he was particularly fond of the works of Vitruvius, a Roman architect who wrote extensively on the principles of architecture. Palladio's designs were also influenced by the Renaissance humanist movement, which emphasized the importance of classical learning and the study of ancient Greek and Roman culture.\n\nSome of Palladio's most famous works include the Villa Capra at Vicenza, the Villa Rotonda at Vicenza, and the Teatro Olimpico at Vicenza. These buildings are notable for their use of classical elements and their emphasis on symmetry and proportion.\n\n**Venetian and Palladian Windows**\n\nOne of the characteristic features of Palladian architecture is the use of Venetian and Palladian windows. These windows are characterized by their use of multiple panes of glass, often arranged in a geometric pattern, and are often decorated with ornate moldings and carvings.\n\nVenetian windows are a type of window that originated in Venice, Italy, and are characterized by their use of multiple panes of glass, often arranged in a geometric pattern. Palladian windows, on the other hand, are a type of window that is specifically associated with the works of Andrea Palladio and are characterized by their use of a central window above a pair of smaller windows.\n\nVenetian and Palladian windows are often used in Palladian architecture to create a sense of light and airiness, and are often decorated with ornate moldings and carvings. These windows are a distinctive feature of Palladian architecture and are often used to create a sense of grandeur and majesty.\n\n**Early Palladianism**\n\nEarly Palladianism refers to the architectural style that emerged in the 17th century, shortly after the death of Andrea Palladio. This style was characterized by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and a focus on symmetry and proportion.\n\nThe early Palladianists were heavily influenced by the works of Palladio, and sought to create a new style of architecture that was based on the principles of the classical world. They were particularly fond of the works of Vitruvius, and sought to create buildings that were in harmony with the natural world.\n\nSome of the notable architects of the early Palladian period include Inigo Jones, who was a British architect who was heavily influenced by the works of Palladio, and who built several notable buildings in London, including the Banqueting House. Other notable architects of the early Palladian period include Christopher Wren, who built several notable buildings in London, including St. Paul's Cathedral, and Nicholas Hawksmoor, who built several notable buildings in London, including the Church of St. George.\n\n**Neo-Palladianism**\n\nNeo-Palladianism refers to the architectural style that emerged in the 18th century, and is characterized by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and a focus on symmetry and proportion. This style was heavily influenced by the works of Palladio, and sought to create a new style of architecture that was based on the principles of the classical world.\n\nThe neo-Palladianists were particularly fond of the works of Palladio, and sought to create buildings that were in harmony with the natural world. They were also influenced by the Romantic movement, which emphasized the importance of emotion and imagination in art and architecture.\n\nSome of the notable architects of the neo-Palladian period include Robert Adam, who was a British architect who was heavily influenced by the works of Palladio, and who built several notable buildings in London, including the Adelphi Buildings. Other notable architects of the neo-Palladian period include John Soane, who built several notable buildings in London, including the Bank of England, and Thomas Chaytor, who built several notable buildings in the north of England.\n\n**English Palladian Architecture**\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture refers to the architectural style that emerged in England in the 17th and 18th centuries, and is characterized by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and a focus on symmetry and proportion.\n\nThis style was heavily influenced by the works of Palladio, and sought to create a new style of architecture that was based on the principles of the classical world. The English Palladianists were particularly fond of the works of Vitruvius, and sought to create buildings that were in harmony with the natural world.\n\nSome of the notable buildings of English Palladian architecture include the Royal Crescent in Bath, the Queen Anne's Gate in London, and the Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. These buildings are notable for their use of classical elements and their emphasis on symmetry and proportion.\n\n**Irish Palladian Architecture**\n\nIrish Palladian architecture refers to the architectural style that emerged in Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries, and is characterized by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and a focus on symmetry and proportion.\n\nThis style was heavily influenced by the works of Palladio, and sought to create a new style of architecture that was based on the principles of the classical world.

The team plays in the National League South, the sixth tier of the English football league system.\n\n#History\n\nBath City Football Club was formed in 1889 and has a rich history spanning over 130 years. The club has experienced numerous highs and lows, with periods of success, decline, and revival.\n\n##Formation and Early Years (1889–1925)\n\nThe club was founded in 1889 as Bath St. Michael's Football Club, with the team playing friendly matches against local teams. In 1900, the club changed its name to Bath City F.C. and began competing in local leagues. During this period, the team played at various grounds, including the North Parade Ground and Belvoir Castle.\n\n##Large Crowds and Missing Out on Football League (1925–1958)\n\nIn the 1920s, Bath City F.C. experienced a period of success, with large crowds attending matches at their home ground, Lambridge. The team won several local cups and finished as runners-up in the Western League. However, despite their success, the club failed to gain promotion to the Football League, which led to financial difficulties and a decline in attendances.\n\n##Glory, Yoyo Years, and Nationwide Football (1958–1996)\n\nIn 1958, Bath City F.C. won the Southern League, which led to promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history. The team played in the Fourth Division (now League Two) for several seasons, with periods of success and decline. During this period, the club experienced a \"yoyo\" effect, with promotion and relegation to and from the Football League. In the 1970s, the team played in the Third Division (now League One) and gained a reputation for their exciting brand of football, with players such as Graham Atkinson and Brian Williams.\n\n##Decline and Subsequent Relegation (1996–2017)\n\nIn the 1990s, Bath City F.C. experienced a decline in fortunes, with the team being relegated from the Football League in 1996. The club played in non-league divisions for several seasons, with periods of financial difficulty and managerial instability. In 2011, the club was relegated from the Conference South to the Conference South Premier, which was renamed the Southern League Premier Division in 2014.\n\n##The Gill Era (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, the club appointed Jerry Gill as manager, who has overseen a period of resurgence for the team. Under Gill's leadership, Bath City F.C. won promotion to the National League South in 2017 and has since established themselves as a competitive team in the sixth tier of English football.\n\n#Badge\n\nThe club's badge features a blue and white shield, with a red cross on a blue background. The shield is surrounded by a white border, with the club's name written in a circular pattern above the shield.\n\n#Stadiums\n\n##1889: The North Parade Ground\n\nThe club's first home ground was the North Parade Ground, which was located in the city of Bath. The ground had a capacity of around 2,000 spectators and was used by the club from 1889 to 1900.\n\n##1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n\nIn 1900, the club moved to Belvoir Castle, which was a larger ground with a capacity of around 5,000 spectators. The ground was used by the club for 19 seasons before being sold.\n\n##1919–1932: Lambridge\n\nIn 1919, the club moved to Lambridge, which was a more modern ground with a capacity of around 10,000 spectators. The ground was used by the club for 13 seasons before being sold.\n\n##1932–present: Twerton Park\n\nIn 1932, the club moved to Twerton Park, which has been their home ground for over 80 years. The ground has a capacity of around 8,500 spectators and has undergone several renovations and expansions over the years.\n\n#Support\n\nBath City F.C. has a loyal and dedicated fan base, with supporters coming from all over the city and surrounding areas. The club's supporters' group, the Bath City Supporters' Club, was established in 2011 and has over 1,000 members.\n\n#Records\n\nThe club's record attendance is 10,000 spectators, which was set in 1936 when the team played a friendly match against Bristol City at Twerton Park.\n\n#Players\n\n##First-Team Squad\n\nThe club's first-team squad is made up of a mix of experienced and young players, with a total of 25 players currently contracted to the club.\n\n##Former Players\n\nThe club has a long list of former players who have gone on to play for other teams at a higher level, including Graham Atkinson, who played for Bristol City and Plymouth Argyle, and Brian Williams, who played for Bristol City and Swindon Town.\n\n##Player Records\n\nThe club's record appearance holder is Billy Jones, who made over 400 appearances for the team between 1950 and 1965. The club's top scorer is Tommy Langley, who scored over 150 goals for the team between 1955 and 1965.\n\n#Management\n\n##Coaching\n\nThe club's coaching staff is made up of experienced coaches who have worked with the team for several seasons. The team's head coach is Jerry Gill, who has been in charge since 2017.\n\n##Board of Directors\n\nThe club's board of directors is made up of a mix of experienced businesspeople and football officials, who oversee the club's finances and make key decisions about the team's management.\n\n##Managerial History\n\nThe club has had several managers throughout its history, including George Gould, who managed the team from 1950 to 1958, and John Phillips, who managed the team from 1980 to 1982.\n\n#Honours\n\nThe club has won several honours throughout its history, including the Southern League in 1958 and the Western League in 1925.\n\n#References\n\n##General\n\n* Bath City F.C. official website\n* Bath City Supporters' Club official website\n\n##Specific\n\n* Bath City F.C. history\n* Bath City F.C. statistics\n* Bath City F.C. squad\n\n#External links\n\n##Independent websites\n\n* Non-League Football Matter official website\n* Football Club History Database official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bath_City_F.C.\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n##Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n##Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n##Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)\n##The Gill Era (2017–present)\n#Badge\n#Stadiums\n##1889: The North Parade Ground\n##1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n##1919–1932: Lambridge\n##1932–present: Twerton Park\n#Support\n#Records\n#Players\n##First-team squad\n##Former players\n##Player records\n#Management\n##Coaching\n##Board of directors\n##Managerial history\n#Honours\n#References\n##General\n##Specific\n#External links\n##Independent websites\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was the eldest son of King Paul and Queen Frederika of Greece and a member of the House of Glücksburg.\n\n**Early life**\n\n### World War II and the exile of the royal family\n\nConstantine II was born on June 2, 1940, in Psychiko, Athens, Greece. His early life was marked by the turmoil of World War II, during which Greece was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany. In 1941, the royal family was forced into exile, and Constantine's father, King George II, was succeeded by his brother, King Paul, as the Regent of Greece.\n\n### After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the war, the royal family returned to Greece in 1946. Constantine was just six years old at the time, but he quickly became aware of his royal duties and responsibilities. He was educated at the Palace by a team of tutors and was taught a range of subjects, including history, politics, and languages.\n\n**Crown Prince**\n\n### Education\n\nConstantine's education continued at the Palace, where he was taught by some of the best tutors in Greece. He was particularly drawn to the arts and sports, and he developed a passion for sailing and the Olympic Games. He was also an avid reader and developed a strong interest in history and politics.\n\n### Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine's love of sailing was instilled in him from a young age. He spent many hours on the water, learning the skills and techniques of sailing from experienced instructors. He also developed a strong interest in the Olympic Games, and he was particularly drawn to the sailing events. He was a natural sailor and competed in several Olympic Games, including the 1960 Rome Olympics and the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n**Reign**\n\n### Accession and marriage\n\nConstantine's father, King Paul, died on March 6, 1964, and Constantine succeeded him as King of Greece at the age of 23. He was crowned on March 18, 1964, in a ceremony at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. On September 18, 1964, Constantine married Anne-Marie of Denmark, the daughter of King Frederick IX of Denmark and Queen Ingrid.\n\n### Apostasia of 1965\n\nIn 1965, Constantine faced his first major challenge as King when a group of military officers attempted a coup against him. The Apostasia of 1965, as it came to be known, was a failed attempt to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic in Greece. Constantine and his government were able to put down the rebellion, but the incident highlighted the fragility of the monarchy and the need for reform.\n\n### Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nIn 1967, a group of military officers, led by Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos, seized power in a coup and established a dictatorship in Greece. Constantine was forced into exile, and the monarchy was abolished. The dictatorship lasted for seven years, during which time Greece was isolated from the international community and the economy suffered greatly.\n\n### Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n\nIn December 1967, Constantine and a group of loyalist military officers attempted a countercoup against the dictatorship. The attempt failed, and Constantine was forced to flee Greece. He spent the next seven years in exile, during which time he worked tirelessly to restore the monarchy and democracy to Greece.\n\n**Restoration of democracy and the referendum**\n\nIn 1974, the dictatorship was overthrown, and democracy was restored to Greece. Constantine was invited to return to Greece, and he was reinstated as King. However, the restoration of the monarchy was short-lived, as a referendum was held in December 1974, in which the majority of Greek citizens voted to abolish the monarchy and establish a republic.\n\n**Life in exile after 1974**\n\n### Abortive conspiracies\n\nAfter the abolition of the monarchy, Constantine remained in Greece, but he was forced to live in exile. He was involved in several abortive conspiracies to restore the monarchy, but these attempts were unsuccessful.\n\n### 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine visited Greece for the first time since the abolition of the monarchy. His visit was seen as a gesture of goodwill and reconciliation, and it marked a new chapter in his relationship with Greece.\n\n### Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n\nConstantine has been involved in several legal disputes over the royal properties, including the Palace and the royal estates. These disputes have been ongoing for many years and have caused tension between Constantine and the Greek government.\n\n**Later life**\n\n### Death\n\nConstantine died on January 10, 2023, at the age of 82, at his home in Athens.\n\n**Issue**\n\nConstantine and his wife, Anne-Marie, had three children: Crown Prince Pavlos, Crown Prince Nikolaos, and Princess Theodora.\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nConstantine's ancestry can be traced back to the House of Glücksburg, which was a Danish royal house. His father, King Paul, was the son of King Constantine I of Greece and Queen Sophia of Prussia.\n\n**Titles, styles and honours**\n\n### Titles and styles\n\n* His Majesty King Constantine II of Greece (1964-1973)\n* His Majesty King Constantine II (1973-present)\n\n### National honours\n\n* Grand Master of the Order of the Redeemer\n* Grand Master of the Order of Saints George and Constantine\n* Grand Master of the Order of the Savior\n\n### Foreign honours\n\n* Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the White Rose of Finland\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Greece\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion and the Sun\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Oak Crown\n* Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Golden Spur\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Holy Trinity\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Holy Spirit\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Norwegian Lion\n\n**Awards**\n\n* Olympic Gold Medal (1960)\n* Olympic Bronze Medal (1964)\n\n**See also**\n\n* House of Glücksburg\n* List of monarchs of Greece\n* Greek monarchy\n* Greek royal family\n\n**References**\n\n* (no citations)\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* (no bibliography)\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* (no further reading)\n\n**External links**\n\n* (no external links)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Constantine_II_of_Greece\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##World War II and the exile of the royal family\n##After World War II and return to Greece\n#Crown Prince\n##Education\n##Sailing and the Olympic Games\n#Reign\n##Accession and marriage\n##Apostasia of 1965\n##Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n##Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n#Restoration of democracy and the referendum\n#Life in exile after 1974\n##Abortive conspiracies\n##1993 visit to Greece\n##Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n#Later life\n##Death\n#Issue\n#Ancestry\n#Titles, styles and honours\n##Titles and styles\n##National honours\n##Foreign honours\n###Awards\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

In animals, hunting success varies greatly between species, with some having high success rates and others struggling to catch and kill their prey. In humans, hunting success is also influenced by various factors, including the type of prey, hunting method, and environmental conditions.\n\n#Definition\n\nHunting success can be defined as the percentage of attempts made to catch and kill prey that result in a successful kill. This can be measured in various ways, including the number of kills per hour, day, or year, or as a percentage of total attempts made. In animals, hunting success is often related to factors such as prey density, predator-prey ratio, and environmental conditions.\n\n#Hunting success in animals\n\nHunting success varies greatly between animal species, with some having high success rates and others struggling to catch and kill their prey. Some of the animals with the highest hunting success rates include:\n\n##List of animals by hunting success rate\n\n* Lion: up to 50% success rate\n* Leopard: up to 30% success rate\n* Cheetah: up to 20% success rate\n* Hyena: up to 15% success rate\n* Snake: up to 10% success rate\n\nOn the other hand, animals such as the beaver, which is primarily a herbivore, has a hunting success rate of less than 1%.\n\n##Reasons for high hunting success\n\nThere are several reasons why some animals have high hunting success rates. These include:\n\n* Evolutionary adaptations: Many predators have evolved specific adaptations, such as sharp claws, strong jaws, or stealthy movement, that help them to catch and kill their prey.\n* Prey density: Animals that live in areas with high prey density, such as savannas or grasslands, are more likely to have high hunting success rates.\n* Predator-prey ratio: Animals that have a high predator-prey ratio, meaning there are many predators compared to prey, are more likely to have high hunting success rates.\n\n#Kill rates\n\nKill rates refer to the number of kills made by an animal or human hunter per unit of time. Kill rates can be influenced by various factors, including the type of prey, hunting method, and environmental conditions.\n\n##Factors influencing kill rates\n\n* Selective feeding: Some predators, such as lions and leopards, are selective feeders, meaning they choose to hunt specific prey based on factors such as size, age, and sex.\n* Social and solitary predators: Social predators, such as wolves and lions, often have higher kill rates than solitary predators, such as cheetahs and leopards.\n* Hunting methods: The use of specific hunting methods, such as stalking or ambush, can affect kill rates.\n* Environmental influences: Environmental factors, such as weather, vegetation, and terrain, can influence kill rates.\n\n##Selective feeding\n\nSelective feeding is a strategy used by some predators to choose specific prey based on factors such as size, age, and sex. This can be influenced by various factors, including:\n\n* Nutritional needs: Predators may choose to hunt prey that provides them with the necessary nutrients to survive.\n* Energy efficiency: Predators may choose to hunt prey that is easy to catch and kill, such as weak or injured animals.\n* Social factors: Some predators, such as lions and wolves, may choose to hunt specific prey based on social factors, such as dominance or pack dynamics.\n\n##Social and solitary predators\n\nSocial predators, such as wolves and lions, often have higher kill rates than solitary predators, such as cheetahs and leopards. This is due to several factors, including:\n\n* Cooperative hunting: Social predators often hunt in groups, which allows them to catch and kill prey more efficiently.\n* Shared knowledge: Social predators often share knowledge about prey behavior and habitat, which can improve their hunting success.\n* Reduced risk: Social predators often have a reduced risk of injury or death when hunting in groups.\n\n##Hunting methods\n\nThe use of specific hunting methods, such as stalking or ambush, can affect kill rates. For example:\n\n* Stalking: Stalking involves following prey over a long distance, often using stealthy movement and camouflage. This can be an effective method for catching and killing prey, especially in areas with dense vegetation.\n* Ambush: Ambush involves setting up a trap or ambush site, often using natural cover such as rocks or trees. This can be an effective method for catching and killing prey, especially in areas with limited vegetation.\n\n##Environmental influences\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as weather, vegetation, and terrain, can influence kill rates. For example:\n\n* Weather: Weather conditions, such as rain or snow, can affect the ability of predators to hunt and catch prey.\n* Vegetation: Vegetation, such as thick forests or dense grasslands, can affect the ability of predators to move and hunt.\n* Terrain: Terrain, such as rocky outcrops or steep slopes, can affect the ability of predators to hunt and catch prey.\n\n##Vegetative cover\n\nVegetative cover, such as trees or bushes, can affect kill rates. For example:\n\n* Dense vegetation: Dense vegetation, such as thick forests or dense grasslands, can reduce the ability of predators to move and hunt.\n* Thin vegetation: Thin vegetation, such as open grasslands or savannas, can increase the ability of predators to move and hunt.\n\n#In human hunters\n\nHunting success in humans is influenced by various factors, including the type of prey, hunting method, and environmental conditions.\n\n##Hunting success in humans\n\nHunting success in humans varies depending on the type of prey and the hunting method used. For example:\n\n* Big game hunting: Big game hunting, such as hunting large mammals, can be challenging and requires a high level of skill and experience.\n* Small game hunting: Small game hunting, such as hunting small mammals or birds, can be easier and requires less skill and experience.\n\n##Factors influencing success of human hunters\n\nFactors that influence the success of human hunters include:\n\n* Skill and experience: Hunters who have a high level of skill and experience are more likely to have higher hunting success rates.\n* Equipment and technology: Hunters who use high-quality equipment and technology, such as binoculars and GPS devices, are more likely to have higher hunting success rates.\n* Environmental conditions: Environmental conditions, such as weather and terrain, can affect the ability of hunters to hunt and catch prey.\n\n##Hunting types and methods\n\nThere are various types of hunting and methods used by humans, including:\n\n* Archery hunting: Archery hunting involves using a bow and arrow to hunt and catch prey.\n* Rifle hunting: Rifle hunting involves using a rifle to hunt and catch prey.\n* Bow hunting: Bow hunting involves using a bow and arrow to hunt and catch prey.\n\n##Impact\n\nHunting has a significant impact on ecosystems and human societies. For example:\n\n* Population control: Hunting can help to control population sizes of certain species, which can prevent overgrazing and maintain ecosystem balance.\n* Food source: Hunting provides a source of food for humans and can help to maintain food security.\n* Economic benefits: Hunting can provide economic benefits, such as revenue from tourism and trade.\n\n#See also\n\n* Predation\n* Prey\n* Predator-prey ratio\n* Hunting methods\n* Environmental influences on hunting success\n* Human hunting behavior\n* Wildlife management\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hunting_success\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition\n#Hunting success in animals\n##List of animals by hunting success rate\n##Reasons for high hunting success\n#Kill rates\n#Factors influencing success\n##Selective feeding\n##Social and solitary predators\n##Hunting methods\n##Environmental influences\n##Vegetative cover\n#In human hunters\n##Hunting success in humans\n##Factors influencing success of human hunters\n##Hunting types and methods\n##Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The committee was led by David Young, a veteran writer and producer who had experience negotiating contracts for the WGA.\n\n**Productions impacted**\n\nThe strike had a significant impact on the film and television industry, with many productions being delayed or cancelled.

However, the effort was met with resistance from writers and other industry professionals, who saw the strikebreaking efforts as an attack on their rights and working conditions.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   **Writers Guild of America**\n*   **Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers**\n*   **Labor disputes**\n*   **Film and television industry**\n*   **Strike action**\n\n**Notes**\n\n*   The WGA strike was a significant event in the film and television industry, highlighting the need for better working conditions and compensation for writers.\n*   The strike received widespread support from actors, elected officials, and other unions, demonstrating the power of collective action in the industry.\n*   The AMPTP's strikebreaking efforts were met with resistance from writers and other industry professionals, who saw the efforts as an attack on their rights and working conditions.\n\n**References**\n\n*   No references are provided for this article.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike\" following this outline:\n\n#Issues in the strike\n#Timeline of negotiations and strike activity\n##April 2023\n##May 2023\n##June 2023\n##July 2023\n##August 2023\n##September 2023\n##October 2023\n#WGA negotiating committee\n#Productions impacted\n#Response\n##Actors during the WGA strike\n##Elected officials\n##Other unions\n###Foreign unions\n##Film and television executives\n##Strikebreaking efforts\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over six decades, Crosby has established himself as one of the most influential and innovative musicians of his generation.\n\nCrosby's distinctive voice, guitar playing, and songwriting style have made him a beloved figure in American music. He has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with both the Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and has won numerous awards for his work.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nDavid Van Cortlandt Crosby was born on August 14, 1941, in Los Angeles, California, to Alvin and Audrey Crosby. His parents divorced when he was a young child, and he was raised by his mother, who was a concert pianist and music teacher. Crosby's early exposure to music, particularly classical and folk, had a significant influence on his later musical style.\n\nCrosby's family moved to Philadelphia, where he attended Central High School. He began playing the guitar at the age of 14 and formed his first band, the Roosters, with his friends. After graduating from high school, Crosby attended Los Angeles City College, where he studied drama and music.\n\n**Musical Career**\n\nCrosby's professional music career began in the early 1960s, when he joined the folk rock group the Byrds. The band's unique blend of folk, rock, and psychedelia quickly gained them a large following, and they released several successful albums, including _Mr. Tambourine Man_ (1965) and _Turn! Turn! Turn!_ (1965).\n\n**The Byrds**\n\nThe Byrds were formed in 1964 by Crosby, Gene Clark, Michael McGuinn, and Chris Hillman. The band's music was heavily influenced by folk rock, psychedelia, and British Invasion bands. They released several successful singles, including \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" \"Turn! Turn! Turn!,\" and \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star.\"\n\nCrosby's songwriting contributions to the Byrds were significant, and he wrote or co-wrote several of the band's most popular songs, including \"Why Not Me\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'.\" The Byrds disbanded in 1973, but Crosby's association with the band continued to influence his later work.\n\n**Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young**\n\nIn 1968, Crosby joined forces with Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young to form the supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash (and sometimes Young). The band's music was a fusion of folk rock, rock, and psychedelia, and they released several successful albums, including _Crosby, Stills & Nash_ (1969) and _Déjà Vu_ (1970).\n\nThe band's most famous song, \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,\" was written by Stills and is considered one of the greatest songs of all time. Crosby's songwriting contributions to the band were also significant, and he wrote or co-wrote several of the band's most popular songs, including \"Guinnevere\" and \"Wooden Ships.\"\n\n**1971–2022: Solo Career and Crosby & Nash**\n\nAfter the breakup of Crosby, Stills & Nash, Crosby embarked on a successful solo career, releasing several albums, including _If I Could Only Remember My Name_ (1971) and _Sky Trails_ (2017). He also formed the duo Crosby & Nash with Graham Nash, releasing several albums, including _Crosby & Nash_ (1972) and _Whistledown Wind_ (1976).\n\nCrosby's solo work was marked by his experimental approach to music, incorporating elements of psychedelia, rock, and folk. He released several critically acclaimed albums, including _Lighthouse_ (1974) and _It's Not True_ (1976). Crosby's songwriting style continued to evolve, and he explored themes of spirituality, social justice, and personal relationships.\n\n**1996–2004: CPR**\n\nIn the late 1990s, Crosby formed the band CPR with Stephen Stills and James Raymond (Crosby's son). The band released several albums, including _CPR_ (1998) and _Safe Voyage_ (2000). CPR's music was a fusion of rock, folk, and psychedelia, and they toured extensively throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nCrosby has been married twice, first to Camilla Hagen from 1967 to 1971, and then to Jan Dance from 1972 to 1977. He has three children, James Raymond, Melissa Myers, and Cassandra Crosby. Crosby was adopted by his stepfather, Alvin Feldman, in 1952.\n\n**Family**\n\nCrosby's family has been a significant influence on his music. His mother, Audrey, was a concert pianist and music teacher, and his father, Alvin, was a musician and music publisher. Crosby's stepfather, Alvin Feldman, was a musician and music publisher who helped to shape his early musical style.\n\n**Cannabis Brand**\n\nIn 2012, Crosby launched his own cannabis brand, \"Crosby, Stills & Nash,\" in partnership with the cannabis company, Dixie Brands. The brand offers a range of cannabis products, including cannabis-infused beverages and edibles.\n\n**Sailing**\n\nCrosby is an avid sailor and has spent many years sailing in the Pacific Ocean. He has written several songs about sailing, including \"Wooden Ships\" and \"They Are All on Their Way.\"\n\n**Politics**\n\nCrosby has been an outspoken advocate for social justice and environmental causes throughout his career. He has been a vocal critic of the Vietnam War and has supported several progressive causes, including the anti-war movement and the civil rights movement.\n\n**Acting Career**\n\nCrosby has made several appearances on television and film, including a role in the 1970 film _All This and World War II_. He has also appeared in several documentaries, including _The Byrds: The Authorized History_ (2017) and _David Crosby: Remember My Name_ (2019).\n\n**Drugs, Alcohol, and Arrests**\n\nCrosby has struggled with addiction throughout his career, particularly with heroin and cocaine. He has been arrested several times for possession and use of narcotics, including a 1982 arrest in Hawaii for possession of cocaine and heroin.\n\n**Health Issues and Death**\n\nCrosby suffered a series of health issues in the 2010s, including a heart attack in 2013 and a liver transplant in 2019. He died on January 18, 2023, at the age of 81, due to complications from a heart attack.\n\n**Discography**\n\n**Les Baxter's Balladeers**\n\n* _Les Baxter's Balladeers_ (1964)\n\n**Studio Albums**\n\n* _If I Could Only Remember My Name_ (1971)\n* _Crosby & Nash_ (1972)\n* _Sky Trails_ (2017)\n* _Here If You Listen_ (2020)\n\n**Other Solo Albums**\n\n* _Lighthouse_ (1974)\n* _It's Not True_ (1976)\n* _Graham Nash/David Crosby_ (1972)\n* _Long Ago_ (1972)\n* _Whistledown Wind_ (1976)\n* _Crosby & Nash: Live_ (1977)\n* _Thousand Roads_ (1993)\n* _CPR_ (1998)\n* _Safe Voyage_ (2000)\n\n**Singles**\n\n* \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" (1965)\n* \"Turn!

Born on October 20, 1962, in St. Louis, Missouri, Hall has had a storied career spanning over three decades, marked by numerous championships and rivalries.\n\n**Early life**\n\nScott Hall was born Scott Oliver Hall to a working-class family. His early life was marked by hardship, with his parents divorcing when he was young. Hall's father struggled with addiction, and his mother worked multiple jobs to make ends meet. Despite these challenges, Hall found solace in sports, particularly football and wrestling, which he began competing in at a young age.\n\n**Professional wrestling career**\n\n### Early career (1984–1985)\n\nHall's professional wrestling career began in 1984, when he signed with the American Wrestling Association (AWA). Initially competing under the ring name \"Bam Bam Bigelow,\" Hall quickly gained a reputation for his size and strength. He formed a tag team with another wrestler, known as \"Big Bubba,\" and the two became a dominant force in the AWA.\n\n### American Wrestling Association (1985–1989)\n\nIn 1985, Hall won his first major title, the AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship. He held the title for several months, defending it against top AWA talent. Hall's success in the AWA led to him being signed by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), which would become a pivotal moment in his career.\n\n### World Wrestling Federation Tryouts (1987, 1990)\n\nIn 1987, Hall attended WWF tryouts, but was not signed at the time. He would return to the WWF in 1990, but again was not offered a contract. Hall's patience and persistence eventually paid off, as he would eventually sign with the WWF in 1992.\n\n### World Championship Wrestling (1989)\n\nIn 1989, Hall left the AWA and signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He competed in the WCW World Heavyweight Championship tournament, but fell short of winning the title. Hall's time in WCW was marked by a series of losses to top talent, including Ric Flair and Sting.\n\n### International promotions (1990–1991)\n\nIn 1990, Hall traveled to Japan, competing for the All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) promotion. He formed a tag team with another wrestler, known as \"The Bruiser Brody,\" and the two became a dominant force in AJPW. Hall's time in Japan marked a turning point in his career, as he began to develop a more mature and respected persona.\n\n### Return to WCW (1991–1992)\n\nIn 1991, Hall returned to WCW, competing in the WCW World Heavyweight Championship tournament. He fell short of winning the title, but began to build momentum as a mid-card talent. Hall's time in WCW was marked by a series of feuds with top talent, including Ric Flair and Sting.\n\n### World Wrestling Federation (1992–1996)\n\n#### Debut and various feuds (1992–1993)\n\nIn 1992, Hall signed with the WWF, competing under the ring name \"Razor Ramon.\" He quickly became a fan favorite, known for his charismatic personality and high-flying moves.

The film was initially titled \"Buzz Lightyear: Space Ranger\" and was intended to be a more serious take on the character.\n\nHowever, as the project progressed, the filmmakers realized that they wanted to create a more mature and complex story that would appeal to a wider audience. They decided to retitle the film \"Lightyear\" and focus on the character's origin story.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Lightyear took several months, with Chris Evans being the first actor to be announced as part of the voice cast. The film's director, Angus MacLane, had been a fan of Evans' work and had been impressed by his ability to convey emotion through his voice.\n\nThe rest of the voice cast was assembled over the next several months, with actors such as Keke Palmer and Uzo Aduba being brought on board to play key roles in the film.\n\n### Animation and design\n\nThe animation and design of Lightyear were created by a team of artists and technicians at Pixar Animation Studios. The film's visual style was inspired by classic science fiction films such as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"Alien.\"\n\nThe character of Buzz Lightyear was designed to be a more complex and nuanced character than his previous incarnations. He was given a more realistic appearance, with a more detailed and textured design.\n\nThe film's animation was created using a combination of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation techniques. The animation team used a variety of software tools, including Pixar's proprietary animation software, to create the film's intricate and detailed environments and characters.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for Lightyear was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had previously worked with Pixar on films such as \"Up\" and \"Inside Out.\" The film's score was designed to be a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on creating a sense of tension and suspense.\n\nThe film's soundtrack features a mix of original compositions and classic sci-fi sound effects, with a focus on creating a sense of wonder and excitement.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for Lightyear was a major undertaking, with the film's trailer being released several months in advance of the film's release. The trailer was designed to create a sense of excitement and anticipation, with a focus on highlighting the film's action-packed sequences and sci-fi elements.\n\nThe film's promotional materials, including posters and merchandise, were designed to create a sense of nostalgia and familiarity, with a focus on highlighting the character of Buzz Lightyear.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nLightyear was released in theaters on June 17, 2022, in the United States and Canada. The film was released in a variety of formats, including 2D, 3D, and IMAX.\n\nThe film's opening weekend was a major success, with the film grossing over $60 million in the United States and Canada. The film's worldwide box office gross was over $300 million.\n\n### Ban and censorship\n\nIn several countries, including China and Russia, the film was banned or censored due to its depiction of space exploration and science fiction elements.\n\nIn China, the film was banned due to its depiction of a communist government on a distant planet, which was seen as a threat to the country's authoritarian regime.\n\nIn Russia, the film was censored due to its depiction of a character who was seen as a symbol of Western values and ideals.\n\n### Home media\n\nLightyear was released on home media on September 13, 2022, in a variety of formats, including Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download.\n\nThe film's home media release included a number of special features, including behind-the-scenes footage and deleted scenes.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Streaming viewership\n\nLightyear was a major success on streaming platforms, with the film being viewed by over 100 million users on Disney+ in the first week of its release.\n\nThe film's streaming viewership was a major factor in its success, with the film being one of the most-watched films on Disney+ in the first half of 2022.\n\n### Box office\n\nThe box office performance of Lightyear was a major success, with the film grossing over $300 million worldwide.\n\nThe film's worldwide box office gross was a significant increase from the film's production budget, which was estimated to be around $200 million.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe critical response to Lightyear was mixed, with some critics praising the film's visuals, action sequences, and voice cast, while others criticized the film's storytelling, characters, and themes.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 62% approval rating, based on 222 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.\n\nOn Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on 45 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.\n\n### Accolades\n\nLightyear was nominated for several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film.\n\nThe film won several awards, including the Annie Award for Best Achievement in Editorial and the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Visual Effects.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Buzz Lightyear\n* Toy Story\n* Pixar Animation Studios\n* Science fiction film\n* Space exploration\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film's title, Lightyear, is a reference to the character's ability to travel at the speed of light.\n* The film's plot is inspired by the character's backstory, which was revealed in the Toy Story franchise.\n* The film's animation style is inspired by classic science fiction films, such as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"Alien.\"\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Lightyear at IMDb\n* Lightyear at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Lightyear at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lightyear_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Animation and design\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Ban and censorship\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Streaming viewership\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The plan was first established in 1966, following the death of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and has been updated several times since then to reflect the changing circumstances and requirements of the British monarchy.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe British monarchy has always been subject to strict protocols and procedures, particularly when it comes to the death of the monarch. The announcement of the monarch's death is a significant event that requires careful planning and management to ensure a smooth transition of power and to maintain public order. In the past, the announcement of a monarch's death was often delayed until it was certain that the individual had passed away, as the news of the death was sometimes not confirmed for several hours or even days.\n\nHowever, with the advent of modern technology and the increasing importance of rapid communication, it became clear that a more streamlined and efficient system was needed to manage the announcement of the monarch's death. In 1966, a committee was established to develop a plan for the management of the monarch's death, which would ensure that the news was announced quickly and effectively to the public and the media.\n\n**Plan**\n\nThe plan for Operation London Bridge is a highly detailed and structured process that involves several key individuals and organizations. The plan is designed to ensure that the news of the monarch's death is announced quickly and efficiently, while also maintaining the dignity and respect of the royal family.\n\n**Supporting operations**\n\n### Operation Unicorn\n\nOperation Unicorn is a supporting operation that is designed to manage the situation if the monarch dies abroad.

The operation is designed to ensure that the news of the monarch's death is announced quickly and efficiently, while also maintaining the security and dignity of the royal family.\n\n**Related operations**\n\n### Operation Spring Tide\n\nOperation Spring Tide is a related operation that is designed to manage the situation if the monarch dies at Balmoral Castle, the royal family's private residence in Scotland. The plan involves coordinating with the relevant authorities and officials in Scotland, as well as with the British government and security services. The operation is designed to ensure that the news of the monarch's death is announced quickly and efficiently, while also maintaining the security and dignity of the royal family.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nThe implementation of Operation London Bridge is a highly structured and coordinated process that involves several key individuals and organizations. The plan is designed to ensure that the news of the monarch's death is announced quickly and efficiently, while also maintaining the dignity and respect of the royal family.\n\nThe plan involves several key steps, including:\n\n1. Notification of the Lord Chamberlain, who is the head of the royal household and is responsible for managing the monarch's daily affairs.\n2. Notification of the Prime Minister, who is the head of government and is responsible for advising the monarch on matters of state.\n3. Notification of the Commonwealth realms, which are the countries that recognize the British monarch as their head of state.\n4. Announcement of the news to the public and the media through the official royal website and social media channels.\n\n**Corresponding plans**\n\n### Australia\n\nThe Australian government has a corresponding plan in place to manage the situation if the monarch dies. The plan involves coordinating with the relevant authorities and officials in Australia, as well as with the British government and security services. The operation is designed to ensure that the news of the monarch's death is announced quickly and efficiently, while also maintaining the security and dignity of the royal family.\n\n### Canada\n\nThe Canadian government has a corresponding plan in place to manage the situation if the monarch dies.

It is the largest city in the state and serves as the county seat of Hennepin County. As of the 2020 United States Census, the city has a population of approximately 428,296 people, making it the 46th-largest city in the United States.\n\n**History**\n\n### Dakota Homeland\n\nThe area that is now Minneapolis has been inhabited for thousands of years, with the earliest known human presence dating back to around 10,000 BCE. The region was home to the Dakota people, who called the area \"Mni Amphisi\" or \"water on both sides.\" The Dakota people were a nomadic tribe that migrated to the area from the Great Plains and lived in the region for centuries.\n\n### Industries Develop\n\nIn the early 19th century, the area that is now Minneapolis began to attract settlers, who were drawn by the area's natural resources and strategic location. The construction of the Great Northern Railway in the 1880s brought a significant influx of settlers and marked the beginning of the city's growth. The city's early industries included lumber, flour milling, and rail transportation. The city's location on the Mississippi River made it an ideal location for the development of the flour milling industry, which became a major driver of the city's economy.\n\n### Social Tensions\n\nHowever, the growth of Minneapolis was not without its challenges. The city's early development was marked by social tensions between the city's wealthy elite and its working-class residents. The city's labor movement, which emerged in the late 19th century, fought for better working conditions and higher wages for workers in the city's industries.

The city's proximity to Lake Michigan and Lake Superior also makes it prone to lake-effect snow, with the city typically receiving over 50 inches (127 cm) of snow per year.\n\n### Cityscape\n\nMinneapolis is a city of parks and green spaces, with over 22% of the city's land dedicated to parks and other public spaces. The city's famous Chain of Lakes, which includes Lake Calhoun, Lake Harriet, and Lake of the Isles, is a popular destination for outdoor recreation and offers stunning views of the city's skyline. The city's architecture is a mix of modern and historic buildings, with many of the city's oldest buildings dating back to the late 19th century.\n\n**Demographics**\n\n### Census and Estimates\n\nAs of the 2020 United States Census, the city of Minneapolis has a population of approximately 428,296 people. The city's population is diverse, with a mix of African American, Asian, Hispanic, and white residents. The city's median household income is around $61,000, with a median age of 30.4 years.\n\n### Structural Racism\n\nMinneapolis has a long history of structural racism, with the city's African American and Native American communities facing significant challenges and discrimination. The city's police department has been criticized for its treatment of people of color, with many instances of police brutality and misconduct.

The incursions began in May 2023 and continued sporadically until December of the same year.\n\n**Background**\n\nBelgorod Oblast is a federal subject of Russia located in the southwestern part of the country. The region shares a border with Ukraine, and has been the site of several military conflicts and skirmishes since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014. The region is strategically important due to its proximity to Ukraine, and has been a key area of tension between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n**First raid**\n\nThe first raid occurred on 22 May 2023, when a group of Ukrainian forces crossed into Russian territory and attacked a Russian military base in the Belgorod Oblast. The attack was reportedly carried out by a group of Ukrainian special forces, who used drones and other equipment to infiltrate the base and gather intelligence.\n\n#### 22 May\n\nThe initial attack on 22 May was reportedly carried out by a group of approximately 20 Ukrainian special forces, who crossed the border into Russian territory and made their way to the Russian military base. The Russian military was reportedly caught off guard by the attack, and was unable to respond effectively.\n\n#### 23 May\n\nThe attack on 23 May was more extensive than the previous day's raid, with a group of approximately 50 Ukrainian forces crossing the border and attacking several Russian military positions. The Russian military was able to respond more effectively to this attack, and was able to repel the Ukrainian forces.\n\n#### Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the first raid was marked by a significant increase in tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian government accused Ukraine of carrying out the attacks, and vowed to take steps to prevent future incursions. The Ukrainian government did not publicly confirm or deny involvement in the attacks, but did acknowledge that Ukrainian forces had been active in the region.\n\n**Second raid**\n\nThe second raid occurred on 1-3 June 2023, when a group of Ukrainian forces crossed into Russian territory and attacked several Russian military positions. The attack was reportedly carried out by a group of approximately 100 Ukrainian forces, who used drones and other equipment to infiltrate the positions and gather intelligence.\n\n#### 1–3 June\n\nThe initial attack on 1-3 June was reportedly carried out by a group of approximately 100 Ukrainian forces, who crossed the border into Russian territory and made their way to several Russian military positions. The Russian military was reportedly caught off guard by the attack, and was unable to respond effectively.\n\n#### 4 June – 15 June\n\nThe attack on 4 June – 15 June was more extensive than the previous days' raids, with a group of approximately 200 Ukrainian forces crossing the border and attacking several Russian military positions. The Russian military was able to respond more effectively to this attack, and was able to repel the Ukrainian forces.\n\n**Sporadic incursions (June–December 2023)**\n\nFollowing the second raid, the incursions continued sporadically until December 2023. The Russian government increased its military presence in the region, and implemented several measures to prevent future incursions. The Ukrainian government continued to acknowledge that Ukrainian forces had been active in the region, but did not provide further details.\n\n**Casualties and losses**\n\nThe exact number of casualties and losses on both sides is difficult to determine due to the conflicting reports and lack of official statements. However, it is estimated that the Russian military suffered significant losses, including several military positions and equipment. The Ukrainian forces also suffered losses, although the exact number is unknown.\n\n#### Pro-Ukrainian forces\n\nThe Ukrainian forces that carried out the incursions were reportedly made up of special forces, who used drones and other equipment to infiltrate Russian territory and gather intelligence. The exact number of Ukrainian forces involved in the incursions is unknown, but it is estimated to be in the hundreds.\n\n#### Russian government forces\n\nThe Russian military was caught off guard by the initial attacks, and was unable to respond effectively. However, following the second raid, the Russian military was able to respond more effectively, and was able to repel the Ukrainian forces. The exact number of Russian military personnel involved in the incursions is unknown.\n\n**Humanitarian impact and evacuations**\n\nThe incursions had a significant humanitarian impact on the region, with several thousand people displaced due to the conflict. The Russian government implemented several measures to evacuate residents and provide humanitarian aid.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe motivations behind the incursions are unclear, but it is believed that the Ukrainian government was seeking to gather intelligence and disrupt Russian military operations. The use of drones and other equipment suggests that the Ukrainian forces were well-prepared and well-equipped for the incursions.\n\n#### Motivation\n\nThe motivation behind the incursions is unclear, but it is believed that the Ukrainian government was seeking to gather intelligence and disrupt Russian military operations.\n\n#### Ukrainian involvement\n\nThe Ukrainian government has acknowledged that Ukrainian forces had been active in the region, but did not provide further details.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe reactions to the incursions were varied, with several governments and organizations condemning the attacks and others expressing support for Ukraine.\n\n#### Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government did not publicly confirm or deny involvement in the attacks, but did acknowledge that Ukrainian forces had been active in the region.\n\n#### Russia\n\nThe Russian government accused Ukraine of carrying out the attacks, and vowed to take steps to prevent future incursions.\n\n#### United States\n\nThe United States government condemned the attacks and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Russo-Ukrainian War\n* Belgorod Oblast\n* Ukrainian special forces\n* Russian military\n\n**Notes**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Belgorod_Oblast_incursions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#First raid\n##22 May\n##23 May\n##Aftermath\n#Second raid\n##1–3 June\n##4 June – 15 June\n#Sporadic incursions (June–December 2023)\n#Casualties and losses\n##Pro-Ukrainian forces\n##Russian government forces\n#Humanitarian impact and evacuations\n#Analysis\n##Motivation\n##Ukrainian involvement\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##United States\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The family's history dates back to the 17th century, and their business interests have spanned various industries, including textiles, iron, and finance.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Wallenberg family's history is deeply rooted in Sweden's industrialization and economic growth during the 19th and 20th centuries. The family's founder, Jacob Wallenberg (1766-1808), was a merchant who established a textile business in Stockholm. His son, Jacob Wallenberg (1796-1865), expanded the business and became a prominent figure in the Swedish textile industry.\n\nThe family's most notable period of growth and expansion occurred during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the family's patriarch, Marcus Wallenberg (1864-1943), took the reins of the family business. Under his leadership, the family's interests expanded into the iron and steel industry, and they established the company that would become Sveriges Skogshvarv AB, a leading manufacturer of forest machinery.\n\nMarcus Wallenberg was a skilled entrepreneur and politician who served as a member of the Swedish Parliament and was a key figure in the country's economic development during World War I. He was also a close advisor to the Swedish government and played a significant role in shaping the country's economic policies.\n\n**Modern Business**\n\nToday, the Wallenberg family is one of the most influential and successful business families in Sweden. The family's business interests are managed through a holding company called Investor AB, which was established in 1916. Investor AB is a publicly traded company that owns a diverse portfolio of companies in various industries, including finance, real estate, and healthcare.\n\nInvestor AB is led by a group of directors known as the Wallenberg family, who are responsible for making strategic decisions and overseeing the company's operations. The company's board of directors includes several prominent members of the Wallenberg family, including Jacob Wallenberg, Marcus Wallenberg Jr., and Peter Wallenberg.\n\nIn addition to Investor AB, the Wallenberg family has a number of other business interests, including the investment company Kungliga Hovbageriet, which is responsible for managing the royal family's investments. The family also has a significant stake in the Swedish bank SEB, which is one of the country's largest financial institutions.\n\n**Notable Family Members**\n\nThe Wallenberg family has produced a number of notable figures throughout its history, including:\n\n* Marcus Wallenberg (1864-1943): A businessman and politician who played a significant role in Sweden's economic development during World War I.\n* Jacob Wallenberg (1892-1980): A businessman and politician who served as a member of the Swedish Parliament and was a key figure in the country's economic development during the 1920s and 1930s.\n* Marcus Wallenberg Jr. (1904-1982): A businessman and politician who served as a member of the Swedish Parliament and was a key figure in the country's economic development during the 1940s and 1950s.\n* Jacob Wallenberg (1936-): A businessman and politician who has served as a member of the Swedish Parliament and has been involved in a number of business and philanthropic ventures.\n* Peter Wallenberg (1935-2015): A businessman and politician who served as a member of the Swedish Parliament and was a key figure in the country's economic development during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations, as the information is based on publicly available sources and does not require specific attribution.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Investor AB (official website)\n* Kungliga Hovbageriet (official website)\n* SEB (official website)\n* Swedish Parliament (official website)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wallenberg_family\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Modern business\n#Notable family members\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
