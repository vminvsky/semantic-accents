Born on June 21, 1982, in London, England, he is second in line to the British throne after his father, following the accession of his grandmother, Elizabeth II, in 1952.\n\n# Early Life\n\nWilliam was born at St Mary's Hospital in London, where his mother had been receiving treatment for her pregnancy. He was the first grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and was affectionately known as \"Willie\" within the Royal Family. William's early life was marked by the close relationship between his parents, who were married in 1981. The couple's marriage was considered a fairy tale romance, with the two being dubbed the \"Will and Kate\" of their time.\n\n# Education\n\nWilliam's early education took place at Eton College, a prestigious independent boarding school in Berkshire, England. He attended Eton from 1995 to 2000, where he excelled in sports, particularly polo and cricket. William's academic performance was also notable, with him achieving a grade A in geography and a grade B in history. After completing his A-levels, William took a gap year to travel and work in various capacities, including volunteering at a children's charity in Chile.\n\n# Early Appointments and Duties\n\n## Military and Air Ambulance Service\n\nIn 2008, William began his military training, starting with a six-month stint at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was commissioned as a cornet in the Blues and Royals regiment, a British Army cavalry unit, and later served in the Household Cavalry Regiment. William's military service was notable for his deployment to Afghanistan, where he served as a forward air controller with the Royal Air Force. During his time in the military, William also worked as a search and rescue pilot for the Royal Air Ambulance Service, flying emergency missions across the UK.\n\n# Personal Life\n\n## Relationship with Catherine Middleton\n\nWilliam met Catherine Middleton, a commoner and a graduate of the University of St Andrews, in 2001. The couple began a romantic relationship in 2003, and their relationship was widely reported in the media. William and Catherine's engagement was announced in November 2010, with the couple getting married in a highly publicized ceremony at Westminster Abbey in April 2011.\n\n## Marriage and Children\n\nWilliam and Catherine married on April 29, 2011, in a ceremony watched by an estimated global audience of 2.5 billion people. The couple's first child, a son named George Alexander Louis, was born on July 22, 2013. Their second child, a daughter named Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, was born on May 2, 2015. A third child, a son named Louis Arthur Charles, was born on April 23, 2018.\n\n# Duke of Cambridge\n\nIn 2011, following his marriage to Catherine, William was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus. As Duke of Cambridge, William has carried out various royal duties, including representing the Queen at events across the UK and abroad. William has also been involved in various charitable causes, including those related to conservation, mental health, and homelessness.\n\n# Prince of Wales\n\nIn September 2022, Charles, Prince of Wales, announced that he would be passing on the title of Prince of Wales to his eldest son, William. The title, which dates back to the 13th century, is traditionally given to the heir apparent, and is considered a key part of the Royal Family's heritage.\n\n# Charity Work\n\n## Humanitarian Causes\n\nWilliam has been involved in various humanitarian causes, including those related to conflict, disaster relief, and poverty alleviation. In 2010, he visited the Haiti earthquake zone, where he worked with local charities to deliver aid to affected communities. William has also been involved in efforts to combat Ebola in West Africa, and has worked with organizations such as the Red Cross and the UN to provide support to refugees and displaced persons.\n\n## Conservation\n\nWilliam has been a long-time advocate for conservation and the protection of the natural world. In 2010, he co-founded the Tusk Trust, a charity dedicated to protecting African wildlife and their habitats. William has also been involved in various conservation initiatives, including the protection of the world's oceans and the preservation of endangered species.\n\n## LGBT Rights\n\nWilliam has been a vocal supporter of LGBT rights, particularly in the UK. In 2011, he spoke out against homophobic bullying, and has since become a patron of several LGBT charities. William has also worked with organizations such as Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation to promote equality and challenge discriminatory attitudes.\n\n## Mental Health\n\nWilliam has been a long-time supporter of mental health initiatives, and has worked with organizations such as the Royal Foundation and the NHS to promote mental health awareness and support. In 2017, he launched the Heads Together initiative, which aimed to reduce stigma around mental health and provide support to those affected by mental illness.\n\n## Homelessness\n\nWilliam has been involved in efforts to combat homelessness, particularly in the UK. In 2017, he visited a homeless shelter in London, where he met with staff and residents to discuss the issue of homelessness and how it can be addressed. William has also worked with organizations such as the Centrepoint charity to provide support to young people experiencing homelessness.\n\n## Sport\n\nWilliam has been a keen sportsman throughout his life, and has represented the UK in polo, sailing, and hockey. In 2011, he competed in the Audi Polo Challenge, a charity polo match held at Windsor Great Park. William has also been involved in various charity sporting events, including the London Marathon and the Rugby World Cup.\n\n# Public Image\n\nWilliam's public image has been shaped by his royal status, his military service, and his charitable work. He has been widely praised for his dedication to duty and his commitment to helping others. However, William's public image has also been subject to scrutiny, particularly in relation to his media coverage and his personal life.\n\n# Privacy and the Media\n\nWilliam has been vocal about the importance of maintaining a private life, particularly in the face of intense media scrutiny. In 2019, he spoke out against the media's handling of his family's private matters, and has since become a vocal advocate for greater media regulation. William has also worked with organizations such as the Press Gazette to promote better media practices and protect the rights of individuals.\n\n# Titles, Styles, and Honours\n\n## Titles and Styles\n\nWilliam's titles and styles are as follows:\n\n* His Royal Highness (HRH) Prince William of Wales (1982–2022)\n* His Royal Highness (HRH) The Duke of Cambridge (2011–present)\n* Earl of Strathearn (2011–present)\n* Baron Carrickfergus (2011–present)\n* Prince of Wales (2022–present)\n\n## Honours\n\nWilliam has been awarded numerous honors, including:\n\n* Royal Victorian Order (RVO) (2009)\n* Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal (2002)\n* Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012)\n* Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal (2022)\n\n# Ancestry\n\nWilliam's ancestry is as follows:\n\n* His father: Charles, Prince of Wales\n* His mother: Diana, Princess of Wales\n* His paternal grandfather: Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh\n* His paternal grandmother: Queen Elizabeth II\n* His maternal grandfather: John Spencer, Viscount Althorp\n* His maternal grandmother: Frances Shand Kydd\n\n# Bibliography\n\n## Book Contributions\n\n* The Royal Family: A Photographic History (2011)\n* The Royal Family: A Year in the Life (2012)\n\n## Authored Letters and Articles\n\n* \"A Letter to Myself\" (2013)\n* \"A Message to Young People\" (2015)\n\n# See Also\n\n* The Royal Family of the United Kingdom\n* The British Monarchy\n* Prince Charles, Prince of Wales\n* Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge\n* Prince George of Cambridge\n* Princess Charlotte of Cambridge\n* Prince Louis of Cambridge\n\n# Footnotes\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n# References\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n# Further Reading\n\n## Books\n\n* The Royal Family: A Photographic History (2011)\n* The Royal Family: A Year in the Life (2012)\n* William and Kate: The Love Story (2011)\n* The Crown: The Official Companion (2018)\n\n## Articles\n\n* \"The Royal Family: A Photographic History\" (2011)\n* \"The Royal Family: A Year in the Life\" (2012)\n* \"William and Kate: The Love Story\" (2011)\n* \"The Crown: The Official Companion\" (2018)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"William,_Prince_of_Wales\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Education\n#Early appointments and duties\n##Military and air ambulance service\n#Personal life\n##Relationship with Catherine Middleton\n##Marriage and children\n#Duke of Cambridge\n#Prince of Wales\n#Charity work\n##Humanitarian causes\n##Conservation\n##LGBT rights\n##Mental health\n##Homelessness\n##Sport\n#Public image\n#Privacy and the media\n#Titles, styles, and honours\n##Titles and styles\n##Honours\n#Ancestry\n#Bibliography\n##Book contributions\n##Authored letters and articles\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#Further reading\n##Books\n##Articles\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The heatwaves caused significant disruptions to daily life, impacted various sectors, and led to a range of consequences.\n\n**June Heatwave**\n\nThe first heatwave of the summer occurred in June 2022. This heatwave was characterized by prolonged periods of hot weather, with temperatures often exceeding 30°C (86°F). The heatwave was particularly severe in the southern and western parts of the UK, where temperatures reached as high as 35°C (95°F) in some areas.\n\n### Impact on Resorts\n\nThe June heatwave had a significant impact on resorts in the UK. Many resorts, particularly those in coastal areas, experienced a surge in popularity as people sought to escape the heat. This led to increased demand for accommodations, food, and other services, putting a strain on local resources. However, some resorts struggled to cope with the influx of visitors, leading to complaints about overcrowding, long queues, and inadequate facilities.\n\n**July Heatwave**\n\nThe second heatwave of the summer occurred in July 2022. This heatwave was even more severe than the June heatwave, with temperatures often reaching 40°C (104°F) in some areas. The heatwave was particularly intense in the south and east of the UK, where temperatures reached as high as 42°C (108°F) in some areas.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe July heatwave had a significant impact on various sectors, including transport, retail, berry farming, seaside resorts, and utilities.\n\n#### Transport\n\nThe heatwave caused significant disruptions to the UK's transport network, with many roads and railways experiencing delays and cancellations due to the extreme heat. The heat also caused issues with public transportation, with many buses and trains experiencing mechanical failures due to the heat.\n\n#### Retail\n\nThe heatwave had a significant impact on retailers, particularly those selling summer clothing and accessories. Many retailers experienced a surge in sales as people sought to cool down and protect themselves from the sun. However, some retailers struggled to keep up with demand, leading to complaints about stock shortages and long delivery times.\n\n#### Berry Farming\n\nThe heatwave had a devastating impact on the UK's berry farming industry. Many berry farms experienced crop losses due to the extreme heat, which caused the berries to ripen too quickly and become overripe. This led to significant losses for farmers, who were left with large amounts of unsellable crop.\n\n#### Seaside Resorts\n\nThe heatwave had a significant impact on seaside resorts in the UK. Many resorts experienced a surge in popularity as people sought to escape the heat, leading to increased demand for accommodations, food, and other services.

The heatwave caused widespread damage to crops, particularly berries, and led to significant losses for farmers. The heatwave also caused issues with the transport network, leading to delays and cancellations. Additionally, the heatwave put a strain on the utilities, particularly the water and electricity supply.\n\n**August Heatwave**\n\nThe third heatwave of the summer occurred in August 2022. This heatwave was characterized by prolonged periods of hot weather, with temperatures often exceeding 30°C (86°F). The heatwave was particularly severe in the southern and western parts of the UK, where temperatures reached as high as 35°C (95°F) in some areas.\n\n### Rain\n\nThe August heatwave was followed by a period of rain, which brought some relief to areas that had experienced drought conditions during the summer. However, the rain also caused issues with flooding in some areas, particularly those that had experienced heavy rainfall.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe August heatwave had a significant impact on various sectors, including retail and gardening.\n\n#### Retail\n\nThe August heatwave had a significant impact on retailers, particularly those selling summer clothing and accessories. Many retailers experienced a surge in sales as people sought to cool down and protect themselves from the sun. However, some retailers struggled to keep up with demand, leading to complaints about stock shortages and long delivery times.\n\n#### Gardening\n\nThe August heatwave caused issues with gardening, particularly for those growing vegetables and other plants that require regular watering. Many gardeners experienced crop losses due to the extreme heat, which caused plants to become stressed and die. Additionally, the heatwave caused issues with soil moisture, leading to a range of problems for gardeners.\n\n**Drought**\n\nThe 2022 United Kingdom heatwaves were part of a larger drought that affected the country during the summer of 2022. The drought was particularly severe in the south and east of the UK, where temperatures were often above average and rainfall was below average. The drought caused significant issues for farmers, particularly those growing crops that require regular watering.\n\n**Wildfires**\n\nThe 2022 United Kingdom heatwaves also led to a range of wildfires, particularly in areas that experienced drought conditions. Many of these wildfires were caused by human activity, such as discarded cigarettes or unattended campfires. However, some wildfires were caused by natural factors, such as lightning strikes.\n\n**Meteorology**\n\nThe 2022 United Kingdom heatwaves were caused by a number of meteorological factors, including high atmospheric pressure and a high-pressure system that dominated the UK's weather during the summer. The heatwaves were also influenced by climate change, which has led to an increase in extreme weather events, including heatwaves.\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nThe 2022 United Kingdom heatwaves received widespread media coverage, with many news outlets reporting on the impact of the heatwaves on daily life, agriculture, and the environment. The heatwaves were also the subject of a range of documentaries and news programs, which examined the causes and consequences of the heatwaves.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe 2022 United Kingdom heatwaves were a significant event, with a range of consequences for daily life, agriculture, and the environment. The heatwaves were caused by a combination of meteorological and climatic factors, and were influenced by climate change.

The storm was one of the most intense hurricanes to impact Florida in recent history, causing widespread devastation and loss of life.\n\n**Meteorological history**\n\nHurricane Ian formed from a tropical wave that emerged from the coast of Africa on September 15, 2022. The wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic, slowly developing into a tropical depression on September 23. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on September 25, and was named Ian by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Ian continued to strengthen, reaching Category 1 status on September 26, and then Category 3 status on September 27. The storm reached its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane on September 28, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (257 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg). Ian began to weaken as it interacted with the Yucatán Peninsula on September 29, and made landfall in Cuba on September 30 as a Category 3 hurricane. The storm continued to weaken over Cuba and the southeastern United States, eventually dissipating over the Atlantic Ocean on October 3.\n\n**Preparations**\n\n### Caribbean\n\n#### Jamaica\n\nJamaica declared a state of emergency on September 28, as Ian was forecast to make landfall on the island.

The government also activated its disaster response plan, which included the deployment of emergency responders and the distribution of relief supplies.\n\n#### Cayman Islands\n\nThe Cayman Islands declared a hurricane warning on September 28, and ordered evacuations of several islands in the archipelago. The government also activated its emergency operations center, and deployed emergency responders to assist with preparations and evacuations.\n\n#### Cuba\n\nCuba declared a hurricane warning on September 29, and ordered evacuations of several provinces in the western part of the island. The government also activated its disaster response plan, which included the deployment of emergency responders and the distribution of relief supplies.\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nFlorida declared a state of emergency on September 28, as Ian was forecast to make landfall on the west coast of the state.

This phenomenon can be analyzed through the lens of network theory and the diffusion of innovation, providing insights into the mechanisms that facilitated this major cultural shift.\n\n**Network Theory and Diffusion of Innovation as an Approach**\n\nThe diffusion of innovation approach, developed by Everett Rogers, provides a framework for understanding how new ideas or practices spread within a population. According to Rogers, the diffusion of an innovation occurs through a process of communication among members of a social system, where the innovation is adopted over time by an increasing proportion of the population.\n\n**Innovation**\n\nIn the context of the Roman Empire, the Christian innovation was the new religion introduced by Jesus Christ and his followers. Christianity was a radical departure from traditional Roman paganism, with its emphasis on a single deity, the importance of faith, and the concept of salvation through individual belief. The Christian innovation was not just a new idea, but also a new way of life, with its own set of practices, rituals, and moral codes.\n\n**Alternative Approaches**\n\nOther approaches, such as the \"paradigm shift\" concept of Thomas Kuhn, could also be applied to the Christianization of the Roman Empire. However, the diffusion of innovation approach provides a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the mechanisms that facilitated this process.\n\n**Failure of Diffusion**\n\nThe diffusion of innovation approach also highlights the potential for failure in the diffusion process. In the case of the Roman Empire, there were several instances where the diffusion of Christianity was hindered or blocked, such as during the reign of the Emperor Diocletian, who launched a massive persecution of Christians in 303 CE.\n\n**Five Characteristics of Diffusion**\n\nRogers identified five characteristics that influence the rate and extent of innovation adoption: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability.\n\n**Relative Advantage**\n\nThe relative advantage of an innovation refers to its perceived benefits over existing practices. In the case of Christianity, the relative advantage lay in its promise of salvation, forgiveness of sins, and the prospect of a better life after death.\n\n### Alms\n\nThe early Christian church emphasized the importance of alms-giving, which helped to establish a network of support for the poor and needy. This practice was seen as a way to demonstrate one's commitment to the Christian faith and to show compassion for others.\n\n### Slavery through the Fifth Century\n\nThe Christian church's approach to slavery was complex and evolved over time. While some early Christian writers, such as Paul of Tarsus, condemned slavery as a moral evil, others saw it as a necessary institution. It wasn't until the fifth century that the church began to take a more explicit stance against slavery.\n\n### Geography and a Scale-Free Network\n\nThe geography of the Roman Empire played a significant role in the diffusion of Christianity. The Empire's extensive network of roads, trade routes, and communication systems facilitated the spread of ideas and practices. The Christian church also developed a scale-free network, with a small number of highly connected hubs (such as major cities and centers of learning) that played a disproportionate role in the diffusion of innovation.\n\n**Compatibility and Complexity**\n\nThe compatibility of an innovation refers to its degree of consistency with existing values, norms, and practices. Christianity was relatively compatible with the values of the Roman Empire, such as the importance of justice, compassion, and respect for authority. However, the complexity of the Christian faith, with its many rituals, practices, and dogmatic statements, may have presented a barrier to adoption for some individuals.\n\n**Trialability**\n\nThe trialability of an innovation refers to the degree to which it can be experimented with or tested before full adoption. In the case of Christianity, the early church emphasized the importance of personal experience and spiritual experimentation as a means of testing one's faith.\n\n### Reinvention\n\nAs the Christian faith spread throughout the Roman Empire, it underwent a process of reinvention, where local traditions and practices were incorporated into the larger Christian narrative. This process helped to make Christianity more appealing and relevant to different cultures and communities.\n\n**Observability**\n\nThe observability of an innovation refers to the degree to which its effects can be seen or demonstrated. In the case of Christianity, the observability of its effects was often dramatic, with converts reporting profound transformations in their lives and communities.\n\n### Innovators of the First Century\n\nThe first century of Christianity was marked by a small number of innovators, such as Jesus Christ, Peter, and Paul of Tarsus, who played a pivotal role in spreading the faith. These innovators were often charismatic leaders who were able to inspire and motivate others to adopt the Christian faith.\n\n### Early Adopters in the First and Second Centuries\n\nThe early adopters of Christianity were often individuals from the upper classes, such as merchants, traders, and government officials. They were attracted to the Christian faith because of its promise of salvation, its emphasis on personal morality, and its potential for social mobility.\n\n### Third Century Early Majority\n\nThe third century saw the emergence of an early majority of Christians, who were drawn to the faith because of its perceived benefits and its growing social and cultural significance. This period also saw the development of a more formalized Christian church structure, with bishops, councils, and liturgical practices.\n\n#### Sexual Morality\n\nThe Christian church's teachings on sexual morality were often at odds with the more permissive attitudes of the Roman Empire. Christianity emphasized the importance of chastity, fidelity, and monogamy, while the Empire tolerated and even encouraged adultery, prostitution, and other forms of sexual deviance.\n\n#### Persecution\n\nDespite its growing popularity, Christianity faced significant persecution throughout the Roman Empire, particularly during the reign of the Emperor Diocletian. This persecution was often brutal and widespread, with Christians being subjected to torture, imprisonment, and execution.\n\n**Constantine as Opinion Leader**\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine to Christianity in the early fourth century marked a significant turning point in the history of the faith. Constantine's support for Christianity helped to legitimize the faith and pave the way for its eventual adoption as the official state religion of the Empire.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire was a gradual and complex process that involved the diffusion of innovation, the adoption of new ideas and practices, and the transformation of existing social and cultural norms.

With a career spanning over seven decades, Bennett has released numerous albums, collaborated with multiple artists, and won numerous awards for his contributions to music.\n\n**Early life**\n\n### 1926–1943: Family and education\n\nAnthony Dominick Benedetto was born on August 3, 1926, in Long Island City, Queens, New York, to Italian-American parents Giuseppe and Anna Benedetto. His father was a grocer, and his mother was a seamstress. Bennett was the second of two children, and his family lived in a small apartment in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens. Bennett's early life was marked by poverty and a strained relationship with his father, who was often absent and physically abusive.\n\nBennett's mother encouraged his love of music from an early age, and he began taking singing lessons at the age of 10. He attended the local St. Cecilia's High School, where he was a member of the school choir and developed his vocal skills. After completing high school, Bennett attended the American Theatre Wing, where he studied at the Dramatic Workshop under the guidance of Erwin Piscator.\n\n### 1944–1950: World War II and after\n\nDuring World War II, Bennett enlisted in the United States Army and served in the 255th Engineer Combat Battalion in the European Theater.

He began performing in nightclubs and bars, singing for tips and developing his stage presence. In 1946, he made his first recording, \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\" which was released on the Columbia Records label.

From the earliest Aboriginal inhabitants to the present day, the city has undergone significant transformations, shaped by the interactions of its indigenous people, European settlers, and immigrants from around the world.\n\nPre-Colonial\n\nThe First Fleet, carrying over 1,500 people, arrived in Sydney Cove on January 26, 1788, marking the beginning of European settlement in Australia. However, the area was already inhabited by the Eora people, who had lived in the region for thousands of years. The Eora people were skilled hunters and gatherers, and their traditional lands stretched from the Blue Mountains to the Hawkesbury River.\n\nThe arrival of the First Fleet had a profound impact on the Eora people, leading to the displacement of their community and the introduction of European diseases that decimated their population. Despite the challenges they faced, the Eora people continued to inhabit the area, and their descendants remain an important part of Sydney's cultural identity today.\n\n18th–19th centuries\n\n1770s–1790s\n\nIn the late 18th century, the British government began to establish a penal colony in New South Wales, with the first convicts arriving in 1788. The colony was initially established in Sydney Cove, which was chosen for its natural harbor and access to fresh water. The early years of the colony were marked by hardship and struggle, with many convicts dying from disease and malnutrition.\n\nDespite these challenges, the colony began to grow, and in 1795, Governor Arthur Phillip was appointed to oversee the colony. Phillip established a system of governance, including the creation of a police force and the introduction of a currency. He also established relationships with the indigenous people, including the Eora, and worked to promote the welfare of the convicts.\n\n1800s–1840s\n\nThe early 19th century saw significant growth in the colony, with the arrival of free settlers and the expansion of the economy. The government began to establish a system of land ownership, with grants being made to settlers who agreed to clear the land and establish farms. The economy also grew, with the establishment of trade and commerce, and the introduction of new technologies such as the steam engine.\n\nDuring this period, the city of Sydney began to take shape, with the construction of buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. The city's first newspaper, the Sydney Gazette, was established in 1803, and the city's first church, St. Philip's, was built in 1818.\n\n1850s–1890s\n\nThe mid-19th century saw significant changes in the colony, with the introduction of the gold rush in 1851. The discovery of gold at Bathurst and other locations in New South Wales led to a massive influx of immigrants, and the colony's population grew rapidly. The gold rush also led to the establishment of new towns and cities, including Ballarat and Bendigo.\n\nThe late 19th century saw the establishment of the city of Sydney as a major commercial center, with the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the introduction of electric trams. The city's population continued to grow, and the city became a major hub for trade and commerce.\n\n20th century\n\n1900s–1940s\n\nThe 20th century saw significant changes in the city, with the introduction of new technologies and the growth of the economy. The city's population continued to grow, and the city became a major hub for industry and commerce. The city's first cinema, the Lyceum Theatre, was established in 1906, and the city's first radio station, 2GB, was established in 1921.\n\nDuring World War II, the city played an important role in the war effort, with the establishment of military bases and the production of war materials. The city's population also grew significantly, with many people moving to the city from rural areas.\n\n1950s–1990s\n\nThe post-war period saw significant growth in the city, with the establishment of new industries and the expansion of existing ones. The city's population continued to grow, and the city became a major hub for tourism and entertainment. The city's first television station, ATN-7, was established in 1956, and the city's first shopping center, the Queen Victoria Building, was established in 1970.\n\nThe late 20th century saw significant changes in the city, with the introduction of new technologies and the growth of the service sector. The city's population continued to grow, and the city became a major hub for finance and commerce.\n\n21st century\n\n2000s\n\nThe 21st century saw significant changes in the city, with the introduction of new technologies and the growth of the service sector. The city's population continued to grow, and the city became a major hub for finance and commerce. The city's first high-speed rail link, the Sydney Metro, was established in 2009, and the city's first casino, The Star, was established in 2010.\n\nDuring the 2000s, the city also experienced significant challenges, including the 2007 floods and the 2010-2011 bushfires. The city's population also continued to grow, with many people moving to the city from rural areas.\n\n2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw significant changes in the city, with the introduction of new technologies and the growth of the service sector. The city's population continued to grow, and the city became a major hub for finance and commerce. The city's first Uber service was launched in 2012, and the city's first Apple Store was established in 2013.\n\nDuring the 2010s, the city also experienced significant challenges, including the 2013-2014 floods and the 2017-2018 bushfires. The city's population also continued to grow, with many people moving to the city from rural areas.\n\n2020s\n\nThe 2020s saw significant changes in the city, with the introduction of new technologies and the growth of the service sector. The city's population continued to grow, and the city became a major hub for finance and commerce. The city's first electric double-decker buses were introduced in 2020, and the city's first high-speed ferry service was established in 2021.\n\nDuring the 2020s, the city also experienced significant challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 floods.

On that day, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos shot and killed 19 students and two teachers, before taking his own life.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn the years leading up to the shooting, there were concerns about school safety and security in Uvalde, Texas. In 2018, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District (UCISD) conducted a security audit, which identified several vulnerabilities in the district's security protocols. The audit recommended that the district implement a more robust security system, including the installation of security cameras and the creation of a school resource officer (SRO) program.\n\nIn 2020, the UCISD implemented a new security policy, which included the creation of a safety committee to oversee school safety and security. The committee was charged with developing and implementing safety protocols, including emergency response plans and active shooter training.\n\nDespite these efforts, the district's security protocols were criticized for being inadequate. In the months leading up to the shooting, there were several incidents in which students reported concerns about school safety to district officials, but their concerns were largely ignored.\n\n**Events**\n\n#### Shooting\n\nOn May 24, 2022, at approximately 11:28 a.m., Salvador Ramos, an 18-year-old student at Robb Elementary School, entered the school through an unlocked back door. Ramos was armed with a semi-automatic rifle, a handgun, and multiple magazines of ammunition. He made his way to the second floor of the school, where he encountered two teachers, Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia, in their classroom. Ramos shot and killed both teachers and then entered the adjacent classroom, where 19 students were taking a reading class.\n\nRamos barricaded himself in the classroom, and the students w", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Uvalde_school_shooting\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##School security preparations\n#Events\n##Shooting\n##Additional emergency response\n##Account by Pedro Arredondo\n##Timeline of events\n#Victims\n#Perpetrator\n#Investigations\n##Texas House Investigative Committee\n##Attempts to block release of police records\n##Hallway video\n#Legal proceedings\n#Aftermath\n##Memorials and tributes\n##Pedro Arredondo\n##Permanent closing of school\n##Potential copycat threats\n##Departures of other officers\n##Criticism of police\n#Law enforcement failures and controversies\n##Confronting the shooter\n##Inaccurate initial statements by Texas authorities\n##City Hall meeting with Steve McCraw on June 2\n#Responses\n##Ramos' parents\n##Survivors and families\n##Reactions from politicians\n##Resulting gun control discussions\n###Political\n###NRA and Daniel Defense\n###Mass shooting survivors and families\n###Entertainment\n##Legislative action\n###Canada\n###United States\n###Protecting Our Kids Act\n###Bipartisan Safer Communities Act\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The war has its roots in the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, which led to the annexation of Crimea by Russia. The conflict has since escalated into a full-blown war in eastern Ukraine, with multiple periods of intense fighting.\n\nThis article will provide an overview of the casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War, including both military and civilian losses, foreign fighters and civilians, and landmine and explosive remnants.\n\n**Russian Annexation of Crimea**\n\nThe annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 was a key event in the escalation of the conflict. Russia's actions were widely condemned by the international community, with many countries imposing economic sanctions on Russia.

The elections were a significant event in Nepalese politics, marking the country's 11th general election since the establishment of the multiparty system in 1990.\n\n#Background\nThe 2022 Nepalese general election was held amidst a backdrop of significant political and economic challenges. The country was facing a deepening economic crisis, with high inflation, unemployment, and a large trade deficit. The COVID-19 pandemic had also taken a toll on the economy, exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.\n\nThe Nepalese government had also been embroiled in controversy, with allegations of corruption, nepotism, and abuse of power. The country's politics had become increasingly polarized, with different parties and factions vying for power and influence.\n\nDespite these challenges, the 2022 Nepalese general election was seen as an opportunity for the country to chart a new course and address its pressing problems. Many Nepalis saw the election as a chance to elect a new government that would prioritize their needs and work towards building a more equitable and prosperous society.\n\n#Timetable\nThe 2022 Nepalese general election was held in two phases on November 12 and 19, 2022. The first phase of the election was held on November 12, covering 36 districts in the hills and mountains of Nepal.

The Election Commission of Nepal (ECN) was responsible for conducting the election, which included the compilation of voter lists, setting up polling stations, and ensuring the smooth conduct of the election.\n\n#Electoral system\nThe 2022 Nepalese general election was held under the proportional representation system, with a mixed electoral system. Under this system, 165 members of the House of Representatives (HoR) were elected through first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting, while 110 members were elected through proportional representation (PR) voting.\n\n##Eligibility to vote\nTo be eligible to vote in the 2022 Nepalese general election, citizens had to be at least 18 years old and registered in the electoral roll.

They campaigned on a platform of change, promising to address the country's pressing problems and restore the rule of law.\n\n#Electoral alliances and parties\nThe 2022 Nepalese general election saw the formation of several electoral alliances and parties.

These parties were seen as the main opposition parties and were determined to defeat the NCP and form a new government.\n\n##2017–2022 MPs contesting under a different political affiliation\nSeveral MPs who were elected in 2017 were contesting under a different political affiliation in the 2022 election. This included MPs who had defected from one party to another or had been disqualified from their party.\n\n##2017–2022 MPs not standing for re-election\nSome MPs who were elected in 2017 were not standing for re-election in the 2022 election.

The election was conducted to elect members of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Parliament of Thailand. The election was significant, as it marked a return to democracy after a military coup in 2014 and the subsequent transition to a hybrid electoral system.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2023 general election was the first general election to be held in Thailand since the 2019 general election. The 2019 election was held after a prolonged period of military rule, which was marked by widespread protests and demands for democracy. The 2019 election was won by the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP), a conservative party that was seen as a proxy for the military. However, the PPRP's victory was short-lived, as the party was unable to form a stable government due to opposition from other parties.\n\nThe 2023 election was seen as an opportunity for Thai citizens to choose a new government and shape the country's future. The election was also significant, as it marked the first time that the military's role in politics had been explicitly challenged by the opposition.\n\n**Electoral System**\n\nThe 2023 general election was conducted under the 2017 Constitution, which introduced a hybrid electoral system that combines elements of proportional representation and single-member constituencies. The system consists of two main components: the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nThe House of Representatives has 500 members, with 375 elected from single-member constituencies and 125 elected from party lists. The single-member constituencies are divided into three groups: urban, rural, and special. The party lists are allocated seats based on the number of votes received by each party in the election.\n\n**Prime Ministerial Candidates**\n\nThe 2023 general election saw several candidates vying for the position of Prime Minister of Thailand. The main candidates were:\n\n* Srettha Thavisin, leader of the Pheu Thai Party, a left-wing party that was seen as a major challenger to the military-backed government.\n* Pita Limjaroenrat, leader of the Move Forward Party, a center-left party that was seen as a potential alternative to the Pheu Thai Party.\n* Uttama Savanayana, leader of the Phalang Chon Party, a conservative party that was seen as a proxy for the military.\n\n**2022 Reapportionment and Redistricting**\n\nThe 2022 reapportionment and redistricting exercise was an important factor in the 2023 general election. The exercise saw the creation of new constituencies and the redrawing of existing ones. The reapportionment and redistricting exercise was seen as an opportunity for the military-backed government to consolidate its power and limit the influence of opposition parties.\n\n**Leading up to the Election**\n\nThe 2023 general election was the culmination of a long and complex process. The election was preceded by a series of events, including the formation of new parties and the realignment of existing ones. The election was also marked by a series of protests and demonstrations, which were aimed at highlighting the opposition's demands for democracy and reform.\n\n**Contesting Parties**\n\nA total of 51 parties contested the 2023 general election. The main parties were:\n\n* Pheu Thai Party\n* Move Forward Party\n* Palang Pracharath Party\n* Phalang Chon Party\n* Democrat Party\n* Bhumjaithai Party\n* Chartthaipattana Party\n\nThe parties were divided into several groups, including the opposition, the government, and the neutral parties. The opposition parties were seen as the main challengers to the military-backed government, while the government parties were seen as loyal to the military.\n\n**Overseas and Advanced Voting**\n\nThe 2023 general election saw the introduction of overseas and advanced voting for the first time. The system allowed eligible voters to cast their ballots in advance or overseas, which was seen as an opportunity to increase voter turnout.\n\n**Opinion Polls**\n\nOpinion polls were an important factor in the 2023 general election. The polls were used to gauge public opinion and predict the outcome of the election. The main opinion polls were:\n\n* Preferred Party: The polls showed that the Pheu Thai Party was the most popular party, followed by the Move Forward Party and the Palang Pracharath Party.\n* Preferred Prime Minister: The polls showed that Srettha Thavisin was the most popular candidate for Prime Minister, followed by Pita Limjaroenrat and Uttama Savanayana.\n* Exit Polls: The exit polls showed that the Pheu Thai Party was likely to win the most seats, followed by the Move Forward Party and the Palang Pracharath Party.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe 2023 general election saw a significant shift in the balance of power in Thailand. The election was won by the Pheu Thai Party, which secured the most seats in the House of Representatives. The party's leader, Srettha Thavisin, was elected as the Prime Minister of Thailand.\n\nThe election results were as follows:\n\n* Pheu Thai Party: 153 seats\n* Move Forward Party: 92 seats\n* Palang Pracharath Party: 40 seats\n* Phalang Chon Party: 30 seats\n* Democrat Party: 20 seats\n* Bhumjaithai Party: 15 seats\n* Chartthaipattana Party: 10 seats\n\n**Results by Province**\n\nThe 2023 general election saw a significant variation in the results by province. The provinces that voted for the Pheu Thai Party were:\n\n* Bangkok: 40 seats\n* Chiang Mai: 10 seats\n* Chiang Rai: 5 seats\n* Khon Kaen: 10 seats\n* Nakhon Ratchasima: 10 seats\n* Nakhon Sawan: 5 seats\n* Nong Bua Lamphu: 5 seats\n* Roi Et: 5 seats\n* Sakon Nakhon: 5 seats\n* Surin: 5 seats\n\nThe provinces that voted for the Move Forward Party were:\n\n* Ayutthaya: 10 seats\n* Chainat: 5 seats\n* Kamphaeng Phet: 5 seats\n* Lopburi: 5 seats\n* Phetchabun: 5 seats\n* Phetchaburi: 5 seats\n* Prachinburi: 5 seats\n* Ratchaburi: 5 seats\n* Samut Sakhon: 5 seats\n\nThe provinces that voted for the Palang Pracharath Party were:\n\n* Ang Thong: 5 seats\n* Chai Nat: 5 seats\n* Kanchanaburi: 5 seats\n* Lopburi: 5 seats\n* Phitsanulok: 5 seats\n* Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya: 5 seats\n* Samut Prakan: 5 seats\n* Sara Buri: 5 seats\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe 2023 general election was significant, as it marked a return to democracy in Thailand after a long period of military rule. The election was won by the Pheu Thai Party, which secured the most seats in the House of Representatives. The party's leader, Srettha Thavisin, was elected as the Prime Minister of Thailand.\n\nThe election results showed a significant shift in the balance of power in Thailand. The Pheu Thai Party's victory was seen as a major challenge to the military-backed government, which had been in power since 2014. The election was also seen as an opportunity for Thai citizens to choose a new government and shape the country's future.\n\n**Government Formation**\n\nThe 2023 general election saw the formation of two main coalitions: the Move Forward–led coalition and the Pheu Thai–led coalition.\n\nThe Move Forward–led coalition was formed by the Move Forward Party, the Bhumjaithai Party, and the Chartthaipattana Party. The coalition secured 132 seats in the House of Representatives and was seen as a major challenger to the Pheu Thai Party.\n\nThe Pheu Thai–led coalition was formed by the Pheu Thai Party, the Palang Pracharath Party, and the Phalang Chon Party. The coalition secured 183 seats in the House of Representatives and was seen as the ruling party.\n\nThe two coalitions were seen as the main forces in the 2023 general election, with the Pheu Thai–led coalition being the dominant force. The Move Forward–led coalition was seen as a potential alternative to the Pheu Thai Party, but ultimately failed to win the most seats.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The 2023 general election was the 27th general election of Thailand.\n* The election was held on 14 May 2023.\n* The election was won by the Pheu Thai Party, which secured the most seats in the House of Representatives.\n* The party's leader, Srettha Thavisin, was elected as the Prime Minister of Thailand.\n* The election results showed a significant shift in the balance of power in Thailand, with the Pheu Thai Party emerging as the dominant force.\n\n**References**\n\n* (none)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* (none)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Thai_general_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Electoral system\n##Prime ministerial candidates\n##2022 reapportionment and redistricting\n#Leading up to the election\n#Contesting parties\n#Overseas and advanced voting\n#Opinion polls\n##Preferred party\n##Preferred prime minister\n##Exit polls\n#Results\n##Results by province\n##Analysis\n#Government formation\n##Move Forward–led coalition\n##Pheu Thai–led coalition\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They were a product of the complex and often fraught interactions between European colonizers, African slaves, and indigenous people. The Saint-Domingue Creoles developed a unique culture, language, and identity that was shaped by their experiences and circumstances.\n\n##Etymology\n\nThe term \"Creole\" is derived from the Portuguese word \"crioulo,\" which means \"native-born\" or \"of mixed ancestry.\" In the context of Saint-Domingue, the term Creole referred to people of mixed European and African ancestry, as well as those of African descent who were born in the Americas.\n\n##Origin of the Saint-Domingue Creoles\n\nThe Saint-Domingue Creoles originated in the 17th century, when European colonizers began to settle on the island. Many of these early colonizers were French, but there were also Spanish, Dutch, and British settlements on the island. As the European communities grew, they began to intermarry with African slaves, who were brought to the island to work on plantations. The resulting offspring were known as Creoles.\n\n##Saint-Domingue Creole society\n\nSaint-Domingue Creole society was characterized by a complex hierarchy of social classes. At the top of the social ladder were the European colonizers, who held positions of power and wealth. Below them were the Creoles, who were often merchants, traders, and plantation owners. At the bottom of the social ladder were the African slaves, who performed the manual labor on the plantations.\n\n##Development of Creole culture\n\nCreole culture was a unique blend of European, African, and indigenous influences. The Creoles developed their own language, music, and art, which was influenced by the cultures of their ancestors. They also developed a distinct cuisine, which combined elements of French, African, and indigenous cooking styles.\n\n##Freedoms of the Creoles and Affranchis\n\nThe Creoles and affranchis (freed slaves) of Saint-Domingue enjoyed a degree of freedom and privilege that was not available to the African slaves. They were free to move about the island, to own property, and to engage in trade and commerce. However, they were still subject to certain restrictions and laws that limited their rights and opportunities.\n\n##Slavery in Saint-Domingue\n\nSlavery was a central institution in Saint-Domingue, and it played a major role in the island's economy and society. The African slaves were brought to the island to work on plantations, where they were forced to labor in harsh conditions. Many slaves died as a result of overwork, disease, and mistreatment, and many others escaped or rebelled against their slave status.\n\n##African presence in Saint-Domingue\n\nThe African presence in Saint-Domingue was a dominant feature of the island's society and economy. The African slaves were brought to the island from various regions of Africa, and they brought with them their own languages, cultures, and customs. Over time, the African slaves developed their own distinct culture and identity on the island.\n\n##European presence in Saint-Domingue\n\nThe European presence in Saint-Domingue was also significant, particularly in the early years of the island's history. The French, Spanish, and British all established settlements on the island, and they introduced European culture, language, and customs. However, as the island developed and the Creoles became more prominent, the European presence began to decline.\n\n##Royalist curtailment of Creole rights\n\nIn the late 18th century, the French monarchy, under the rule of King Louis XVI, began to curtail the rights and privileges of the Creoles and affranchis. The royalists saw the Creoles as a threat to their power and authority, and they began to restrict their rights and freedoms. This led to growing tensions and conflicts between the Creoles and the royalists.\n\n##Downturn of Saint-Domingue's economy\n\nIn the late 18th century, Saint-Domingue's economy began to decline. The island's sugar and coffee industries, which had been major sources of wealth and prosperity, began to stagnate. The Creoles and affranchis, who had become increasingly wealthy and influential, were affected by the economic downturn, and they began to demand greater rights and freedoms.\n\n##Saint-Domingue Creoles in the American Revolutionary War\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Saint-Domingue Creoles played a significant role in the conflict. Many Creoles and affranchis fought on the side of the French, who were allies of the Americans. The Creoles saw the war as an opportunity to gain greater rights and freedoms, and they fought bravely to achieve their goals.\n\n##Revolutionary History of Saint-Domingue\n\n###The Rebellion of Saint-Domingue\n\nThe Rebellion of Saint-Domingue, which began in 1791, was a major turning point in the island's history. The rebellion was sparked by a slave uprising on a plantation, and it quickly spread throughout the island. The Creoles and affranchis, who had long been frustrated by their lack of rights and freedoms, joined the rebellion, and together they fought against the French colonial authorities.\n\n###Civil War and Invasion of Santo Domingo\n\nThe rebellion soon turned into a full-blown civil war, with the Creoles and affranchis fighting against the French and their Spanish allies. The war lasted for several years, and it was marked by brutal fighting and widespread destruction. In 1803, the French were defeated, and the Creoles and affranchis established their own government on the island.\n\n###The Haitian Revolution in Saint-Domingue\n\nThe Haitian Revolution, which began", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Saint-Domingue_Creoles\" following this outline:\n\n#Saint-Domingue Creole Society\n##Etymology\n##Origin of the Saint-Domingue Creoles\n##Saint-Domingue Creole society\n##Development of Creole culture\n##Freedoms of the Creoles and Affranchis\n##Slavery in Saint-Domingue\n##African presence in Saint-Domingue\n##European presence in Saint-Domingue\n##Royalist curtailment of Creole rights\n##Downturn of Saint-Domingue's economy\n##Saint-Domingue Creoles in the American Revolutionary War\n#Revolutionary History of Saint-Domingue\n##The Rebellion of Saint-Domingue\n##Civil War and Invasion of Santo Domingo\n##The Haitian Revolution in Saint-Domingue\n##Genocide of the remaining whites in Saint-Domingue\n##The Empire of Haiti\n#Saint-Domingue Creoles after the Haitian Revolution\n##Saint-Domingue Creoles in New Orleans, Louisiana\n##Saint-Domingue Creoles in Haiti\n#Culture\n##Creole French Language\n#See also\n#References\n##Works cited\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The league is one of the oldest and most prestigious in regional Victoria, with a rich history dating back to 1893.\n\n**History**\n\n### Beginnings of the O&MFNL\n\nThe O&MFL was founded in 1893, when the Ovens and Murray Football Association was established. The league was formed by a group of football clubs from the Ovens and Murray regions, who wanted to create a formal competition to govern the sport in the area. The first season of the O&MFL was held in 1894, with six teams competing in the inaugural season.\n\n### Post-World War II\n\nFollowing World War II, the O&MFL experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion. New clubs were established in the region, and the league's popularity increased significantly. The 1940s and 1950s saw the introduction of new rules and regulations, including the use of helmets and the abolition of the \"wrestle\" tackle.\n\n### 1970s and 1980s\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s were a period of significant change and growth for the O&MFL. The league introduced a new competition format, with a finals system and a ladder-based competition. This change helped to increase the league's popularity and attract new teams to the competition.\n\n### 1990 \"Bloodbath\" Grand Final\n\nIn 1990, the O&MFL Grand Final was played between the Wangaratta Rovers and the Yarrawonga Football Club. The game, which became known as the \"Bloodbath\" due to the high number of injuries sustained during the match, was one of the most contested and intense in O&MFL history. Wangaratta Rovers won the game by a single point, with Yarrawonga's captain being stretchered from the field with a serious injury.\n\n### Recent years\n\nIn recent years, the O&MFL has continued to grow and evolve. The league has introduced new initiatives and programs aimed at promoting the sport and improving the experience for players, officials, and spectators. The league has also invested in infrastructure, including the construction of new change rooms and facilities.\n\n**Clubs**\n\n### Current clubs\n\nThe O&MFL currently comprises 14 teams, including:\n\n* Benalla Football Club\n* Beechworth Football Club\n* Boweya District Football Club\n* Everton Football Club\n* Glenrowan Football Club\n* Lavington Football Club\n* Myrtleford Football Club\n* Rutherglen Football Club\n* Shepparton Swans Football Club\n* Wangaratta Rovers Football Club\n* Wodonga Raiders Football Club\n* Yarrawonga Football Club\n* Euroa Football Club\n* Seymour Football Club\n\n### Former clubs\n\nThe O&MFL has had several clubs that have folded or merged over the years, including:\n\n* Albury Football Club\n* Rutherglen Football Club (pre-1993)\n* Wangaratta Football Club (pre-1993)\n\n**League honour boards**\n\n### Premierships\n\nThe O&MFL has a long and proud history of premiership successes, with over 120 teams having won the premiership since the league's inception in 1893.\n\n### Records\n\n#### Football: Seniors\n\nThe O&MFL has a number of records and achievements in the senior football competition, including:\n\n* Most premierships: 17 (Wangaratta Rovers)\n* Most consecutive premierships: 4 (Wangaratta Rovers, 1995-1998)\n* Longest unbeaten streak: 23 games (Wangaratta Rovers, 1995-1996)\n* Highest score in a game: 38.23 (Wangaratta Rovers vs. Yarrawonga, 1990)\n* Lowest score in a game: 1.4 (Glenrowan vs. Benalla, 1922)\n\n#### Senior Football Premierships (1893-present)\n\nA full list of O&MFL senior premierships since 1893 is included below:\n\n* 1893: Benalla\n* 1894: Wangaratta\n* 1895: Benalla\n* 1896: Wangaratta\n* 1897: Albury\n* 1898: Benalla\n* 1899: Albury\n* 1900: Wangaratta\n* 1901: Benalla\n* 1902: Albury\n* 1903: Wangaratta\n* 1904: Benalla\n* 1905: Albury\n* 1906: Wangaratta\n* 1907: Benalla\n* 1908: Albury\n* 1909: Wangaratta\n* 1910: Benalla\n* 1911: Albury\n* 1912: Wangaratta\n* 1913: Benalla\n* 1914: Albury\n* 1915: Wangaratta\n* 1916: No competition\n* 1917: No competition\n* 1918: Benalla\n* 1919: Albury\n* 1920: Wangaratta\n* 1921: Benalla\n* 1922: Albury\n* 1923: Wangaratta\n* 1924: Benalla\n* 1925: Albury\n* 1926: Wangaratta\n* 1927: Benalla\n* 1928: Albury\n* 1929: Wangaratta\n* 1930: Benalla\n* 1931: Albury\n* 1932: Wangaratta\n* 1933: Benalla\n* 1934: Albury\n* 1935: Wangaratta\n* 1936: Benalla\n* 1937: Albury\n* 1938: Wangaratta\n* 1939: Benalla\n* 1940: Albury\n* 1941: Wangaratta\n* 1942: Benalla\n* 1943: Albury\n* 1944: Wangaratta\n* 1945: Benalla\n* 1946: Albury\n* 1947: Wangaratta\n* 1948: Benalla\n* 1949: Albury\n* 1950: Wangaratta\n* 1951: Benalla\n* 1952: Albury\n* 1953: Wangaratta\n* 1954: Benalla\n* 1955: Albury\n* 1956: Wangaratta\n* 1957: Benalla\n* 1958: Albury\n* 1959: Wangaratta\n* 1960: Benalla\n* 1961: Albury\n* 1962: Wangaratta\n* 1963: Benalla\n* 1964: Albury\n* 1965: Wangaratta\n* 1966: Benalla\n* 1967: Albury\n* 1968: Wangaratta\n* 1969: Benalla\n* 1970: Albury\n* 1971: Wangaratta\n* 1972: Benalla\n* 1973: Albury\n* 1974: Wangaratta\n* 1975: Benalla\n* 1976: Albury\n* 1977: Wangaratta\n* 1978: Benalla\n* 1979: Albury\n* 1980: Wangaratta\n* 1981: Benalla\n* 1982: Albury\n* 1983: Wangaratta\n* 1984: Benalla\n* 1985: Albury\n* 1986: Wangaratta\n* 1987: Benalla\n* 1988: Albury\n* 1989: Wangaratta\n* 1990: Yarrawonga\n* 1991: Wangaratta\n* 1992: Yarrawonga\n* 1993: Wangaratta\n* 1994: Yarrawonga\n* 1995: Wangaratta\n* 1996: Wangaratta\n* 1997: Wangaratta\n* 1998: Wangaratta\n* 1999: Yarrawonga\n* 2000: Wangaratta\n* 2001: Yarrawonga\n* 2002: Wangaratta\n* 2003: Yarrawonga\n* 2004: Wangaratta\n* 2005: Yarrawonga\n* 2006: Wangaratta\n* 2007: Yarrawonga\n* 2008: Wangaratta\n* 2009: Yarrawonga\n* 2010: Wangaratta\n* 2011: Yarrawonga\n* 2012: Wangaratta\n* 2013: Yarrawonga\n* 2014: Wangaratta\n* 2015: Yarrawonga\n* 2016: Wangaratta\n* 2017: Yarrawonga\n* 2018: Wangaratta\n* 2019: Yarrawonga\n* 2020: Wangaratta\n* 2021: Yarrawonga\n* 2022: Wangaratta\n\n### Current finals system\n\nThe O&MFL currently uses a finals system, with the top four teams in each division qualifying for the finals.
