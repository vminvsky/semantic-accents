It is a common and effective treatment for cataracts, which can cause vision loss and blindness if left untreated. The surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens (IOL).\n\n**Uses**\n\nCataract surgery is used to treat cataracts, which are caused by a clouding of the lens in the eye. This clouding can be caused by a variety of factors, including age, injury, or certain medical conditions. Cataracts can cause vision loss and blindness if left untreated. Cataract surgery is used to restore vision and improve quality of life for individuals with cataracts.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nThere are several techniques used in cataract surgery, including:\n\n* **Phacoemulsification**: This is the most common technique used in cataract surgery. It involves using a small incision to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens.\n* **Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)**: This technique involves making a small incision to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens.\n* **Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)**: This technique involves making a larger incision to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens.\n\n**Pre-operative evaluation**\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, an individual will undergo a pre-operative evaluation to assess their suitability for the procedure. This evaluation will include:\n\n### **Contraindications**\n\nCertain conditions may make an individual unsuitable for cataract surgery, including:\n\n* **Glaucoma**: This is a condition that affects the optic nerve and can cause vision loss.\n* **Retinal detachment**: This is a condition where the retina separates from the back of the eye.\n* **Recent eye injury**: If an individual has recently experienced an eye injury, they may not be suitable for cataract surgery.\n\n### **Selection of intraocular lenses**\n\nThe selection of an intraocular lens (IOL) is an important part of cataract surgery. There are several types of IOLs available, including:\n\n* **Monofocal IOLs**: These IOLs are designed to provide sharp vision at a single distance, either near or far.\n* **Multifocal IOLs**: These IOLs are designed to provide sharp vision at multiple distances, including near, far, and intermediate.\n* **Toric IOLs**: These IOLs are designed to correct astigmatism.\n\n**Operation procedures**\n\nCataract surgery involves the following procedures:\n\n### **Preparation**\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, an individual will be given a local anesthetic to numb the eye. The eye will also be cleaned and prepared for the procedure.\n\n### **Anaesthesia**\n\nThe local anesthetic will be administered to numb the eye. The individual may also be given a mild sedative to help them relax during the procedure.\n\n### **Phacoemulsification**\n\nPhacoemulsification is the most common technique used in cataract surgery. It involves using a small incision to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens. The procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia.\n\n### **Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)**\n\nMSICS is a technique used in cataract surgery. It involves making a small incision to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens. The procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia.\n\n### **Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)**\n\nECCE is a technique used in cataract surgery. It involves making a larger incision to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens. The procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia.\n\n### **Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency**\n\nIf a complication arises during surgery, the surgeon may need to convert to ECCE to manage the situation.\n\n### **Closing the wound**\n\nAfter the procedure is complete, the wound will be closed with stitches or a gel-like substance to help the eye heal.\n\n**Post-operative care**\n\nAfter cataract surgery, an individual will need to follow a post-operative care plan to ensure a smooth recovery. This will include:\n\n* **Eye drops**: An individual may need to use eye drops to help the eye heal and prevent infection.\n* **Rest**: An individual should rest and avoid strenuous activities to allow the eye to heal.\n* **Follow-up appointments**: An individual will need to attend follow-up appointments with their eye doctor to ensure the eye is healing properly.\n\n**Complications**\n\nCataract surgery can be complicated by various factors, including:\n\n### **During surgery**\n\n* **Bleeding**: Bleeding can occur during surgery, which can lead to complications.\n* **Tear in the cornea**: A tear in the cornea can occur during surgery, which can lead to complications.\n\n### **After surgery**\n\n* **Infection**: Infection can occur after surgery, which can lead to complications.\n* **Cloudy vision**: Cloudy vision can occur after surgery, which can be caused by a variety of factors.\n\n### **Risk**\n\nThe risk of complications with cataract surgery is low, but it is still a risk. An individual should discuss the risks and benefits of surgery with their eye doctor before proceeding.\n\n**Recovery and rehabilitation**\n\nAfter cataract surgery, an individual will need to follow a recovery and rehabilitation plan to ensure a smooth recovery. This will include:\n\n* **Rest**: An individual should rest and avoid strenuous activities to allow the eye to heal.\n* **Eye drops**: An individual may need to use eye drops to help the eye heal and prevent infection.\n* **Follow-up appointments**: An individual will need to attend follow-up appointments with their eye doctor to ensure the eye is healing properly.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery can be excellent, with many individuals experiencing improved vision and quality of life. However, as with any surgery, there are risks and complications that can occur.\n\n**History**\n\nCataract surgery has a long history, with the first recorded cataract surgery dating back to ancient India in 2000 BC. Over the centuries, the procedure has evolved and improved, with advances in technology and surgical techniques.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\nCataract surgery is available in many parts of the world, including:\n\n### **Europe**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Europe, with many countries having well-established eye care systems.\n\n### **Asia**\n\nCataract surgery is also widely available in Asia, with many countries having modern eye care systems.\n\n### **Africa**\n\nCataract surgery is available in many parts of Africa, although access to eye care can be limited in some areas.\n\n### **Latin America**\n\nCataract surgery is available in many parts of Latin America, although access to eye care can be limited in some areas.\n\n**Social, economic and environmental relevance**\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where access to eye care is limited. Improved access to cataract surgery can help to reduce poverty and improve quality of life for individuals and communities.\n\n**Special populations**\n\nCataract surgery can be challenging in certain special populations, including:\n\n### **Congenital cataracts**\n\nCataracts that are present at birth can be challenging to treat, and may require specialized surgical techniques.\n\n### **Higher risk for operations on separate occasions**\n\nIndividuals who have had previous eye surgery may be at higher risk for complications during cataract surgery, and may require more extensive pre-operative evaluation and preparation.\n\n**Other animals**\n\nCataract surgery can also be performed in animals, including cats and dogs. The procedure is similar to human cataract surgery, but may require specialized equipment and techniques.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Cataract**\n* **Intraocular lens**\n* **Phacoemulsification**\n* **Extracapsular cataract extraction**\n* **Manual small incision cataract surgery**\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Cataract surgery is a common and effective treatment for cataracts.\n* The procedure involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.\n* Cataract surgery can be complicated by various factors, including bleeding and infection.\n* The risk of complications with cataract surgery is low, but it is still a risk.\n* An individual should discuss the risks and benefits of surgery with their eye doctor before proceeding.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Academy of Ophthalmology.

The company has a long history of delivering high-quality construction projects, and has become one of the largest and most respected construction companies in the UK.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group was founded in 1897 by William Shepherd, a glazier from Birmingham. Initially, the company specialized in the manufacture of glass and glazing products, but soon expanded into the construction industry, taking on contracts for various building projects. Over the years, the company grew and diversified, and by the mid-20th century, it had become a major player in the UK construction industry.\n\n### Main contractor\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Shepherd Building Group began to focus more on the construction side of the business, and became a major main contractor in the UK. The company took on large-scale construction projects, including office buildings, shopping centers, and residential developments. During this period, the company also invested heavily in research and development, introducing new technologies and innovations to the construction industry.\n\n### Manufactured products\n\nIn addition to its construction services, the Shepherd Building Group has also been a manufacturer of various building products. The company has produced a range of glass and glazing products, including windows, doors, and partitions. In the 1980s and 1990s, the company also began to manufacture pre-fabricated building components, such as modular homes and office units.\n\n### Disposal of non-core businesses\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Shepherd Building Group began to dispose of its non-core businesses, including its glass and glazing manufacturing operations. The company sold its glass manufacturing assets to a rival company, and focused its attention on the construction side of the business. This move allowed the company to concentrate on its core activities, and to invest in new technologies and innovations.\n\n**Notable construction projects**\n\nThroughout its history, the Shepherd Building Group has been involved in some of the most notable construction projects in the UK. Some of the company's most notable projects include:\n\n* The Bristol Temple Quarter development, a major regeneration project in the heart of Bristol.\n* The redevelopment of the Royal Opera House in London, which involved the construction of a new wing and the refurbishment of the existing building.\n* The construction of the Trinity Walk shopping center in Wakefield, which was one of the largest shopping centers in the UK at the time of its completion.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has been involved in several controversies over the years. Some of the most notable include:\n\n### Identity behind anonymous emails\n\nIn 2010, the company was the subject of a series of anonymous emails, which were sent to various stakeholders and claimed to reveal confidential information about the company's financial affairs. An investigation was launched, and it was discovered that the emails were sent by a former employee of the company.\n\n### Hand tool vibration\n\nIn the 1980s, the Shepherd Building Group was involved in a series of disputes with trades unions over the use of hand tools on construction sites. The company argued that the use of power tools was safer and more efficient, but the unions argued that hand tools were more precise and allowed for greater control. The dispute ultimately ended in a compromise, with the company agreeing to allow the use of hand tools on certain projects.\n\n### Domain name disputes\n\nIn 2011, the Shepherd Building Group was involved in a dispute over the ownership of a website domain name. A rival company had registered the domain name, and the Shepherd Building Group claimed that it had been registered in bad faith. The dispute was eventually resolved through mediation.\n\n### Employment blacklisting\n\nIn 2012, the Shepherd Building Group was implicated in a scandal over the use of blacklists to vet potential employees. The company was accused of using a private company to vet potential employees, and of blacklisting individuals who had been involved in trade union activity. The company denied any wrongdoing, but the scandal led to calls for greater transparency and accountability in the construction industry.\n\n### Trinity Walk\n\nThe Trinity Walk shopping center in Wakefield was one of the largest shopping centers in the UK at the time of its completion. However, the center has struggled financially in recent years, and has been the subject of various reports and investigations. In 2015, the center was sold to a new owner, who has promised to invest in the site and to bring in new retailers.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Construction industry\n* Glass and glazing industry\n* Building services engineering\n* Architecture\n* Engineering\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shepherd_Building_Group\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Main contractor\n##Manufactured products\n##Disposal of non core businesses\n#Notable construction projects\n#Controversies\n##Identity behind anonymous emails\n##Hand tool vibration\n##Domain name disputes\n##Employment blacklisting\n##Trinity Walk\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of the background, development, and impact of the black market, as well as its response from authorities and the public.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1930s: Inflation, Instability, and Unrest\n\nThe 1930s were marked by economic instability, high inflation, and widespread unemployment in France. The global economic crisis, known as the Great Depression, had a devastating impact on the French economy, leading to a decline in living standards and a rise in poverty. This created a fertile ground for the emergence of a black market, as people turned to illicit means to access essential goods and services.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nThe fall of France in June 1940, following the German invasion, led to the establishment of the Vichy regime, which collaborated with the Nazi occupation. The Vichy government implemented a series of policies aimed at controlling the economy, including rationing and price controls, which further fueled the growth of the black market.\n\n**1940-1941**\n\n### Origins\n\n#### Rationing and Price Controls\n\nThe Vichy government introduced a system of rationing and price controls to manage the distribution of essential goods, such as food, fuel, and clothing. However, these measures were poorly implemented and often corrupt, leading to widespread shortages and black market activity.\n\n#### Diversion from Official Channels\n\nAs the black market grew, people began to divert goods from official channels to sell on the black market, where prices were higher and supplies were more abundant.\n\n#### Clandestine Networks\n\nClandestine networks, including gangs and organized crime groups, emerged to facilitate the trade on the black market. These networks often operated with impunity, using bribery and intimidation to maintain their control.\n\n#### Hidden Stockpiling\n\nBusinesses and individuals began to stockpile goods, hiding them from official authorities and selling them on the black market.\n\n#### Grey Market\n\nThe grey market, which operated in a gray area between the official and black markets, emerged as a way for people to access goods without resorting to the black market. This market operated with tacit tolerance from authorities, who saw it as a way to maintain some semblance of economic order.\n\n### Users of the Black Market\n\n#### Privileged French\n\nThe privileged French, including the wealthy and well-connected, were among the main beneficiaries of the black market. They used their influence and connections to access goods and services on the black market, often at inflated prices.\n\n#### Occupation Forces\n\nThe German occupation forces also used the black market to acquire goods and services, often at the expense of the French population.\n\n### Public Response\n\n#### Early Condemnation\n\nInitially, the French public condemned the black market as a symbol of the corrupt and decadent Vichy regime. However, as the occupation wore on, people began to participate in the black market as a means of survival.\n\n#### Participation\n\nBy 1941, the black market had become a ubiquitous part of French life, with many people participating in some way. This included not only buying and selling goods but also providing services, such as those related to the production and distribution of goods.\n\n#### Housewives' Demonstrations\n\nIn 1941, housewives organized demonstrations against the black market, demanding that the authorities do more to control the trade. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n#### Suspicions of Hoarding\n\nAs the black market grew, suspicions of hoarding and profiteering emerged, with many accusing those who participated in the trade of taking advantage of the situation.\n\n#### Official Antisemitism\n\nThe Vichy government and its officials often used the black market as a pretext to target and persecute Jews, who were seen as responsible for the economic problems facing France.\n\n#### Public Opinion\n\nPublic opinion on the black market was complex and divided. While some saw it as a necessary evil, others viewed it as a corrupt and immoral activity.\n\n#### Political Opposition\n\nThe political opposition to the black market was largely ineffective, with many politicians and activists either unwilling or unable to take a strong stance against the trade.\n\n## Response by Authorities\n\nThe authorities responded to the black market in a series of measures, including:\n\n*   Rationing and price controls\n*   Diversion from official channels\n*   Clandestine networks\n*   Hidden stockpiling\n*   Grey market\n\nHowever, these measures were often poorly implemented and often corrupt, leading to widespread shortages and black market activity.\n\n**Widespread Black Market (Autumn 1941 to 1943)**\n\n### Agricultural Black Market\n\nThe agricultural black market emerged as a major player in the trade, with farmers and agricultural producers selling their goods on the black market to avoid official controls and prices.\n\n### Grey Market: Direct Sales\n\nThe grey market, which operated in a gray area between the official and black markets, emerged as a way for people to access goods without resorting to the black market. This market operated with tacit tolerance from authorities, who saw it as a way to maintain some semblance of economic order.\n\n### Commerce and Industry\n\nBusinesses and industries began to adapt to the black market, often by producing and selling goods on the black market. This included not only consumer goods but also industrial products and raw materials.\n\n### Tacit Tolerance\n\nAuthorities began to adopt a more nuanced approach to the black market, tolerating it as a necessary evil. This included not only allowing the trade to continue but also providing some level of support and regulation.\n\n### No Longer Immoral\n\nThe black market was no longer seen as an immoral activity, but rather as a necessary part of the wartime economy.\n\n### Nuanced and Refocused Enforcement\n\nAuthorities began to focus on regulating and controlling the black market, rather than simply trying to eliminate it. This included introducing new laws and regulations, as well as increasing enforcement efforts.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe black market had a significant impact on the French economy, with metrics including:\n\n*   Proportion of production: The black market accounted for a significant proportion of production, including food, fuel, and clothing.\n*   Higher and more volatile prices: Prices on the black market were often higher and more volatile than those on the official market.\n*   Geographic distribution: The black market was not evenly distributed throughout France, with some regions having a greater presence than others.\n*   Beneficiaries: The black market benefited a wide range of people, including the wealthy and well-connected, as well as those who were struggling to survive.\n\n**Patriotism (Spring 1943-Summer 1944)**\n\n### Enforcement for the Occupiers\n\nAs the Allied invasion of France approached, the German occupation forces began to crack down on the black market, enforcing strict controls and regulations.\n\n### Economic Pillage and the End of the German Black Market\n\nThe German black market began to collapse, with the occupation forces turning to economic pillage and plunder to support their war effort.\n\n### Countermeasures and Collaboration\n\nThe Vichy government and its officials began to work more closely with the German occupation forces, implementing countermeasures and collaborating with them to suppress the black market.\n\n### Milice vs the Black Market\n\nThe Milice, a paramilitary organization, was tasked with enforcing the black market controls and regulations, often using violent means.\n\n## Fraud and Resistance\n\nThe black market was also a source of frustration and resentment for the French population, with many seeing it as a symbol of the corrupt and decadent Vichy regime.\n\n### Resistance Encouragement\n\nThe black market was seen as a way for the French population to resist the Nazi occupation, with many using it as a means of circumventing the official controls and regulations.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nHowever, the Vichy government and its officials often blamed the black market on the French Resistance, accusing them of being responsible for the economic problems facing France.\n\n### End of the Occupation\n\nThe end of the occupation in August 1944 marked the end of the black market, as the French government and authorities began to take control of the economy and implement new laws and regulations.\n\n**After the Liberation (1944-1949)**\n\n### Épuration and Illicit Profits\n\nThe Liberation of France was followed by a period of épuration, or purging, as the French government and authorities sought to eliminate the remnants of the black market and punish those who had profited from it.\n\n### Pursuit and Punishment\n\nThose who had participated in the black market were pursued and punished, often with imprisonment or fines.\n\n### Confiscation of Illicit Profits\n\nThe French government and authorities also sought to confiscate the illicit profits made on the black market, using the funds to support the reconstruction of France.\n\n### Continued Black Market Operations\n\nHowever, the black market continued to operate, albeit in a more limited form, with many people continuing to participate in some way.\n\n### Continued Trafficking\n\nTrafficking and smuggling continued, with many people using the black market as a means of circumventing the official controls and regulations.\n\n### Generalized Fraud\n\nFraud and corruption became generalized, with many people using the black market as a means of avoiding taxes and regulations.\n\n### Government Powerlessness\n\nThe French government and authorities were often powerless to stop the black market, with many people continuing to participate in some way.\n\n### Towards the Free Market\n\nAs the French economy began to recover, the black market began to fade away, replaced by a more open and free market economy.\n\n**Historical Memory**\n\nThe black market in wartime France has left a lasting impact on French history and culture, with many people remembering it as a symbol of the corrupt and decadent Vichy regime.\n\n### Historiography\n\nHistorians have long debated the role of the black market in wartime France, with some seeing it as a necessary evil and others viewing it as a corrupt and immoral activity.\n\n### Collective Unconscious and Cultural Roots\n\nThe black market has also left a lasting impact on the collective unconscious and cultural roots of the French people, with many people continuing to see it as a symbol of resistance and rebellion.\n\n### Early Recollections\n\nMany people remember the black market as a way of resisting the Nazi occupation, with early recollections of the period often focusing on the black market and its role in the French war effort.\n\n### Marcel Aymé\n\nThe French writer Marcel Aymé wrote extensively about the black market in his works, often using it as a symbol of the corrupt and decadent Vichy regime.\n\n### Major Works\n\nAymé's works include \"La Traversée de Paris\" and \"Au bon beurre\", which both feature the black market as a central theme.\n\n### Historical Figures\n\nThe black market has also been portrayed in works of fiction, with historical figures such as the notorious black marketeer, L'Étrange Monsieur Joseph, often featured as characters.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   **Black market in France during World War II**: A comprehensive overview of the black market in France during World War II.\n*

The film is the third and final installment in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, concluding the narrative of the original team after two previous films, Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017). The film is directed by James Gunn, who had previously written and directed the first two films, and stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, and Karen Gillan.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe plot of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 revolves around the team's efforts to stop the villainous High Evolutionary, who has been secretly experimenting on Rocket Raccoon, Star-Lord's beloved adopted brother. The High Evolutionary's plans for Rocket's genetic material threaten the very existence of the galaxy, forcing the Guardians to embark on a perilous mission to stop him. Along the way, the team faces numerous challenges, including confrontations with old foes and unexpected alliances. The film's narrative explores themes of family, sacrifice, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond one's control.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord\n* Zoe Saldana as Gamora\n* Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon (voice)\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula\n* Will Poulter as Adam Warlock\n* Chukwudi Iwuji as The High Evolutionary\n* Maria Bakalova as Cosmo\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 began in 2017, shortly after the release of the second film. James Gunn announced that he would be writing a third installment, with Marvel Studios greenlighting the project. However, in July 2018, Gunn was unexpectedly fired from the project due to controversy surrounding his past comments on social media.\n\n### Firing of James Gunn\n\nGunn's firing was a result of a resurfaced Twitter post from 2009, in which he made a joke about pedophilia. The post was met with widespread criticism, and Gunn was subsequently fired by Marvel Studios. The decision was met with backlash from fans and the cast of the film, who expressed their disappointment and support for Gunn.\n\n### Rehiring Gunn\n\nIn March 2019, Disney rehired James Gunn to direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, following an investigation into his past comments. Gunn's rehiring was seen as a positive development for the film, with many fans and critics expressing their excitement to see the original creative team reunited.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 began in earnest in 2019, with Gunn and the cast returning to work on the film. The production team expanded to include new writers and producers, who worked alongside Gunn to develop the script and story.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 took place from July to November 2021, primarily in Atlanta, Georgia. The production team used a mix of practical and visual effects to bring the film's elaborate action sequences and fantastical worlds to life.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was a complex and time-consuming process, with the film's visual effects and soundtrack requiring extensive work. Gunn and the production team spent several months fine-tuning the film's editing and sound design, before finalizing the film's cut.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe soundtrack for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was composed by John Murphy and John Powell, who returned to the franchise after working on the second film. The soundtrack features a mix of classic rock and pop tracks, as well as an original score that incorporates elements of electronic and orchestral music.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nMarketing for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 began in earnest in 2022, with Marvel Studios releasing a series of promotional materials and trailers for the film. The marketing campaign focused on showcasing the film's action-packed sequences, as well as its emotional and dramatic moments.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was released in theaters on May 5, 2023, in the United States and other countries. The film received a wide release, with many theaters showing the film in 3D and IMAX formats.\n\n### Home media\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was released on digital platforms on June 20, 2023, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on July 11, 2023. The home media release includes a range of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a commentary track from James Gunn.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 grossed over $900 million at the global box office, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2023. The film's performance was driven by its strong opening weekend and positive word-of-mouth, which helped the film maintain its momentum throughout its release.\n\n### Critical response\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics praising the film's action sequences, emotional moments, and visual effects. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.5/10. Many critics praised the film's conclusion to the original team's narrative, which they felt was a satisfying and emotional conclusion to the franchise.\n\n### Accolades\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 received several awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score.

Born on July 26, 1975, in Oxford, England, Truss is a member of the Conservative Party and has held various positions in government, including Foreign Secretary and International Trade Secretary.\n\n**Early life and education (1975–1996)**\n\nLiz Truss was born to John and Priscilla Truss. Her father was a teacher and her mother was a nurse. Truss attended the local comprehensive school, Roundwood Park School, in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. She later studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Merton College, Oxford, graduating in 1996.\n\n**Career**\n\n### Employment and candidatures (1996–2010)\n\nAfter graduating from Oxford, Truss worked as an accountant for Shell Oil and then as a management consultant for Cable & Wireless. In 2000, she was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for the constituency of Chesham and Amersham. She lost the seat in the 2001 general election but was later selected as the candidate for the constituency of Truro and St Austell, which she won in the 2010 general election.\n\n### Backbencher (2010–2012)\n\nTruss served as a backbencher from 2010 to 2012, participating in various parliamentary debates and committees. She was a vocal supporter of the Conservative Party's economic policies and argued in favor of reducing the national deficit.\n\n### Education under-secretary (2012–2014)\n\nIn 2012, Truss was appointed as the Under-Secretary of State for Education, a position she held until 2014. During her tenure, she introduced several education reforms, including reducing the number of national curriculum tests for primary school pupils.\n\n### Environment secretary (2014–2016)\n\nTruss was promoted to the position of Environment Secretary in 2014, a position she held until 2016. She was a strong advocate for reducing carbon emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy sources.\n\n### Justice secretary and lord chancellor (2016–2017)\n\nIn 2016, Truss was appointed as the Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, a position she held until 2017. During her tenure, she introduced several reforms to the justice system, including the introduction of fixed sentences for certain crimes.\n\n### Chief secretary to the Treasury (2017–2019)\n\nTruss was promoted to the position of Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 2017, a position she held until 2019. She was responsible for overseeing the government's economic policies and working closely with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\n### International trade secretary (2019–2021)\n\nIn 2019, Truss was appointed as the International Trade Secretary, a position she held until 2021. She played a key role in negotiating trade agreements with various countries, including the United States and Japan.\n\n### Foreign secretary (2021–2022)\n\nTruss was promoted to the position of Foreign Secretary in 2021, a position she held until 2022. She was responsible for conducting diplomatic relations with other countries and advising the Prime Minister on foreign policy matters.\n\n### Leadership election (July–September 2022)\n\nIn July 2022, Truss announced her candidacy for the Conservative Party leadership election, which was sparked by the resignation of Boris Johnson. She won the first round of voting but lost the second round to Rishi Sunak. However, after Sunak dropped out of the race, Truss won the final round of voting and became the Conservative Party leader.\n\n**Premiership (2022)**\n\n### Cabinet and death of Elizabeth II\n\nTruss formed a new cabinet, which included several of her close allies from her time as Foreign Secretary and International Trade Secretary. She also appointed several new ministers to key positions, including the Home Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. On September 8, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II passed away, marking the end of an era for the United Kingdom. Truss paid tribute to the Queen, praising her dedication to duty and service to the country.\n\n### Domestic policies and mini-budget\n\nTruss's domestic policies focused on reducing taxes and regulation, with a particular emphasis on energy and housing. She announced a mini-budget, which included several key measures, including a cut to the basic income tax rate and the national insurance threshold. However, the measures were widely criticized by economists and opposition politicians, who argued that they would exacerbate the national deficit and worsen inequality.\n\n### Government crisis and resignation\n\nThe mini-budget was met with severe criticism from the financial markets, which responded by raising interest rates and selling off government bonds. The pound sterling plummeted in value, and the government's borrowing costs increased significantly. Truss's popularity plummeted, and she faced intense pressure from her own party to resign. After a series of meetings with her cabinet and Conservative Party members, Truss announced her resignation as Prime Minister on October 20, 2022.\n\n**Post-premiership (2022–present)**\n\nTruss's resignation marked the end of her premiership and the beginning of a new chapter in her career. She has since stepped down as a member of the Conservative Party and is no longer a member of the House of Commons. However, she remains a prominent figure in British politics and continues to be a vocal advocate for her brand of conservatism.\n\n**Political positions**\n\n### Domestic issues\n\nTruss has been a vocal supporter of reducing the national deficit and promoting economic growth.

The fires were fueled by hot and dry weather, strong winds, and a buildup of dry vegetation. The wildfires posed a significant threat to human life and property, as well as the environment and climate.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2023 Canadian wildfires were part of a larger global trend of increasing wildfires, which are often linked to climate change. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have led to an increase in dry conditions, making forests and other vegetation more susceptible to wildfires. In Canada, the risk of wildfires is also exacerbated by the country's geography, with many areas prone to drought and strong winds.\n\n**Wildfires**\n\nThe 2023 Canadian wildfires burned across several provinces and territories, with the majority of the fires occurring in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan.\n\n### Alberta\n\nThe High Level Forest Area was one of the most heavily affected regions in Alberta, with several large fires burning in the area. The fires were fueled by strong winds and dry conditions, and were difficult to contain due to the remote location and rugged terrain.\n\n### British Columbia\n\nBritish Columbia was also heavily affected by the wildfires, with many fires burning in the province's interior and on Vancouver Island. The fires were fueled by hot and dry conditions, and were exacerbated by strong winds and dry lightning.\n\n### Manitoba\n\nManitoba was less affected by the wildfires, but several small fires burned in the province's southern regions.

The battle was one of the longest and bloodiest of the war, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n**Background**\n\nBakhmut, a city of over 70,000 people, is located in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, an area that has been the epicenter of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists since 2014. The city's strategic location, situated on the main road from Donetsk to Kharkiv, makes it a crucial node in the regional transportation network. The surrounding area is also rich in natural resources, including coal and iron ore.\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut began in August 2022, as part of the larger Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russian military, which had been making incremental gains in the Donbas region, sought to capture the city and secure a foothold in the surrounding area.\n\n**Battle**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut can be divided into several phases, each marked by significant changes in the military situation on the ground.\n\n### **Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)**\n\nThe battle began with a series of artillery exchanges between Ukrainian and Russian forces, as the Russian military attempted to soften up the city's defenses. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned, the Ukrainian military managed to hold off the initial Russian advance, inflicting significant casualties on the enemy.\n\nHowever, the Russian military continued to press its advantage, pouring in troops and equipment to reinforce its efforts. The city's defenses began to weaken, and by the end of October, the Russian military had made significant gains, including the capture of several key villages and towns in the surrounding area.\n\n### **Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)**\n\nAs winter set in, the battle for Bakhmut intensified. The Russian military, seeking to exploit the challenging weather conditions, launched a series of fierce attacks on the city, including a major assault on the city's eastern outskirts. The Ukrainian military, however, managed to hold its ground, inflicting significant casualties on the enemy and blunting the Russian advance.\n\nDespite the Ukrainian military's efforts, the Russian military continued to make gains, capturing several key villages and towns in the surrounding area. By the end of December, the Russian military had effectively encircled the city, cutting off the Ukrainian military's supply lines and isolating the city's defenders.\n\n### **Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)**\n\nIn January 2023, the Russian military launched a major assault on the nearby city of Soledar, which had been a key Ukrainian stronghold in the region. Despite fierce resistance from the Ukrainian military, the Russian military managed to capture the city, effectively cutting off the Ukrainian military's supply lines and isolating the city's defenders.\n\nThe capture of Soledar marked a significant turning point in the battle for Bakhmut, as the Russian military began to tighten its grip on the city. The Ukrainian military, however, continued to fight, launching a series of counterattacks in an attempt to break the Russian encirclement.\n\n### **Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)**\n\nIn May 2023, the Ukrainian military launched a series of flanking counterattacks against the Russian military, seeking to break the encirclement and retake the city. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the Ukrainian military managed to make significant gains, inflicting significant casualties on the enemy and pushing the Russian military back.\n\n### **Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)**\n\nOn 20 May 2023, the Ukrainian military launched a final assault on the city, pushing deep into the city's center and capturing key buildings and infrastructure. The Russian military, which had been fighting to hold the city, began to withdraw, with the Wagner Group pulling out its last remaining troops on 1 June 2023.\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut marked a significant turning point in the battle, as the Ukrainian military had finally broken the Russian encirclement and reasserted its control over the city.\n\n**Military strength and tactics**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by a series of intense and bloody battles, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The Russian military, which had been making incremental gains throughout the conflict, ultimately failed to capture the city, despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, which had been fighting to hold the city, managed to hold off the initial Russian advance, inflicting significant casualties on the enemy. However, the Russian military continued to press its advantage, pouring in troops and equipment to reinforce its efforts.\n\nThe Russian military's tactics were marked by a series of brutal and indiscriminate attacks on the city's civilian population, including the use of artillery and airstrikes on civilian targets. The Ukrainian military, however, continued to fight, launching a series of counterattacks in an attempt to break the Russian encirclement.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut had significant strategic implications for both sides, with the city's capture marking a major turning point in the conflict.\n\n### **Strategic value**\n\nThe city of Bakhmut is located in the Donbas region, an area that has been the epicenter of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists since 2014. The city's strategic location, situated on the main road from Donetsk to Kharkiv, makes it a crucial node in the regional transportation network.\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut marked a significant turning point in the conflict, as the Ukrainian military had finally broken the Russian encirclement and reasserted its control over the city. The city's capture also marked a significant blow to the Russian military's efforts to capture the Donbas region, with the Russian military forced to withdraw its troops from the area.\n\n### **Battlefield conditions**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by a series of intense and bloody battles, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The city's infrastructure was severely damaged, with many buildings and homes destroyed or damaged beyond repair.\n\nThe Russian military's tactics were marked by a series of brutal and indiscriminate attacks on the city's civilian population, including the use of artillery and airstrikes on civilian targets. The Ukrainian military, however, continued to fight, launching a series of counterattacks in an attempt to break the Russian encirclement.\n\n### **Casualties**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by a significant number of casualties, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n### **Military casualties**\n\nThe Ukrainian military suffered significant casualties during the battle, with estimates suggesting that up to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers were killed or wounded during the conflict. The Russian military also suffered significant casualties, with estimates suggesting that up to 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded during the conflict.\n\n### **Civilian casualties**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut also had a significant impact on the city's civilian population, with many civilians killed or injured during the conflict. Estimates suggest that up to 10,000 civilians were killed or injured during the conflict, with many more displaced or forced to flee the city.\n\n### **Attrition**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut marked a significant turning point in the conflict, with the Russian military forced to withdraw its troops from the area. The Ukrainian military, however, continued to fight, launching a series of counterattacks in an attempt to break the Russian encirclement.\n\n### **Result**\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut marked a significant turning point in the battle, as the Ukrainian military had finally broken the Russian encirclement and reasserted its control over the city. The city's capture also marked a significant blow to the Russian military's efforts to capture the Donbas region, with the Russian military forced to withdraw its troops from the area.\n\n**Allegations of war crimes**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by a series of allegations of war crimes, with both sides accused of committing atrocities against civilians and prisoners of war.\n\nThe Russian military was accused of committ", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Bakhmut\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n#Military strength and tactics\n#Aftermath\n##Strategic value\n##Battlefield conditions\n##Casualties\n###Military casualties\n###Civilian casualties\n##Attrition\n##Result\n#Allegations of war crimes\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was founded in 1919 and has since become one of the most important art and cultural history museums in Central Europe.\n\n**History**\n\nThe museum's roots date back to 1919, when the Hessian state government decided to establish a museum to showcase the cultural heritage of Hesse. The museum's first director, Bernhard Degenhart, played a crucial role in shaping the institution's early years. During World War II, the museum's collections were severely damaged, with many artifacts being lost or destroyed.\n\nIn the post-war era, the museum underwent a significant transformation. In 1949, the museum was re-established, and its collections were gradually rebuilt. In the 1960s and 1970s, the museum underwent a series of renovations and expansions, which included the addition of new galleries and the creation of a modern museum building.\n\n**Building**\n\nThe museum's current building was designed by the German architect Joachim Schürmann and opened in 1975. The building's design is characterized by its minimalist and modernist aesthetic, with a large glass atrium and a spacious interior.\n\n#### Location\n\nThe museum is located in the heart of Darmstadt, in the city's historic center. The museum's address is Schlossplatz 1, 64283 Darmstadt.\n\n#### Renovations and extensions\n\nIn 2010, the museum underwent a major renovation, which included the addition of new galleries and the creation of a modern museum shop. The renovation also included the installation of new lighting and climate control systems.\n\nIn 2019, the museum celebrated its 100th anniversary with a major exhibition that showcased the museum's collections and highlighted its importance as a cultural institution in Hesse.\n\n**Collections**\n\nThe museum's collections include over 100,000 objects, which span a wide range of topics, including art, cultural history, archaeology, and natural history. The museum's collections are divided into several departments, including:\n\n* **Art and Cultural History**: The museum's art and cultural history collections include paintings, sculptures, and other works of art from the Middle Ages to the present day.\n* **Archaeology**: The museum's archaeology collections include artifacts from ancient civilizations, including Egypt, Greece, and Rome.\n* **Natural History**: The museum's natural history collections include fossils, minerals, and other natural specimens.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nThe museum has several galleries that showcase its collections. Some of the most notable galleries include:\n\n* **The Art Gallery**: The art gallery features a wide range of works of art, including paintings, sculptures, and other objects from the Middle Ages to the present day.\n* **The Archaeology Gallery**: The archaeology gallery features artifacts from ancient civilizations, including Egypt, Greece, and Rome.\n* **The Natural History Gallery**: The natural history gallery features fossils, minerals, and other natural specimens.\n\n**Special exhibitions**\n\nThe museum regularly hosts special exhibitions that showcase its collections and highlight its importance as a cultural institution in Hesse. Some of the most notable special exhibitions include:\n\n* **The 100th Anniversary Exhibition**: In 2019, the museum celebrated its 100th anniversary with a major exhibition that showcased the museum's collections and highlighted its importance as a cultural institution in Hesse.\n* **The Art of the Middle Ages**: In 2018, the museum hosted a special exhibition that showcased its collections of medieval art and culture.\n* **The Archaeology of Ancient Greece**: In 2017, the museum hosted a special exhibition that showcased its collections of ancient Greek artifacts.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nIn 2019, the museum was embroiled in a controversy over the ownership of a rare medieval manuscript. The manuscript, which was believed to be one of the oldest surviving copies of the Bible, was discovered in the museum's collections and was subsequently claimed by a rival museum. The controversy highlighted the importance of museum collections and the need for transparent and accountable ownership practices.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Hessian State Museum Darmstadt** (official website)\n* **Darmstadt** (city website)\n* **Hesse** (state government website)\n\n**Films**\n\n* **\"The Art of the Middle Ages\"** (documentary film, 2018)\n* **\"The Archaeology of Ancient Greece\"** (documentary film, 2017)\n* **\"The 100th Anniversary Exhibition\"** (documentary film, 2019)\n\n**References**\n\n* **\"Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\"** (catalogue, 2019)\n* **\"The Art of the Middle Ages\"** (catalogue, 2018)\n* **\"The Archaeology of Ancient Greece\"** (catalogue, 2017)\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* **\"The History of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\"** (book, 2019)\n* **\"The Collections of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\"** (book, 2018)\n* **\"The Archaeology of Ancient Greece\"** (book, 2017)\n\n**External links**\n\n* **Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt** (official website)\n* **Darmstadt** (city website)\n* **Hesse** (state government website)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hessisches_Landesmuseum_Darmstadt\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Building\n##Location\n##Renovations and extensions\n#Collections\n#Gallery\n#Special exhibitions\n#Controversies\n#See also\n#Films\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His father, Vasily Ivanovich Suvorov, was a Russian nobleman and military officer who served in the Russian army during the Great Northern War. Alexander was the eldest of six children, and his family was part of the Russian nobility.\n\nChildhood\n\nSuvorov's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and military training.

The country's rich history, which spans over a thousand years, has been marked by various periods of foreign rule, cultural exchange, and political upheaval, all of which have left an indelible mark on its heraldic heritage.\n\n# Medieval Period\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nDuring the medieval period, the concept of heraldry was in its formative stages, and the distinction between different families and regions was often unclear. In Albania, the lack of a strong centralized authority and the presence of multiple ethnic groups created an environment where heraldic symbols were not always well-defined or consistently used. This ambiguity is reflected in the scarcity of surviving coats of arms from this period, which often bear similarities and overlaps with those of neighboring regions.\n\n## Regnum Albaniae\n\nThe Regnum Albaniae, also known as the Kingdom of Albania, was a medieval state that emerged in the 12th century. During this period, the country's nobility and aristocracy developed their own distinct heraldic traditions, which were influenced by the Byzantine and Ottoman empires. The Regnum Albaniae's coats of arms often featured symbols associated with the country's rich cultural heritage, such as the double-headed eagle, the crowned lion, and the crescent moon.\n\n## Feudal Lords\n\nFeudal lords, who held power and influence over specific territories and regions, played a significant role in shaping Albania's heraldic identity. These nobles and aristocrats often adopted coats of arms that reflected their individual and family histories, as well as their relationships with neighboring families and kingdoms. The feudal lords' heraldic symbols often featured animals, geometric shapes, and other motifs that conveyed their status, power, and prestige.\n\n# Albanian Nobility\n\n## Austria-Hungary\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Albania experienced a period of foreign rule under the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This led to the introduction of new heraldic symbols and the adoption of existing ones from neighboring regions. The nobility of Albania, which had previously used a range of heraldic devices, began to adopt more standardized and formalized coats of arms, often featuring the Imperial Eagle and other symbols associated with the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\n## Italian States\n\n### La Serenissima\n\nThe Republic of Venice, also known as La Serenissima, was a powerful maritime state that dominated the Mediterranean for centuries. Albania's nobility and aristocracy had close ties with the Venetian Republic, which led to the adoption of similar heraldic symbols. The double-headed eagle, a symbol of the Venetian Republic, became a popular motif in Albanian heraldry, often paired with other symbols such as the lion and the crescent moon.\n\n#### Albania Vèneta\n\nThe Albanian Vèneta was a medieval region that corresponded to the modern-day territories of Albania and Montenegro. During the 14th and 15th centuries, this region was part of the Venetian Republic, which had a significant impact on its heraldic heritage. The Albanian Vèneta's nobility and aristocracy adopted coats of arms that reflected their connection to the Venetian Republic, often featuring the double-headed eagle and other symbols associated with the Venetian Empire.\n\n#### Dalmatia\n\nDalmatia, a region in modern-day Croatia, was also part of the Venetian Republic. Albania's nobility and aristocracy had close ties with the Dalmatian nobility, which led to the adoption of similar heraldic symbols. The Dalmatian coat of arms, featuring a red and white checkered pattern, became a popular motif in Albanian heraldry, often paired with other symbols such as the lion and the crescent moon.\n\n#### Istria\n\nIstria, a region in modern-day Croatia, was also part of the Venetian Republic. Albania's nobility and aristocracy had close ties with the Istrian nobility, which led to the adoption of similar heraldic symbols. The Istrian coat of arms, featuring a red and white checkered pattern, became a popular motif in Albanian heraldry, often paired with other symbols such as the lion and the crescent moon.\n\n### Dicio Pontificia\n\nThe Papal States, also known as Dicio Pontificia, was a medieval state that existed from the 8th to the 19th centuries. Albania's nobility and aristocracy had close ties with the Papal States, which led to the adoption of similar heraldic symbols. The Papal coat of arms, featuring the keys of St. Peter, became a popular motif in Albanian heraldry, often paired with other symbols such as the lion and the crescent moon.\n\n### Genoa, Neapolis, Sicilia...\n\nAlbania's nobility and aristocracy also had close ties with the Genoese Republic, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Kingdom of Sicily. These connections led to the adoption of similar heraldic symbols, such as the Genoese cross, the Neapolitan eagle, and the Sicilian arms.\n\n## Moldavia & Romania\n\nThe Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, which corresponded to modern-day Romania, had close ties with Albania's nobility and aristocracy. The Moldavian and Wallachian coats of arms, featuring the double-headed eagle and other symbols, became popular motifs in Albanian heraldry.\n\n## Greece\n\nAlbania's nobility and aristocracy had close ties with the Byzantine Empire, which led to the adoption of similar heraldic symbols. The Byzantine coat of arms, featuring the double-headed eagle, became a popular motif in Albanian heraldry, often paired with other symbols such as the lion and the crescent moon.\n\n## Ottoman Empire\n\n### Grand Viziers\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, which ruled Albania from the 14th to the 20th centuries, had a significant impact on the country's heraldic heritage. The Grand Viziers of the Ottoman Empire, who held the highest office in the empire, adopted coats of arms that reflected their status and power. These coats of arms often featured the Ottoman crescent moon and other symbols associated with the empire.\n\n## Egypt\n\nAlbania's nobility and aristocracy also had close ties with the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, which led to the adoption of similar heraldic symbols. The Mamluk coat of arms, featuring the lion and the crescent moon, became a popular motif in Albanian heraldry.\n\n# Modern Period\n\nDuring the modern period, Albania experienced a range of political and social changes that had a significant impact on its heraldic heritage. The country's nobility and aristocracy continued to use coats of arms that reflected their individual and family histories, as well as their relationships with neighboring families and kingdoms.\n\n# Ecclesiastical Coats of Arms\n\n## Coats of Arms\n\nThe ecclesiastical coats of arms of Albania's noble families and aristocratic clans often featured symbols associated with the country's rich cultural heritage, such as the double-headed eagle, the crowned lion, and the crescent moon. These coats of arms often paired with other symbols such as the cross, the mitre, and the keys of St. Peter.\n\n## Seals\n\nAlbania's noble families and aristocratic clans also used seals that featured their coats of arms or other symbols associated with their status and power. These seals often bore the family motto and other heraldic devices that reflected their individual and family histories.\n\n# In Society\n\nIn Albanian society, coats of arms played an important role in conveying status, power, and prestige. The use of heraldic symbols was often associated with nobility and aristocratic clans, who used these symbols to distinguish themselves from their less privileged counterparts.

The event was sparked by the enrollment of African American student James Meredith, who had been admitted to the university earlier that year under the terms of a federal court order.\n\n**Leadup**\n\nIn the early 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement was gaining momentum across the United States, with many African Americans seeking to exercise their constitutional rights, including the right to equal education. James Meredith, a 29-year-old Air Force veteran, had applied to Ole Miss in 1961, but was rejected due to the university's segregationist policies.\n\n## Meredith's attempts to enroll\n\nMeredith appealed the decision, and in October 1961, he filed a lawsuit against the university, claiming that he had been denied admission on the basis of his race. The case, Meredith v. Fair, eventually made its way to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in Meredith's favor in September 1962. The court ordered Ole Miss to admit Meredith as a student.\n\n## Kennedy dialogue and escalating tensions\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy was informed of the court's decision and was advised by his advisors to take a strong stance in support of Meredith's admission. Kennedy expressed his concerns to his brother Robert, the U.S. Attorney General, and to other officials, stating that the federal government would not allow the university to defy the court's order. However, Kennedy also expressed his desire to avoid using federal troops to enforce the decision, and instead sought to work with state officials to find a peaceful solution.\n\nAs tensions escalated on the Ole Miss campus, federal officials began to prepare for the possibility of violence. The U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI were deployed to the site to monitor the situation and to provide support to Meredith.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn September 30, 1962, James Meredith arrived on the Ole Miss campus, accompanied by a group of federal marshals and FBI agents. The group was met with a large crowd of protesters, who were determined to prevent Meredith from enrolling.\n\n## Violence on campus\n\nAs Meredith and his escort attempted to make their way to the university's administration building, they were confronted by a mob of protesters. The crowd was largely composed of white students, faculty, and local residents, who were opposed to Meredith's enrollment. The situation quickly escalated into violence, with protesters throwing rocks, bottles, and other objects at Meredith and his escort.\n\n## Military response\n\nAs the violence continued, President Kennedy deployed federal troops to the Ole Miss campus to restore order. The troops, who were largely composed of paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division, were authorized to use force to protect Meredith and to maintain order.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe Ole Miss Riot of 1962 was a traumatic event for the university and the surrounding community. The violence and chaos caused by the riot led to widespread condemnation of the protesters and the university's administration. In the aftermath of the event, the university's president, Dr. J.D. Williams, was forced to resign, and several students and faculty members were disciplined for their roles in the violence.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Ole Miss Riot of 1962 was a significant event in the Civil Rights Movement, marking a major milestone in the struggle for racial equality in the United States. The event highlighted the depth of racial tensions in the South and the need for federal intervention to enforce the law and protect the rights of African Americans.\n\nIn the years following the riot, the University of Mississippi began to take steps to address its segregationist policies and to become more inclusive of African American students. In 1965, the university admitted its first African American woman, and in 1969, it admitted its first African American woman to the law school.\n\n**Notes and references**\n\n## Notes\n\n* The Ole Miss Riot of 1962 was a pivotal event in the Civil Rights Movement, marking a major milestone in the struggle for racial equality in the United States.\n* The event highlighted the depth of racial tensions in the South and the need for federal intervention to enforce the law and protect the rights of African Americans.\n* The University of Mississippi has since taken steps to address its segregationist policies and to become more inclusive of African American students.\n\n## Citations and references\n\n* (no citations or references)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ole_Miss_riot_of_1962\" following this outline:\n\n#Leadup\n##Meredith's attempts to enroll\n##Kennedy dialogue and escalating tensions\n#Events\n##Meredith arrives\n##Violence on campus\n##Military response\n##Aftermath\n#Legacy\n#Notes and references\n##Notes\n##Citations and references\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is situated at the summit of the butte (hill) Montmartre, offering panoramic views of the city. The basilica is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Paris and is a popular tourist destination.\n\n**History**\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe idea of building a basilica on the hill of Montmartre dates back to the 19th century. In 1860, the Catholic Church in France launched a campaign to build a shrine dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, with the goal of promoting devotion to the Heart of Christ. The proposal was met with enthusiasm by the French people, and a site was chosen on the hill of Montmartre, which offered a panoramic view of the city.\n\n### Site\n\nThe site chosen for the basilica was a former quarry, where limestone had been extracted for centuries. The quarry was transformed into a garden, and a large cross was erected on the site. The cross was later replaced by a statue of the Virgin Mary, which was placed at the summit of the hill.\n\n### Construction\n\nConstruction of the basilica began in 1875, with the laying of the foundation stone by the Archbishop of Paris, Théodore-Augustin Forcade. The project was entrusted to architect Paul Abadie, who designed the basilica in the Byzantine Romanesque style. The construction process was slow and laborious, with the basilica taking 46 years to complete. The final stone was laid in 1923.\n\n### Controversy over the church\n\nThe construction of the basilica was not without controversy. Many Parisians were opposed to the idea of building a large church on the hill of Montmartre, which was a popular spot for artists and intellectuals. The controversy surrounding the basilica was heightened by the fact that it was built on a site that had previously been used for quarrying and other industrial activities. The basilica's design and location were also criticized by many, who saw it as a symbol of the Catholic Church's attempts to impose its will on the city.\n\n**Description**\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe exterior of the basilica is imposing, with a large dome that rises above the hill. The dome is decorated with a statue of the Virgin Mary, which is surrounded by four smaller statues of angels. The basilica's façade is made of white limestone, with a large entrance door that is flanked by two smaller doors. The entrance is guarded by two large stone statues of lions.\n\n### Interior\n\nThe interior of the basilica is impressive, with a large nave and two smaller aisles that are separated by a series of arches. The ceiling of the nave is decorated with a large mosaic, which depicts the Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The basilica's interior is also decorated with a number of chapels, which are dedicated to various saints and martyrs.\n\n#### The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n\nThe Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic is a large and impressive work of art that adorns the ceiling of the basilica's nave. The mosaic was created by French artist Luc-Olivier Merson and took several years to complete. The mosaic depicts the Sacred Heart of Jesus surrounded by a number of angels and saints, who are shown ascending to heaven.\n\n#### Chapels\n\nThe basilica has a number of chapels that are dedicated to various saints and martyrs. These chapels are located on both sides of the nave and are decorated with a number of works of art, including stained glass windows and sculptures. Some of the chapels are dedicated to specific themes, such as the Chapelle de la Vierge, which is dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\n#### Crypt\n\nThe crypt of the basilica is located beneath the altar and is a popular spot for prayer and reflection. The crypt is decorated with a number of works of art, including mosaics and sculptures. It is also home to a number of relics, including a fragment of the True Cross.\n\n**Art and decoration**\n\n### Stained glass\n\nThe basilica is home to a number of stained glass windows, which were created by French artist Charles Connick. The windows depict a number of scenes from the Bible and are considered some of the most beautiful in the world.\n\n### Sculpture\n\nThe basilica is also home to a number of sculptures, which were created by French artists such as Auguste Rodin and Camille Claudel. The sculptures depict a number of scenes from the Bible and are considered some of the most important works of art in the basilica.\n\n**Grand organ**\n\nThe basilica is home to a large and impressive pipe organ, which was built by French organ maker Aristide Cavaillé-Coll. The organ is considered one of the finest in the world and is used regularly in concerts and other events.\n\n**Bells**\n\nThe basilica is home to a number of bells, which were cast by French bell founder Marcel Proust. The bells are used regularly in services and other events and are considered some of the most beautiful in the world.\n\n**Role in Catholicism**\n\nThe Sacré-Cœur Basilica plays an important role in Catholicism, as it is one of the most important shrines dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The basilica is a popular pilgrimage site, and thousands of people visit it each year. The basilica is also an important symbol of the Catholic Church's presence in Paris and is considered one of the most important landmarks in the city.\n\n**Access**\n\nThe basilica is open to visitors throughout the year, and admission is free. Visitors can climb to the top of the dome for panoramic views of the city. The basilica is also home to a number of shops and restaurants, which offer a range of products and services.\n\n**Copy in Martinique**\n\nA copy of the Sacré-Cœur Basilica was built in Martinique, a French island in the Caribbean. The copy was built in 1891 and is a popular tourist destination on the island.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of tallest structures in Paris\n* List of buildings and structures in Paris\n* List of Roman Catholic cathedrals in France\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**Bibliography (in French)**\n\n* \"La Basilique du Sacré-Cœur de Paris\" by Paul Abadie\n* \"Histoire de la Basilique du Sacré-Cœur de Paris\" by Théodore-Augustin Forcade\n* \"La Basilique du Sacré-Cœur de Paris, son histoire, son architecture\" by Marcel Proust\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Sacré-Cœur Basilica of Paris\" by John F.

The women are forced to wear the same type of clothes and hairstyles, and the men are expected to be providers and protectors. The town is also heavily surveilled, with cameras and microphones monitoring every aspect of the residents' lives.\n\nAlice becomes increasingly unhappy with her situation and starts to rebel against the town's rules.

The Roman slave system was complex, with various forms of enslavement, classification, and treatment of slaves.\n\n**Origins**\n\nSlavery in ancient Rome originated from various sources, including the enslavement of Roman citizens, war captives, and debtors.\n\n### Enslavement of Roman citizens\n\nRoman citizens were occasionally enslaved as a result of debt or other forms of debt bondage. The Roman Republic's increasing reliance on slave labor led to a rise in debt slavery, with citizens being forced to sell themselves or their families into bondage.\n\n**The slave in Roman law and society**\n\nSlaves in ancient Rome were considered property, with limited rights and protections under the law. However, Roman law did recognize certain privileges and obligations for slaves.\n\n### Marriage and family\n\nSlaves were not recognized as having a legal family, but they could form informal relationships with other slaves or free individuals. Some slaves were granted manumission, or freedom, as part of a family or household.\n\n### Peculium\n\nPeculium was a form of property or savings set aside for slaves, allowing them to accumulate wealth and achieve a degree of financial independence.\n\n### Manumission\n\nManumission was the process of freeing a slave, which could be granted by a slave's owner or through a court order. Freedmen, or former slaves, often retained close ties to their former owners or households.\n\n### Freedmen\n\nFreedmen were individuals who had been granted manumission and were recognized as free people. However, they often faced social and economic challenges, including limited access to citizenship and property rights.\n\n### Dediticii\n\nDediticii were individuals who had surrendered to their enemies in battle and were subsequently enslaved. This form of enslavement was often seen as a form of punishment or dishonor.\n\n**Causes of enslavement**\n\nEnslavement in ancient Rome resulted from various causes, including war, piracy, and debt.\n\n### War captives\n\nCaptivi were individuals taken prisoner in battle and sold into slavery. This form of enslavement was a common occurrence in ancient Rome, particularly during times of war.\n\n### Captivi in Roman culture\n\nCaptivi were often seen as a valuable source of slave labor, and their treatment varied depending on the circumstances of their capture.\n\n### Piracy and kidnapping\n\nPiracy and kidnapping were other common causes of enslavement in ancient Rome. Pirates and kidnappers often targeted wealthy individuals or families, selling them into slavery or holding them for ransom.\n\n### Vernae\n\nVernae were slaves born into bondage, often the children of slaves or servants. They were considered property from birth and were often treated as inferior to other slav", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Slavery_in_ancient_Rome\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Enslavement of Roman citizens\n#The slave in Roman law and society\n##Marriage and family\n##Peculium\n##Manumission\n##Freedmen\n##Dediticii\n#Causes of enslavement\n##War captives\n###Captivi in Roman culture\n##Piracy and kidnapping\n##Vernae\n###Alumni\n##Child labor\n###Child abandonment\n###Infant exposure\n###Parental sale\n##Debt slavery\n##Self-sales\n#The slave economy\n##The slave trade\n###Auctions and sales\n###Slave-traders\n###Taxes and tariffs\n##Types of work\n###Household slaves\n###Urban crafts and services\n###Agriculture\n###Hard labor\n###Public and imperial slaves\n###Business managers and agents\n###Gladiators, entertainers, and prostitutes\n##Serfdom\n#Demography\n##Race and ethnicity\n#Quality of life\n##Healthcare\n###Physicians\n##Cicero and Tiro\n##Names\n##Clothing\n#Resistance and control\n##Rebellions\n###First Servile War (135–132 BC)\n###Second Servile War (104–100 BC)\n###Third Servile War (73–71 BC)\n###Later uprisings\n##Fugitive slave-catching\n###The fugitive in Roman culture\n##Punishments\n###Chaining\n###Tattooing and branding\n###Collaring\n###Crucifixion\n##Suicide\n#Slavery and Roman religion\n##Slaves in classical Roman religion\n###Saturnalia\n###The Festival of Handmaids\n##Temple slaves\n##Mithraic cult\n##Early Christian church\n#Commemoration\n#Slavery and Roman morality\n##Stoic philosophy\n##Epicurean philosophy\n##Early Christian attitudes toward slavery\n##Sexual ethics and attitudes\n#In Latin and Imperial Greek literature\n##Roman comedy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are well adapted to their harsh, cold environments, with distinctive physical characteristics and behaviors that enable them to survive in these regions. Reindeer are an important part of the ecosystems in which they live, playing a vital role in shaping the landscape and providing food and clothing for indigenous communities.\n\n**Description**\n\nReindeer are large, herbivorous mammals, with adults typically weighing between 150 and 200 kilograms (330 and 440 pounds) and reaching heights of 1.2 to 1.5 meters (4 to 5 feet) at the shoulder. They have a distinctive set of antlers, which are grown by both males and females, and are used for defense, fighting, and attracting mates. Reindeer also have a thick, insulating coat of fur, which helps to keep them warm in the freezing temperatures of their native habitats.\n\n**Status**\n\nReindeer are widely distributed across the Arctic and subarctic regions of the world, with populations found in the northernmost parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. However, their populations are declining in many areas due to habitat loss, hunting, and climate change. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the reindeer as \"Least Concern,\" but many subspecies are considered endangered or vulnerable.\n\n**Naming**\n\nReindeer have been known by many different names throughout history. In North America, they are commonly referred to as caribou, while in Europe and Asia, they are known as reindeer. The name \"reindeer\" is thought to have originated from the Old Norse word \"hreinn,\" which means \"reindeer.\" The scientific name for the species, Rangifer tarandus, was given by the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carolus Linnaeus in the 18th century.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nReindeer are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor with other deer species around 2 million years ago. They are closely related to the musk deer and the water deer, and share many physical and behavioral characteristics with these species. Over time, reindeer have adapted to their harsh, cold environments, developing unique physical characteristics such as their antlers, fur, and hooves.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\n### Naming and research on museum collections\n\nReindeer have been extensively studied and described in museum collections around the world. Many specimens have been collected and preserved, providing valuable information about the species' anatomy, physiology, and behavior. The study of museum collections has also helped to identify and describe many different subspecies of reindeer, which are often defined by their geographic range and physical characteristics.\n\n### Biological exploration expeditions\n\nMany biological exploration expeditions have been conducted to study reindeer populations in their native habitats. These expeditions have provided valuable information about the species' ecology, behavior, and population dynamics, and have helped to identify areas of high conservation value. The first biological exploration expedition to study reindeer was conducted by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen in the early 20th century.\n\n### Reclassification\n\nIn recent years, there has been a reclassification of reindeer into several different species and subspecies. This is based on genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence, which has helped to identify distinct populations with unique physical and behavioral characteristics. The reclassification of reindeer has been driven by advances in genetic technology and the development of new analytical techniques.\n\n### Ecotypes\n\nReindeer are thought to consist of several different ecotypes, which are defined by their geographic range and physical characteristics. These ecotypes are thought to have evolved in response to different environmental pressures, such as climate, habitat, and predation. The different ecotypes of reindeer are thought to be adapted to specific environments, and have unique physical and behavioral characteristics that enable them to survive in these areas.\n\n### Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n\nGenetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence has provided valuable information about the evolution and diversity of reindeer. This evidence has helped to identify distinct populations with unique physical and behavioral characteristics, and has provided insights into the species' ecology and behavior. The study of genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence has also helped to identify areas of high conservation value, and has informed conservation efforts.\n\n### Novel genetics-based clades\n\nRecent studies have identified novel genetics-based clades of reindeer, which are thought to have evolved in response to different environmental pressures. These clades are thought to be adapted to specific environments, and have unique physical and behavioral characteristics that enable them to survive in these areas. The identification of novel genetics-based clades has provided valuable insights into the evolution and diversity of reindeer, and has informed conservation efforts.\n\n**Species and subspecies**\n\nThere are several different species and subspecies of reindeer, which are thought to have evolved in response to different environmental pressures. The most well-known species of reindeer is the caribou (Rangifer tarandus), which is found in the Arctic regions of North America. Other species of reindeer include the Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus), which is found in the Svalbard archipelago, and the Finnish reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus), which is found in the northern parts of Finland.\n\n**Physical characteristics**\n\n### Antlers\n\nReindeer have a distinctive set of antlers, which are grown by both males and females. The antlers are made of bone and are covered in a layer of velvet, which is a soft, fuzzy material. The antlers are used for defense, fighting, and attracting mates, and are shed and regrown every year.\n\n### Pelt\n\nReindeer have a thick, insulating coat of fur, which helps to keep them warm in the freezing temperatures of their native habitats. The fur is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. The undercoat is made up of soft, fine hairs that provide insulation, while the guard hairs are longer and coarser, and help to repel water and snow.\n\n### Heat exchange\n\nReindeer are able to regulate their body temperature in extreme cold by exchanging heat between their body and the environment. They do this by using their ears and nose to lose heat, and by using their fur to trap heat close to their body.\n\n### Hooves\n\nReindeer have large, hooved feet that are well adapted to their native habitats. The hooves are made of a tough, keratin-based material that is resistant to wear and tear. They are also able to absorb shock and provide traction on slippery surfaces.\n\n### Size\n\nReindeer can vary in size depending on the subspecies and the sex of the individual. Males are typically larger than females, and can weigh up to 200 kilograms (440 pounds).\n\n### Clicking sound\n\nReindeer are able to make a distinctive clicking sound by clicking their hooves on the ground. This sound is often heard when they are running or walking on hard surfaces.\n\n### Eyes\n\nReindeer have large, dark eyes that are well adapted to their native habitats. Their eyes are able to see in low light conditions, and are able to detect movement and changes in the environment.\n\n**Biology and behaviors**\n\n### Seasonal body composition\n\nReindeer are able to adjust their body composition in response to changing seasons. In the summer, they are able to eat a diet rich in plant material and gain weight. In the winter, they are able to live off their stored fat reserves and lose weight.\n\n### Reproduction and life cycle\n\nReindeer are able to breed in the summer, and give birth to a single calf in the spring. The calf is able to nurse for several months, and is weaned after about 6-8 months. Reindeer can live for up to 15 years in the wild.\n\n### Social structure, migration and range\n\nReindeer are able to form complex social structures, with individuals living in small herds. These herds are often led by a dominant female, and are able to migrate long distances in search of food and suitable habitats. Reindeer are able to range over large areas, and are found in many different habitats, including tundra, forest, and grasslands.\n\n**Ecology**\n\n### Distribution and habitat\n\nReindeer are found in many different parts of the world, including the Arctic regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. They are able to live in a variety of habitats, including tundra, forest, and grasslands.\n\n### Diet\n\nReindeer are able to eat a variety of plant material, including grasses, leaves, and lichens. They are also able to eat mosses and other small plants. In the winter, they are able to survive on their stored fat reserves and eat very little.\n\n### Predators\n\nReindeer have a number of predators, including wolves, bears, and mountain lions. These predators are able to hunt reindeer in a variety of ways, including stalking and ambushing.\n\n### Other threats\n\nReindeer are also threatened by other factors, including habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and human activity. These threats can impact the population size and distribution of reindeer, and can also impact their behavior and ecology.\n\n**Conservation**\n\n### Current status\n\nReindeer are listed as \"Least Concern\" on the IUCN Red List, but many subspecies are considered endangered or vulnerable. The population size and distribution of reindeer are impacted by a variety of factors, including habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and human activity.\n\n### Boreal woodland caribou\n\nThe boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the boreal forests of North America. This subspecies is considered endangered, and is listed on the IUCN Red List.\n\n### Peary caribou\n\nThe Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the Arctic tundra of North America. This subspecies is considered vulnerable, and is listed on the IUCN Red List.\n\n**Relationship with humans**\n\n### Indigenous North Americans\n\nReindeer have been an important part of the culture and economy of indigenous North American communities for thousands of years. They are used for food, clothing, and other essential needs.\n\n### Indigenous Eurasians\n\nReindeer have also been an important part of the culture and economy of indigenous Eurasian communities for thousands of years. They are used for food, clothing, and other essential needs.\n\n### Husbandry\n\nReindeer are often kept in captivity for their meat, milk, and hides. They are also used for transportation and other purposes.\n\n### History\n\nReindeer have been an important part of human history for thousands of years. They were used by ancient cultures for food, clothing, and other essential needs.\n\n### Santa Claus\n\nReindeer are often associated with Santa Claus, who is said to ride on the back of a reindeer-led sleigh on Christmas Eve.\n\n### Mythology and art\n\nReindeer have been depicted in many forms of mythology and art throughout history. They are often associated with magic, fertility, and other symbolic themes.\n\n### Heraldry and symbols\n\nReindeer are often used as symbols in heraldry and other forms of art.

Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. It is characterized by its unique blend of science fiction, philosophy, and spiritual practices. Scientology's teachings emphasize the individual's spiritual journey and the attainment of spiritual enlightenment through a process called auditing. The movement has been the subject of intense controversy and debate, with some regarding it as a legitimate religion and others as a cult or pseudoscience.\n\nDefinition and classification\n-----------------------------\n\n### Debates over classification\n\nScientology's classification as a religion has been the subject of debate. Some governments and courts have recognized Scientology as a legitimate religion, while others have refused to do so. Critics of Scientology argue that it is not a true religion, but rather a business or a cult.\n\n### Etymology\n\nThe term \"Scientology\" is derived from the word \"science,\" which refers to the movement's emphasis on empirical knowledge and self-discovery. The term \"ology\" refers to the study of something, in this case, the study of the self and the universe.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nScientology was founded by L. Ron Hubbard in 1954. Hubbard was a science fiction author who developed the movement's teachings over several years. He drew inspiration from various sources, including Eastern spirituality, occultism, and science fiction. The movement gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, with Hubbard establishing the Church of Scientology in 1955.\n\nBeliefs and practices\n----------------------\n\n### Auditing\n\nAuditing is a central practice in Scientology. It involves a trained auditor who uses a device called an E-meter to detect the emotional state of the individual being audited. The auditor then guides the individual through a series of exercises and questions to help them confront and resolve past traumas and emotional blockages. Auditing is said to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment and improve their mental and emotional well-being.\n\n### Soul\n\nScientologists believe in the concept of the \"thetan,\" which refers to the spiritual essence of an individual. Thetans are said to be immortal and have lived multiple lifetimes on Earth and other planets. The thetan is seen as a powerful, independent being that has been trapped in a physical body.\n\n### Space opera and the Wall of Fire\n\nScientology's teachings include a unique cosmology, which describes the universe as a vast, interconnected web of spiritual energies and galaxies. This cosmology is often referred to as the \"space opera\" or \"Xenu myth.\" According to Scientology, the universe was once a peaceful and prosperous place, but was ravaged by a cataclysmic event known as the \"Wall of Fire,\" which destroyed entire galaxies and left the thetans in a state of spiritual trauma.\n\n### The Operating Thetan levels\n\nScientologists who have achieved a certain level of spiritual enlightenment can become Operating Thetans (OTs). OTs are said to have achieved a state of spiritual mastery and are able to manipulate the physical universe through their thoughts and intentions. There are several levels of OT, each representing a higher level of spiritual attainment.\n\n### Ethics\n\nScientology places a strong emphasis on ethics and moral conduct. Scientologists are expected to adhere to a strict code of ethics, which includes principles such as honesty, integrity, and respect for others. Those who fail to adhere to these principles can be subject to disciplinary action, including expulsion from the Church.\n\n### Symbology\n\nScientology's teachings include a complex system of symbology, which is used to convey spiritual and philosophical concepts. This symbology includes the use of symbols, diagrams, and other visual aids to help individuals understand complex ideas and principles.\n\n### Psychiatry, psychology, psychosis\n\nScientology has been critical of psychiatry and psychology, which it sees as pseudosciences that are often used to control and manipulate individuals. Scientology's teachings emphasize the importance of individual freedom and the rejection of psychiatric and psychological concepts.\n\n### Views on Hubbard\n\nScientologists view L. Ron Hubbard as a spiritual leader and a visionary who founded the movement. They see him as a messenger of the divine, who brought spiritual enlightenment to humanity.\n\nThe Church of Scientology\n-------------------------\n\n### Internal organization\n\nThe Church of Scientology is a hierarchical organization, with a central leadership and a network of local churches and missions. The church is divided into several departments, including the Church of Scientology International, the Sea Organization, and the Church of Spiritual Technology.\n\n### Promotional material\n\nThe Church of Scientology produces a wide range of promotional material, including books, films, and videos. This material is used to promote the church's teachings and attract new members.\n\n### Social outreach\n\nThe Church of Scientology engages in various social outreach activities, including disaster relief, education, and community development. The church also sponsors various charitable organizations and initiatives.\n\n### Responses to opponents\n\nThe Church of Scientology has responded to criticisms and opposition from various quarters, including the media, governments, and former members. The church has been accused of using aggressive tactics to silence critics and opponents.\n\n### Suppressive persons and fair game\n\nScientology's teachings include the concept of \"suppressive persons,\" which refers to individuals who are hostile to the church and its teachings. Suppressive persons are seen as a threat to the church and its members, and can be subject to various forms of harassment and intimidation. The church's policy of \"fair game\" allows it to target and persecute those who it sees as a threat.\n\nFree Zone and independent Scientology\n--------------------------------------\n\nFree Zone Scientology refers to a network of independent Scientology groups and individuals who operate outside of the Church of Scientology's official structure. These groups and individuals often follow their own interpretations of Scientology's teachings and may be critical of the church's policies and practices.\n\nControversies\n-------------\n\n### Hubbard's motives\n\nCritics of Scientology have questioned L. Ron Hubbard's motives and the church's true intentions. Some have accused the church of being a business or a cult, rather than a legitimate religion.\n\n### Criminal behavior\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been accused of engaging in various forms of criminal behavior, including harassment, intimidation, and financial exploitation. The church has also been accused of using its wealth and influence to silence critics and opponents.\n\n### Organized harassment\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been accused of using organized harassment tactics against its critics and opponents. This includes surveillance, intimidation, and disinformation campaigns.\n\n### Mistreatment of Members\n\nSeveral former members have come forward with allegations of mistreatment at the hands of the Church of Scientology. This includes physical and emotional abuse, financial exploitation, and psychological manipulation.\n\n### Violation of auditing confidentiality\n\nCritics of Scientology have accused the church of violating the confidentiality of auditing sessions. This includes the use of auditing records to blackmail and intimidate members.\n\n### Allegations of coerced abortions\n\nSeveral former members have alleged that the Church of Scientology ha", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Scientology\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and classification\n##Debates over classification\n##Etymology\n#History\n#Beliefs and practices\n##Auditing\n##Soul\n##Space opera and the Wall of Fire\n##The Operating Thetan levels\n##Ethics\n##Symbology\n##Psychiatry, psychology, psychosis\n##Views on Hubbard\n#The Church of Scientology\n##Internal organization\n##Promotional material\n##Social outreach\n##Responses to opponents\n##Suppressive persons and fair game\n#Free Zone and independent Scientology\n#Controversies\n##Hubbard's motives\n##Criminal behavior\n##Organized harassment\n###Mistreatment of Members\n##Violation of auditing confidentiality\n##Allegations of coerced abortions\n##Allegation of human trafficking and other crimes against women\n##Scientology, litigation, and the Internet\n#Disputes over legal status\n#Scientology in religious studies\n##Influences\n#Demographics\n##Recruitment\n#Reception and influence\n##Media, popular culture, and academia\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The entry was a reenactment of the traditional coronation ceremony, in which the queen was led to the throne and presented with the symbols of her office.\n\n**Coronation**\n\n**The mount and St Edward's chair**\n\nAt the coronation, Mary was seated on the throne, which was supported by a pair of velvet cushions known as the \"mount.\" She was then presented with St Edward's chair, which was the throne of the Saxon kings and was seen as a symbol of the queen's authority.\n\n**The traverse**\n\nAs part of the coronation ceremony, Mary was led through the \"traverse,\" which was a symbolic path that represented the queen's journey from her coronation to her accession to the throne. The traverse was lined with nobles and clergy, who represented the different orders of society and the various branches of the church.\n\n**Three crowns and two sceptres**\n\nAs part of the coronation ceremony, Mary was presented with three crowns and two sceptres. The crowns were the symbols of her authority as queen, while the sceptres represented her power over the church and the state.\n\n**Banquet in Westminster Hall**\n\n**The champion**\n\nAs part of the coronation celebrations, a champion was chosen to defend the queen's honor and to represent her at the banquet.
