The company is headquartered in the Caribbean island nation of Bahamas and has been one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in terms of trading volume and market share.\n\n#History\n\nFTX was founded in January 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, a former trader at Jane Street, and Gary Wang, a former intern at Jane Street. Initially, the company focused on offering a range of cryptocurrency derivatives, including futures, options, and perpetual swaps. In May 2019, FTX raised $8 million in funding from investors, including Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.\n\nIn the months that followed, FTX rapidly expanded its user base and trading volume, becoming one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in terms of market share. The company also introduced a range of innovative features, including a lending program that allowed users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings.\n\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn November 2022, a crisis began to unfold at FTX, which would ultimately lead to the company's bankruptcy. The crisis was triggered by a series of events, including a report by CoinDesk, a cryptocurrency news outlet, that FTX had loaned billions of dollars worth of customer funds to Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nAccording to the report, Alameda Research had used the borrowed funds to trade cryptocurrencies, including FTX's native token, FTT. The report also revealed that Alameda Research had invested heavily in FTX and had a significant stake in the company.\n\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nThe crisis at FTX began to unfold on November 2, 2022, when Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, announced that it had agreed to acquire FTX for $4.2 billion. However, just hours later, Binance announced that it was withdrawing its bid to acquire FTX, citing concerns over FTX's financial health and the lack of transparency in its financial reporting.\n\nIn the days that followed, the value of FTT, FTX's native token, plummeted by over 80%, as investors began to sell off their holdings in the token. The sell-off was exacerbated by a series of reports by CoinDesk and other news outlets, which revealed that FTX had a significant amount of FTT on its balance sheet, which it had used to purchase other assets.\n\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nOn November 11, 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The company's bankruptcy filing revealed that it had over $8 billion in liabilities and less than $1 billion in assets.\n\nIn the days that followed, it was discovered that FTX had made a series of unauthorized transactions, including the transfer of $1 billion in customer funds to Alameda Research. The transactions were made using FTX's own funds, without the knowledge or consent of the company's customers.\n\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n\nThe crisis at FTX had a significant impact on the wider cryptocurrency market, with many other exchanges and trading firms seeing a decline in their trading volume and market share. The crisis also led to concerns over contagion, with many investors worrying that other exchanges and trading firms could be affected by the crisis at FTX.\n\n##Responses and effects\n\n###Effects on investors\n\nThe crisis at FTX had a significant impact on investors, with many losing a significant amount of money on their investments in FTX and its native token, FTT. The crisis also led to a decline in confidence in the cryptocurrency market as a whole, with many investors becoming increasingly cautious about investing in the market.\n\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n\nThe crisis at FTX had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets, with many exchanges and trading firms seeing a decline in their trading volume and market share. The crisis also led to concerns over contagion, with many investors worrying that other exchanges and trading firms could be affected by the crisis at FTX.\n\n###Responses and commentary\n\nThe crisis at FTX led to a significant amount of commentary and criticism, with many experts and analysts accusing the company of mismanaging its finances and failing to provide adequate transparency to its customers. The crisis also led to a number of investigations and regulatory actions, including a probe by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into FTX's practices.\n\n#Legal process\n\nThe legal process surrounding FTX's bankruptcy is ongoing, with the company's creditors and customers seeking to recover their losses. The process is likely to be complex and contentious, with many parties vying for a share of FTX's assets.\n\n#Sponsorships\n\nFTX was a prominent sponsor of several high-profile events and organizations, including the Miami Dolphins football team and the Formula 1 racing circuit. The company's sponsorship deals were seen as a key part of its marketing and branding strategy.\n\n#References\n\nNote: This article does not include any references or citations, as per the requirements.\n\n#External links\n\nNote: This article does not include any external links, as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FTX\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n##Responses and effects\n###Effects on investors\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n###Responses and commentary\n#Legal process\n#Sponsorships\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The siege was part of the broader Russian invasion of Ukraine and was marked by intense fighting, widespread destruction, and significant human suffering.\n\n**Background**\n\nMariupol is a major port city located in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine, with a population of approximately 430,000 people. The city has been a focal point of conflict in eastern Ukraine since 2014, when pro-Russian separatists began fighting against the Ukrainian government. In 2022, the Russian military launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with the goal of capturing the country's capital, Kyiv, and eventually incorporating the Donbas region, including Mariupol, into Russia.\n\n**Advances to Mariupol**\n\nThe Russian military's advance on Mariupol was swift and decisive. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched a missile strike on the city's airport, destroying several aircraft and killing several Ukrainian soldiers. The next day, Russian troops began to surround the city, cutting off its access to the sea and trapping its residents inside.\n\n### **Preliminary shelling and advance on the city**\n\nThe initial shelling of Mariupol was intense, with Russian forces using artillery and missiles to attack the city's infrastructure and residential areas. The city's defenders, a mix of Ukrainian military personnel and civilian volunteers, put up a fierce resistance, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. As the Russian military advanced on the city, they encountered pockets of resistance, but these were quickly overwhelmed.\n\n### **Mariupol surrounded**\n\nBy February 26, 2022, Mariupol was completely surrounded by Russian forces. The city's residents were trapped inside, with no way to escape. The Ukrainian government and international organizations pleaded with Russia to allow humanitarian aid to enter the city, but their requests were ignored.\n\n**Urban advances**\n\nAs the siege of Mariupol continued, the Russian military launched a series of urban advances, pushing deeper into the city and further encircling its defenders. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\n### **Russian push into the city**\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Russian forces launched a major push into the city, aiming to capture its central districts. The fighting was fierce, with Ukrainian defenders putting up a fierce resistance. However, the Russian military eventually broke through the city's defenses and began to push deeper into its residential areas.\n\n### **Final pockets of resistance**\n\nAs the Russian military advanced, they encountered several final pockets of resistance, including a group of Ukrainian soldiers who were holed up in a city hospital. The defenders fought bravely, but they were eventually overwhelmed, and the hospital was captured by Russian forces.\n\n**Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant**\n\nAs the Russian military advanced on Mariupol, a group of Ukrainian soldiers and civilian volunteers retreated to the city's Azovstal steel plant, where they established a final stronghold. The plant's defenders, led by the Azov Regiment, a volunteer infantry unit, put up a fierce resistance, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned.\n\n### **Withdrawal to Azovstal**\n\nOn March 12, 2022, the Ukrainian military withdrew its forces from the city's residential areas and retreated to the Azovstal steel plant, where they established a final stronghold. The plant's defenders, led by the Azov Regiment, put up a fierce resistance, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned.\n\n### **Siege of Azovstal**\n\nThe Azovstal steel plant became the focal point of the siege of Mariupol, with Russian forces launching a series of attacks on the plant's defenders. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the plant's defenders held out for several weeks, but eventually, they were forced to surrender.\n\n### **Evacuation of civilians**\n\nAs the Russian military advanced on the Azovstal steel plant, a group of civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, were evacuated from the plant and taken to safety. The evacuation was carried out by Ukrainian officials and international organizations, who worked to rescue as many civilians as possible.\n\n### **Ukrainian surrender**\n\nOn May 20, 2022, the Ukrainian military surrendered the Azovstal steel plant, marking the end of the siege of Mariupol. The surrender was negotiated by Ukrainian officials and Russian forces, who agreed to allow the plant's defenders to retreat from the plant and surrender their arms.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the siege of Mariupol was marked by widespread destruction and significant human suffering. The city's infrastructure was severely damaged, and its residents were left without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and electricity.\n\n### **Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city**\n\nAs the Russian military took control of the city, they began to demolish its buildings, including its iconic city hall and other cultural landmarks. The city's residents were also forced to undergo a process of Russification, with Russian language and culture being promoted at the expense of Ukrainian language and culture.\n\n### **Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war**\n\nSeveral Ukrainian soldiers and civilian volunteers remained in hiding in the city, refusing to surrender to Russian forces. These individuals, who became known as the \"last Ukrainian holdouts,\" were eventually captured by Russian forces and taken prisoner.\n\n### **City government's role**\n\nThe city government played a significant role in the siege of Mariupol, with its officials working to coordinate the city's defenses and evacuate its residents. However, the government's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the city fell to Russian forces.\n\n### **Claimed cholera outbreak**\n\nThere were reports of a cholera outbreak in the city, with several residents falling ill with the disease. The outbreak was attributed to the city's poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water.\n\n### **Ukrainian missile strikes**\n\nIn response to the siege of Mariupol, the Ukrainian military launched a series of missile strikes on Russian forces, targeting their positions and infrastructure. The strikes were carried out using Ukrainian-made missiles, which were supplied by international donors.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nThe siege of Mariupol resulted in significant human suffering, with both milita", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Siege_of_Mariupol\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Advances to Mariupol\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n##Mariupol surrounded\n#Urban advances\n##Russian push into the city\n##Final pockets of resistance\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\n##Siege of Azovstal\n##Evacuation of civilians\n##Ukrainian surrender\n#Aftermath\n##Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n##Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n##City government's role\n##Claimed cholera outbreak\n##Ukrainian missile strikes\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#Humanitarian situation\n#War crimes committed by Russian forces\n##Shooting of evacuation checkpoints\n##Maternity and children's hospital bombing\n##Regional theatre bombing\n##Mass shelling of residential areas\n##Alleged use of chemical weapons\n#Media coverage\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England, Drake's life was marked by a series of remarkable achievements that would cement his place in the annals of history.\n\n**Birth and early years**\n\nFrancis Drake was the eldest of 12 children born to Edmund Drake, a Protestant clergyman, and his wife, Mary Mylwaye. His early life was spent in Tavistock, where he received a basic education and developed an interest in the sea. At the age of 13, Drake was apprenticed to a local merchant, Thomas Doughty, who would later become his companion and friend.\n\n**Early career at sea**\n\nDrake's sea career began in the early 1560s, when he sailed to the Mediterranean on a merchant vessel. He quickly gained experience and became a skilled navigator, which would serve him well in his future endeavors. During this period, Drake also became involved in the slave trade, a common practice at the time, and made several voyages to the West Indies.\n\n### Slave trade\n\nDrake's involvement in the slave trade was a significant aspect of his early career. As a young man, he participated in several voyages to the West Indies, where he traded in slaves and other commodities. This experience not only provided him with valuable knowledge of the region but also helped him develop the skills and connections that would serve him well in his future adventures.\n\n### Expedition of 1572–1573\n\nIn 1572, Drake embarked on an expedition to the West Indies, where he became involved in a dispute with the Spanish over the ownership of several islands. The expedition was a significant success, and Drake returned to England with a large quantity of gold and other valuable commodities.\n\n### Rathlin Island massacre\n\nIn 1573, Drake was involved in a massacre of Spanish soldiers on Rathlin Island, off the coast of Ireland. The incident, known as the Rathlin Island massacre, was a significant event in the Anglo-Spanish conflict and marked the beginning of a long period of hostility between the two nations.\n\n**Circumnavigation (1577–1580)**\n\nDrake's most famous voyage was his circumnavigation of the globe, which took place between 1577 and 1580. The voyage was a significant achievement, as it was the first time an Englishman had successfully circumnavigated the globe.\n\n### Execution of Thomas Doughty\n\nIn 1577, Drake embarked on his circumnavigation voyage, which was to be a solo expedition. However, he was joined by his friend and companion, Thomas Doughty, who had been with him since his early days at sea. Unfortunately, Doughty was executed on board ship for mutiny, a incident that would have long-lasting consequences for Drake's reputation.\n\n### Entering the Pacific (1578)\n\nDrake's voyage entered the Pacific in 1578, when he sailed through the Strait of Magellan at the tip of South America. The voyage was a significant achievement, as it marked the first time an Englishman had entered the Pacific.\n\n### Raids on Spanish American west coast\n\nDuring his voyage, Drake raided several Spanish ports on the west coast of South America, including Valparaiso and Callao. The raids were significant, as they helped to weaken the Spanish grip on the region and provided Drake with valuable plunder.\n\n### Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n\nIn 1579, Drake landed on the coast of California, which he named Nova Albion (New England). The landing was a significant event, as it marked the first time an Englishman had set foot on the west coast of North America.\n\n### Across the Pacific and around Africa\n\nAfter leaving California, Drake sailed across the Pacific and around Africa, returning to England in 1580. The voyage was a significant achievement, as it marked the first time an Englishman had successfully circumnavigated the globe.\n\n### Return to Plymouth (1580)\n\nDrake returned to Plymouth in 1580, where he was received as a hero. The voyage had been a significant success, and Drake had brought back valuable knowledge and experience that would serve him well in his future endeavors.\n\n### Knighthood and arms\n\nIn 1580, Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I for his services to the crown. The knighthood was a significant honor, as it marked the first time a privateer had been knighted for his services.\n\n**Political career**\n\nDrake's political career began in the late 1570s, when he became involved in the politics of the English court. He was a strong supporter of Queen Elizabeth I and became a key advisor on naval matters.\n\n### Great Expedition to America\n\nIn 1585, Drake embarked on a Great Expedition to America, which was a significant event in the history of English colonization. The expedition was a series of raids on Spanish ports and settlements, and it marked the beginning of a long period of conflict between the English and the Spanish in the Americas.\n\n### Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, Drake was involved in the conflict with the Spanish Armada, which was a significant event in the history of English naval warfare. The Armada was a massive fleet of Spanish ships that had been sent to invade England, but it was defeated by the English navy, led by Drake and his fellow commanders.\n\n#### Cádiz raid\n\nIn 1587, Drake led a raid on the Spanish port of Cádiz, which was a significant event in the war with Spain. The raid was a success, and it helped to weaken the Spanish grip on the region.\n\n#### Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n\nThe defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 was a significant event in the history of English naval warfare. The Armada was a massive fleet of Spanish ships that had been sent to invade England, but it was defeated by the English navy, led by Drake and his fellow commanders.\n\n#### English Armada\n\nIn 1589, Drake led the English Armada, which was a series of raids on Spanish ports and settlements. The Armada was a significant event in the war with Spain, and it marked the beginning of a long period of conflict between the two nations.\n\n**Defeats and death**\n\nDrake's later years were marked by a series of defeats, including the loss of the English Armada in 1590. He died in 1596, at the age of 55, after a long illness.\n\n**Family and heritage**\n\nDrake's family and heritage are the subject of much speculation and debate. He had several children, including a son who was born out of wedlock, and a daughter who married a wealthy merchant. His legacy as a naval commander and explorer has been celebrated in England for centuries, and his name remains synonymous with bravery and adventure.\n\n**Legacy and honours**\n\nDrake's legacy and honours are numerous and varied. He was a key figure in the history of English naval warfare, and his voyages and exploits are still celebrated in England today. He was also a pioneer of English colonization, and his expeditions helped to lay the foundations for the English empire in the Americas.\n\n### Geographical names\n\nSeveral geographical features and locations are named after Drake, including:\n\n* Drake Passage: a strait in the southern ocean, named after Drake's voyage of 1578\n* Drake Bay: a bay in California, named after Drake's landing in 1579\n* Drake Island: an island in the Galapagos, named after Drake's voyage of 1577\n* Drake's Bay: a bay in South Africa, named after Drake's voyage of 1591\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of explorers\n* List of English navigators\n* History of British exploration\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is based on the following sources:\n\n* \"Francis Drake\" by David Beers Quinn, published by Routledge, 1996\n* \"The Voyages of Sir Francis Drake\" by W.

The incident sparked an investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and raised questions about the handling of sensitive information by the President and his staff.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe discovery of classified documents at Biden's homes began on November 2, 2022, when a lawyer for Biden, Robert B. \"Bob\" Bauer, informed the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) that a small number of classified documents had been found at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a think tank located in Washington, D.C. The documents were said to be from Biden's time as Vice President in the Obama administration. This initial discovery was followed by the revelation that more classified documents had been found at Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach, and subsequently at his home in Wilmington.\n\n**Discoveries and other developments**\n\n### First batch of documents\n\nOn November 2, 2022, Bauer informed NARA that a small number of classified documents had been found at the Penn Biden Center. The documents were said to have been stored in a locked closet, and Bauer claimed that he had taken possession of them. However, it was later revealed that the documents had been stored in a box with a label indicating that they were classified.\n\n### DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn December 20, 2022, the DOJ sent a letter to Bauer informing him that the investigation into the discovery of classified documents at the Penn Biden Center was ongoing, and that Bauer was required to retain all documents related to the investigation. The letter also stated that Bauer would be required to testify before a grand jury.\n\n### Second batch of documents\n\nOn January 9, 2023, it was revealed that additional classified documents had been found at Biden's home in Wilmington. The documents were said to have been stored in a locked garage, and Biden's lawyer claimed that he had been unaware of their existence. This revelation led to increased scrutiny of Biden's handling of classified information and raised questions about the extent to which he was aware of the documents' existence.\n\n### FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the FBI conducted a search of Biden's Wilmington home as part of the investigation into the discovery of classified documents. The search was said to have been conducted in accordance with a court-approved warrant, and Biden's lawyer claimed that he had cooperated fully with the investigation.\n\n### Other searches\n\nIn addition to the search of Biden's Wilmington home, the FBI also searched his home in Rehoboth Beach on January 24, 2023. The search was said to have been conducted in accordance with a court-approved warrant, and Biden's lawyer claimed that he had cooperated fully with the investigation.\n\n**Initial responses**\n\n### Biden and his legal team\n\nBiden initially claimed that he had been unaware of the existence of the classified documents, and that they had been stored in a box with a label indicating that they were classified. However, this claim was later disputed, and it was revealed that Biden had been aware of the documents' existence for some time.\n\n### Elected officials\n\n#### Republican elected officials\n\nRepublican elected officials were quick to criticize Biden's handling of classified information, with some calling for him to resign. Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) claimed that Biden's actions were \"stunning\" and \"inexcusable,\" while Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) called for Biden to be held accountable for his actions.\n\n#### Democratic elected officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials were more muted in their response, with some expressing concern about the handling of classified information but stopping short of calling for Biden to resign. Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) claimed that Biden had done nothing wrong and that the investigation was unnecessary, while Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD) expressed concern about the handling of classified information but stopped short of calling for Biden to step down.\n\n### Media analysis\n\nThe media was quick to analyze the discovery of classified documents at Biden's homes, with some outlets expressing concern about the handling of sensitive information. The Washington Post claimed that the discovery raised \"serious questions\" about Biden's judgment, while The New York Times noted that the investigation was ongoing and that it was too early to draw conclusions.\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThe discovery of classified documents at Biden's homes also led to the spread of misinformation, with some outlets claiming that the documents were from Biden's time as President rather than Vice President. This claim was quickly disputed, and the investigation focused on the handling of classified information during Biden's time as Vice President.\n\n### Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n\nOn January 24, 2023, it was revealed that former Vice President Mike Pence had also stored classified documents at his home in Carmel, Indiana. The discovery raised questions about the handling of classified information by both Biden and Pence, and led to increased scrutiny of the two men's handling of sensitive information.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### Special counsel\n\nOn January 12, 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the discovery of classified documents at Biden's homes. The special counsel, Robert Hur, was tasked with investigating the handling of classified information and determining whether Biden had committed any crimes.\n\n### Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nOn November 1, 2023, the special counsel announced that he had concluded his investigation and that the evidence did not warrant charging Biden with any crimes. However, the report noted that Biden had been aware of the existence of the classified documents and had failed to take adequate steps to secure them.\n\n### Comments on Biden's memory\n\nThe special counsel's report also noted that Biden had claimed to have no memory of storing the classified documents, but that he had also claimed to have been unaware of their existence. The report concluded that Biden's memory was \"inconsistent\" and that he had failed to provide a clear explanation for the storage of the documents.\n\n### Congressional\n\nThe discovery of classified documents at Biden's homes also led to increased scrutiny of the handling of classified information by the Biden administration. Congressional committees launched investigations into the handling of classified information, and some lawmakers called for changes to the way that classified documents are stored and handled.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Classified information in the United States\n* Presidential records\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Department of Justice\n* FBI\n* Special counsel\n* Impeachment of Donald Trump\n* Investigation into Donald Trump's handling of classified information", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle took place in the Kapyong Valley, approximately 80 kilometers northeast of Seoul, South Korea.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Military Situation\n\nIn the spring of 1951, the Korean War had reached a stalemate. The United Nations Command (UNC) had established a defensive line along the 38th parallel, which had been breached by the Chinese in the winter of 1950. The UNC, led by General Matthew Ridgway, had regrouped and launched a series of counterattacks to push the Chinese back. However, the Chinese had reinforced their positions and were determined to drive the UNC back.\n\n### Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nOn 22 April 1951, the Chinese launched a massive spring offensive, code-named \"Operation Yubin,\" with the aim of breaking through the UNC lines and advancing on Seoul. The Chinese had assembled a large force of over 180,000 soldiers, including infantry, artillery, and tanks, and had been secretly mobilizing troops for weeks.\n\n### Preparations\n\nIn anticipation of the Chinese offensive, the UNC had been preparing its defenses along the Kapyong Valley. The Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), had been stationed in the area since April 1951, and had been tasked with defending the valley. The Canadians had also been assigned to the area, with the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI) being stationed on Hill 677.\n\n### Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nOn the morning of 22 April 1951, the Chinese launched their spring offensive, with a massive artillery bombardment of the UNC positions along the Kapyong Valley. The Chinese infantry then advanced in large numbers, attempting to break through the UNC lines.\n\n### South Korean Withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n\nAs the Chinese advanced, the South Korean 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, was forced to withdraw from the area, leaving the Australians and Canadians to fend for themselves. The Australians and Canadians were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, but they were determined to hold their ground.\n\n**Australian 3 RAR Defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951**\n\n### Night Battle\n\nOn the night of 23 April 1951, the Australians launched a counterattack against the Chinese positions on Hill 504. The Australians used mortars and machine guns to soften up the Chinese positions, before launching a bayonet charge against the enemy. The Australians managed to drive the Chinese off the hill, but at great cost.\n\n### Day Battle\n\nThe next day, 24 April 1951, the Chinese launched a massive counterattack against the Australian positions on Hill 504. The Australians were vastly outnumbered, but they managed to hold their ground, using their superior training and discipline to repel the Chinese attacks. However, the Australians were forced to withdraw from the hill, due to a lack of ammunition and reinforcements.\n\n### 3 RAR Withdraws\n\nThe Australians withdrew from Hill 504 on 25 April 1951, leaving the Canadians to fend for themselves on Hill 677.\n\n**Canadian 2 PPCLI Last Stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951**\n\n### Preparations\n\nThe Canadians had been preparing for the Chinese attack on Hill 677 for days, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. The Canadians had been tasked with defending the hill, but they knew that they would be unable to hold out for long.\n\n### Night Battle\n\nOn the night of 24 April 1951, the Chinese launched a massive attack against the Canadian positions on Hill 677. The Canadians used machine guns and mortars to repel the Chinese attacks, but they were vastly outnumbered. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Canadians managed to hold their ground, but at great cost.\n\n### Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n\nThe next day, 25 April 1951, the Chinese launched a final attack against the Canadian positions on Hill 677. The Canadians were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, but they managed to hold their ground, using their superior training and discipline to repel the Chinese attacks. However, the Canadians were forced to withdraw from the hill, due to a lack of ammunition and reinforcements.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Summary and Casualties\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong lasted for three days, from 22 to 25 April 1951. The battle was a decisive victory for the Chinese, who managed to break through the UNC lines and advance on Seoul. However, the UNC was able to regroup and launch a series of counterattacks, which eventually pushed the Chinese back. The battle was a bloody and brutal one, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Australians and Canadians suffered over 3,000 casualties, while the Chinese suffered an estimated 10,000 casualties.\n\n### Awards\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a turning point in the Korean War, and it marked the beginning of the end of the Chinese spring offensive. The battle was a testament to the bravery and sacrifice of the Australian and Canadian soldiers, who fought against overwhelming odds to defend their positions. The battle also marked the beginning of the end of the Chinese spring offensive, and it paved the way for the UNC's eventual victory in the war.\n\n### Subsequent Operations\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong marked the end of the Chinese spring offensive, and it marked the beginning of a series of UNC counterattacks against the Chinese. The UNC launched a series of operations, including Operation Ripper and Operation Dauntless, which eventually pushed the Chinese back and secured a decisive victory for the UNC.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Korean War\n* Battle of the Hook\n* Battle of the Imjin River\n* Operation Ripper\n* Operation Dauntless\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a range of sources, including official histories, memoirs, and academic studies.\n* The Battle of Kapyong was a major turning point in the Korean War, and it marked the beginning of the end of the Chinese spring offensive.\n* The battle was a testament to the bravery and sacrifice of the Australian and Canadian soldiers, who fought against overwhelming odds to defend their positions.\n* The battle also marked the beginning of the end of the Chinese spring offensive, and it paved the way for the UNC's eventual victory in the war.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Kapyong\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Military situation\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n##Preparations\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n##Night battle\n##Day battle\n##3 RAR withdraws\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n##Preparations\n##Night battle\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n#Aftermath\n##Summary and casualties\n##Awards\n##Subsequent operations\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They have a rich and complex history, with a distinct culture and traditions that have evolved over centuries. The Bugis are known for their seafaring skills, mercantile trading networks, and warrior culture, which have contributed to their influential position in Southeast Asian history.\n\n**Origins and Antecedents**\n\n### **Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi**\n\nThe region that is now South Sulawesi has been inhabited by indigenous peoples since the early Paleolithic era, around 40,000 years ago. The Toalean culture, which flourished from around 1000 BCE to 100 CE, is believed to be the precursor to the Bugis people. The Toaleans were known for their skilled metalworking, particularly in copper and bronze.\n\n### **The Arrival of Austronesians**\n\nAround 1000 BCE, Austronesian-speaking peoples began to migrate to the region, displacing the Toaleans. These Austronesians brought with them new technologies, such as the domestication of rice and the use of outrigger canoes. They established a thriving maritime trading network, which would eventually become a hallmark of Bugis culture.\n\n### **Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis**\n\nThe name \"Bugis\" is derived from the word \"Tana Ogi,\" which means \"land of the Bugis\" in the Bugis language. This name refers to the region that is now the Bugis homeland, which includes the city of Makassar and the surrounding areas.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Early Society**\n\nIn the 14th century, the Bugis people began to establish a complex society, with a system of kingship and a strong warrior culture.

The Bugis people believed in a complex pantheon of gods and goddesses, which included the gods of the sea, the gods of war, and the gods of fertility.\n\n### **Quest for Prestige, Influence, and Powers Over the Peninsula**\n\nIn the 17th century, the Bugis-Makassar society began to decline, and the peninsula was divided among various kingdoms and city-states. The Bugis people continued to seek prestige, influence, and power over the peninsula, and they established several new kingdoms, including the Kingdom of Soppeng and the Kingdom of Bone.\n\n### **The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar**\n\nIn the 17th century, the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar people began to convert to Islam. The conversion to Islam was a gradual process, which was led by Muslim missionaries and traders. The conversion to Islam had a significant impact on Bugis culture, which became more Islamicized over time.\n\n### **The Twilight of Dominance**\n\nIn the 18th century, the Bugis-Makassar society began to decline, and the peninsula was divided among various kingdoms and city-states. The Bugis people continued to seek prestige, influence, and power over the peninsula, but they were eventually defeated by the Dutch and the Makassar people.\n\n### **A New Golden Age**\n\nIn the 19th century, the Bugis people experienced a new golden age, which was characterized by a resurgence of their cultural traditions and their economic prosperity.

She is the leader of the Brothers of Italy (Fratelli d'Italia) party, a right-wing populist and nationalist party. Meloni has been a prominent figure in Italian politics since the 1990s, known for her conservative and Eurosceptic views.\n\n**Early life**\n\nMeloni was born on 15 January 1977 in Rome, Italy, to a family of Italian parents. Her father, Giuseppe Meloni, was a conservative politician who served as a Member of Parliament from 1994 to 1996. Meloni's early life was marked by her family's conservative values and her father's involvement in politics.\n\n**Education and early political activism**\n\nMeloni attended the Liceo Classico Enrico Buonanni in Rome, where she developed an interest in politics and economics. She then enrolled at the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\" to study European Union law, but dropped out after one year to focus on her political career. Meloni began her involvement in politics in the early 1990s, joining the National Alliance (Alleanza Nazionale) party, a neo-fascist party that was led by Gianfranco Fini.\n\nMeloni's early activism was marked by her involvement in the student movement and her participation in protests against the Italian government's policies. She also began to write for various right-wing publications, including the newspaper \"Il Secolo d'Italia\".\n\n**Political career**\n\n### Minister of Youth\n\nIn 2006, Meloni was appointed as the Minister of Youth by the Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi. She held the position until 2008, during which time she implemented various policies aimed at promoting youth employment and education. However, her tenure as Minister was marked by controversy, including allegations of corruption and cronyism.\n\n### Leader of Brothers of Italy\n\nIn 2012, Meloni became the leader of the Brothers of Italy party, which was founded by her and other former members of the National Alliance.

The song was written by Gaga, along with Paul Blair, Dino Zoullas, and Nick Monson, and produced by Blair and Monson. \"Bloody Mary\" is an electronic dance music (EDM) and dance-pop song with elements of darkwave and gothic rock.\n\n**Influences and lyrical content**\n\nThe song's lyrics are a fragmented and abstract exploration of themes related to love, death, and the supernatural. Gaga has stated that the song's title and lyrics were inspired by a character from her childhood, a Catholic girl who believed that the name \"Mary\" was cursed, and that anyone who uttered it three times would summon a \"Bloody Mary\" figure, a vengeful spirit from folklore.\n\n## **Thematic analysis**\n\nThe song's lyrics can be interpreted as a metaphor for the dangers of obsession and the blurring of reality and fantasy. Gaga has stated that the song is about the idea that \"the line between reality and fantasy is getting thinner and thinner, and we're all just living in a dream state.\" The song's themes of love, death, and the supernatural are also reflective of Gaga's own interests in the occult and her fascination with the darker aspects of human nature.\n\n**Recording and composition**\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" was recorded in 2012 at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California. The song features a prominent use of synthesizers and electronic drum machines, as well as a haunting vocal performance from Gaga. The song's composition is characterized by a driving beat and a sense of tension and release, with a gradual build-up of energy throughout the song.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" received mixed reviews from music critics, with some praising the song's ambition and creativity, while others found it to be overly ambitious and confusing. The song's lyrics were particularly criticized for being abstract and difficult to decipher. However, the song's production and sound design were widely praised, with many critics noting its innovative use of electronic elements.\n\n**Single release and media appearances**\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" was released as a single in October 2013, along with a music video directed by Terry Richardson. The song was also included on Gaga's Artpop Tour setlist, where it was performed as a high-energy dance number. The song has also been featured on several soundtracks and compilations, including the soundtrack to the film \"Machete Kills\" and the compilation album \"Lady Gaga: The Remixes\".\n\n**Commercial performance**\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" was a moderate commercial success, peaking at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 29 on the UK Singles Chart. However, the song's performance was largely overshadowed by Gaga's other singles from the album, including \"Applause\" and \"Do What U Want\".\n\n**Remix versions**\n\nSeveral remix versions of \"Bloody Mary\" were released in 2013, including remixes by DJ White Shadow and Zedd. These remixes feature extended and remixed versions of the song, as well as new vocal and instrumental elements.\n\n**Live performances**\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" has been performed live by Gaga on several occasions, including on her Artpop Tour and at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. The song's live performances are characterized by a high-energy dance routine and a dramatic lighting and video design.\n\n**Credits and personnel**\n\n* Written by Lady Gaga, Paul Blair, Dino Zoullas, and Nick Monson\n* Produced by Paul Blair and Nick Monson\n* Recorded at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California\n* Mixed by Blair\n* Mastered by Gene Grimaldi\n\n**Charts**\n\n* US Billboard Hot 100: 69\n* US Dance Club Songs: 1\n* UK Singles Chart: 29\n* Australian Singles Chart: 33\n* Canadian Hot 100: 53\n\n**Certifications and sales**\n\n* Certified gold by the RIAA for sales of over 500,000 copies in the US\n* Certified platinum by the BPI for sales of over 600,000 copies in the UK\n* Estimated sales worldwide: 1 million+\n\n**Release history**\n\n* Released as a single: October 2013\n* Included on the album Artpop: November 2013\n* Released on the soundtrack to Machete Kills: November 2013\n* Released on the compilation album Lady Gaga: The Remixes: December 2013\n\n**Notes**\n\n* \"Bloody Mary\" was inspired by a character from Gaga's childhood, a Catholic girl who believed that the name \"Mary\" was cursed.\n* The song's lyrics are a metaphor for the dangers of obsession and the blurring of reality and fantasy.\n* The song features a prominent use of synthesizers and electronic drum machines, as well as a haunting vocal performance from Gaga.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bloody_Mary_(song)\" following this outline:\n\n#Influences and lyrical content\n##Thematic analysis\n#Recording and composition\n#Critical reception\n#Single release and media appearances\n#Commercial performance\n#Remix versions\n#Live performances\n#Credits and personnel\n#Charts\n#Certifications and sales\n#Release history\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are predominantly followers of the Shia branch of Islam, with the majority adhering to the Twelver Shia tradition. This article provides an overview of the history, sub-groups, geographic distribution, demographics, and notable figures of Lebanese Shia Muslims.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe Shia branch of Islam emerged in the 7th century, following the death of the Prophet Muhammad. The Shia Muslims believed that the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib, was the rightful successor to the leadership of the Muslim community. This led to a split between the Shia and the Sunni Muslims, with the Shia minority maintaining their distinct identity and traditions.\n\n### Early Islamic period\n\nDuring the early Islamic period, Shia Muslims played a significant role in the development of Islamic thought and culture. Shia scholars and theologians made significant contributions to the fields of jurisprudence, theology, and philosophy. Notable Shia scholars of this period include Ali ibn Abi Talib, Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, and Ali ibn al-Ashtar.\n\n### Mamluk period\n\nThe Mamluk period, which lasted from the 13th to the 16th century, saw the rise of Shia Muslims in Egypt and the Levant. Shia scholars and leaders, such as the Ala' al-Dawla al-Simnani, played a key role in the development of Shia thought and institutions. The Mamluk period also saw the emergence of Shia Sufism, which emphasized the mystical and spiritual dimensions of Shia Islam.\n\n### Under Ottoman rule\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, Shia Muslims in Lebanon continued to develop their distinct traditions and institutions. The Ottomans imposed their own administrative and judicial systems on the region, which led to tensions between Shia Muslims and the Ottoman authorities. Shia Muslims resisted Ottoman attempts to impose Sunni orthodoxy and maintained their own distinct identity and institutions.\n\n### Relations with Safavid Iran\n\nThe Safavid dynasty in Iran, which ruled from the 16th to the 18th century, played a significant role in the development of Shia Islam in Lebanon. Shia scholars and leaders from Lebanon traveled to Iran to study and engage with Safavid scholars and leaders. The Safavid court also provided patronage to Shia scholars and institutions in Lebanon, which contributed to the development of Shia thought and culture in the region.\n\n### French mandate period\n\nThe French mandate period, which lasted from 1920 to 1946, saw significant changes in the social and economic landscape of Lebanon. Shia Muslims continued to develop their distinct traditions and institutions, despite the challenges and obstacles posed by the French colonial authorities. Shia Muslims played a significant role in the Lebanese national movement, which demanded greater autonomy and self-determination for the country.\n\n### Education\n\nEducation played a significant role in the development of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. Shia scholars and leaders established schools and universities, which provided education in Shia theology, jurisprudence, and other fields. Shia Muslims also established a network of mosques and Islamic centers, which provided education and training in Shia traditions and practices.\n\n### Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n\nJa'fari shar'ia courts, which were established in Lebanon during the Ottoman period, continued to function during the French mandate period. These courts provided a framework for Shia Muslims to resolve disputes and settle cases according to Shia jurisprudence. Shia Muslims also established their own separate courts and institutions, which provided an alternative to the French colonial authorities.\n\n**Sub-groups**\n\n### Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n\nThe Shia Twelvers, also known as Metouali, are the largest sub-group of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. They follow the traditions of the Twelver Shia school, which emphasizes the importance of the twelve Imams as the rightful leaders of the Muslim community. The Metouali are found throughout Lebanon, but are concentrated in the south and the Beirut suburbs.\n\n### Alawites\n\nThe Alawites are a sub-group of Shia Muslims who are found primarily in the Kayfoun region of Lebanon. They follow a distinct tradition of Shia Islam, which is influenced by Christian and other local traditions. The Alawites are known for their unique religious practices and traditions, which include the veneration of saints and the use of sacraments.\n\n### Isma'ilis\n\nThe Isma'ilis are a sub-group of Shia Muslims who are found primarily in the north of Lebanon. They follow a distinct tradition of Shia Islam, which emphasizes the importance of knowledge and intellectual pursuits. The Isma'ilis are known for their rich cultural and intellectual heritage, which includes the works of the Isma'ili philosophers and theologians.\n\n**Geographic distribution within Lebanon**\n\nShia Muslims are found throughout Lebanon, but are concentrated in the south and the Beirut suburbs. The majority of Shia Muslims are found in the following governorates:\n\n* Nabatieh Governorate: 70-80% Shia\n* South Governorate: 60-70% Shia\n* Mount Lebanon Governorate: 40-50% Shia\n* Beirut Governorate: 30-40% Shia\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAccording to the 2010 Lebanese census, Shia Muslims comprise approximately 27-30% of the country's population. The majority of Shia Muslims are concentrated in the following age groups:\n\n* 18-24 years: 40-50% Shia\n* 25-34 years: 30-40% Shia\n* 35-44 years: 20-30% Shia\n* 45-54 years: 10-20% Shia\n\n**Genetics**\n\nStudies have shown that Shia Muslims in Lebanon have a distinct genetic profile that is influenced by their Middle Eastern and Mediterranean ancestry. Shia Muslims have a higher frequency of genetic markers that are associated with Middle Eastern and Mediterranean populations, such as the Haplogroup J1 and the Y-chromosome haplogroup J-M267.\n\n**Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims**\n\n### Religious figures\n\n* Ayatollah Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah: A prominent Shia cleric and scholar who played a key role in the development of Shia thought and institutions in Lebanon.\n* Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi Shamsuddin: A prominent Shia cleric and scholar who was known for his opposition to the French colonial authorities and his advocacy for Shia rights.\n* Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Hussein al-Khumaini: A prominent Shia cleric and scholar who was known for his opposition to the French colonial authorities and his advocacy for Shia rights.\n\n### Political figures\n\n* Najib Mikati: A Shia politician who served as the Prime Minister of Lebanon from 2011 to 2014.\n* Saad Hariri: A Shia politician who served as the Prime Minister of Lebanon from 2009 to 2011.\n* Ammar Houri: A Shia politician who served as the Minister of Education in Lebanon from 2005 to 2009.\n\n### Academics\n\n* Sayyid Muhammad al-Musawi: A Shia scholar and academic who was known for his expertise in Shia theology and jurisprudence.\n* Sayyid Muhammad al-Abudi: A Shia scholar and academic who was known for his expertise in Shia theology and jurisprudence.\n\n### Artists, singers and journalists\n\n* Fairouz: A Lebanese singer and songwriter who is known for her beautiful voice and her advocacy for Shia rights.\n* Wadih El Safi: A Lebanese singer and songwriter who is known for his beautiful voice and his advocacy for Shia rights.\n* Hassan Al-Laqis: A Lebanese journalist and writer who was known for his advocacy for Shia rights and his criticism of the French colonial authorities.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Shia Islam\n* Lebanon\n* Lebanese people\n* Lebanese Shia Muslims\n* Shia Twelvers\n* Alawites\n* Isma'ilis\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is a general overview of the history, sub-groups, geographic distribution, demographics, and notable figures of Lebanese Shia Muslims.

This article will explore the historical context of the Founding Fathers, the origin of the phrase, and the list of notable individuals who contributed to the creation of the United States.\n\n# Historical founders\n\nThe concept of the Founding Fathers is closely tied to the idea of the American Revolution and the creation of the United States. The American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783, in which the Thirteen Colonies in North America rejected British rule and established the United States of America as an independent nation. The Founding Fathers were a group of individuals who were instrumental in this process, and their actions and decisions had a profound impact on the course of American history.\n\n# Origin of phrase\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used in the 18th century to describe the individuals who played a key role in the creation of the United States. The phrase was popularized by the American historian and statesman, David Ramsay, who wrote in his 1789 book, \"The History of the American Revolution,\" that the Founding Fathers were a group of individuals who were \"the authors of our liberty and the founders of our republic.\" Over time, the term has become synonymous with the individuals who contributed to the creation of the United States.\n\n# List of Founding Fathers\n\n## Framers and signers\n\nThe Framers and signers of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution were a group of individuals who played a key role in the creation of the United States. They were instrumental in drafting and signing the Declaration of Independence in 1776, which formally declared the colonies' independence from Great Britain. The signers of the Declaration of Independence included individuals such as John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, who were all prominent leaders in the American Revolution.\n\n### Other delegates\n\nIn addition to the signers of the Declaration of Independence, there were many other delegates who played a key role in the creation of the United States. These individuals included statesmen, politicians, and military leaders who contributed to the drafting and signing of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution. Some notable delegates include George Washington, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin.\n\n## Additional Founding Fathers\n\nIn addition to the Framers and signers of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, there were many other individuals who contributed to the creation of the United States. These individuals included patriots, politicians, and military leaders who played a key role in the American Revolution and the early years of the United States. Some notable individuals include Paul Revere, Patrick Henry, and John Jay.\n\n## Women founders\n\nWhile the Founding Fathers were primarily men, there were also women who played a significant role in the creation of the United States. These women included patriots, politicians, and activists who contributed to the American Revolution and the early years of the United States. Some notable women founders include Abigail Adams, Deborah Sampson, and Lydia Darragh.\n\n## Other patriots\n\nIn addition to the Framers and signers of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, there were many other patriots who contributed to the creation of the United States. These individuals included soldiers, sailors, and militiamen who fought in the American Revolution, as well as civilians who supported the cause of American independence. Some notable patriots include Crispus Attucks, Peter Salem, and Francis Marion.\n\n# The colonies unite (1765–1774)\n\nThe American Revolution began in 1765, when the British government imposed a series of taxes on the Thirteen Colonies, including the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, and the Townshend Acts. The colonies responded to these taxes with protests, boycotts, and eventually, violence. The First Continental Congress, which met in 1774, was a gathering of representatives from the Thirteen Colonies who came together to coordinate a unified response to British rule.\n\n## First Continental Congress (1774)\n\nThe First Continental Congress was a gathering of representatives from the Thirteen Colonies who met in Philadelphia in 1774. The Congress was a significant event in American history, as it marked the first time that representatives from the colonies came together to coordinate a unified response to British rule. The Congress drafted a list of grievances against the British government, which was known as the Declaration and Resolves. The Congress also established a plan for a unified colonial response to British rule, which included the creation of a colonial militia and the coordination of economic boycotts.\n\n## Second Continental Congress (1775)\n\nThe Second Continental Congress was a gathering of representatives from the Thirteen Colonies who met in Philadelphia in 1775. The Congress was a significant event in American history, as it marked the beginning of the United States' fight for independence from Great Britain. The Congress drafted the Declaration of Independence, which formally declared the colonies' independence from Great Britain. The Congress also established a unified colonial government, which included the creation of a continental army and the appointment of George Washington as its commander-in-chief.\n\n# Declaration of Independence (1776)\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was a document that formally declared the colonies' independence from Great Britain. The document, which was drafted by a committee including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin, was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. The Declaration of Independence stated that all men are created equal and are endowed with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The document also listed the colonies' grievances against the British government, which included the imposition of taxes without consent, the quartering of soldiers in the colonies, and the denial of trial by jury.\n\n# Fighting for independence\n\nThe American Revolution was a long and bloody conflict that lasted from 1775 to 1783. The war was fought between the United States and Great Britain, with the colonies eventually securing their independence in 1783. The war was marked by numerous battles, including the Battle of Lexington and Concord, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the Battle of Yorktown. The war also saw the rise of military leaders such as George Washington, who played a key role in the American victory.\n\n## Treaty of Paris\n\nThe Treaty of Paris was a treaty signed in 1783 between the United States and Great Britain, which formally ended the American Revolution. The treaty established the United States as an independent nation, with its own government, laws, and borders. The treaty also recognized the United States' sovereignty over its territory, which included the modern-day states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.\n\n# Constitutional Convention\n\nThe Constitutional Convention was a gathering of representatives from the United States who met in Philadelphia in 1787 to revise the Articles of Confederation. The Convention, which was attended by many of the Founding Fathers, including George Washington, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin, drafted a new constitution that established a federal government with three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial. The Constitution also established the principles of federalism, which divided power between the federal government and the states.\n\n## Virginia and New Jersey plans\n\nThe Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan were two proposals that were presented at the Constitutional Convention. The Virginia Plan, which was proposed by James Madison, called for a bicameral legislature with representation based on population. The New Jersey Plan, which was proposed by William Paterson, called for a unicameral legislature with equal representation for each state. The two plans were eventually combined to create the Great Compromise, which established a bicameral legislature with equal representation for each state in the Senate and representation based on population in the House of Representatives.\n\n## Connecticut Compromise\n\nThe Connecticut Compromise, also known as the Great Compromise, was a plan that was proposed by Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth at the Constitutional Convention. The compromise established a bicameral legislature with equal representation for each state in the Senate and representation based on population in the House of Representatives. The compromise also established the principle of federalism, which divided power between the federal government and the states.\n\n## State ratification conventions\n\nThe state ratification conventions were a series of conventions that were held in each state to ratify the United States Constitution. The conventions were attended by representatives from each state, who debated and voted on the Constitution. The Constitution was ratified by the necessary number of states in 1788, and it went into effect in 1789.\n\n## New form of government\n\nThe United States Constitution established a new form of government, which was based on the principles of federalism, the separation of powers, and the rule of law. The Constitution established a federal government with three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative branch was composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives, which were responsible for making laws. The executive branch was headed by the President, who was responsible for enforcing laws. The judicial branch was composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, which were responsible for interpreting laws.\n\n## Bill of Rights\n\nThe Bill of Rights was a series of amendments that were added to the United States Constitution in 1791. The Bill of Rights established certain fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to a fair trial. The Bill of Rights was a significant addition to the Constitution, as it provided a clear statement of the rights and freedoms that were protected by the government.\n\n# Ascending to the presidency\n\nThe presidency of the United States was established by the United States Constitution, which provided for a president to be elected by the Electoral College. The first president of the United States was George Washington, who was elected in 1789. Washington was inaugurated as president on April 30, 1789, and he served two terms in office. Washington established many of the traditions and precedents of the presidency, including the use of a cabinet and the issuance of executive orders.\n\n# Demographics and other characteristics\n\n## Political experience\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers had significant political experience before the American Revolution. For example, George Washington was a military leader and a member of the House of Burgesses. James Madison was a member of the Continental Congress and the Virginia House of Delegates. Thomas Jefferson was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Continental Congress.\n\n## Education\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers were well-educated, with a strong background in classical literature and history. For example, John Adams attended Harvard University and studied law at the University of Leyden. Thomas Jefferson attended the College of William and Mary and studied law at the Inns of Court in London.\n\n### American institutions\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers were educated in American institutions, including Harvard University, the College of William and Mary, and the University of Pennsylvania. These institutions played an important role in shaping the Founding Fathers' views on government, law, and politics.\n\n### British institutions\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers were educated in British institutions, including the University of Leyden, the Inns of Court in London, and the University of Oxford. These institutions provided a strong background in classical literature and history, as well as training in law and politics.\n\n## Ethnicity\n\nThe Founding Fathers were primarily of European descent, with a mix of English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish ancestry. For example, George Washington was of English and Scottish descent, while Thomas Jefferson was of English and Welsh descent.\n\n## Occupations\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers had various occupations before the American Revolution. For example, George Washington was a military leader and a planter. James Madison was a lawyer and a politician. Thomas Jefferson was a lawyer, politician, and scientist.\n\n# Religion\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers were Christian, with a mix of Protestant and Catholic denominations. For example, George Washington was a Episcopalian, while Thomas Jefferson was a Deist. James Madison was a Presbyterian.\n\n# Founders on currency and postage\n\nThe Founding Fathers were instrumental in establishing the United States' monetary and postal systems. For example, George Washington was a strong advocate for a national bank, which was established in 1791. Thomas Jefferson was a proponent of a decimal-based currency system, which was introduced in 1785.\n\n# Political and cultural impact\n\nThe Founding Fathers had a significant impact on American politics and culture. For example, they established the principles of federalism, the separation of powers, and the rule of law. They also established the United States' system of government, which has been a model for other countries around the world.\n\n## Political rhetoric\n\nThe Founding Fathers were skilled politicians who used rhetorical devices to persuade their fellow citizens and opponents. For example, George Washington used the concept of honor to appeal to his fellow Americans, while Thomas Jefferson used the idea of liberty to advocate for individual rights.\n\n## Holidays\n\nThe Founding Fathers were instrumental in establishing several American holidays, including Independence Day (July 4), Thanksgiving Day (fourth Thursday in November), and Memorial Day (last Monday in May).\n\n## Media and theater\n\nThe Founding Fathers were patrons of the arts and sciences, and they encouraged the development of media and theater in the United States. For example, Thomas Jefferson was a strong supporter of the American stage, and he encouraged the development of American theater.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Founding Fathers were not known for their involvement in sports, but they did establish several American sports traditions, including horse racing and fox hunting.\n\n# Religious freedom\n\nThe Founding Fathers were strong advocates for religious freedom, and they included provisions for religious liberty in the United States Constitution. For example, the First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion, and the Constitution also prohibits the establishment of a national church.\n\n# Slavery\n\nThe Founding Fathers were not unanimous in their views on slavery, and some of them owned slaves while others opposed the institution. For example, George Washington freed some of his slaves in his will, while Thomas Jefferson owned slaves throughout his life.\n\n## Reconstruction as a \"Second Founding\"\n\nThe Reconstruction period after the Civil War is often referred to as a \"Second Founding\" of the United States. During this time, the United States government and society were reorganized to eliminate slavery and establish the principles of equality and justice for all citizens.\n\n# Scholarly analysis\n\n## Early historians\n\nEarly historians such as George Bancroft and Benson Lossing wrote extensively about the Founding Fathers and their role in American history. These historians provided a framework for understanding the Founding Fathers' contributions to American politics and society.\n\n## Modern historians\n\nModern historians such as Gordon Wood and David McCullough have continued to study the Founding Fathers and their role in American history. These historians have provided a more nuanced understanding of the Founding Fathers' motivations and actions, and they have highlighted the complexities and contradictions of American history.\n\n## Noted collections\n\nNoted collections of the Founding Fathers' writings and documents include the Papers of George Washington, the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, and the Papers of James Madison. These collections provide a wealth of information about the Founding Fathers' thoughts, actions, and decisions.\n\n# See also\n\n* American Revolution\n* United States Constitution\n* Declaration of Independence\n* Founding Fathers\n* American History\n\n# Notes\n\n* There is no footnotes or citations in this article.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States\" following this outline:\n\n#Historical founders\n#Origin of phrase\n#List of Founding Fathers\n##Framers and signers\n###Other delegates\n##Additional Founding Fathers\n##Women founders\n##Other patriots\n#The colonies unite (1765–1774)\n#Continental Congress (1774–1775)\n##First Continental Congress (1774)\n##Second Continental Congress (1775)\n#Declaration of Independence (1776)\n#Fighting for independence\n##Treaty of Paris\n#Constitutional Convention\n##Virginia and New Jersey plans\n##Connecticut Compromise\n##State ratification conventions\n##New form of government\n##Bill of Rights\n#Ascending to the presidency\n#Demographics and other characteristics\n##Political experience\n##Education\n###American institutions\n###British institutions\n##Ethnicity\n##Occupations\n#Religion\n#Founders on currency and postage\n#Political and cultural impact\n##Political rhetoric\n##Holidays\n##Media and theater\n##Sports\n#Religious freedom\n#Slavery\n##Reconstruction as a \"Second Founding\"\n#Scholarly analysis\n##Early historians\n##Modern historians\n##Noted collections\n#See also\n#Notes\n#Citations\n#Bibliography\n##Journal articles\n##Online sources\n#Further reading\n##Books\n##Journal articles\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is the fifth installment in the Indiana Jones franchise and serves as a sequel to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The story follows an aging Indiana Jones as he embarks on a perilous quest to uncover the secrets of the Dial of Destiny, a powerful artifact with the ability to manipulate time. The film features a cast of veteran actors, including Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and features a mix of action, adventure, and humor.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in 1969, during the height of the Cold War. Indiana Jones, now in his 70s, is a retired professor of archaeology who has grown disillusioned with the world around him. However, when he is approached by his goddaughter, Helena Shaw, with a cryptic message from his long-lost father, Henry Jones Sr., Indiana is drawn back into the world of archaeology and adventure. Helena has inherited a mysterious artifact from her grandfather, known as the Dial of Destiny, which is said to have the power to manipulate time itself.\n\nAs Indiana delves deeper into the mystery of the Dial, he finds himself embroiled in a world of espionage and counter-espionage, with various factions vying for control of the artifact. He soon discovers that the Dial is being sought after by a wealthy and ruthless collector, Jürgen Voller, who will stop at nothing to claim it for himself. Indiana must use all his wits and experience to outwit Voller and his minions, while also navigating the treacherous world of 1960s politics and espionage.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones\n* Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Jürgen Voller\n* Thomas Kretschmann as Reinhardt\n* Boyd Holbrook as Klaber\n* Shaunette Renée Wilson as Eudora\n* Toby Jones as Basil Shaw\n* Leif Edlund as Adolf Hitler\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny began in 2015, when Harrison Ford expressed interest in reprising his role as Indiana Jones. Steven Spielberg, who had directed the previous four films in the franchise, was initially attached to direct, but eventually dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. James Mangold, who had directed the critically-acclaimed Logan, was brought on board to direct the film.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2020, with a script being written by Mangold and Jez Butterworth. The script was heavily influenced by the original Indiana Jones films, as well as the 1960s spy thrillers of the era. The production team also conducted extensive research on the era, including the Cold War and the rise of the counterculture movement.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting of the film was a major priority for the production team.

The film's supporting cast includes a number of veteran actors, including Thomas Kretschmann and Toby Jones.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming on the film took place in the summer of 2021, with a mix of practical and visual effects used to bring the action sequences to life. The film's production team made use of a combination of traditional stunt work and CGI to create the film's elaborate action sequences. The film's cinematography was handled by Janusz Kaminski, who had worked with Spielberg on a number of previous films.\n\n### Visual Effects\n\nThe visual effects in the film were handled by Industrial Light & Magic, who created a number of elaborate sequences, including a scene in which Indiana Jones and Helena Shaw escape from a group of villains on motorcycles. The film's visual effects team also created a number of practical effects, including a scene in which Indiana Jones is chased by a group of Nazis through a crowded market.\n\n### De-aging\n\nThe film's visual effects team used a combination of de-aging and makeup to bring Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones back to his younger self. The de-aging process involved a combination of CGI and makeup, with the goal of creating a seamless and realistic transformation.\n\n### Music\n\nThe music for the film was composed by John Williams, who had scored all of the previous Indiana Jones films. The score incorporates a number of themes from the previous films, including the iconic \"Raiders March.\" The score also features a number of new themes, including a haunting melody that plays during a key scene in the film.\n\n**Themes and influences**\n\nThe film's themes and influences are rooted in the original Indiana Jones films, as well as the 1960s spy thrillers of the era.
