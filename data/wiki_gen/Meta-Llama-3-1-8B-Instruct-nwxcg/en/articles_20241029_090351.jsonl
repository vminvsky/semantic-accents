Her father, John Kenneth Truss, was a librarian, and her mother, Priscilla Mary Truss, was a nurse. Truss grew up in Paisley, Scotland, and later moved to New Zealand, where her family lived for several years. She attended the independent Mary Hare Grammar School for the Deaf and later studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Merton College, Oxford.\n\n**Career**\n\n#### Employment and Candidatures (1996–2010)\n\nAfter graduating from Oxford, Truss worked as a teacher and a financial journalist. She also worked for the Adam Smith Institute, a free-market think tank, and as a policy officer for the British Retail Consortium. In 1997, Truss became the parliamentary researcher for the Conservative MP John Maples. In 2005, she stood as the Conservative candidate in the Chesham and Amersham by-election, but lost to the Liberal Democrats. In 2006, she became a member of the Conservative Party's National Executive Committee.\n\n#### Backbencher (2010–2012)\n\nTruss was elected as the Member of Parliament for South West Norfolk in the 2010 general election. She served on various parliamentary committees, including the Treasury Select Committee and the Environmental Audit Committee.\n\n#### Education Under-Secretary (2012–2014)\n\nIn 2012, Truss was appointed as the Education Under-Secretary, a junior ministerial position, by the Prime Minister David Cameron. In this role, she was responsible for higher education and vocational education.\n\n#### Environment Secretary (2014–2016)\n\nIn 2014, Truss was promoted to the position of Environment Secretary, a cabinet position.

She also announced a mini-budget, which included a series of tax cuts and increased government borrowing. The mini-budget was widely criticized by economists and opposition politicians, who argued that it would increase inflation and widen the UK's budget deficit.\n\n#### Government Crisis and Resignation\n\nThe mini-budget triggered a government crisis, with several cabinet ministers resigning and opposition politicians calling for Truss's resignation. On October 20, 2022, Truss's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, resigned, and she replaced him with Jeremy Hunt. However, the crisis continued, and on October 25, 2022, Truss announced her resignation as Prime Minister, effective immediately.\n\n**Post-Premiership (2022–present)**\n\nAfter resigning as Prime Minister, Truss became the Member of Parliament for South West Norfolk.

The battle began in August 2022 and continued until the city was captured by Russian forces in early June 2023.\n\n**Background**\n\nBakhmut, a city of approximately 75,000 people, has a strategic location in eastern Ukraine, situated on the Bakhmutka River. The city is a key transportation hub, connecting the industrial centers of Donetsk and Kharkiv. The surrounding area is rich in coal deposits and has significant agricultural production. Following the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, Ukraine faced increasing tensions with Russia, which eventually led to the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\n**Battle**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut can be divided into several stages, each marked by significant changes in the situation on the ground.\n\n### Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nIn August 2022, Russian forces began to shell Bakhmut, targeting the city's infrastructure and residential areas. Ukrainian forces responded with counter-battery fire, but the Russian artillery superiority eventually led to significant damage to the city's buildings and essential services. As the Russian forces advanced, they established a foothold in the outskirts of Bakhmut, beginning a prolonged and bloody battle for control of the city.\n\n### Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nIn the early winter months, the fighting intensified, with both sides suffering heavy losses. Russian forces made significant gains, pushing Ukrainian forces back and encroaching on the city itself. Ukrainian forces, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, managed to hold their ground in several key areas, including the city's central square. The fighting during this period was fierce, with both sides employing heavy artillery and infantry tactics.\n\n### Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, Russian forces captured the nearby city of Soledar, which gave them a strategic advantage and allowed them to encircle Bakhmut from the north. Ukrainian forces, however, managed to maintain a tenuous connection with the city, keeping the supply lines open. The capture of Soledar marked a significant turning point in the battle, as Russian forces now had a clear path to Bakhmut.\n\n### Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, Ukrainian forces launched a series of flanking counterattacks, aiming to drive a wedge between Russian forces and cut off their supply lines. These attacks, though initially successful, were ultimately repelled by Russian forces, who had established a strong defensive position around Bakhmut.\n\n### Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn 20 May 2023, Russian forces launched a final assault on Bakhmut, which was captured after fierce fighting. The capture of the city marked a significant victory for Russian forces, but at a heavy cost. The Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, which had been instrumental in the capture of Bakhmut, withdrew from the city in early June 2023, citing disagreements with the Russian military command.\n\n**Military strength and tactics**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was a testament to the military strength and tactics employed by both sides. Ukrainian forces, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, managed to hold their ground through a combination of bravery, determination, and clever tactics. Russian forces, on the other hand, employed heavy artillery and infantry tactics to break through Ukrainian defenses.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut had significant consequences for both sides.\n\n### Strategic value\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut gave Russian forces a strategic advantage, allowing them to control the surrounding area and gain access to the Donbas region. The city's capture also marked a significant psychological blow to Ukraine, as it was seen as a major defeat for the Ukrainian military.\n\n### Battlefield conditions\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by extreme conditions, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The city was left in ruins, with significant damage to its infrastructure and residential areas. The fighting also left a trail of destruction in the surrounding countryside, with abandoned buildings and debris scattered across the landscape.\n\n### Casualties\n\nBoth sides suffered significant casualties during the battle.\n\n#### Military casualties\n\nEstimates of military casualties vary widely, but it is believed that Ukrainian forces lost between 5,000 to 10,000 soldiers, while Russian forces lost between 10,000 to 20,000 s", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Bakhmut\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n#Military strength and tactics\n#Aftermath\n##Strategic value\n##Battlefield conditions\n##Casualties\n###Military casualties\n###Civilian casualties\n##Attrition\n##Result\n#Allegations of war crimes\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is one of the largest and most important museums in the state, with a collection of over 130,000 objects spanning from prehistory to the 21st century. The museum is situated in the heart of Darmstadt's historic Old Town, within walking distance of the city's main attractions.\n\n#History\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a rich history dating back to 1919, when it was founded as the \"Großherzoglich-Hessisches Landesmuseum\". The museum's initial collection consisted of 30,000 objects, primarily from the Darmstadt region. Over the years, the museum's collection has grown significantly, thanks to numerous acquisitions, donations, and archaeological excavations. In 1935, the museum was renamed the \"Staatliches Museum Darmstadt\", and after World War II, it was re-established as the \"Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\".\n\nThe museum's early years were marked by a focus on natural history and archaeology, with a collection of fossils, minerals, and ancient artifacts. However, in the 1960s, the museum began to shift its focus towards art and cultural history, reflecting the growing interest in modern and contemporary art. Today, the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt is one of the leading art museums in Germany, with a collection of over 20,000 works of art from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n#Building\n\n##Location\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt is located in the heart of Darmstadt's historic Old Town, within walking distance of the city's main attractions. The museum's address is Mathildenstraße 3, 64283 Darmstadt.\n\n##Renovations and extensions\n\nThe museum's building has undergone several renovations and extensions over the years. In the 1970s, the museum's main building was renovated to accommodate the growing collection and increasing visitor numbers. In the 1990s, a new wing was added to the museum, providing additional exhibition space and improved facilities. In 2019, the museum underwent a major renovation, which included the installation of new lighting, climate control systems, and exhibition design.\n\nThe renovation also involved the creation of a new entrance and reception area, as well as the development of a museum shop and café. The project was undertaken to improve the museum's accessibility and visitor experience, while also enhancing the building's architectural and cultural significance.\n\n#Collections\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a vast collection of over 130,000 objects, spanning from prehistory to the 21st century. The museum's collection is divided into several departments, including:\n\n* Art and cultural history: The museum's art collection includes works from the 19th and 20th centuries, including paintings, sculptures, and prints.\n* Archaeology: The museum's archaeological collection includes artifacts from prehistory to the Middle Ages, including pottery, jewelry, and other artifacts.\n* Natural history: The museum's natural history collection includes fossils, minerals, and other objects related to the natural world.\n\nThe museum's collection also includes a significant number of artifacts related to the history of Darmstadt and the Hessian region, including documents, photographs, and other objects.\n\n#Gallery\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has several permanent galleries, each focused on a specific aspect of the museum's collection. These galleries include:\n\n* The art gallery: This gallery features a selection of works from the museum's art collection, including paintings, sculptures, and prints.\n* The archaeological gallery: This gallery features a selection of artifacts from the museum's archaeological collection, including pottery, jewelry, and other artifacts.\n* The natural history gallery: This gallery features a selection of fossils, minerals, and other objects related to the natural world.\n* The Darmstadt gallery: This gallery features a selection of artifacts related to the history of Darmstadt and the Hessian region.\n\nThe museum also hosts temporary exhibitions, which are usually focused on specific themes or topics. These exhibitions may be organized in collaboration with other museums or institutions, and may feature loans from other collections.\n\n#Special exhibitions\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt regularly hosts special exhibitions, which are usually focused on specific themes or topics. These exhibitions may be organized in collaboration with other museums or institutions, and may feature loans from other collections.\n\nSome recent special exhibitions at the museum include:\n\n* \"Impressionism and Expressionism\" (2020): This exhibition featured a selection of works from the museum's collection, including paintings, sculptures, and prints.\n* \"The Archaeology of Hesse\" (2019): This exhibition featured a selection of artifacts from the museum's archaeological collection, including pottery, jewelry, and other artifacts.\n* \"The Natural History of Hesse\" (2018): This exhibition featured a selection of fossils, minerals, and other objects related to the natural world.\n\n#Controversies\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has been involved in several controversies over the years, including:\n\n* In 2019, the museum was criticized for its handling of a temporary exhibition on the history of Darmstadt's Jewish community. Some critics argued that the exhibition was too focused on the negative aspects of the community's history, while others argued that it did not provide enough context or background information.\n* In 2018, the museum was criticized for its decision to display a selection of artifacts from the \"Dachau Collection\", which includes objects that were created by prisoners at the Dachau concentration camp. Some critics argued that the display of these artifacts was insensitive and inappropriate.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of museums in Germany\n* List of art museums in Germany\n* List of natural history museums in Germany\n\n#Films\n\n* \"The Museum\" (2019): This documentary film features the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt and explores the role of museums in contemporary society.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"The Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt: A Guide to the Collection\" (2020)\n* \"The Art and Archaeology of Hesse: A History of the Collection\" (2019)\n* \"The Natural History of Hesse: A Guide to the Collection\" (2018)\n\n#External links\n\n* Official website of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hessisches_Landesmuseum_Darmstadt\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Building\n##Location\n##Renovations and extensions\n#Collections\n#Gallery\n#Special exhibitions\n#Controversies\n#See also\n#Films\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on December 14, 1946, in London, England, Birkin is known for her unique and eclectic career spanning over six decades, with notable roles in film, television, and music.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJane Birkin was born to David Birkin, a British artist and writer, and Judy Gordon, a Scottish ballet dancer. Her parents separated when she was a year old, and she was raised by her mother in Cherry Burton, Yorkshire. Birkin's early life was marked by a love for music and dance, and she began playing the piano at the age of five.\n\nBirkin's family moved to France in 1952, where she attended a private boarding school in Paris. She developed a passion for singing and began performing in local talent shows. After completing her secondary education, Birkin moved to London to pursue a career in acting.\n\n**Career**\n\n### Early Acting Credits\n\nBirkin's acting career began in the early 1960s, with small roles in British television productions and films. Her breakthrough role came in 1965 when she appeared in the film \"The Americanization of Emily,\" opposite James Garner. However, it was her performance in the 1966 film \"Blowup\" that brought her international recognition.\n\n### Collaborations with Serge Gainsbourg\n\nBirkin's collaboration with French singer and songwriter Serge Gainsbourg began in the late 1960s. The two artists released several albums together, including \"Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg\" (1969) and \"Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg, Vol. 2\" (1971). Their music featured a unique blend of French pop, jazz, and folk influences.\n\nBirkin and Gainsbourg's personal relationship also garnered significant media attention. The two artists were in a romantic relationship from 1968 to 1980, and their partnership was marked by a deep creative and emotional connection.\n\n### Later Performances and Recordings\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Birkin continued to work in film and television, appearing in a range of productions, including \"Death on the Nile\" (1978) and \"The Thief and the Cobbler\" (1993). She also released several solo albums, including \"Di Do Da\" (1973) and \"Ex Fan des Sixties\" (1978).\n\nBirkin's music evolved over the years, incorporating a range of styles, from folk and rock to electronic and ambient. Her collaborations with other artists, including Ryuichi Sakamoto and Barry Reynolds, resulted in critically acclaimed albums such as \"Ex Fan des Sixties\" and \"Ambre\" (1981).\n\n**Personal Life**\n\n### Death\n\nJane Birkin passed away on July 16, 2023, at the age of 76, in Paris, France. Her death was met with tributes and condolences from fans and fellow artists around the world.\n\n### Philanthropy\n\nThroughout her career, Birkin was involved in various charitable endeavors, including the French Red Cross and the charity organization, Les Enfants de la Terre. She also supported several environmental causes, including the preservation of the Amazon rainforest and the protection of endangered species.\n\n### Political Views and Activism\n\nBirkin was an outspoken advocate for social justice and human rights. She was involved in several high-profile campaigns, including the anti-apartheid movement and the women's rights movement. Birkin also supported the French Left and was a vocal critic of the country's government policies.\n\n**Awards and Honours**\n\nJane Birkin received numerous awards and honors throughout her career, including a César Award for Best Actress for her performance in \"Blowup.\" She was also awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government in 1996.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\n### Birkin Basket\n\nThe term \"Birkin basket\" refers to a type of woven basket that is similar to a traditional French basket. The design is often attributed to Jane Birkin, who allegedly carried a similar basket on a flight in the 1980s, and the airline's crew were so taken by the design that they asked her to reveal the name of the basket's manufacturer. The basket has since become a sought-after design classic.\n\n### Birkin Bag\n\nThe \"Birkin bag\" is a luxury handbag designed by Hermès, a French fashion house. The design is inspired by Jane Birkin, who allegedly complained to Hermès CEO Jean-Louis Dumas about the lack of a stylish and spacious handbag. Dumas responded by creating the Birkin bag, which has since become one of the most iconic and sought-after luxury handbags in the world.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg (1969)\n* Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg, Vol. 2 (1971)\n* Di Do Da (1973)\n* Ex Fan des Sixties (1978)\n* Ambre (1981)\n\n**Filmography**\n\n### Film\n\n* The Americanization of Emily (1964)\n* Blowup (1966)\n* Death on the Nile (1978)\n* The Thief and the Cobbler (1993)\n\n### Television\n\n* The Wednesday Play (1964)\n* The Avengers (1965)\n* The Baron (1966)\n* The Saint (1969)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Serge Gainsbourg\n* Hermès\n* Birkin bag\n* Birkin basket\n\n**References**\n\n**External links**\n\n* Jane Birkin at IMDb\n* Jane Birkin at AllMusic\n* Jane Birkin at Discogs", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jane_Birkin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##Early acting credits\n##Collaborations with Serge Gainsbourg\n##Later performances and recordings\n#Personal life\n##Death\n##Philanthropy\n##Political views and activism\n#Awards and honours\n#In popular culture\n##Birkin basket\n##Birkin bag\n#Discography\n#Filmography\n##Film\n##Television\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The country's rich cultural heritage and strategic location between Europe and the Middle East have contributed to the diversity and complexity of its armorial bearings.\n\n**Medieval period**\n\nDuring the medieval period, the armorial of Albania was characterized by a blend of Byzantine, Venetian, and Ottoman influences. The country's nobility and ruling classes adopted coats of arms that reflected their alliances, trade relationships, and military campaigns.\n\n### Ambiguitatem\n\nThe earliest known armorial bearings in Albania date back to the 12th century, during the reign of the Byzantine Empire. These early coats of arms often featured simple geometric shapes, animals, and plants, which were used to identify the wearer or their family. The use of ambiguitatem, or ambiguous symbols, was also common, as it allowed nobles to subtly convey their allegiances and status without openly declaring it.\n\n### Regnum Albaniæ\n\nThe Kingdom of Albania, established in the 14th century, introduced a more formalized system of armorial bearings. The royal family and nobles adopted coats of arms that reflected their connections to the crown and their military achievements. The use of royal lions, eagles, and other symbols became widespread, symbolizing the power and prestige of the Albanian monarchs.\n\n### Feudal lords\n\nFeudal lords and vassals also developed their own armorial bearings, which often featured their family crests, mottoes, and other heraldic devices. These coats of arms were used to identify the lord's territory, his relationship with the royal family, and his military prowess. The use of feudal armorial bearings helped to establish a system of social hierarchy and reinforced the bonds between the nobility and the monarch.\n\n**Albanian nobility**\n\nThe Albanian nobility, comprising the beys, pasas, and other prominent families, developed their own distinct armorial traditions. Their coats of arms often featured intricate designs, reflecting their wealth, influence, and cultural connections.\n\n### Austria–Hungary\n\nDuring the 19th century, Albania was under the control of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Albanian nobility adopted coats of arms that incorporated elements of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, such as the double-headed eagle and the imperial crown. This period saw the emergence of new armorial devices, including the use of imperial eagles, lions, and other symbols.\n\n### Italian States\n\nThe Italian States, particularly the Venetian Republic, had a significant impact on the armorial of Albania. The Venetians introduced their own heraldic devices, such as the winged lion, which became a popular motif among the Albanian nobility. The use of Italian armorial bearings helped to establish trade and cultural connections between Albania and the Italian States.\n\n#### Albania Vèneta\n\nAlbania Vèneta, a region in northern Albania, developed its own distinct armorial tradition. The coats of arms used in this region often featured elements of the Venetian Republic, such as the winged lion and the imperial eagle.\n\n#### Dalmatia\n\nDalmatia, a region in southern Albania, also developed its own armorial bearings. The coats of arms used in this region often featured elements of the Dalmatian Republic, such as the lion and the imperial eagle.\n\n#### Istria\n\nIstria, a region in western Albania, developed its own distinct armorial tradition. The coats of arms used in this region often featured elements of the Istrian Republic, such as the winged lion and the imperial eagle.\n\n### Dicio Pontificia\n\nThe Dicio Pontificia, a region in eastern Albania, developed its own distinct armorial tradition. The coats of arms used in this region often featured elements of the Papal States, such as the papal keys and the imperial eagle.\n\n### Genoa, Neapolis, Sicilia...\n\nOther regions in Albania, such as Genoa, Neapolis, and Sicilia, also developed their own distinct armorial traditions. These regions often featured their own unique heraldic devices, which reflected their cultural and trade connections.\n\n**Moldavia & Romania**\n\nMoldavia and Romania, neighboring countries to Albania, also had an impact on the country's armorial bearings. The use of Moldavian and Romanian coats of arms, such as the eagle and the double-headed eagle, became widespread among the Albanian nobility.\n\n**Greece**\n\nGreece, a country with a rich cultural heritage, also had an impact on the armorial of Albania. The use of Greek coats of arms, such as the double-headed eagle and the imperial eagle, became popular among the Albanian nobility.\n\n**Ottoman Empire**\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, which controlled Albania from the 15th to the 20th century, had a significant impact on the country's armorial bearings. The use of Ottoman coats of arms, such as the crescent and the star, became widespread among the Albanian nobility. The grand viziers of the Ottoman Empire also developed their own distinct armorial traditions.\n\n### Grand viziers\n\nThe grand viziers of the Ottoman Empire, who served as the chief administrators of the empire, developed their own distinctive armorial bearings. These coats of arms often featured elements of the Ottoman Empire, such as the crescent and the star.\n\n**Egypt**\n\nEgypt, a country with a rich cultural heritage, also had an impact on the armorial of Albania. The use of Egyptian coats of arms, such as the lion and the imperial eagle, became popular among the Albanian nobility.\n\n**Modern period**\n\nThe modern period, which began in the 20th century, saw significant changes in the armorial of Albania. The country gained independence from the Ottoman Empire and developed its own distinct national coat of arms. The use of modern armorial bearings, such as the eagle and the double-headed eagle, became widespread among the Albanian people.\n\n**Ecclesiastical coats of arms**\n\nEcclesiastical coats of arms, used by the Albanian Orthodox Church and other religious institutions, also developed their own distinct traditions. These coats of arms often featured elements of the Orthodox faith, such as the cross and the dove.\n\n### Coats of arms\n\nThe use of coats of arms, also known as armorials, became widespread among the Albanian nobility and clergy. These coats of arms often featured intricate designs, reflecting the wearer's status, family connections, and military achievements.\n\n### Seals\n\nSeals, used by the Albanian nobility and clergy, also developed their own distinct traditions. These seals often featured elements of the wearer's coat of arms, such as the eagle and the double-headed eagle.\n\n**In society**\n\nThe armorial bearings of Albania played a significant role in society, reflecting the country's cultural heritage and social hierarchy.

This region includes the coastal areas of northern Australia, as well as the island nations of the South Pacific.\n\nThe Australian region cyclone season typically runs from November to May, with the peak season occurring between December and April. This period is characterized by the presence of a warm ocean current and a low-pressure system that can develop into a tropical cyclone.\n\n**Season forecasts**\n\nBefore the start of the season, several organizations, including the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) and the Fiji Meteorological Service, issued forecast advisories for the number of tropical cyclones expected to develop in the Australian region. These forecasts are based on climate models and historical data.\n\nAccording to the BOM, the 2022–23 season was expected to be above average, with 14–18 tropical cyclones forecast to develop in the region. However, the actual number of cyclones that formed during the season was lower than expected.\n\n**Season summary**\n\nThe 2022–23 Australian region cyclone season was a relatively quiet season, with a total of 17 tropical cyclones forming in the region.

Situated on the hill of Montmartre, the church is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Paris and a prominent symbol of the city's rich cultural and spiritual heritage.\n\n**History**\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe idea of building a basilica on the hill of Montmartre dates back to the mid-19th century, when the Catholic Church sought to create a monumental church to commemorate the victims of the French Revolution. In 1873, the French government officially authorized the construction of a basilica on the site, and the project was entrusted to the architect Paul Abadie.\n\n### Site\n\nThe site chosen for the basilica was a barren and rocky hill, which was considered unsuitable for building. However, Abadie saw the potential of the location and designed the church to blend seamlessly into the surrounding landscape. The hill was leveled and a foundation was built to support the weight of the massive church.\n\n### Construction\n\nConstruction of the basilica began in 1875 and took 46 years to complete. The church was built using white limestone and travertine, with a distinctive white dome that dominates the Paris skyline. The dome was designed by Abadie to be a symbol of the Catholic Church and was intended to be seen from all corners of the city.\n\n### Controversy over the church\n\nThe construction of the basilica was not without controversy. Many Parisians saw the church as an eyesore and a symbol of the Catholic Church's influence over the city. The church's imposing presence and dominant architecture were seen as a threat to the city's secular values and artistic heritage. Despite these objections, the basilica was completed in 1914 and has since become one of Paris's most beloved landmarks.\n\n**Description**\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe basilica's exterior is a masterclass in neoclassical architecture. The church's façade is a symmetrical composition of arches, columns, and pilasters, with a central rose window that dominates the front of the building. The façade is topped with a large tympanum, which features a representation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\n\nThe basilica's most striking feature is its white dome, which is visible from all corners of the city. The dome is supported by a massive drum, which is decorated with a series of arches and pilasters. The dome is topped with a large cross, which is made of gleaming white stone.\n\n### Interior\n\n#### The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n\nThe basilica's interior is a treasure trove of artistic and architectural wonders. The most striking feature of the interior is the massive mosaic of the Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which dominates the apse of the church. The mosaic was created by the French artist Luc-Olivier Merson and features a depiction of Christ surrounded by a halo of light.\n\n#### Chapels\n\nThe basilica features a series of chapels, each of which is dedicated to a different saint or aspect of the Catholic faith. The chapels are decorated with a range of artistic and architectural features, including stained glass windows, sculptures, and intricate wood carvings.\n\n#### Crypt\n\nThe basilica's crypt is a subterranean chapel that is dedicated to the memory of the Catholic martyrs of the French Revolution. The crypt features a range of artistic and architectural features, including a series of frescoes that depict the lives of the martyrs.\n\n**Art and decoration**\n\n### Stained glass\n\nThe basilica features a range of stunning stained glass windows, which were created by a number of different artists. The windows are a masterpiece of medieval art and feature a range of colors and designs, including depictions of saints, angels, and biblical scenes.\n\n### Sculpture\n\nThe basilica features a range of sculptures, including a series of statues that depict the apostles of Christ. The statues are made of gleaming white marble and are positioned around the interior of the church, where they can be seen by the faithful.\n\n**Grand organ**\n\nThe basilica's grand organ is a masterpiece of musical instrument-making. The organ was built by the French company Cavaillé-Coll and features a range of pipes and mechanical components that are capable of producing a wide range of sounds and effects.\n\n**Bells**\n\nThe basilica features a range of bells, each of which is decorated with a different design or inscription. The bells are rung on special occasions, including Sundays and holidays, and are a beloved feature of the church's daily routine.\n\n**Role in Catholicism**\n\nThe Sacré-Cœur basilica plays a significant role in the Catholic Church's liturgical and spiritual life. The church is a major pilgrimage site and attracts thousands of visitors each year, who come to pray, worship, and seek spiritual guidance. The basilica is also a major center of Catholic art and architecture, and its beautiful decorations and stunning architecture make it a beloved and iconic symbol of the Catholic faith.\n\n**Access**\n\nThe basilica is open to the public and can be visited by anyone who wishes to do so. Visitors can take a guided tour of the church, which includes access to the interior, the bell tower, and the crypt. The basilica is also open for private prayer and worship, and visitors are welcome to come and pray in the church's peaceful and beautiful surroundings.\n\n**Copy in Martinique**\n\nA copy of the basilica can be found in Martinique, where a smaller replica was built in the early 20th century. The replica is a popular tourist attraction and features many of the same artistic and architectural features as the Parisian basilica.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Catholic Church in France\n* Montmartre\n* Paul Abadie\n* Luc-Olivier Merson\n* Cavaillé-Coll\n* Cavaillé-Coll Organs\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This section is intentionally left blank, as the article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Bibliography (in French)**\n\n* Abadie, P.

They are well adapted to the harsh, cold climate of their native habitats and are found in a variety of ecosystems, from tundra to boreal forests.\n\n**Description**\n\nReindeer are medium to large-sized deer, with adults typically weighing between 80 and 200 kg (180 to 440 lb). They have a distinctive set of antlers, which are grown by both males and females, although the males have larger and more complex antlers. Reindeer are also known for their thick, insulating coats, which are made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. Their coats are usually brown or reddish-brown in color, but can vary depending on the subspecies.\n\n**Status**\n\nReindeer are listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List, although some subspecies are considered endangered or vulnerable. The global population of reindeer is estimated to be around 3-4 million individuals.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe name \"reindeer\" is derived from the Old Norse word \"hreinn,\" which means \"reindeer\" or \"deer.\" The term \"caribou\" is used in North America to refer to the same species of deer.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nReindeer are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor with other deer species around 2-3 million years ago. They are thought to have originated in the northern parts of the Old World, where they adapted to the harsh, cold climate.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nThe taxonomy of reindeer is complex and has undergone many changes over the years. There are several different subspecies of reindeer, which are recognized based on their physical characteristics, distribution, and genetic differences.\n\n### **Naming and research on museum collections**\n\nThe taxonomy of reindeer has been studied extensively through the examination of museum collections. Many museums around the world have collections of reindeer specimens, which have been used to study the morphology, genetics, and phylogeny of the species.\n\n### **Biological exploration expeditions**\n\nBiological exploration expeditions have also played a key role in the study of reindeer. Many expeditions have been conducted to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the world to study the behavior, ecology, and evolution of reindeer in their natural habitats.\n\n### **Reclassification**\n\nThe taxonomy of reindeer has undergone many changes over the years, with some subspecies being reclassified as separate species. This has been driven by advances in genetic and molecular research, as well as the discovery of new fossil evidence.\n\n### **Ecotypes**\n\nReindeer are often divided into different ecotypes, which are groups of individuals that are adapted to specific environments or ecosystems. For example, the woodland caribou is an ecotype of reindeer that is found in boreal forests, while the barren-ground caribou is an ecotype that is found on the tundra.\n\n### **Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence**\n\nGenetic, molecular, and archaeological research have all contributed to our understanding of the taxonomy and evolution of reindeer. For example, studies of mitochondrial DNA have been used to reconstruct the phylogeny of reindeer, while fossil evidence has been used to study the evolution of their antlers.\n\n### **Novel genetics-based clades**\n\nRecent advances in genetics have led to the discovery of novel clades of reindeer that were not previously recognized. These clades are often based on genetic differences that are not reflected in their morphology or ecology.\n\n**Species and subspecies**\n\nThere are several different species and subspecies of reindeer, which are recognized based on their physical characteristics, distribution, and genetic differences. Some of the most well-known species of reindeer include:\n\n* Rangifer tarandus (reindeer or caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus tarandus (Eurasian reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus granti (Peary caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus caribou (woodland caribou)\n\n**Physical characteristics**\n\nReindeer have several distinctive physical characteristics that allow them to adapt to their environment. Some of these characteristics include:\n\n### **Antlers**\n\nReindeer are known for their large and complex antlers, which are grown by both males and females. The antlers are made up of a series of branching points, which are covered in a velvet-like material. The antlers are shed and regrown every year.\n\n### **Pelt**\n\nReindeer have a thick, insulating coat that is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. The coat is usually brown or reddish-brown in color, but can vary depending on the subspecies.\n\n### **Heat exchange**\n\nReindeer have a number of adaptations that help them to conserve heat in their cold environment. These include a thick coat, a circulatory system that allows them to conserve heat, and a unique way of breathing that helps to conserve heat.\n\n### **Hooves**\n\nReindeer have large, flat hooves that are well adapted to their environment. The hooves are made up of a hard outer layer and a soft inner layer, and are used for walking, running, and jumping.\n\n### **Size**\n\nReindeer vary in size depending on the subspecies, but adults typically weigh between 80 and 200 kg (180 to 440 lb).\n\n### **Clicking sound**\n\nReindeer are known for the distinctive clicking sound that they make with their hooves. This sound is made by the hooves striking the ground and is used for communication and navigation.\n\n### **Eyes**\n\nReindeer have large, expressive eyes that are well adapted to their environment. The eyes are able to detect movement and changes in light, and are used for seeing and navigating in the dark.\n\n**Biology and behaviors**\n\nReindeer are well adapted to their environment and have a number of unique biology and behaviors that allow them to survive and thrive in the Arctic and subarctic regions of the world.\n\n### **Seasonal body composition**\n\nReindeer have a unique body composition that allows them to adapt to changes in their environment. In the summer, they are able to eat and drink more, which allows them to store fat and build up their body condition. In the winter, they are able to survive on their stored fat reserves.\n\n### **Reproduction and life cycle**\n\nReindeer are polyestrous, which means that they are able to breed multiple times during their lifetime. The reproductive cycle of reindeer is influenced by a number of factors, including daylight, temperature, and nutrition.\n\n### **Social structure, migration and range**\n\nReindeer are social animals and are often found in large herds. The social structure of reindeer is complex and is influenced by a number of factors, including age, sex, and dominance.\n\n**Ecology**\n\nReindeer play a key role in their ecosystems and are an important food source for many other animals. They are also an important part of the nutrient cycle, as they help to transfer nutrients from the terrestrial ecosystem to the aquatic ecosystem.\n\n### **Distribution and habitat**\n\nReindeer are found in a variety of ecosystems, including tundra, boreal forests, and Arctic deserts. They are adapted to a range of temperatures and can be found in areas ranging from sea level to high mountains.\n\n### **Diet**\n\nReindeer are herbivores and are adapted to a diet of lichens, mosses, and other vegetation. They are also able to eat a variety of other plants, including grasses, sedges, and shrubs.\n\n### **Predators**\n\nReindeer have a number of predators, including wolves, bears, and humans. These predators are able to hunt reindeer for a variety of reasons, including for food, sport, and control.\n\n### **Other threats**\n\nReindeer are also threatened by a number of other factors, including climate change, habitat destruction, and disease.\n\n**Conservation**\n\nReindeer are an important part of their ecosystems and are a key species for conservation efforts. There are a number of organizations and initiatives that are working to protect and conserve reindeer populations.\n\n### **Current status**\n\nReindeer are listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List, although some subspecies are considered endangered or vulnerable.\n\n### **Boreal woodland caribou**\n\nThe boreal woodland caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in boreal forests. They are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act and are protected by a number of conservation agreements.\n\n### **Peary caribou**\n\nThe Peary caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the Arctic. They are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List and are protected by a number of conservation agreements.\n\n**Relationship with humans**\n\nReindeer have a long and complex history with humans, who have hunted and domesticated them for thousands of years.\n\n### **Indigenous North Americans**\n\nReindeer have been an important part of the culture and traditions of Indigenous North Americans for thousands of years. They are still hunted and consumed by many Indigenous communities today.\n\n### **Indigenous Eurasians**\n\nReindeer have also been an important part of the culture and traditions of Indigenous Eurasians for thousands of years. They are still hunted and consumed by many Indigenous communities today.\n\n### **Husbandry**\n\nReindeer have been domesticated by humans for thousands of years and are used for a variety of purposes, including milk, meat, and wool.\n\n### **History**\n\nReindeer have a long and complex history with humans, who have hunted and domesticated them for thousands of years. They were first domesticated in Siberia and were introduced to Europe and North America by early migrants.\n\n### **Santa Claus**\n\nReindeer are also associated with the legend of Santa Claus, who is said to ride on a reindeer-drawn sleigh on Christmas Eve.\n\n### **Mythology and art**\n\nReindeer have been the subject of a number of myths and legends throughout history, and are often depicted in art and literature. They are also an important part of the folklore and mythology of many cultures.\n\n### **Heraldry and symbols**\n\nReindeer are often used as symbols and heraldry in many cultures, including the flags and coats of arms of several countries.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Caribou-specific links (North America)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* \n\n**References**\n\n* \n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \n\n**External links**\n\n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Reindeer\" following this outline:\n\n#Description\n#Status\n#Naming\n#Evolution\n#Taxonomy\n##Naming and research on museum collections\n##Biological exploration expeditions\n##Reclassification\n###Ecotypes\n###Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n###Novel genetics-based clades\n#Species and subspecies\n#Physical characteristics\n##Antlers\n##Pelt\n##Heat exchange\n##Hooves\n##Size\n##Clicking sound\n##Eyes\n#Biology and behaviors\n##Seasonal body composition\n##Reproduction and life cycle\n##Social structure, migration and range\n#Ecology\n##Distribution and habitat\n##Diet\n##Predators\n##Other threats\n#Conservation\n##Current status\n##Boreal woodland caribou\n##Peary caribou\n#Relationship with humans\n##Indigenous North Americans\n##Indigenous Eurasians\n##Husbandry\n##History\n##Santa Claus\n##Mythology and art\n##Heraldry and symbols\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n##Caribou-specific links (North America)\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Ron Hubbard in 1954. The movement has been the subject of controversy and debate, with some regarding it as a cult, while others view it as a legitimate religion. This article aims to provide a neutral and factual overview of Scientology, its history, beliefs, practices, and controversies.\n\n**Definition and classification**\n\nScientology is often classified as a new religious movement (NRM), a term used to describe spiritual and philosophical movements that emerged in the 20th century. However, the classification of Scientology as a religion is disputed, with some regarding it as a secular self-help movement, while others see it as a distinct religion with its own theology and rituals.\n\n## Debates over classification\n\nThe classification of Scientology as a religion has been the subject of debate among scholars and experts. Some argue that Scientology meets the criteria for a religion, including a shared set of beliefs, rituals, and practices. Others argue that Scientology is a secular self-help movement, as it focuses on personal improvement and self-actualization. The classification of Scientology as a religion has implications for its tax-exempt status and its ability to operate as a church.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe word \"Scientology\" is derived from the Greek words \"scientia,\" meaning knowledge, and \"logos,\" meaning study or science. Hubbard chose the name to reflect the movement's focus on the discovery of knowledge and the pursuit of truth.\n\n**History**\n\nScientology was founded by L. Ron Hubbard in 1954, after he published his book \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health.\" Hubbard's book introduced the concept of the \"reactive mind,\" a collection of painful memories and thoughts that can be held back by the conscious mind. He claimed that through a process called \"auditing,\" individuals could overcome the reactive mind and achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\nHubbard's early teachings emphasized the importance of self-improvement and personal responsibility. However, over time, his teachings evolved to include a more spiritual and metaphysical focus. Hubbard claimed that humans are immortal spiritual beings, known as \"thetans,\" who have existed for millions of years. He also developed a complex cosmology, which included the concept of the \"Wall of Fire,\" a spiritual barrier that separates the thetans from the physical world.\n\n**Beliefs and practices**\n\nScientology is a spiritual movement that emphasizes the importance of self-improvement and personal responsibility. Hubbard's teachings focus on the concept of the \"reactive mind,\" a collection of painful memories and thoughts that can be held back by the conscious mind. Through a process called \"auditing,\" individuals can overcome the reactive mind and achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\n## Auditing\n\nAuditing is a process in which an individual is guided by a trained auditor through a series of questions and exercises. The goal of auditing is to identify and confront the individual's reactive mind, allowing them to overcome painful memories and thoughts and achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\n## Soul\n\nIn Scientology, the soul is known as the \"thetan.\" Hubbard believed that the thetan is an immortal spiritual being that has existed for millions of years. He claimed that the thetan is the true self of the individual, and that it is the thetan that experiences spiritual growth and enlightenment.\n\n## Space opera and the Wall of Fire\n\nHubbard developed a complex cosmology, which included the concept of the \"Wall of Fire,\" a spiritual barrier that separates the thetans from the physical world. He claimed that the thetans are trapped in a cycle of reincarnation, and that the Wall of Fire prevents them from escaping. Through auditing and spiritual practice, individuals can overcome the Wall of Fire and achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\n## The Operating Thetan levels\n\nScientology has a series of spiritual levels, known as the \"Operating Thetan\" levels. These levels are designed to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment and overcome the reactive mind. The Operating Thetan levels involve a series of auditing sessions and spiritual exercises, and are intended to help individuals understand and overcome their reactive mind.\n\n## Ethics\n\nScientology has a complex system of ethics, which emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and self-improvement. Hubbard believed that individuals have the power to choose their actions and create their own reality, and that they are responsible for overcoming their reactive mind and achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\n## Symbology\n\nScientology has a complex system of symbology, which includes the use of symbols, rituals, and ceremonies. Hubbard believed that symbols and rituals could help individuals connect with the spiritual world and achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\n## Psychiatry, psychology, psychosis\n\nScientology has a complex relationship with psychiatry and psychology. Hubbard was critical of psychiatry and psychology, and believed that they were used to control and manipulate individuals. However, Scientology also uses some of the techniques of psychiatry and psychology, such as auditing and therapy, to help individuals overcome their reactive mind and achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\n## Views on Hubbard\n\nScientologists regard Hubbard as a spiritual leader and a prophet. They believe that he received spiritual revelations and insights that are the basis of Scientology. However, Hubbard's teachings and actions have been the subject of controversy and debate, and some have questioned his motives and integrity.\n\n**The Church of Scientology**\n\nThe Church of Scientology is the central organization of Scientology, and is responsible for promoting the movement's teachings and practices. The church has a complex internal organization, with a hierarchical structure and a system of spiritual ranks.\n\n## Internal organization\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a hierarchical structure, with a system of spiritual ranks and a complex system of internal governance. The church is led by a group of senior executives, known as the \"Executive Committee,\" who are responsible for making strategic decisions and overseeing the movement's operations.\n\n## Promotional material\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a extensive promotional material, including books, videos, and websites. The church uses these materials to promote its teachings and practices, and to recruit new members.\n\n## Social outreach\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a complex system of social outreach, which includes charitable activities and community service. The church has established a number of social programs, including drug rehabilitation centers and literacy programs.\n\n## Responses to opponents\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a complex system of responses to opponents, which includes a network of lawyers and public relations specialists. The church has used these resources to defend itself against criticism and controversy, and to silence its critics.\n\n## Suppressive persons and fair game\n\nScientology has a complex system of terminology, which includes the concept of \"Suppressive Persons\" (SPs) and \"Fair Game.\" SPs are individuals who are deemed to be hostile to Scientology, and who are subject to harassment and persecution. Fair Game is a policy of retaliation against SPs, which includes a range of activities, from financial sabotage to physical assault.\n\n**Free Zone and independent Scientology**\n\nThe Free Zone is a network of independent Scientology groups, which are not affiliated with the Church of Scientology. The Free Zone was established by individuals who were dissatisfied with the Church of Scientology's authoritarian structure and practices.\n\n## Controversies\n\nScientology has been the subject of controversy and debate, with some regarding it as a cult, while others view it as a legitimate religion. The movement's teachings and practices have been criticized for being abusive and exploitative, and for promoting a paranoid and conspiratorial worldview.\n\n### Hubbard's motives\n\nScientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, has been the subject of controversy and debate. Some have questioned his motives and integrity, and have accused him of using Scientology to promote his own personal interests and ego.\n\n### Criminal behavior\n\nScientology has been accused of engaging in criminal behavior, including organized harassment, financial sabotage, and physical assault. The movement has also been accused of engaging in coercive recruitment practices, including the use of mind control and manipulation.\n\n### Organized harassment\n\nScientology has a complex system of organized harassment, which includes a network of lawyers, public relations specialists, and security agents. The movement has used these resources to silence its critics and defend itself against criticism.\n\n### Mistreatment of Members\n\nScientology has been accused of mistreating its members, including the use of physical and emotional abuse, financial exploitation, and psychological manipulation. The movement has also been accused of promoting a culture of fear and paranoia, which can lead to mental health problems and other negative consequences.\n\n### Violation of auditing confidentiality\n\nScientology has been accused of violating the confidentiality of auditing sessions, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive personal information and the disruption of relationships.\n\n### Allegations of coerced abortions\n\nScientology has been accused of coercing its members into having abortions, including the use of financial and emotional blackmail.\n\n### Allegation of human trafficking and other crimes against women\n\nScientology has been accused of engaging in human trafficking and other crimes against women, including the use of coercion, manipulation, and physical abuse.\n\n### Scientology, litigation, and the Internet\n\nScientology has been involved in a number of high-profile lawsuits, including cases involving defamation, libel, and harassment. The movement has also been accused of using the internet to harass and silence its critics.\n\n**Disputes over legal status**\n\nScientology has been the subject of disputes over its legal status, with some arguing that it is a legitimate religion, while others view it as a cult or a business. The movement's tax-exempt status has been the subject of controversy, with some arguing that it should be revoked due to its alleged abuses and exploitations.\n\n**Scientology in religious studies**\n\nScientology has been the subject of study and analysis in the field of religious studies, with scholars examining its teachings, practices, and organizational structure. Scientology's unique blend of spirituality, psychology, and science fiction has made it a subject of interest and controversy among scholars.\n\n## Influences\n\nScientology has been influenced by a number of spiritual and philosophical traditions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Theosophy. Hubbard's teachings also reflect his interest in science fiction and fantasy, as well as his fascination with the occult and the supernatural.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nScientology has a small but dedicated following, with estimates suggesting that there are between 20,000 and 50,000 practicing members worldwide. The movement has a strong presence in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, but is less prominent in other countries.\n\n## Recruitment\n\nScientology's recruitment practices have been the subject of controversy and debate. The movement has been accused of using coercive and exploitative tactics to recruit new members, including the use of financial incentives and emotional manipulation.\n\n**Reception and influence**\n\nScientology has had a significant impact on popular culture, with references to the movement appearing in films, television shows, and literature. Scientology has also been the subject of controversy and debate, with some regarding it as a cult or a business, while others view it as a legitimate religion.\n\n## Media, popular culture, and academia\n\nScientology has been the subject of media coverage and popular culture references, including films, television shows, and books.

The service began on February 15, 2019, with the introduction of the first train, which connected New Delhi to Varanasi, a city located in the eastern part of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The Vande Bharat Express is designed to be a game-changer in the Indian Railways' efforts to provide efficient, comfortable, and reliable transportation services to passengers.\n\n**#History**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express is a culmination of over five decades of efforts by the Indian Railways to increase the speed of its trains. The journey to introduce a high-speed train service in India began in the 1960s.\n\n### **##Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)**\n\nIn the 1960s, the Indian Railways began to explore the possibility of introducing high-speed trains in the country. The first high-speed rail project in India, the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train, was conceptualized in the 1960s. However, due to various reasons, including technical and financial challenges, the project was put on hold for over four decades. In the 1990s and 2000s, the Indian Railways introduced several high-speed trains, including the Shatabdi Express and the Rajdhani Express, which were designed to reduce travel time between cities. However, these trains did not have a significant impact on reducing travel time, as they were not designed to operate at high speeds.\n\n### **##Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)**\n\nIn 2016, the Indian Railways embarked on a new project to design and manufacture an indigenous high-speed trainset. The project, which was led by the Indian Railways' Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), aimed to create a trainset that could operate at speeds of up to 220 km/h (137 mph). The project involved the collaboration of several Indian companies, including the Indian Railways' Production Units, the Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), and the Indian Railways' Signalling and Telecommunication (S&T) departments. The trainset was designed to be a self-propelled, electric multiple unit (EMU) with 16 coaches, including a power car at both ends.\n\n### **##Introduction and further (2019–present)**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express was introduced on February 15, 2019, with the first train connecting New Delhi to Varanasi. The train was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who flagged off the train from the Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station in New Delhi. The Vande Bharat Express was designed to reduce travel time between New Delhi and Varanasi to just 10 hours, compared to the 12 hours taken by the previous Shatabdi Express train. The train was a huge success, with all the 16 coaches being fully occupied on the inaugural run. Since its introduction, the Vande Bharat Express has been extended to other cities, including Katra, Amritsar, and Madurai.\n\n**#Rolling stock**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express is a self-propelled, electric multiple unit (EMU) with 16 coaches, including a power car at both ends. The trainset is designed to operate at speeds of up to 220 km/h (137 mph). The coaches are equipped with modern amenities, including air-conditioning, Wi-Fi, and bio-toilets. The trainset is also equipped with advanced safety features, including collision avoidance systems and automatic train protection systems.\n\n**#Facilities**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express is equipped with modern facilities, including air-conditioned coaches, Wi-Fi, and bio-toilets. The trainset also has a restaurant car, a pantry car, and a lounge car with comfortable seating and modern amenities. The trainset is also equipped with advanced safety features, including collision avoidance systems and automatic train protection systems.\n\n**#Services**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express offers a range of services, including:\n\n* **High-speed travel**: The trainset is designed to operate at speeds of up to 220 km/h (137 mph), reducing travel time between cities.\n* **Comfortable seating**: The coaches are equipped with comfortable seating, including reclining seats and ample legroom.\n* **Modern amenities**: The trainset is equipped with modern amenities, including air-conditioning, Wi-Fi, and bio-toilets.\n* **Food and beverage services**: The trainset has a restaurant car and a pantry car that offer a range of food and beverage options.\n* **Entertainment**: The trainset has a lounge car with comfortable seating and modern amenities, including TV screens and magazines.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* **Indian Railways**\n* **High-speed rail in India**\n* **Electric multiple unit**\n* **Automatic train protection system**\n\n**#Notes**\n\n* The Vande Bharat Express is a high-speed, intercity train service operated by Indian Railways.\n* The trainset is designed to operate at speeds of up to 220 km/h (137 mph).\n* The coaches are equipped with modern amenities, including air-conditioning, Wi-Fi, and bio-toilets.\n* The trainset has a restaurant car, a pantry car, and a lounge car with comfortable seating and modern amenities.\n\n**#References**\n\n* (This article does not have any references as per the requirements)\n\n**#External links**\n\n* Indian Railways official website\n* Vande Bharat Express official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vande_Bharat_Express\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)\n##Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)\n##Introduction and further (2019–present)\n#Rolling stock\n#Facilities\n#Services\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The referendum has garnered widespread attention and debate, with various groups and individuals endorsing the \"Yes\" or \"No\" campaigns.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Australian Indigenous Voice referendum is a significant moment in the country's history, with the potential to address the ongoing health, economic, and social disparities faced by Indigenous Australians. The referendum is centered on the question of whether the Australian Constitution should be amended to include a provision for an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, which would provide a formal mechanism for Indigenous Australians to have a say in decisions that affect their lives. The \"Yes\" campaign has received support from various groups and individuals, including politicians, political parties, local government, land councils, the legal profession, sporting organisations and athletes, businesses, and community groups. In contrast, the \"No\" campaign has also garnered significant support from various groups and individuals, including politicians, political parties, religious organisations and leaders, and notable individuals.\n\n**#Yes campaign**\n\nThe \"Yes\" campaign has been vocal in its support for the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, with many arguing that it is a crucial step towards reconciliation and addressing the ongoing disparities faced by Indigenous Australians.\n\n### Lead lobby groups\n\nSeveral lead lobby groups have endorsed the \"Yes\" campaign, including:\n\n* The Australian Labor Party's Indigenous Affairs Minister, Linda Burney\n* The Australian Greens' Indigenous Affairs spokesperson, Lidia Thorpe\n* The National Congress of Australia's First Peoples\n* The Australian Indigenous Doctors Association\n* The Australian Indigenous Leadership Centre\n* The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Worker Association\n\n### Politicians\n\n#### Federal\n\nMany
