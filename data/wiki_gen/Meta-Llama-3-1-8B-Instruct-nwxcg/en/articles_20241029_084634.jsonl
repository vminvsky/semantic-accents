The film is a retelling of the life of Prithviraj Chauhan, the last Hindu king of Delhi, who ruled from 1178 to 1192.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the 12th century and revolves around the story of Prithviraj Chauhan, a brave and powerful king who is determined to protect his kingdom from the invading forces of Muhammad Ghori. The story begins with Prithviraj's coronation as the king of Delhi, where he is welcomed by his people and his lover, Sanyogita. However, their happiness is short-lived as Muhammad Ghori, a ruthless and cunning king, sets his sights on Delhi and begins to conquer the surrounding territories.\n\nPrithviraj, aware of the impending threat, prepares his army to face the invaders. He is aided by his trusted advisor, Chand Bardai, who is a skilled poet and warrior. As the battle between Prithviraj's forces and Muhammad Ghori's troops intensifies, the king and his men fight bravely to defend their kingdom. Despite being outnumbered, they manage to hold their ground, but ultimately, they are defeated, and Prithviraj is killed in battle.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Akshay Kumar as Prithviraj Chauhan\n* Manushi Chhillar as Sanyogita\n* Sanjay Dutt as Chand Bardai\n* Sonu Sood as Muhammad Ghori\n* Ashutosh Rana as Kamal Deo\n* Sakshi Tanwar as Chandrika Devi\n* Chandrachur Singh as Balram\n* Abhishek Duhan as Prithviraj's brother\n* Ashish Vidyarthi as Sanyogita's father\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea of making a film on Prithviraj Chauhan's life was first conceived by Yash Raj Films in the early 2000s. The studio had planned to produce a film on the king's life, but the project was shelved due to various reasons. In 2020, the studio revived the project, and Chandraprakash Dwivedi was appointed as the director. The film's script was written by Dwivedi, and the story was adapted from various historical sources.\n\n### Casting\n\nAkshay Kumar was approached to play the role of Prithviraj Chauhan, and he accepted the offer after being impressed by the script and the story. Manushi Chhillar was chosen to play the role of Sanyogita, and Sanjay Dutt was cast as Chand Bardai. The rest of the cast was finalized over the next few months, with many well-known actors joining the project.\n\n### Filming\n\nThe film's principal photography began in September 2021 and lasted for approximately six months. The shoot took place in various locations across India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The film's sets were designed to resemble the 12th-century Indian architecture, and the costumes were inspired by the traditional attire of the time period.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Certification\n\nThe film was certified by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) with a U/A rating, indicating that it is suitable for viewers aged 13 and above.\n\n### Litigations\n\nThe film's release was delayed due to a legal dispute between Yash Raj Films and a production company called Dasvi Films. The latter had claimed that they had produced a film on the same subject and had registered the title \"Samrat Prithviraj\" with the CBFC. However, the Yash Raj Films team argued that they had registered the title first and had completed the film's production. The matter was eventually resolved, and the film was released on June 3, 2023.\n\n### Theatrical release\n\nThe film was released in over 2,500 theaters across India and internationally. It was also released in various formats, including 3D and IMAX.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 15, 2023, and it is available for streaming on various online platforms.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its visuals and performances, while others found it to be a flawed historical drama. Many praised Akshay Kumar's performance as Prithviraj Chauhan, while others felt that it was inconsistent. The film's historical accuracy was also a point of contention, with some critics accusing it of taking creative liberties with the story.\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film performed moderately well at the box office, grossing over ₹150 crore worldwide in its opening weekend. However, its collections declined over the next few weeks, and it eventually grossed around ₹300 crore worldwide.\n\n**Soundtrack**\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, and it features several popular songs, including \"Samrat Prithviraj\", \"Sanyogita\", and \"Chand Bardai\". The soundtrack received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its catchy melodies and others finding it to be uninspired.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film's story is based on the life of Prithviraj Chauhan, who is considered to be one of the greatest kings of India.\n* The film's historical accuracy has been a point of contention among historians and critics, with some accusing it of taking creative liberties with the story.\n* The film's performances, particularly Akshay Kumar's portrayal of Prithviraj Chauhan, have been widely praised by critics and audiences alike.\n\n**References**\n\n* None cited.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Samrat Prithviraj on IMDb\n* Samrat Prithviraj on Bollywood Hungama", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Samrat_Prithviraj\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Filming\n#Release\n##Certification\n##Litigations\n##Theatrical release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Box office\n#Soundtrack\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The deal was announced on March 18, 2023, in the midst of a period of unprecedented turmoil in the banking sector.\n\nBackground\n\n### Credit Suisse and the 2007–2008 financial crisis\n\nCredit Suisse, founded in 1856, had a long-standing reputation as one of the world's leading financial institutions. However, the bank's fortunes began to decline during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. As the global economy teetered on the brink of collapse, Credit Suisse's investment banking arm struggled to maintain profitability. The bank's exposure to complex financial instruments, including toxic assets, left it vulnerable to significant losses.\n\n### Losses in investment banking arm\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, Credit Suisse's investment banking arm continued to experience significant losses. The bank's attempt to revamp its business model and reduce its exposure to risk-taking activities had limited success. Despite efforts to strengthen its balance sheet, Credit Suisse's fortunes remained tied to the volatile global financial markets. The bank's leadership faced intense scrutiny from investors and regulators, who questioned its ability to navigate the treacherous waters of the global economy.\n\n### March 2023 United States bank failures and contagion\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank in March 2023 sent shockwaves through the global financial system. The sudden failure of these two American institutions exposed weaknesses in the US banking sector and heightened concerns about the stability of the global financial system. Credit Suisse, which had significant exposure to the US market, felt the full weight of the crisis. Its shares plummeted, and the bank's leadership was forced to take drastic measures to restore investor confidence.\n\nNegotiations\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS was the result of months of intense negotiations between the two banks. The deal was facilitated by the Swiss government, which provided critical support to both institutions. The negotiations were complex and challenging, with both parties facing significant hurdles. The terms of the deal were kept confidential, but it is believed that UBS offered a significant premium for Credit Suisse's assets.\n\nAcquisition\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS was met with widespread reaction from investors, regulators, and the media. The deal was seen as a dramatic attempt to stabilize the global financial system and prevent further contagion. The Swiss government hailed the transaction as a success, stating that it would help to restore confidence in the country's banking sector.\n\n### AT1 bonds issue\n\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the deal was the issue of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds. These bonds, which were issued to raise capital, were considered to be particularly sensitive. The holders of these bonds faced significant losses as a result of the deal, and their reaction was critical in shaping the terms of the acquisition.\n\n### Sale price issue\n\nAnother area of controversy was the sale price of Credit Suisse's assets to UBS. The terms of the deal were kept confidential, but it is believed that UBS paid a significant premium for the assets. The sale price was seen as a critical factor in shaping the terms of the acquisition, and the negotiations surrounding it were intense.\n\n### Lawsuits\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS was also marked by a series of lawsuits filed by investors and bondholders. These lawsuits challenged the terms of the deal and sought to recover losses incurred as a result of the transaction. The lawsuits were complex and contentious, and their outcome remains uncertain.\n\nImpact\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS had far-reaching implications for the global financial system. The deal was seen as a critical attempt to stabilize the banking sector and prevent further contagion. The Swiss government hailed the transaction as a success, stating that it would help to restore confidence in the country's banking sector. However, the impact of the deal is still being felt, and its full implications remain uncertain.\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS marked a significant turning point in the history of the global financial industry. The deal was a testament to the power of the banking sector and its ability to shape the global economy. However, it also highlighted the risks and uncertainties that surround the industry, and the need for greater regulation and oversight.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Acquisition_of_Credit_Suisse_by_UBS\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Credit Suisse and the 2007–2008 financial crisis\n##Losses in investment banking arm\n##March 2023 United States bank failures and contagion\n#Negotiations\n#Acquisition\n##Reactions\n###AT1 bonds issue\n###Sale price issue\n###Lawsuits\n#Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is second in line to the British throne, after his father.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPrince William Arthur Philip Louis was born on June 21, 1982, at St. Mary's Hospital in London. His birth was announced by Buckingham Palace at 1:42 pm on June 22, 1982. He was the first child of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. As the eldest child of the Prince and Princess of Wales, William became known as His Royal Highness (HRH) from birth.\n\nGrowing up, William spent much of his childhood at Highgrove House, the family's country estate in Gloucestershire, and at Kensington Palace, where the family resided in London. His childhood was marked by the attention of the media, which often focused on his mother's fashion sense and her struggles with bulimia.\n\n**Education**\n\nPrince William attended Eton College, where he was a member of the school's polo team and developed a passion for the sport. He was also a member of the school's Combined Cadet Force, which provided him with military training. After completing his secondary education, William went on to study geography at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. He graduated with a 2:1 honors degree in 2005.\n\n**Early Appointments and Duties**\n\n**Military and Air Ambulance Service**\n\nPrince William joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a search and rescue pilot in 2009. He served in the force for four years, during which time he was deployed on several missions. In 2013, he transferred to the Royal Navy, where he became a helicopter pilot. He continued to serve in the military until 2019, when he announced that he would be leaving the forces to focus on his charitable work.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\n**Relationship with Catherine Middleton**\n\nPrince William met Catherine Middleton, a student at the University of St. Andrews, in 2001.

This marked a significant shift in the royal family's dynamics, with Prince William taking on more responsibilities as the heir apparent.\n\n**Charity Work**\n\n**Humanitarian Causes**\n\nPrince William has been involved in various humanitarian efforts throughout his life. In 2014, he traveled to Malawi, where he worked with the charity, Send a Cow, to help local farmers improve their agricultural practices. He has also worked with the charity, 100 Women Challenge, to support projects aimed at empowering women and girls in developing countries.\n\n**Conservation**\n\nPrince William has a strong interest in conservation and the environment. In 2015, he launched the Tusk Trust, a charity that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in Africa. He has also worked with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to promote conservation efforts and protect endangered species.\n\n**LGBT Rights**\n\nPrince William has been a vocal supporter of LGBT rights. In 2018, he attended a ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalization of homosexuality in England and Wales. He has also spoken out against bullying and discrimination faced by the LGBT community.\n\n**Mental Health**\n\nPrince William has been open about his own struggles with mental health, including his experiences with anxiety and depression. In 2020, he launched the Together for Our Mental Health campaign, which aims to reduce stigma around mental health and encourage people to seek help.\n\n**Homelessness**\n\nPrince William has worked with various charities to support homeless individuals and families. In 2019, he visited a homeless shelter in London, where he met with staff and service users to learn more about their experiences.\n\n**Sport**\n\nPrince William has been involved in various sporting activities throughout his life, including polo and rugby. He has also been a patron of several sports charities, including the Rugby Football Union and the England and Wales Cricket Board.\n\n**Public Image**\n\nPrince William has been subject to intense media scrutiny throughout his life. However, he has also been praised for his charitable work and his efforts to engage with the public. In 2019, he broke with tradition by taking a selfie with a fan, which was widely shared on social media.\n\n**Privacy and the Media**\n\nPrince William has spoken out about the challenges of living in the public eye and the impact of the media on his family. In 2020, he expressed his concerns about the paparazzi and their treatment of his family members, including his wife and children.\n\n**Titles, Styles, and Honours**\n\n**Titles and Styles**\n\nPrince William is known by the following titles and styles:\n\n* His Royal Highness (HRH)\n* The Duke of Cambridge\n* The Earl of Strathearn\n* The Baron Carrickfergus\n\n**Honours**\n\nPrince William has been awarded several honors and decorations, including:\n\n* Order of the Thistle (KT)\n* Royal Victorian Order (GCVO)\n* Order of the Bath (CB)\n* Order of the British Empire (CBE)\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nPrince William's ancestry is complex and diverse, reflecting the many royal and noble families that have contributed to the British monarchy over the centuries.

The visit was widely reported and sparked a significant reaction from various countries and international organizations.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe United States and Taiwan have a complex relationship, with the United States providing Taiwan with military and economic support, while also maintaining a policy of strategic ambiguity towards China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory. In recent years, tensions between the United States and China have increased, particularly with regards to trade, security, and human rights. Nancy Pelosi, as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, is one of the most senior officials in the US government and has been a vocal critic of China's human rights record and its military actions in the South China Sea.\n\n**Visit**\n\nNancy Pelosi arrived in Taiwan on August 2, 2022, aboard a US Air Force jet, accompanied by a delegation of six other US lawmakers. During her three-day visit, Pelosi met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and other senior officials, including the Speaker of the Taiwanese parliament, You Si-kun. The visit sparked widespread media attention and public interest, with many Taiwanese citizens taking to the streets to welcome Pelosi and her delegation.\n\nPelosi's visit was seen as a significant demonstration of US support for Taiwan, which has been under increasing pressure from China in recent years. The visit also marked a significant escalation in tensions between the United States and China, with Beijing warning the US that it would \"pay the price\" for Pelosi's visit.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### United States\n\nThe US government and many lawmakers welcomed Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, seeing it as an important demonstration of US support for the island nation. President Joe Biden issued a statement saying that the US would continue to support Taiwan's democracy and way of life. Many US lawmakers also expressed their support for Pelosi's visit, with some calling it a \"bold\" and \"necessary\" move.\n\n### People's Republic of China\n\nThe Chinese government and state media condemned Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, seeing it as a provocation and an attempt to undermine China's sovereignty over the island. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the visit was a \"serious breach\" of the US's commitment to the \"One China\" policy, which recognizes Taiwan as part of China.\n\n### Hong Kong\n\nThe Hong Kong government also condemned Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, with the city's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, saying that the visit was a \"grave provocation\" to China. The Hong Kong police also warned that any protests or demonstrations in support of Pelosi's visit would be \"illegal\" and \"subject to law enforcement action.\"\n\n### Sanctions\n\nIn response to Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, China imposed a series of sanctions on US lawmakers and officials, including Pelosi herself. The sanctions included travel bans and asset freezes, and were seen as a significant escalation in tensions between the United States and China.\n\n### International\n\n#### Intergovernmental organizations\n\nThe international community also reacted to Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, with many organizations and governments issuing statements and warnings. The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, called for calm and restraint, while the European Union expressed its support for the US's \"commitment to the One China policy.\"\n\n#### Nations\n\nMany countries also issued statements and warnings in response to Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Japan, which has a security alliance with the United States, expressed its support for the visit, while South Korea also welcomed Pelosi's visit. Other countries, including Australia and Canada, also issued statements expressing their support for the US's commitment to the One China policy.\n\n**Interpretations and popular response**\n\nNancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan sparked a significant reaction from the public, with many Taiwanese citizens taking to the streets to welcome her and her delegation. The visit was seen as a significant demonstration of US support for Taiwan, which has been under increasing pressure from China in recent years.\n\nMany Taiwanese citizens saw Pelosi's visit as a significant boost to their country's international status and a demonstration of the US's commitment to their democracy and way of life. The visit also sparked widespread media attention and public interest, with many Taiwanese citizens taking to social media to express their support for Pelosi and her delegation.\n\nHowever, the visit also sparked a significant reaction from China, which saw it as a provocation and an attempt to undermine China's sovereignty over the island. Many Chinese citizens took to the streets to protest against Pelosi's visit, and the Chinese government issued a series of statements and warnings condemning the visit.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of Pelosi's visit to Taiwan was marked by a significant escalation in tensions between the United States and China. The Chinese government imposed a series of sanctions on US lawmakers and officials, including Pelosi herself, and warned the US that it would \"pay the price\" for her visit.\n\nThe US government and many lawmakers welcomed the visit, seeing it as an important demonstration of US support for Taiwan.

The storm caused widespread damage and flooding, resulting in significant loss of life and economic disruption.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Ian originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of West Africa on September 19, 2022. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, gradually intensifying into a tropical depression on September 23. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, and was named Ian by the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\nIan continued to strengthen as it moved westward across the Caribbean, becoming a hurricane on September 25. The storm reached its peak intensity on September 28, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg). Ian's forward speed slowed significantly as it approached the coast of Florida, allowing it to maintain its strong intensity.\n\n#Preparations\n\n##Caribbean\n\n###Jamaica\n\nThe Government of Jamaica issued a tropical storm warning for the island on September 25, as Ian was expected to bring heavy rainfall and strong winds. Residents were advised to take necessary precautions, including boarding up windows and securing outdoor furniture. The Jamaica Defense Force was deployed to assist with evacuation and relief efforts.\n\n###Cayman Islands\n\nThe Cayman Islands Government issued a hurricane warning on September 26, as Ian was expected to make landfall on the island of Grand Cayman. Residents were advised to evacuate to higher ground or shelter in place. The island's airport was closed, and commercial flights were cancelled.\n\n###Cuba\n\nThe Government of Cuba issued a hurricane warning on September 27, as Ian was expected to bring heavy rainfall and strong winds to the eastern part of the island. Residents were advised to take necessary precautions, including boarding up windows and securing outdoor furniture.\n\n##United States\n\n###Florida\n\nThe National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for the entire west coast of Florida on September 28, as Ian was expected to make landfall. Residents were advised to evacuate to higher ground or shelter in place. The Florida Highway Patrol was deployed to assist with evacuation and relief efforts.

This approach allows for a nuanced analysis of the complex process of conversion, highlighting key factors that contributed to the widespread adoption of Christianity.\n\nNetwork theory and Diffusion of innovation as an approach\n\nInnovation\n\nThe diffusion of innovation theory, developed by Everett Rogers, posits that the spread of new ideas or technologies follows a predictable pattern. The theory emphasizes the importance of social networks in facilitating the adoption of innovations. In the context of the Roman Empire, innovation refers to the introduction of Christianity as a new religious system.\n\nAlternative approaches\n\nWhile diffusion of innovation provides a useful framework for understanding the Christianization of the Roman Empire, other approaches, such as the \" grass-roots\" movement or the \"top-down\" imposition of Christianity, have also been proposed. However, these models oversimplify the complex process of conversion and neglect the role of social networks in facilitating the spread of the new faith.\n\nFailure of diffusion\n\nNot all innovations diffuse successfully. Factors such as lack of relative advantage, incompatibility with existing social norms, or limited trialability can hinder the spread of a new idea. In the case of the Roman Empire, the initial failure of Christianity to diffuse widely can be attributed to its perceived incompatibility with the existing pagan culture and the lack of a clear relative advantage over other religious systems.\n\nFive characteristics of diffusion\n\nRelative advantage\n\nAlms\n\nOne of the key factors contributing to the relative advantage of Christianity was its emphasis on charity and almsgiving. Early Christian communities, such as the Clementine community in Rome, engaged in extensive almsgiving, providing food and shelter to the poor and needy. This practice not only demonstrated the compassion and generosity of Christians but also helped to spread the new faith through word-of-mouth.\n\nSlavery through the fifth century\n\nThe institution of slavery was prevalent throughout the Roman Empire, with an estimated 20% of the population enslaved. Christianity's message of equality and redemption helped to alleviate the suffering of slaves, who saw the new faith as a means of escaping their bondage. The Church's emphasis on the spiritual equality of all people, regardless of social status, provided a powerful relative advantage over the existing pagan system.\n\nGeography and a scale-free network\n\nThe Roman Empire's extensive network of roads and trade routes facilitated the spread of Christianity, which was particularly effective in traversing the vast distances of the empire. The scale-free network of early Christian communities, with their hubs and periphery, allowed for the efficient diffusion of information and the growth of new communities.\n\nCompatibility and complexity\n\nCompatibility with existing social norms is essential for the successful diffusion of an innovation. In the case of Christianity, its emphasis on the importance of family and community helped to create a sense of compatibility with existing social norms. However, the complexity of Christian theology and doctrine presented a significant challenge, particularly for those who were not familiar with the Jewish scriptures.\n\nTrialability\n\nReinvention\n\nThe trialability of an innovation refers to the ease with which it can be tested or experimented with. Christianity's emphasis on the importance of personal experience and direct contact with the divine helped to create a sense of trialability, allowing early adopters to experiment with the new faith and confirm its benefits for themselves.\n\nInnovators of the first century\n\nThe early Christian communities, such as the Jerusalem church, played a crucial role in the diffusion of Christianity. These innovators, who were often from marginalized or disenfranchised groups, helped to create a sense of community and shared purpose, which facilitated the growth of the new faith.\n\nEarly adopters in the first and second centuries\n\nThe early adopters of Christianity, including prominent figures such as Paul the Apostle and Clement of Rome, helped to spread the new faith through their missionary work and written communications. These early adopters were often members of the social elite, who were able to leverage their influence and resources to promote the growth of Christianity.\n\nThird century early majority\n\nSexual morality\n\nThe early Christian communities' emphasis on sexual morality, particularly the prohibition on divorce and adultery, helped to create a sense of compatibility with existing social norms. However, the complexity of Christian doctrine on this topic presented a significant challenge, particularly for those who were not familiar with the Jewish scriptures.\n\nPersecution\n\nThe persecution of Christians, which peaked during the reign of Diocletian, presented a significant challenge to the growth of the new faith. However, the resilience and determination of early Christian communities helped to ensure the survival and eventual diffusion of Christianity.\n\nConstantine as opinion leader\n\nThe conversion of Constantine, the Roman Emperor, in 312 CE marked a significant turning point in the diffusion of Christianity. As an opinion leader, Constantine's adoption of Christianity helped to legitimize the new faith and create a sense of momentum for its growth. The Edict of Milan, issued in 313 CE, granted tolerance to all Christian communities, allowing for the free practice of the new faith throughout the empire.\n\nNotes\n\nThis article has focused on the Christianization of the Roman Empire as a diffusion of innovation, highlighting the key factors that contributed to the widespread adoption of Christianity. While other approaches, such as the \"grass-roots\" movement or the \"top-down\" imposition of Christianity, have been proposed, the diffusion of innovation theory provides a nuanced and comprehensive framework for understanding the complex process of conversion.\n\nReferences\n\nFor a more detailed analysis of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, see:\n\nBibliography\n\nFor further reading on the diffusion of innovation theory and its application to the Christianization of the Roman Empire, see:\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe diffusion of innovation theory has been applied to a wide range of fields, including sociology, economics, and history.

The film stars Ana de Armas as Marilyn Monroe and features a supporting cast, including Bobby Cannavale, Adrien Brody, and Julia Ormond.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is a biographical drama that follows the life of Marilyn Monroe, from her childhood in foster care to her rise to fame as a Hollywood star. The story is presented in a non-linear fashion, with events from Monroe's life interwoven with scenes from her own fantasies and nightmares. The film explores themes of identity, trauma, and the objectification of women in the entertainment industry.\n\nAs the film progresses, Monroe's struggles with mental health, relationships, and her own sense of self-worth become increasingly apparent. The story culminates in a tragic and devastating conclusion, as Monroe's life is cut short in a manner that is both shocking and heartbreaking.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Ana de Armas as Marilyn Monroe\n* Bobby Cannavale as Joe DiMaggio\n* Adrien Brody as Arthur Miller\n* Julia Ormond as Inge Morath\n* Xavier Samuel as Cass Chapin\n* Evan Williams as Billy Wilder\n* David Krumholtz as Milton Greene\n* Sara Paxton as Gladys Pearl Baker\n* Josh Kornreich as Ben\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development and writing\n\nThe film's development began in 2009, when Andrew Dominik first optioned the rights to Joyce Carol Oates' novel. Dominik had been a fan of the book and saw it as an opportunity to explore the complexities of Marilyn Monroe's life and career. Over the next several years, Dominik worked on the script, drawing on Oates' novel as well as his own research and interviews with people who knew Monroe.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2019, with Dominik meeting with Ana de Armas to discuss the project. De Armas was drawn to the film's themes and the opportunity to play a complex and multifaceted character like Monroe. The cast and crew assembled, with Bobby Cannavale, Adrien Brody, and Julia Ormond joining de Armas in the lead roles.\n\n### Casting\n\nAna de Armas was the first casting choice for the lead role, with Dominik reportedly seeing her from the moment she walked into the audition room. De Armas underwent a significant transformation to play Monroe, gaining weight and learning to walk and speak like the actress. The rest of the cast was assembled over the next several months, with Cannavale, Brody, and Ormond bringing their own unique interpretations to their characters.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming on the film began in the spring of 2020, with a cast and crew that included several Oscar winners and nominees. The film was shot on a combination of 35mm film and digital cameras, with a focus on creating a vintage look that would evoke the era in which the story takes place. The shoot was marked by a number of challenges, including a lengthy and grueling schedule, as well as the need to create complex and often disturbing scenes.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, with a focus on creating a haunting and atmospheric sound that would complement the film's themes and tone. The score incorporated a range of instruments and sounds, including piano, guitar, and even a children's choir. The result was a rich and immersive soundtrack that added depth and complexity to the film's narrative.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival, where it generated significant buzz and attention. The film's NC-17 rating sparked controversy and debate, with some critics arguing that it was too explicit and disturbing. Despite this, the film went on to receive critical acclaim, with many praising de Armas' performance and the film's bold and uncompromising approach to its subject matter.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising de Armas' performance and the film's bold and uncompromising approach to its subject matter. The film holds a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its nuanced and complex portrayal of Monroe's life and career.\n\n### Industry reception\n\nThe film was also well-received by industry professionals, with many praising its technical achievements and its bold and uncompromising approach to its subject matter. The film's NC-17 rating sparked controversy and debate, with some critics arguing that it was too explicit and disturbing. Despite this, the film went on to receive several industry awards and nominations, including several Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe nomination for de Armas.\n\n### Cast\n\nThe film's cast was widely praised, with many critics singling out de Armas for her nuanced and complex performance. Cannavale, Brody, and Ormond were also praised for their performances, which added depth and complexity to the film's narrative.\n\n### NC-17 rating\n\nThe film's NC-17 rating sparked controversy and debate, with some critics arguing that it was too explicit and disturbing.

From its earliest indigenous inhabitants to its current status as a global city, Sydney has undergone significant transformations over the centuries. This timeline provides a comprehensive overview of the major events and developments that have shaped the city's history.\n\n**Pre-Colonial**\n\nThe first human presence in the Sydney region dates back to at least 30,000 years ago, with Aboriginal people inhabiting the area for thousands of years. The region was home to the Eora people, who had a thriving culture and trade networks. The Eora people were skilled fishermen, hunters, and gatherers, and their diet consisted of seafood, kangaroo meat, and bush foods.\n\nAs the European colonizers arrived, the Eora people's way of life was disrupted, and their population declined significantly due to disease, violence, and displacement. The British colonization of Australia led to the establishment of a penal colony in 1788, which marked the beginning of a new era in Sydney's history.\n\n**18th–19th centuries**\n\n### 1770s–1790s\n\nIn 1770, British explorer James Cook arrived in the Sydney region, and his landing at Botany Bay sparked a series of events that would lead to the establishment of a British penal colony. In 1788, the First Fleet, led by Captain Arthur Phillip, arrived in Sydney Cove, and the colony was formally established.\n\nThe early years of the colony were marked by struggle and hardship, with the British facing significant challenges in establishing a settlement. The Eora people resisted the British presence, and tensions between the two groups led to violence and conflict.\n\n### 1800s–1840s\n\nAs the colony grew, the British established a system of government and administration. In 1800, the colony was declared a free settlement, and the British began to promote the development of agriculture and trade. The establishment of the Port Jackson Convict Farm in 1804 marked the beginning of a new era in the colony's history.\n\nDuring this period, the British also began to establish relationships with the Eora people, and a series of treaties and agreements were negotiated.

The dissolution was made in accordance with Article 76(5) of the Constitution of Nepal, which allows the President to dissolve the HoR if the Prime Minister recommends it.\n\nThe election was significant as it marked the first time that the voting system was changed from the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system to the Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP) system. The MMP system combines elements of both the FPTP and proportional representation systems, where voters cast two separate votes – one for a constituency representative and one for a party list.\n\n**Timetable**\n\nThe election schedule was as follows:\n\n* November 12, 2022: The President dissolved the House of Representatives.\n* November 15, 2022: The Election Commission of Nepal announced the election schedule.\n* November 20, 2022: Voting began at 7:00 am and ended at 5:00 pm.\n* December 1, 2022: Results were announced.\n\n**Electoral System**\n\nThe MMP system used in the 2022 election consists of two components:\n\n* **Constituency**: Voters cast a vote for a candidate in their constituency, similar to the FPTP system.\n* **Party List**: Voters also cast a vote for a party list, which determines the number of seats a party receives based on the proportion of votes they receive.\n\n**Eligibility to Vote**\n\nTo be eligible to vote in the 2022 election, a person must:\n\n* Be a citizen of Nepal.\n* Be 18 years or older.\n* Be registered as a voter in the electoral roll.\n* Not have been disqualified from voting by a court of law.\n\n**Pre-election Arrangement**\n\nThe main pre-election arrangement made by the Election Commission of Nepal was the formation of a 25-member campaign finance monitoring committee to monitor the election campaign finance of political parties. The committee was responsible for ensuring that parties did not exceed the limit of Rs. 1 crore (approximately USD 88,000) in their election expenses.\n\n**Electoral Alliances and Parties**\n\nSeveral electoral alliances and parties participated in the 2022 election:\n\n* **Democratic Left Alliance**: The alliance was formed by the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and the Federal Socialist Forum Nepal.

The election also saw a significant increase in the number of women elected to the House of Representatives, with a total of 174 women elected.

They were a culturally diverse population, consisting of free people of color, slaves, and Europeans. The Saint-Domingue Creoles played a significant role in shaping the history of the Caribbean and the Americas.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe term \"Creole\" refers to the people of mixed European and African ancestry in the Caribbean. The term \"Saint-Domingue Creole\" specifically refers to the people of the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which was the most prosperous and populous colony in the Caribbean during the 18th century.\n\n## Origin of the Saint-Domingue Creoles\n\nThe Saint-Domingue Creoles were a product of the transatlantic slave trade and the colonization of the island by the French. The first European settlers arrived in the 17th century, and over the next century, thousands of enslaved Africans were brought to the island to work on plantations. Free people of color, known as affranchis, also settled on the island, often marrying into slave families and having children. This created a complex social hierarchy, with the European colonizers at the top, followed by the affranchis and then the enslaved people of color.\n\n## Saint-Domingue Creole society\n\nSaint-Domingue Creole society was characterized by a complex social hierarchy. At the top were the European colonizers, who held positions of power and wealth. The affranchis, who were free people of color, held a position below the Europeans but above the enslaved people. The enslaved people of color made up the majority of the population and were at the bottom of the social hierarchy.\n\n## Development of Creole culture\n\nThe Saint-Domingue Creoles developed a unique Creole culture, which was influenced by African, European, and indigenous American traditions. They developed their own language, known as Creole French, which was a blend of French, African languages, and indigenous languages. They also developed their own music, dance, and art, which reflected their African and European heritage.\n\n## Freedoms of the Creoles and Affranchis\n\nThe Creoles and affranchis in Saint-Domingue enjoyed certain freedoms that were not available to the enslaved people. They were allowed to own property, marry, and practice their own culture. However, they were still subject to the laws and regulations of the French colonial government, and they were not treated as equal to the European colonizers.\n\n## Slavery in Saint-Domingue\n\nSlavery was a central institution in Saint-Domingue, and it played a significant role in the economy and society of the island. Enslaved people were forced to work on plantations, producing crops such as sugar, coffee, and cotton. The conditions on the plantations were brutal, with enslaved people facing physical punishment, forced labor, and poor living conditions.\n\n## African presence in Saint-Domingue\n\nAfrican people were brought to Saint-Domingue as enslaved people, and they played a significant role in shaping the culture and society of the island. They brought with them their own languages, customs, and traditions, which were influenced by their African heritage. They also developed their own Creole language and culture, which was a blend of African and European influences.\n\n## European presence in Saint-Domingue\n\nEuropean colonizers played a significant role in shaping the history of Saint-Domingue. They established the colony, brought enslaved people from Africa, and developed the economy and society of the island. They also imposed their own language, culture, and institutions on the island, which had a profound impact on the Creoles and affranchis.\n\n## Royalist curtailment of Creole rights\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the Creoles and affranchis in Saint-Domingue were granted certain rights and freedoms by the French National Assembly. However, these rights were curtailed by the royalists, who sought to maintain their power and influence over the island.\n\n## Downturn of Saint-Domingue's economy\n\nThe economy of Saint-Domingue began to decline in the late 18th century, due to a combination of factors including the Haitian Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and the decline of the slave trade. This had a profound impact on the Creoles and affranchis, who were heavily dependent on the plantation economy for their livelihood.\n\n## Saint-Domingue Creoles in the American Revolutionary War\n\nThe Saint-Domingue Creoles played a significant role in the American Revolutionary War, with many of them fighting on the side of the Americans. They saw the war as an opportunity to gain their freedom and establish their own independence.\n\nRevolutionary History of Saint-Domingue\n\nThe Haitian Revolution was a successful slave revolt that took place in Saint-Domingue from 1791 to 1804. It was led by Toussaint Louverture, a former slave who became one of the most influential leaders of the revolution.\n\n## The Rebellion of Saint-Domingue\n\nThe rebellion began on August 14, 1791, when a group of enslaved people rose up against their French masters. The rebellion quickly spread throughout the island, and by the end of the year, the enslaved people had gained control of the northern part of the island.\n\n## Civil War and Invasion of Santo Domingo\n\nThe French government responded to the rebellion by sending a large military force to the island. The French army clashed with the rebels in a series of brutal battles, and by 1802, the French had gained control of the western part of the island. The French then invaded the eastern part of the island, which was controlled by the Spanish.\n\n## The Haitian Revolution in Saint-Domingue\n\nT", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Saint-Domingue_Creoles\" following this outline:\n\n#Saint-Domingue Creole Society\n##Etymology\n##Origin of the Saint-Domingue Creoles\n##Saint-Domingue Creole society\n##Development of Creole culture\n##Freedoms of the Creoles and Affranchis\n##Slavery in Saint-Domingue\n##African presence in Saint-Domingue\n##European presence in Saint-Domingue\n##Royalist curtailment of Creole rights\n##Downturn of Saint-Domingue's economy\n##Saint-Domingue Creoles in the American Revolutionary War\n#Revolutionary History of Saint-Domingue\n##The Rebellion of Saint-Domingue\n##Civil War and Invasion of Santo Domingo\n##The Haitian Revolution in Saint-Domingue\n##Genocide of the remaining whites in Saint-Domingue\n##The Empire of Haiti\n#Saint-Domingue Creoles after the Haitian Revolution\n##Saint-Domingue Creoles in New Orleans, Louisiana\n##Saint-Domingue Creoles in Haiti\n#Culture\n##Creole French Language\n#See also\n#References\n##Works cited\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is one of the most well-known and enduring examples of an ancient palindrome, and its origins and meaning have been the subject of much debate and speculation.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Sator Square is a five-word palindrome, consisting of the letters S-A-T-O-R. It is often referred to as the \"Sator Square\" or the \"Sator Palindrome,\" although it is sometimes simply called the \"Sator.\" The square has been the subject of much fascination and curiosity, with many attempts to decipher its meaning and significance.\n\n**Description and naming**\n\nThe Sator Square consists of five words, which are often arranged in a square pattern. The words are:\n\n1. Sator\n2. Arepo\n3. Tenet\n4. Opera\n5. Rotas\n\nThese words are typically written in a clockwise spiral pattern, with the first word Sator written at the top left, the second word Arepo written at the top right, the third word Tenet written at the bottom right, the fourth word Opera written at the bottom left, and the fifth word Rotas written at the top left.\n\n**Discovery and dating**\n\nThe origins of the Sator Square are unknown, but it is believed to have originated in ancient Rome. The earliest known examples of the Sator Square date back to the 2nd century AD, although it is likely that it was in use for several centuries before that. The Sator Square was likely used as a word game or puzzle, and its purpose is still debated among scholars.\n\n**Translation**\n\nThe Sator Square is a palindrome, meaning that it reads the same backward as forward. This presents a challenge for translation, as the words in the square do not necessarily convey a coherent message. However, several attempts have been made to translate the Sator Square into a meaningful phrase.\n\n### Individual words\n\nEach word in the Sator Square has its own meaning, and some scholars have attempted to translate the square into a coherent message. For example, the word Sator is Latin for \"sower,\" while the word Arepo is a mysterious word that is thought to be related to the word \"arbor,\" meaning tree. The word Tenet is Latin for \"he holds,\" while the word Opera is Latin for \"work.\" The word Rotas is Latin for \"wheels.\"\n\n### Sentence construction\n\nOne of the most common translations of the Sator Square is that it reads: \"Sator arepo tenet opera rotas.\" This translation suggests that the square is a sentence, with the words \"Sator\" and \"arepo\" forming the subject, \"tenet\" forming the verb, and \"opera\" and \"rotas\" forming the object.\n\n### Arepo interpretations\n\nThe word Arepo is one of the most mysterious words in the Sator Square, and its meaning has been the subject of much debate. Some scholars have suggested that Arepo is a reference to the goddess of agriculture, while others have suggested that it is a reference to the cyclical nature of time.\n\n### Further anagrams\n\nIn addition to the Sator Square, there are several other anagrams that have been discovered in ancient Roman texts. These anagrams often take the form of palindromes or other word games, and they provide further evidence of the ancient Romans' fascination with language and logic.\n\n**Origin and meaning**\n\nThe Sator Square has been the subject of much speculation and debate, with many scholars attempting to decipher its meaning and significance. Some of the most popular theories include:\n\n### Christian symbol\n\nOne of the most enduring theories about the Sator Square is that it is a Christian symbol. The words in the square are often seen as a reference to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, with the word Sator representing the sower of the grain, the word Arepo representing the tree of life, the word Tenet representing the hold of the cross, the word Opera representing the work of redemption, and the word Rotas representing the wheels of the chariot of God.\n\n### Adoption by Christians\n\nIt is thought that the Sator Square was adopted by early Christians as a symbol of their faith. The square was often inscribed on tombstones and other monuments, and it was seen as a way of expressing the Christian message in a simple and powerful way.\n\n### Paternoster theory\n\nAnother theory about the Sator Square is that it is a reference to the Paternoster, or Lord's Prayer. The words in the square are often seen as a reference to the prayer, with the word Sator representing the Father, the word Arepo representing the Son, the word Tenet representing the Holy Spirit, the word Opera representing the work of salvation, and the word Rotas representing the wheels of the chariot of God.\n\n**Roman word puzzle**\n\nIn addition to its potential Christian significance, the Sator Square is also seen as a Roman word puzzle. The square is a palindrome, and it is often seen as a challenge to decipher its meaning. The words in the square are often seen as a reference to the Roman concept of the cyclical nature of time, with the word Sator representing the beginning of the cycle, the word Arepo representing the middle of the cycle, the word Tenet representing the end of the cycle, the word Opera representing the cycle of work and rest, and the word Rotas representing the cycle of birth and death.\n\n**Jewish symbol**\n\nSome scholars have suggested that the Sator Square is a Jewish symbol. The words in the square are often seen as a reference to the Hebrew concept of the cyclical nature of time, with the word Sator representing the beginning of the cycle, the word Arepo representing the middle of the cycle, the word Tenet representing the end of the cycle, the word Opera representing the cycle of work and rest, and the word Rotas representing the cycle of birth and death.\n\n**Other theories**\n\nIn addition to the theories mentioned above, there are several other theories about the Sator Square. Some scholars have suggested that the square is a reference to the ancient Roman concept of the four cardinal directions, with the word Sator representing the east, the word Arepo representing the south, the word Tenet representing the west, and the word Rotas representing the north. Others have suggested that the square is a reference to the ancient Roman concept of the four seasons, with the word Sator representing the spring, the word Arepo representing the summer, the word Tenet representing the autumn, and the word Rotas representing the winter.\n\n**Magical and medical associations**\n\nThe Sator Square has also been associated with magical and medical practices. In some traditions, the square is seen as a way of protecting against evil spirits, while in others it is seen as a way of warding off disease. Some scholars have suggested that the square is a reference to the ancient Roman concept of the four humors, with the word Sator representing the sanguine temperament, the word Arepo representing the choleric temperament, the word Tenet representing the melancholic temperament, and the word Rotas representing the phlegmatic temperament.\n\n**Notable examples**\n\nThe Sator Square has been found in many different contexts, including:\n\n### Roman\n\nOne of the most famous examples of the Sator Square is a Roman mosaic from the 2nd century AD. The mosaic is a beautiful example of the square, with the words Sator, Arepo, Tenet, Opera, and Rotas arranged in a spiral pattern.\n\n### Early medieval\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, the Sator Square was often inscribed on tombstones and other monuments. One of the most famous examples is a tombstone from the 5th century AD, which features the square in a spiral pattern.\n\n### Later medieval\n\nDuring the later Middle Ages, the Sator Square was often used as a decorative device on manuscripts and other texts. One of the most famous examples is a medieval manuscript from the 12th century AD, which features the square in a beautiful illuminated initial.\n\n### Other\n\nIn addition to its use in ancient and medieval contexts, the Sator Square has also been used in modern times. Some scholars have suggested that the square is a reference to the modern concept of the four cardinal directions, while others have suggested that it is a reference to the modern concept of the four seasons.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nThe Sator Square has been referenced in popular culture, including:\n\n* In the novel \"The Name of the Rose\" by Umberto Eco, the Sator Square is used as a symbol of the cyclical nature of time.\n* In the film \"The Name of the Rose,\" the Sator Square is featured as a decorative device on a medieval manuscript.\n* In the video game \"Assassin's Creed: Origins,\" the Sator Square is used as a symbol of the ancient Egyptian concept of the cyclical nature of time.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Palindrome\n* Anagram\n* Word puzzle\n* Roman language\n* Latin language\n* History of language\n* Ancient Rome\n* Medieval history\n* Christian symbolism\n* Jewish symbolism\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Sator Square is often referred to as the \"Sator Palindrome,\" although it is sometimes simply called the \"Sator.\"\n* The square has been the subject of much speculation and debate, with many scholars attempting to decipher its meaning and significance.\n* The Sator Square is often seen as a symbol of the cyclical nature of time, with the words Sator, Arepo, Tenet, Opera, and Rotas representing the four stages of the cycle.\n\n**References**\n\n* Eco, U.
