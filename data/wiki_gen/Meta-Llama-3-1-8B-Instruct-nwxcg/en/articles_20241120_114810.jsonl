Australia and the United States These operations had recaptured the Solomon Islands, eastern New Guinea, western New Britain, the Admiralty Islands, and the Gilbert and Marshall Islands [8]\n\n\nAmerican strategic objectives\nUp to early 1944, Allied operations against the Japanese military in the Pacific were focused on securing the lines of communication between Australia and the United States These operations had recaptured the Solomon Islands, eastern New Guinea, western New Britain, the Admiralty Islands, and the Gilbert and Marshall Islands [8]\n\n\nJapanese strategic plan\nThe Japanese Imperial War Council established the \"Absolute National Defense Zone  [jp]\", Zettai Kokubōken) in September 1943, which was bounded by the Kuril Islands, Bonin Islands, the Marianas, Western New Guinea, Malaya, and Burma [26] This line was to be held at all costs if Japan was to win the war [27] The Marianas were considered particularly important to protect as their capture would put Japan within bombing range of the B-29 bomber [28] and allow the Americans to interdict the supply routes between the Japanese home islands and the western Pacific [29]\n\n\nHistory and geography\nSaipan and the other Mariana Islands were claimed as Spanish possessions by the conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565 [37] After Spain's defeat in the Spanish-American War, Saipan was sold to Germany in 1899 [38] The island was occupied by the Japanese in 1914 during World War I, who made it the administrative center for the Mariana Islands – Saipan, Tinian and Rota – that were part of Japan's South Seas Mandate [39]\n\n\nOpposing forces\nNimitz, the commander of the Pacific Fleet, assigned Admiral Raymond Spruance, commander of the Fifth Fleet, to oversee the operation Vice Admiral Richmond K Turner, Commander, Joint Amphibious Forces (Task Force 51) oversaw the overall organization of the amphibious landings of the Mariana Islands; he also oversaw the tactical command of the landing on Saipan as Commander, Northern Attack Force (TF 52) [57] Once the amphibious landings were completed, Lieutenant General Holland M Smith, Commanding General, Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56), would oversee the ground forces for all of Forager; he would also oversee the ground combat on Saipan as Commander, Northern Troops and Landing Force [58]\n\n\nAmerican invasion force\nNimitz, the commander of the Pacific Fleet, assigned Admiral Raymond Spruance, commander of the Fifth Fleet, to oversee the operation Vice Admiral Richmond K Turner, Commander, Joint Amphibious Forces (Task Force 51) oversaw the overall organization of the amphibious landings of the Mariana Islands; he also oversaw the tactical command of the landing on Saipan as Commander, Northern Attack Force (TF 52) [57] Once the amphibious landings were completed, Lieutenant General Holland M Smith, Commanding General, Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56), would oversee the ground forces for all of Forager; he would also oversee the ground combat on Saipan as Commander, Northern Troops and Landing Force [58]\n\n\nJapanese defense preparations\nAmerican intelligence had estimated that there would be between 15,000 and 18,000 Japanese troops on Saipan at the time of the invasion [71] In actuality, there were double that number [72] Nearly 32,000 Japanese military personnel were on the island, including 6,000 naval troops [29] The two major army units defending the island were the 43rd Division commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saitō and the 47th Independent Mixed Brigade commanded by Colonel Yoshira Oka [73]\n\n\nBattle\nOn 11 June, over 200 F6F Hellcats from the Fast Carrier Task Force launched a surprise attack on Japanese airfields in Saipan and Tinian, [89] putting approximately 130 Japanese aircraft out of operation [90] at the cost of 11 American aircraft [91]\nThe attack destroyed most of the 1st Air Fleet's land-based planes that had been deployed to defend the Marianas, [92] and gave the Americans air superiority over Saipan [93] Planes from the task force continued their attacks until 14 June, [94] harassing fields, bombing military targets, and burning cane fields on the southern half of Saipan [95] By the end of the week, the 1st Air Fleet had been reduced to about 100 aircraft [92]\n\n\n11–14 June: Preparatory attacks\nOn 11 June, over 200 F6F Hellcats from the Fast Carrier Task Force launched a surprise attack on Japanese airfields in Saipan and Tinian, [89] putting approximately 130 Japanese aircraft out of operation [90] at the cost of 11 American aircraft [91]\nThe attack destroyed most of the 1st Air Fleet's land-based planes that had been deployed to defend the Marianas, [92] and gave the

half of Saipan [95] By the end of the week, the 1st Air Fleet had been reduced to about 100 aircraft [92]\n\n\n15 June: D-Day\n15 June was D-Day for the amphibious landing, [103] which began around 08:40 [104] Naval and aerial bombardments in preparation for the landings began earlier in the morning, [105]\ndisrupting the Japanese communications network [106]\nThe guns of the warships would provide continuous supporting fire throughout the day [105]\n\n\n16–20 June: Southern Saipan\nOn 16 June, Holland Smith committed his reserves to reinforce the beachhead, ordering two of the three regiments of the 27th Infantry Division—the 165th and the 105th—to land [130] He proposed to indefinitely postpone the 18 June invasion of Guam [131] [e] The two Marine divisions on Saipan spent most of the day consolidating the beachhead [133] The 2nd Marine Division began to close the gap between the two divisions north of Charan Kanoa, and the 4th Marine Division cleared the area around Aginan point on the southwest of the Island [134]\n\n\nBattle of Philippine Sea\nOnce Admiral Soemu Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, was certain that Saipan was the target of an invasion, he initiated his response [157]\nLess than a half hour after the start of the amphibious invasion, [158] he announced the implementation of Operation A-Go, [159] the Japanese Navy's current plan to destroy the American fleet [160] He then sent a message to the entire fleet that repeated Admiral Heihachirō Tōgō's speech before Japan's decisive naval battle against Russia at Tsushima in 1905, which in turn echoed Horatio Nelson's signal at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805: [161] \"The fate of the Empire rests upon this single battle Every man is expected to do his utmost.\" [162]\n\n\n21–24 June: Central Saipan, initial attack\nSaitō's new defense line stretched from Garapan on the west coast to the southern slopes of Mount Tapatchou across to Magicienne Bay on the east coast [183] It held most of the island's high ground, which allowed the Japanese to observe American movements, and the rough terrain was filled with caves concealed by brush [184]\n\n\n25–30 June: Central Saipan, breakthrough\nThe United States forces had built up substantial firepower to continue their northward drive On 22 June, P-47s from the Seventh Air Force landed on Aslito Field and immediately began launching ground assault missions [198] On the same day, the XXIV Corps Artillery commanded by Brigadier General Arthur M Harper moved 24 155 mm field guns and 24 155 mm howitzers into place to fire on Japanese positions [199]\nThe Americans also used truck-launched rockets [200] for saturation barrages [201] Spotters flying in L-4 Grasshoppers helped direct ground artillery, [202] and Navajo code talkers relayed information about Japanese troop movements [203]  In the hills, soldiers relied on personal flamethrowers, particularly in locations where the motorized flamethrowers could not reach [204] They gradually developed tactics for effectively reducing caves, using a combination of flamethrowers and demolition charges to clear them, or sometimes using demolitions to seal them off [205]\n\n\nAmerican firepower\nThe United States forces had built up substantial firepower to continue their northward drive On 22 June, P-47s from the Seventh Air Force landed on Aslito Field and

demolitions to seal them off [205]\n\n\nAmerican advance and Japanese break out at Nafutan Point\nOn 25 June, the 27th Infantry Division was not able to make much headway in their fight for Death Valley, but the 2nd Marine Division to the west gained control of Mount Tapotchau, the key artillery observation posts in Central Saipan [211] On the east coast, the 4th Marine Division quickly occupied most of the Kagman peninsula, meeting little organized resistance [212] because the Japanese had evacuated the peninsula [213] Between 26 June and 30 June, the 2nd Marine Division and the 27th Infantry Division had made little progress The second Marines remained south of Garapan and were slowly fighting their way north of Mount Tapotchau The 4th Marine Division was able to advance up the eastern coast to a line just north of the village of Hashigoru [214]\n\n\n1–6 July: Pursuit into northern Saipan\nSaitō intended to form a new line in northern Saipan that would be anchored on Tanapag on the west, running southeast to a village called Tarahoho, and through to the east coast [226] He wasn't able to His army's cohesion was disintegrating: Some of the remaining forces retreated north, others holed up in whatever caves they could find, others put up disorganized resistance where they were [227] During 2–4 July, the 2nd Marine Division took the ruins of Garapan and its harbor [228] The 4th Marine Division quickly moved north on the west coast in the face of light resistance [229]\nAs Saitō's attempt to form the defense line collapsed, [230] he eventually moved his final headquarters near Makunsha village on the west coast north of Tanapag [231]\n\n\n7–9 July: Gyokusai attack and battle's end\nAt least 3,000 Japanese combatants participated in the gyokusai attack [250] [i] They assembled near Makunsha The force included naval personnel, [256] support troops, civilians, [257] and the walking wounded [258] It included three tanks, [259] supporting mortars, and machine guns, [260] but some troops were only armed with sticks with bayonets, knives, or grenades tied to poles [256] It would be the largest gyokusai attack of the Pacific War [238]\n\n\nCasualties\nAlmost the entire Japanese garrison–approximately 30,000 military personnel–were killed in the battle Eventually 1,700, about half of whom were Korean workers, were taken prisoner [270] American forces suffered about 16,500 casualties –3,100 killed and 13,000 wounded– [279] out of 71,000 who were part of the assault force [280] The casualty rate was over 20%, [281] which was comparable to Tarawa [279] It was the Americans' most deadly battle in the Pacific up to that time [282]\n\n\nLogistics\nThe American forces brought their supplies with the invasion fleet, [291] carrying over one ton of supplies per soldier: [292] 32 days of rations, 30 days of medical supplies, 20 days of maintenance supplies, seven days of ammunition for ground weapons, and ten days of anti-aircraft ammunition [293] Mobile reserves [294] and an ammunition resupply train, [295] as well as regular resupply shipments came from depots at Eniwetok, [296] which was 1,017 mi (1,637 km) from Saipan [291]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe invasion of Saipan and the invasion of France in Operation Overlord demonstrated the dominance of American industrial power Both were massive amphibious invasions–the two largest up to that time–and they were launched almost simultaneously on separate halves of the globe [310] Together, they were the greatest deployment of military resources by the United States at one time [311] Because the Battle of Saipan began just over a week after the 6 June landings for Overlord, its importance has often been overlooked, but just as Overlord was a major step in contributing to the fall of the Third Reich, Saipan marked a major step in the collapse of the Empire of Japan [312]\n\n\nImpact on American military strategy\nThe availability of Saipan as an American airbase, along with the airbases already established in Chengdu, opened a new phase in the Pacific War, in which strategic bombing would play a major role.\nThe 15 June invasion of the island had been synchronized with bombing of the Yawata Steel Works by B-29s in China It was the first bombing of the Japan home islands by B-29s, signaling the beginning of a campaign that could strike deep into Japan's Absolute National Defense Zone [313]\n\n\nImpact on Japanese politics and morale\nSaipan's loss had a greater impact in Japan than any of its previous defeats [326]\nThe Emperor of Japan, Hirohito, recognized that American control of the island would result in Tokyo being bombed After the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Philippine Sea, he demanded that the Japanese General Staff plan another naval attack to prevent its fall [327] Hirohito only accepted Saipan's eventual fall on 25 June 1944 when his advisors told him all was lost [328] The defeat brought the collapse of Hideki Tōjō's government Disappointed with the progress of the war, Hirohito withdrew his support for Tōjō, who resigned as prime minister of Japan on 18 July [329] He was replaced by former General Kuniaki Koiso, [330] who was a less capable leader [331]\n\n\nMemorials\nSuicide Cliff and Banzai Cliff, along with surviving isolated Japanese fortifications, are recognized as historic sites on the U.S National Register of Historic Places The cliffs are part of the National Historic Landmark District Landing Beaches; Aslito/Isley Field; & Marpi Point, Saipan Island, which includes the American landing beaches, the B-29 runways of Isley Field, and the surviving Japanese infrastructure of the Aslito and Marpi Point airfields [342] The Maritime Heritage Trail has a series of dive sites with

"article": "The Battle of Saipan was a pivotal battle fought during World War II, taking place from June 15 to July 9, 1944, on the island of Saipan in the Mariana Islands. The battle was a key event in the Pacific War, as it marked the first major land battle between American forces and the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\n**Background**\n\nUp to early 1944, Allied operations against the Japanese military in the Pacific were focused on securing the lines of communication between Australia and the United States. These operations had recaptured the Solomon Islands, eastern New Guinea, western New Britain, the Admiralty Islands, and the Gilbert and Marshall Islands.\n\n**American Strategic Objectives**\n\nThe American strategic objective was to capture the Mariana Islands, which were considered a key location for airbases and naval bases. The capture of the islands would provide a strategic advantage for the United States, as it would allow for the bombing of the Japanese home islands and the protection of the sea lanes between the United States and Australia.\n\n**Japanese Strategic Plan**\n\nThe Japanese Imperial War Council established the \"Absolute National Defense Zone\" in September 1943, which was bounded by the Kuril Islands, Bonin Islands, the Marianas, Western New Guinea, Malaya, and Burma. This line was to be held at all costs if Japan was to win the war. The Marianas were considered particularly important to protect as their capture would put Japan within bombing range of the B-29 bomber and allow the Americans to interdict the supply routes between the Japanese home islands and the western Pacific.\n\n**History and Geography**\n\nSaipan and the other Mariana Islands were claimed as Spanish possessions by the conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565. After Spain's defeat in the Spanish-American War, Saipan was sold to Germany in 1899. The island was occupied by the Japanese in 1914 during World War I, who made it the administrative center for the Mariana Islands – Saipan, Tinian, and Rota – that were part of Japan's South Seas Mandate.\n\n**Opposing Forces**\n\nNimitz, the commander of the Pacific Fleet, assigned Admiral Raymond Spruance, commander of the Fifth Fleet, to oversee the operation. Vice Admiral Richmond K Turner, Commander, Joint Amphibious Forces (Task Force 51), oversaw the overall organization of the amphibious landings of the Mariana Islands; he also oversaw the tactical command of the landing on Saipan as Commander, Northern Attack Force (TF 52). Once the amphibious landings were completed, Lieutenant General Holland M Smith, Commanding General, Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56), would oversee the ground forces for all of Forager; he would also oversee the ground combat on Saipan as Commander, Northern Troops and Landing Force.\n\n**American Invasion Force**\n\nThe American invasion force consisted of over 70,000 troops, including the 2nd Marine Division, 4th Marine Division, and the 27th Infantry Division. The invasion force was supported by a large fleet of warships and landing craft, which provided naval and aerial bombardments in preparation for the landings.\n\n**Japanese Defense Preparations**\n\nAmerican intelligence had estimated that there would be between 15,000 and 18,000 Japanese troops on Saipan at the time of the invasion. In actuality, there were double that number. Nearly 32,000 Japanese military personnel were on the island, including 6,000 naval troops. The two major army units defending the island were the 43rd Division commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saitō and the 47th Independent Mixed Brigade commanded by Colonel Yoshira Oka.\n\n**Battle**\n\nOn June 11, over 200 F6F Hellcats from the Fast Carrier Task Force launched a surprise attack on Japanese airfields in Saipan and Tinian, putting approximately 130 Japanese aircraft out of operation at the cost of 11 American aircraft. The attack destroyed most of the 1st Air Fleet's land-based planes that had been deployed to defend the Marianas, and gave the Americans air superiority over Saipan. Planes from the task force continued their attacks until June 14, harassing fields, bombing military targets, and burning cane fields on the southern half of Saipan.\n\n**15 June: D-Day**\n\nJune 15 was D-Day for the amphibious landing, which began around 08:40. Naval and aerial bombardments in preparation for the landings began earlier in the morning, disrupting the Japanese communications network. The guns of the warships would provide continuous supporting fire throughout the day.\n\n**16–20 June: Southern Saipan**\n\nOn June 16, Holland Smith committed his reserves to reinforce the beachhead, ordering two of the three regiments of the 27th Infantry Division—the 165th and the 105th—to land. He proposed to indefinitely postpone the 18 June invasion of Guam. The two Marine divisions on Saipan spent most of the day consolidating the beachhead. The 2nd Marine Division began to close the gap between the two divisions north of Charan Kanoa, and the 4th Marine Division cleared the area around Aginan point on the southwest of the Island.\n\n**Battle of Philippine Sea**\n\nOnce Admiral Soemu Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, was certain that Saipan was the target of an invasion, he initiated his response. Less than a half hour after the start of the amphibious invasion, he announced the implementation of Operation A-Go, the Japanese Navy's current plan to destroy the American fleet. He then sent a message to the entire fleet that repeated Admiral Heihachirō Tōgō's speech before Japan's decisive naval battle against Russia at Tsushima in 1905, which in turn echoed Horatio Nelson's signal at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805: \"The fate of the Empire rests upon this single battle. Every man is expected to do his utmost.\"\n\n**21–24 June: Central Saipan, Initial Attack**\n\nSaitō's new defense line stretched from Garapan on the west coast to the southern slopes of Mount Tapatchou across to Magicienne Bay on the east coast. It held most of the island's high ground, which allowed the Japanese to observe American movements, and the rough terrain was filled with caves concealed by brush.\n\n**25–30 June: Central Saipan, Breakthrough**\n\nThe United States forces had built up substantial firepower to continue their northward drive. On June 22, P-47s from the Seventh Air Force landed on Aslito Field and immediately began launching ground assault missions. On the same day, the XXIV Corps Artillery commanded by Brigadier General Arthur M Harper moved 24 155 mm field guns and 24 155 mm howitzers into place to fire on Japanese positions. The Americans also used truck-launched rockets for saturation barrages. Spotters flying in L-4 Grasshoppers helped direct ground artillery, and Navajo code talkers relayed information about Japanese troop movements.\n\n**American Advance and Japanese Breakout at Nafutan Point**\n\nOn June 25, the 27th Infantry Division was not able to make much headway in their fight for Death Valley, but the 2nd Marine Division to the west gained control of Mount Tapotchau, the key artillery observation posts in Central Saipan. On the east coast, the 4th Marine Division quickly occupied most of the Kagman peninsula, meeting little organized resistance because the Japanese had evacuated the peninsula.\n\n**1–6 July: Pursuit into Northern Saipan**\n\nSaitō intended to form a new line in northern Saipan that would be anchored on Tanapag on the west, running southeast to a village called Tarahoho, and through to the east coast. He wasn't able to. His army's cohesion was disintegrating: Some of the remaining forces retreated north, others holed up in whatever caves they could find, others put up disorganized resistance where they were.\n\n**7–9 July: Gyokusai Attack and Battle's End**\n\nAt least 3,000 Japanese combatants participated in the gyokusai attack. They assembled near Makunsha. The force included naval personnel, support troops, civilians, and the walking wounded. It included three tanks, supporting mortars, and machine guns, but some troops were only armed with sticks with bayonets, knives, or grenades tied to poles. It would be the largest gyokusai attack of the Pacific War.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nAlmost the entire Japanese garrison – approximately 30,000 military personnel – were killed in the battle. Eventually 1,700, about half of whom were Korean workers, were taken prisoner. American forces suffered about 16,500 casualties – 3,100 killed and 13,000 wounded – out of 71,000 who were part of the assault force. The casualty rate was over 20%, which was comparable to Tarawa. It was the Americans' most deadly battle in the Pacific up to that time.\n\n**Logistics**\n\nThe American forces brought their supplies with the invasion fleet, carrying over one ton of supplies per soldier: 32 days of rations, 30 days of medical supplies, 20 days of maintenance supplies, seven days of ammunition for ground weapons, and ten days of anti-aircraft ammunition. Mobile reserves and an ammunition resupply train, as well as regular resupply shipments came from depots at Eniwetok, which was 1,017 miles from Saipan.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe invasion of Saipan and the invasion of France in Operation Overlord demonstrated the dominance of American industrial power. Both were massive amphibious invasions – the two largest up to that time – and they were launched almost simultaneously on separate halves of the globe. Together, they were the greatest deployment of military resources by the United States at one time.\n\n**Impact on American Military Strategy**\n\nThe availability of Saipan as an American airbase, along with the airbases already established in Chengdu, opened a new phase in the Pacific War, in which strategic bombing would play a major role. The 15 June invasion of the island had been synchronized with bombing of the Yawata Steel Works by B-29s in China. It was the first bombing of the Japan home islands by B-29s, signaling the beginning of a campaign that could strike deep into Japan's Absolute National Defense Zone.\n\n**Impact on Japanese Politics and Morale**\n\nSaipan's loss had a greater impact in Japan than any of its previous defeats. The Emperor of Japan, Hirohito, recognized that American control of the island would result in Tokyo being bombed. After the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Philippine Sea, he demanded that the Japanese General Staff plan another naval attack to prevent its fall. Hirohito only accepted Saipan's eventual fall on 25 June 1944 when his advisors told him all was lost.\n\n**Memorials**\n\nSuicide Cliff and Banzai Cliff, along with surviving isolated Japanese fortifications, are recognized as historic sites on the U.S National Register of Historic Places. The cliffs are part of the National Historic Landmark District Landing Beaches; Aslito/Isley Field; & Marpi Point, Saipan Island, which includes the American landing beaches, the B-29 runways of Isley Field, and the surviving Japanese infrastructure of the Aslito and Marpi Point airfields. The Maritime Heritage Trail has a series of dive sites with submerged ships, planes, and tanks from the battle.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

{"title": "Jared_Fogle", "content": "\nEarly life\nFogle was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on August 23, 1977, to Norman and Adrienne Fogle [2] [3] He has a younger brother and sister He was raised in a Jewish home [4] [5] He had a bar mitzvah while on a trip to Israel, and then was confirmed by his Conservative-Reconstructionist synagogue [6]\n\n\nCareer\nFogle first came to media attention in April 1999, via an article published in the Indiana Daily Student written by a former dormmate about Fogle losing 245 lb (111 kg) by exercising and eating a diet of Subway sandwiches [10] [11] Subsequently, Fogle was featured in a Men's Health magazine article, \"Stupid Diets .. that Work!\" [12] According to the article, Fogle had become obese – at one point weighing 425 lb (193 kg) [10] – through lack of exercise and eating junk food.\n\n\nSubway campaign\nFogle first came to media attention in April 1999, via an article published in the Indiana Daily Student written by a former dormmate about Fogle losing 245 lb (111 kg) by exercising and eating a diet of Subway sandwiches [10] [11] Subsequently, Fogle was featured in a Men's Health magazine article, \"Stupid Diets .. that Work!\" [12] According to the article, Fogle had become obese – at one point weighing 425 lb (193 kg) [10] – through lack of exercise and eating junk food.\n\n\nJared Foundation\nIn 2004, Fogle established the Jared Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on raising awareness about childhood obesity through educational programs and tools provided to parents, schools, and community organizations [25]\n\n\nLegal history\nIn 2007, Fogle came to the attention of state and federal law enforcement agencies after Sarasota, Florida, journalist and radio host Rochelle Herman-Walrond told the Sarasota Police Department he made lewd comments to her about middle school-age girls; she had met Fogle at a local middle school for a health event, as he was in Sarasota for his speaking tour She made recordings of Fogle's remarks and saved text messages between them, and then went to the FBI, where agents asked her to record her conversations with him Herman-Walrond befriended Fogle and for the next four years surreptitiously recorded her conversations with him as part of an ongoing federal investigation She recorded him making several remarks about having had sex with underage girls and asking her to install a webcam in her children's rooms so he could watch them; ultimately, the FBI could not pursue a case against Fogle using the recordings because they needed more substantive evidence against him [35] [36] [37]\n\n\nChild pornography investigation and arrest\nIn 2007, Fogle came to the attention of state and federal law enforcement agencies after Sarasota, Florida, journalist and radio host Rochelle Herman-Walrond told the Sarasota Police Department he made lewd comments to her about middle school-age girls; she had met Fogle at a local middle school for a health event, as he was in Sarasota for his speaking tour She made recordings of Fogle's remarks and saved text messages between them, and then went to the FBI, where agents asked her to record her conversations with him Herman-Walrond befriended Fogle and for the next four years surreptitiously recorded her conversations with him as part of an ongoing federal investigation She recorded him making several remarks about having had sex with underage girls and asking her to install a webcam in her children's rooms so he could watch them; ultimately, the FBI could not pursue a case against Fogle using the recordings because they needed more substantive evidence against him [35] [36] [37]\n\n\nPlea agreement\nOn August 19, 2015, [47] federal prosecutors announced they had reached a deal with Fogle in which he would plead guilty to their August 15, 2015, indictment containing two counts, one of distribution and receipt of child pornography (Count 1) and one of traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor—specifically, from Indiana to New York City, where he is charged with paying to engage in sexual acts with a minor girl – known by Fogle to be 17 years old at the time (Count 2) [39] [48] In the August 15 indictment, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana included allegations in Count 1 that Fogle: was fully aware of, and approved of, co-conspirator Russell Taylor soliciting 12 minors, as young as 13 years old, to perform sexually explicit conduct, secretly filming the conduct then sharing the video and image files with Fogle;

He gained widespread media attention in the late 1990s for his dramatic weight loss, which was attributed to a diet of Subway sandwiches and regular exercise.\n\n## Early Life\n\nJared Fogle was born on August 23, 1977, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Norman and Adrienne Fogle. He has a younger brother and sister, and was raised in a Jewish home. Fogle had a bar mitzvah while on a trip to Israel, and was later confirmed by his Conservative-Reconstructionist synagogue.\n\n## Career\n\nFogle first came to media attention in April 1999, when an article was published in the Indiana Daily Student written by a former dormmate about Fogle's dramatic weight loss. At the time, Fogle weighed 425 pounds (193 kg), but had lost over 245 pounds (111 kg) in just over a year through a diet of Subway sandwiches and regular exercise. This caught the attention of Men's Health magazine, which featured Fogle in an article titled \"Stupid Diets... that Work!\"\n\n## Subway Campaign\n\nFogle's weight loss and enthusiasm for Subway sandwiches made him a natural fit for the company's marketing efforts. He became the national spokesperson for Subway in 2000, and appeared in numerous television commercials and print advertisements for the company. Fogle's contract with Subway was reportedly worth millions of dollars, and he became a ubiquitous presence on television and in print.\n\n## Jared Foundation\n\nIn 2004, Fogle established the Jared Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on raising awareness about childhood obesity through educational programs and tools provided to parents, schools, and community organizations.

The sport requires athletes to compete in five different events: fencing, swimming, equestrian show jumping, pistol shooting, and cross-country running.\n\n## Format\n\nThe format of the modern pentathlon has changed frequently throughout the sport's history. The current format, which was used in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, consists of five consecutive events held over two days. The first day features the fencing and swimming events, while the second day includes the equestrian show jumping, pistol shooting, and cross-country running events.\n\n## History\n\nThe modern pentathlon has a rich and complex history that dates back to the late 19th century. While most sources attribute the creation of the modern pentathlon to Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, some researchers argue that Viktor Balck, the President of the Organizing Committee for the 1912 Games, played a significant role in developing the sport. Regardless of who exactly created the modern pentathlon, it is clear that the sport has a long and storied history that spans over a century.\n\n## Olympic Games\n\nThe modern pentathlon made its Olympic debut at the 1912 Games in Stockholm, Sweden, and has been a part of the Olympic program ever since. Initially, the sport was only open to men, but women were introduced to the competition in 2000. This move towards inclusivity marked a significant milestone in the sport's history, as it brought the modern pentathlon in line with the Olympic Games' commitment to gender parity.\n\n## Governance\n\nUntil 1948, there was no official international governing body for modern pentathlon. However, an IOC committee was established to oversee the sport and provide guidance to athletes and national federations. The Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) was founded in 1948 and has since become the governing body for the sport.\n\n## International Competitions\n\nThe modern pentathlon has a well-established international competition calendar, which includes the World Championships and the UIPM World Cup. The World Championships have been held annually since 1949, and the UIPM World Cup was introduced in 1965. The competitions feature both individual and team events, as well as relay events for men and women.\n\n## Format Changes Over Time\n\nModern pentathlon has undergone numerous format changes since its inception. Some of the key changes include:\n\n### Fencing\n\nIn 2015, an additional bonus round was introduced in the épée fencing event. This change aimed to increase the excitement and competitiveness of the fencing discipline.\n\n### Swimming\n\nThe swimming distance was reduced from 300 meters to 200 meters in 2000.\n\n### Equestrian Show Jumping\n\nCross-country riding was replaced by equestrian show jumping in 1988.\n\n### Pistol Shooting\n\nFrom 1912 to 1988, regular pistols or later sport pistols were used for shooting. From 1989 to 2009, the shooting discipline involved firing a 4.5 mm (.177 cal) air pistol in the standing position from 10 meters distance at a stationary target. Since 2011, laser pistols have been used instead of pistols with actual projectiles.\n\n### Overall Scoring and Operation\n\nThe modern pentathlon uses a points-for-place system, where the lowest score wins. Since 1954, points tables have been used for each of the five events, and points are added for the final score.\n\n## Replacement of Riding with Obstacle Course Racing\n\nIn 2021, the UIPM announced plans to replace the equestrian show jumping discipline with obstacle course racing. The decision was ratified during the UIPM's Congress on November 27, 2021, and is intended to be implemented for the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\n## Popularity\n\nModern pentathlon has historically struggled to attract large audiences and participation. In 2021, the sport consistently had the least TV viewers of all Olympic sports, and also ranked at the bottom for internal Olympic measurements of social engagement. However, some critics argue that the sport has the potential to evolve and improve in the 21st century.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Media related to Modern pentathlon at Wikimedia Commons\n\nNote: This article is a factual summary of the modern pentathlon and its history, and is intended to provide a neutral and informative overview of the sport.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Modern_pentathlon\" following this outline:\n\n\nFormat\nThe format of the modern pentathlon has changed frequently through the sport's history Described below is the format that was used in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris: [6] [7]\n\n\nHistory\nMost sources state that the creator of the modern pentathlon was Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games [8] [9] [10] [11] One alternative view is provided by researcher Sandra Heck, who concluded that Viktor Balck, the President of the Organizing Committee for the 1912 Games, made use of the long tradition of Swedish military multi-sports events to create the modern pentathlon [12]\n\n\nCreation\nMost sources state that the creator of the modern pentathlon was Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games [8] [9] [10] [11] One alternative view is provided by researcher Sandra Heck, who concluded that Viktor Balck, the President of the Organizing Committee for the 1912 Games, made use of the long tradition of Swedish military multi-sports events to create the modern pentathlon [12]\n\n\nOlympic Games\nThe event was first held at the 1912 Olympic Games and has been on the Olympic program continuously ever since [14] It was a male-only event until the 2000 Games, when an event for women was added [8] This enabled the sport to achieve gender parity 24 years before the Olympic Games managed this as a whole [15]\n\n\nGovernance\nUntil 1948 there was no official international federation for modern pentathlon, so an IOC committee was set up for the sport making use of the expertise of IOC members [21] The governing body, Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) was founded in 1948 in Sandhurst, England during the London 1948 Olympic Games [citation needed]\n\n\nInternational competitions\nA world championship has been held every year since 1949 The competitions now include men and women's individual and team events together with relay events for men and women and, since 2010, a mixed relay event After much lobby work of the president of the German Modern Pentathlon Federation, Wilhelm Henze, women were for the first time admitted at the world championships in 1977, and at the official world championships in 1981 [22]\n\n\nFormat changes over time\nModern pentathlon has been the subject of numerous changes since its creation [9]\n\n\nFencing\nIn 2015 — and for the first time in the 2016 Summer Olympics — a system of an additional bonus round was added to épée fencing in international competitions Before that, there was only the round-robin format.\n\n\nSwimming\nUntil the 2000 Olympics, the distance for swimming was 300 metres;

Born on July 17, 1935, in the Bronx, New York City, Carroll's life was marked by dedication, perseverance, and a passion for the arts.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nCarol Diann Johnson was born to John Johnson, a subway conductor, and Mabel (Faulk), a nurse. When Carroll was still an infant, the family moved to Harlem, where she grew up except for a brief period in which her parents had left her with an aunt in North Carolina. This experience had a profound impact on Carroll, who later spoke fondly of her parents' support and the lessons she learned from her aunt. Carroll attended Music and Art High School, where she was a classmate of Billy Dee Williams. In many interviews, Carroll recalled her parents' encouragement, which led her to enroll in dance, singing, and modeling classes. By the time Carroll was 15, she was modeling for Ebony magazine, and she began entering television contests, including Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts.\n\nAs Carroll's interest in show business grew, she attended New York University, where she majored in sociology. However, she left college before graduating to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. Carroll had promised her family that if her career did not materialize after two years, she would return to college. This decision would prove to be a pivotal moment in her life, as it paved the way for her rise to fame.\n\n**Career**\n\nCarroll's big break came at the age of 18, when she appeared as a contestant on the DuMont Television Network program, Chance of a Lifetime, hosted by Dennis James. On January 8, 1954, she took the $1,000 top prize for a rendition of the Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein song, \"Why Was I Born?\" Carroll went on to win the following four weeks, and her success on the show led to engagements at Manhattan's Café Society and Latin Quarter nightclubs.\n\nCarroll's early success was followed by a string of notable roles in film and television, including her breakout performance in the Broadway musical, No Strings. Her performance earned her a Tony Award nomination and established her as a rising star in the entertainment industry. Carroll's subsequent film roles, such as in the 1966 film, A Man Called Adam, and her starring role in the hit television series, Julia, solidified her status as a talented and versatile actress.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nCarroll was married four times, with her first marriage to record producer Monte Kay in 1956. The marriage ended in 1962, but not before Carroll gave birth to her daughter, Suzanne Kay, who would go on to become a journalist and screenwriter. Carroll's personal life was marked by her dedication to her family and her career, and she often spoke of the importance of balancing her personal and professional life.\n\n**Charitable Work**\n\nCarroll was a dedicated philanthropist, particularly in the area of women's health and rehabilitation. She was a founding member of the Celebrity Action Council, a volunteer group of celebrity women who served the women's outreach of the Los Angeles Mission. Carroll worked tirelessly to support women in rehabilitation from problems with alcohol, drugs, or prostitution, and her commitment to this cause was evident in her frequent visits to the Los Angeles Mission.\n\n**Illness, Death, and Memorial**\n\nIn 1997, Carroll was diagnosed with breast cancer, which had a profound impact on her life. She underwent nine weeks of radiation therapy and had been clear for years after the diagnosis. Carroll frequently spoke of the need for early detection and prevention of the disease, and her advocacy helped to raise awareness about breast cancer.\n\nCarroll died on October 4, 2019, at the age of 84, at her home in West Hollywood, California. She had suffered from dementia in the years leading up to her death, but her family and friends remembered her as a vibrant and energetic person who remained dedicated to her craft until the end.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n**Film**\n\n* Carmen Jones (1954)\n* A Man Called Adam (1966)\n* Hallelujah, Baby!

(usually three) will then face the public vote with the nominee receiving the fewest votes (through a save to evict voting system) being evicted from the house The format however may be altered as seen in Day 49 where the Co-HoHs directly nominated two nominees each and in Day 81 where the housemates ranked their housemates rather than the usual nomination process.\n\n\nTwists\nThe logo for

from the other seasons' Big Jump twist where the public's vote also played as a determining factor in choosing the final four The series of challenges were called Big 4 Karapatdapat Challenges (Big 4 Worthy Challenges) and tested the housemates qualities: their self-trust, sense of camaraderie, resourcefulness and being steadfast.\n\n\nChallengers\nThere were four Big 4 Karapatdapat Challenges that were played by the seven remaining housemates, each of which determined a holder for a certain Big 4 spot Unknown to all of them, with four housemates taking the Big 4 spots, the three others who

point; the second with 2 points; and so on until the eighth with 8 points The total points received by each housemate will determine the final ranking; the housemates in the first six ranks will be saved from becoming part of the final list of nominees, while the housemates who receive the most points will be in the last two ranks and will become the official nominees for the week.\n\n\nS–E voting system result\nThe following is a summary of the results of the evictions nights that had used the S-E voting system In this system, a voter may vote to evict or to save a nominee from eviction The votes to save are then subtracted by the votes to evict which may result in a nominee receiving a negative number of votes as seen in the first, eighth, tenth and eleventh evictions, this also results in the percentages not adding up to one hundred.\n\n\nBig Night\nFor the first time in Pinoy Big Brother history, the finale of the season, dubbed as Pinoy Big Brother: Connect @ The Big

the 10th season of the Philippine version of the reality television show Pinoy Big Brother, which is based on the international series Big Brother. The season premiered on December 6, 2020, on Kapamilya Channel and was broadcast on ABS-CBN, which was later shut down by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) on May 5, 2020, due to the expiration of its congressional franchise. The season was hosted by Toni Gonzaga, Bianca Gonzalez, and Robi Domingo, with new digital hosts Richard Juan, Enchong Dee, and Melai Cantiveros.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe scrapping of ABS-CBN's television broadcast operations by the NTC on May 5, 2020, left the continuity of the local Big Brother franchise uncertain. The House of Representatives denied ABS-CBN's franchise renewal bid on July 10, 2020, and the network was unable to secure a renewal of its congressional franchise. However, on October 16, 2020, Pinoy Big Brother hinted at an announcement for a possible return of the show. On October 18, 2020, it was officially announced that a new season would air as Pinoy Big Brother: Connect. No physical auditions were held, and all auditions were done online using the Kumu platform.\n\n**Auditions**\n\nPinoy Big Brother: Connect was first revealed during the October 18, 2020, episode of ASAP Natin 'To!, along with new audition mechanics for this newest season. As the season was held during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, the auditions and its program were held using Kumu. Auditions were opened for ages 16 to 35 years-old. The auditions were opened on October 19, 2020, and ended on November 11, 2020.\n\n**COVID-19 Precautions**\n\nPinoy Big Brother: Connect had some notable changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines.

Big 4 slots were determined by all of these challenges—a deviation from the other seasons' Big Jump twist where the public's vote also played as a determining factor in choosing the final four The series of challenges were called Big 4 Karapatdapat Challenges (Big 4 Worthy Challenges) and tested the housemates qualities: their self-trust, sense of camaraderie, resourcefulness and being steadfast.\n\n\nChallengers\nThere were four Big 4 Karapatdapat Challenges that were played by the seven remaining housemates, each of which determined a holder for a certain Big 4 spot Unknown to all of them, with four housemates taking the Big 4 spots, the three others who failed to take any of those spots were automatically nominated and had to face the public vote The two housemates with the highest number of public votes were given a chance to stay and challenge the Big 4 while the housemate with the least vote was evicted.\n\n\nBig 4 Tasks\nDuring the final days of the season, Big Brother gave the finalists a task Each task can grant either extra votes to save or the deduction and transfer of vote to evict.\n\n\nNomination History\nNote that the production team of show does not tally the launch night as Day 1 For the purposes of uniformity with the other previous season articles, the launch night is marked as Day 1, not the day after it The days reflected in this article were always numbered a day ahead compared to that as shown in the program.\n\n\nPower of Veto\nThe Power of Veto was a power given to the winner of certain tasks The holder of the power is given the chance to automatically save a nominee of their choice from the list of nominees If the power was given to a group, the group will decide which nominee gets vetoed via a collective vote.\n\n\nRank-based nomination result\nFor the 10th nomination week, the list of nominees was based on the housemates' rankings Each housemate will rank all remaining housemates, including themselves Each rank will receive a specific number of points: the first will receive 1 point; the second with 2 points; and so on until the eighth with 8 points The total points received by each housemate will determine the final ranking; the housemates in the first six ranks will be saved from becoming part of the final list of nominees, while the housemates who receive the most points will be in the last two ranks and will become the official nominees for the week.\n\n\nS–E voting system result\nThe following is a summary of the results of the evictions nights that had used the S-E voting system In this system, a voter may vote to evict or to save a nominee from eviction The votes to save are then subtracted by the votes to evict which may result in a nominee receiving a negative number of votes as seen in the first, eighth, tenth and eleventh evictions, this also results in the percentages not adding up to one hundred.\n\n\nBig Night\nFor the first time in Pinoy Big Brother history, the finale of the season, dubbed as Pinoy Big Brother: Connect @ The Big Night, was held in front of the Pinoy Big Brother House with a virtual audience The finale also featured several guests, including past Pinoy Big Brother winners such as Nene Tamayo of Season 1, Bea Saw of Season 2, Ruben Gonzaga of Celebrity Edition 2, Ejay Falcon of Teen Edition Plus, Slater Young of Unlimited, Daniel Matsunaga of All In, Jimboy Martin of 737 Teens and Yamyam Gucong of Otso and other former housemates [2] [99]\n\n\nOfficial soundtrack\nStar Music together with ABS-CBN created an album for this season entitled Connected Na Tayo (Ang Soundtrack Ng Bahay Mo Vol 2) and was released on January 29, 2021 Tracks in this album are mostly composed by Otso ex-housemates Lie Reposposa, Shawntel Cruz, Jem Macatuno, and Kiara Takahashi, which includes this season's theme song and carrier track \"Connected Na Tayo\" and eviction theme song \"Bagong Simula\" [102]\n\n\nControversies and criticism\nJust like in all other seasons, this season was not spared from controversies and criticism One issue involves the rude behavior of one housemate towards another; [103] [104] another was the inclusion of two housemates who favored the shutdown of ABS-CBN; [105] [106] and a mechanic that was tagged as \"unfair\" by viewers [93]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Saint_Nicholas", "content": "\nBiographical sources\nVery little is known about Saint Nicholas's historical life [11] [12] Any writings Nicholas himself may have produced have been lost and he is not mentioned by any contemporary chroniclers [13] This is not surprising, [14] since Nicholas lived during a turbulent time in Roman history [14] The earliest mentions of Saint Nicholas indicate that, by the sixth century, his following was already well-established [15] Less than two hundred years after Saint Nicholas's probable death, the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II (ruled 401–450) ordered the building of the Church of Saint Nicholas in Myra, which thereby preserves an early mention of his name [16] The Byzantine historian Procopius also mentions that the Emperor Justinian I (ruled 527–565) renovated churches in Constantinople dedicated to Saint Nicholas and Saint Priscus, [17] [16] which may have originally been built as early as c 490 [17]\n\n\nLife and legends\nAccounts of Saint Nicholas's life agree on the essence of his story, but modern historians disagree regarding how much of this story is actually rooted in historical fact [24] Traditionally, Nicholas was born in the city of Patara (Lycia et Pamphylia), a port on the Mediterranean Sea, [9] in Asia Minor in the Roman Empire, to a wealthy family of Greek Christians [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [9] According to some accounts, his parents were named Epiphanius (Ἐπιφάνιος, Epiphánios) and Johanna (Ἰωάννα, Iōánna), [29] but, according to others, they were named Theophanes (Θεοφάνης, Theophánēs) and Nonna (Νόννα, Nónna) [9] In some accounts, Nicholas's uncle was the bishop of the city of Myra, also in Lycia Recognizing his nephew's calling, Nicholas's uncle ordained him as a priest [30]\n\n\nFamily and background\nAccounts of Saint Nicholas's life agree on the essence of his story, but modern historians disagree regarding how much of this story is actually rooted in historical fact [24] Traditionally, Nicholas was born in the city of Patara (Lycia et Pamphylia), a port on the Mediterranean Sea, [9] in Asia Minor in the Roman Empire, to a wealthy family of Greek Christians [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [9] According to some accounts, his parents were named Epiphanius (Ἐπιφάνιος, Epiphánios) and Johanna (Ἰωάννα, Iōánna), [29] but, according to others, they were named Theophanes (Θεοφάνης, Theophánēs) and Nonna (Νόννα, Nónna) [9] In some accounts, Nicholas's uncle was the bishop of the city of Myra, also in Lycia Recognizing his nephew's calling, Nicholas's uncle ordained him as a priest [30]\n\n\nGenerosity and travels\nAfter his parents died from an epidemic, Nicholas is said to have distributed their wealth to the poor [23] [30] In his most famous exploit, [31] which is first attested in Michael the Archimandrite's Life of Saint Nicholas, Nicholas heard of a devout man who had once been wealthy but had lost all of his money due to the \"plotting and envy of Satan.\" [23] [32] The man could not afford proper dowries for his three daughters [32] [23] [30] [d] This meant that they would remain unmarried and probably, in absence of any other possible employment, be forced to become prostitutes [23] [30] [32] Hearing of the girls' plight, Nicholas decided to help them, but, being too modest to help the family in public (or to save them the humiliation of accepting charity), he went to the house under the cover of night and threw a purse filled with gold coins through the window opening into the house [23] [30] The father immediately arranged a marriage for his first daughter, and after her wedding, Nicholas threw a second bag of gold through the same window late at night [23] [30] [34]\n\n\nBishop of Myra\nAfter visiting the Holy Land, Nicholas returned to Myra The bishop of Myra, who had succeeded Nicholas's uncle, had recently died [30] and the priests in the city had decided that the first priest to enter the church that morning would be made bishop Nicholas went to the church to pray [30] and was therefore proclaimed the new bishop [24] [30] [40] He is said to have been imprisoned and tortured during the Great Persecution under the Emperor Diocletian (ruled 284–305), [41] [42] but was released under the orders of the Emperor Constantine the Great (ruled 306–337) [15] This story sounds plausible, but is not attested in the earliest sources and is therefore unlikely to be historical [43]\n\n\nCouncil of Nicaea\nIn 325, Nicholas is said to have attended the First Council of Nicaea, [15] [23] [50] where he is said to have been a staunch opponent of Arianism and a devoted supporter of Trinitarianism, [51] and one of the bishops who signed the Nicene Creed [52] Nicholas's attendance at the Council of Nicaea is attested early by Theodore the Lector's list of attendees, which records him as the 151st attendee [15] [16] However, he is conspicuously never mentioned by Athanasius of Alexandria, the foremost defender of Trinitarianism at the council, who knew all the notable bishops of the period, [53] nor is he mentioned by the historian Eusebius, who was also present at the council [13] Adam C English notes that lists of the attendees at Nicaea vary considerably, with shorter lists only including roughly 200 names, but longer lists including around 300 Saint Nicholas's name only appears on the longer lists, not the shorter ones [37] Nicholas's name appears on a total of three early lists, one of which, Theodore the Lector, is generally considered to be the most accurate According to Jona Lendering, there are two main possibilities:\n\n\nOther reputed miracles\nOne story tells how during a terrible famine, a malicious butcher lured three little children into his house, where he killed them, placing their remains in a barrel to cure, planning to sell them off as ham [30] [57] Nicholas, visiting the region to care for the hungry, saw through the butcher's lies and resurrected the pickled children by making the sign of the cross [30] [58] Jona Lendering opines that the story is \"without any historical value\" [43] Adam C English notes that the story of the resurrection of the pickled children is a late medieval addition to the legendary biography of Saint Nicholas and that it is not found in any of his earliest Lives [37] Although this story seems bizarre and horrifying to modern audiences, it was tremendously popular throughout the Late Middle Ages and the early modern period, and widely beloved by ordinary folk [58] [30] [43] It is depicted in stained glass windows, wood panel paintings, tapestries, and frescoes Eventually, the scene became so widely reproduced that, rather than showing the whole scene, artists began to merely depict Saint Nicholas with three naked children and a wooden barrel at his feet [58]\n\n\nRelics\nIt has long been traditionally assumed that Saint Nicholas was originally buried in his home town of Myra, where his relics are later known to have been kept, [43] [61] but some recent archaeological evidence indicates that Saint Nicholas may have originally been entombed in a rock-cut church located at the highest point on the small Turkish island of Gemile, only twenty miles away from his birthplace of Patara Nicholas's name is painted on part of the ruined building In antiquity, the island was known as \"Saint Nicholas Island\" [61] and today it is known in Turkish as Gemiler Adasi, meaning \"Island of Boats\", in reference to Saint Nicholas's traditional role as the patron saint of seafarers [61]\n\n\nGemile\nIt has long been traditionally assumed that Saint Nicholas was originally buried in his home town of Myra, where his relics are later known to have been kept, [43] [61] but some recent archaeological evidence indicates that Saint Nicholas may have originally been entombed in a rock-cut church located at the highest point on the small Turkish island of Gemile, only twenty miles away from his birthplace of Patara Nicholas's name is painted on part of the ruined building In antiquity, the island was known as \"Saint Nicholas Island\" [61] and today it is known in Turkish as Gemiler Adasi, meaning \"Island of Boats\", in reference to Saint Nicholas's traditional role as the patron saint of seafarers [61]\n\n\nMyra\nIn the mid-7th century, Gemile was vulnerable to attack by Arab fleets, so Nicholas's remains appear to have been moved from the island to the city of Myra, where Nicholas had served as bishop for most of his life Myra is located roughly 40 km (25 mi) east of Gemile and its location further inland made it safer from seafaring Arab forces [61]\n\n\nBari\nAfter the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Byzantine Empire temporarily lost control over most of Asia Minor to the invading Seljuk Turks, and so Greek Christians of Myra became subjects of the Turks [62] [70] At the same time the Catholic Church in the West had declared (in 1054 AD) that the Greek church, the official church of the Byzantine Empire, was in schism Because of the many wars in the region, some Christians were concerned that access to the tomb might become difficult [62]\n\n\nVenice\nThe sailors from Bari took only the main bones of Nicholas's skeleton, leaving all the minor fragments in the grave [84] The city of Venice had interest in obtaining the remaining fragments of his skeleton In 1044, they dedicated the San Nicolò al Lido monastery basilica to him on the north end of the Lido di Venezia [85] According to a single chronicle written by an anonymous monk at this monastery, in 1100, a fleet of Venetian ships accompanied by Bishop Henri sailed past Myra on their way to Palestine for the First Crusade Bishop Henri insisted for the fleet to turn back and set anchor in Myra [86] The Venetians took the remaining bones of Saint Nicholas, as well as those of several other bishops of Myra, from the church there, which was only guarded by four Orthodox monks, and brought them to Venice, where they deposited them in the San Nicolò al Lido [87] This tradition was lent credence in two scientific investigations of the relics in Bari and Venice, which confirmed that the relics in the two cities are anatomically compatible and may belong to the same person [88] [89] [83] It is said that someone dies every time the bones of Saint Nicholas in Venice are disturbed The last time the bones were examined was in July 1992 [75]\n\n\nOther locations\nBecause of Nicholas's skeleton's long confinement in Myra, after it was brought to Bari, the demand for pieces of it rose Small bones quickly began to disperse across western Europe [90] The sailors who had transported the bones gave one tooth and two fragments chipped from Nicholas's sarcophagus to the Norman knight William Pantulf Pantulf took these relics to his hometown of Noron in Normandy, where they were placed in the local Church of St Peter in June 1092 [84] In 1096, the duke of Apulia gave several bones of Saint Nicholas to the count of Flanders, which he then enshrined in the Abbey of Watten [84] According to legend, in 1101, Saint Nicholas appeared in a vision to a French clerk visiting the shrine at Bari and told him to take one of his bones with him to his hometown of Port, near Nancy The clerk took a finger bone back with him to Port, where a chapel was built to Saint Nicholas [91] Port became an important center of devotion in the following of Nicholas and, in the fifteenth century, a church known as the Basilique Saint-Nicolas was built there dedicated to him [91] The town itself is now known as \"Saint Nicolas de Port\" in honor of Nicholas [43]\n\n\nScientific analysis\nWhereas the devotional importance of relics and the economics associated with pilgrimages caused the remains of most saints to be divided up and spread over numerous churches in several countries, Saint Nicholas is unusual in that most of his bones have been preserved in one spot: his grave crypt in Bari Even with the allegedly continuing miracle of the manna, the archdiocese of Bari has allowed for one scientific survey of the bones [97] In the late 1950s, while the crypt was undergoing much-needed restoration, the bones were removed from it for the first time since their interment in 1089 A special Pontiffical Commission permitted Luigi Martino, a professor of human anatomy at the University of Bari, to examine the bones under the commission's supervision [42] Martino took thousands of measurements, detailed scientific drawings, photographs, and x-rays [42] These examinations revealed the saint to have died at over seventy years of age and to have been of average height and slender-to-average build He also suffered from severe chronic arthritis in his spine and pelvis [42]\n\n\nVeneration and celebrations\nAmong Greeks and Italians he is a favorite of sailors, fishermen, ships and sailing As a result, and over time, he has become the patron saint of several cities which maintain harbours In centuries of Greek folklore, Nicholas was seen as \"The Lord of the Sea\", often described by modern Greek scholars as a kind of Christianized version of Poseidon In modern Greece, he is still easily among the most recognizable saints and 6 December finds many cities celebrating their patron saint He is also the patron saint of all of Greece and particularly of the Hellenic Navy [101]\n\n\nEastern Orthodox Feast Days for Saint Nicholas of Myra in Lycia\nSaint Nicholas is a popular subject portrayed on Eastern Orthodox icons, particularly Russian and Serbian ones He is depicted as an Orthodox bishop, wearing the omophorion and holding a Gospel Book Sometimes he is depicted wearing the Eastern Orthodox mitre, sometimes he is bareheaded Iconographically, Nicholas is depicted as an elderly man with a short, full, white, fluffy beard and balding head In commemoration of the miracle attributed to him by tradition at the Council of Nicaea, he is sometimes depicted with Christ over his left shoulder holding out a Gospel Book to him and the Theotokos over his right shoulder holding the omophorion Because of his patronage of mariners, occasionally Saint Nicholas will be shown standing in a boat or rescuing drowning sailors; Medieval Chants and Polyphony, image on the cover of the Book of Hours of Duke of Berry, 1410 [124]\n\n\nIconography\nSaint Nicholas is a popular subject portrayed on Eastern Orthodox icons, particularly Russian and Serbian ones He is depicted as an Orthodox bishop, wearing the omophorion and

270-343 AD) was a bishop of Myra, a city in ancient Lycia, and is considered one of the most popular saints in Christianity. He is known for his generosity, kindness, and miracles, and is often depicted in art and literature as a bearded bishop in a red cloak. Nicholas is the patron saint of many countries, cities, and professions, and his feast day is celebrated on December 6.\n\n**Biographical Sources**\n\nVery little is known about Saint Nicholas's historical life. Any writings Nicholas himself may have produced have been lost, and he is not mentioned by any contemporary chroniclers. This is not surprising, as Nicholas lived during a turbulent time in Roman history. The earliest mentions of Saint Nicholas indicate that, by the sixth century, his following was already well-established. Less than two hundred years after Nicholas's probable death, the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II ordered the building of the Church of Saint Nicholas in Myra, which thereby preserves an early mention of his name. The Byzantine historian Procopius also mentions that the Emperor Justinian I renovated churches in Constantinople dedicated to Saint Nicholas and Saint Priscus, which may have originally been built as early as c 490.\n\n**Life and Legends**\n\nAccounts of Saint Nicholas's life agree on the essence of his story, but modern historians disagree regarding how much of this story is actually rooted in historical fact. Traditionally, Nicholas was born in the city of Patara (Lycia et Pamphylia), a port on the Mediterranean Sea, in Asia Minor in the Roman Empire, to a wealthy family of Greek Christians. According to some accounts, his parents were named Epiphanius and Johanna, but, according to others, they were named Theophanes and Nonna. In some accounts, Nicholas's uncle was the bishop of the city of Myra, also in Lycia. Recognizing his nephew's calling, Nicholas's uncle ordained him as a priest.\n\n**Family and Background**\n\nAccounts of Saint Nicholas's life agree on the essence of his story, but modern historians disagree regarding how much of this story is actually rooted in historical fact. Traditionally, Nicholas was born in the city of Patara (Lycia et Pamphylia), a port on the Mediterranean Sea, in Asia Minor in the Roman Empire, to a wealthy family of Greek Christians. According to some accounts, his parents were named Epiphanius and Johanna, but, according to others, they were named Theophanes and Nonna. In some accounts, Nicholas's uncle was the bishop of the city of Myra, also in Lycia. Recognizing his nephew's calling, Nicholas's uncle ordained him as a priest.\n\n**Generosity and Travels**\n\nAfter his parents died from an epidemic, Nicholas is said to have distributed their wealth to the poor. In his most famous exploit, which is first attested in Michael the Archimandrite's Life of Saint Nicholas, Nicholas heard of a devout man who had once been wealthy but had lost all of his money due to the \"plotting and envy of Satan.\" The man could not afford proper dowries for his three daughters, which meant that they would remain unmarried and probably, in absence of any other possible employment, be forced to become prostitutes. Hearing of the girls' plight, Nicholas decided to help them, but, being too modest to help the family in public (or to save them the humiliation of accepting charity), he went to the house under the cover of night and threw a purse filled with gold coins through the window opening into the house. The father immediately arranged a marriage for his first daughter, and after her wedding, Nicholas threw a second bag of gold through the same window late at night.\n\n**Bishop of Myra**\n\nAfter visiting the Holy Land, Nicholas returned to Myra. The bishop of Myra, who had succeeded Nicholas's uncle, had recently died, and the priests in the city had decided that the first priest to enter the church that morning would be made bishop. Nicholas went to the church to pray and was therefore proclaimed the new bishop. He is said to have been imprisoned and tortured during the Great Persecution under the Emperor Diocletian, but was released under the orders of the Emperor Constantine the Great. This story sounds plausible, but is not attested in the earliest sources and is therefore unlikely to be historical.\n\n**Council of Nicaea**\n\nIn 325, Nicholas is said to have attended the First Council of Nicaea, where he is said to have been a staunch opponent of Arianism and a devoted supporter of Trinitarianism, and one of the bishops who signed the Nicene Creed. Nicholas's attendance at the Council of Nicaea is attested early by Theodore the Lector's list of attendees, which records him as the 151st attendee. However, he is conspicuously never mentioned by Athanasius of Alexandria, the foremost defender of Trinitarianism at the council, who knew all the notable bishops of the period, nor is he mentioned by the historian Eusebius, who was also present at the council. Adam C English notes that lists of the attendees at Nicaea vary considerably, with shorter lists only including roughly 200 names, but longer lists including around 300. Saint Nicholas's name only appears on the longer lists, not the shorter ones. Nicholas's name appears on a total of three early lists, one of which, Theodore the Lector, is generally considered to be the most accurate.\n\n**Other Reputed Miracles**\n\nOne story tells how during a terrible famine, a malicious butcher lured three little children into his house, where he killed them, placing their remains in a barrel to cure, planning to sell them off as ham. Nicholas, visiting the region to care for the hungry, saw through the butcher's lies and resurrected the pickled children by making the sign of the cross. Jona Lendering opines that the story is \"without any historical value.\" Adam C English notes that the story of the resurrection of the pickled children is a late medieval addition to the legendary biography of Saint Nicholas and that it is not found in any of his earliest Lives. Although this story seems bizarre and horrifying to modern audiences, it was tremendously popular throughout the Late Middle Ages and the early modern period, and widely beloved by ordinary folk. It is depicted in stained glass windows, wood panel paintings, tapestries, and frescoes. Eventually, the scene became so widely reproduced that, rather than showing the whole scene, artists began to merely depict Saint Nicholas with three naked children and a wooden barrel at his feet.\n\n**Relics**\n\nIt has long been traditionally assumed that Saint Nicholas was originally buried in his home town of Myra, where his relics are later known to have been kept. However, some recent archaeological evidence indicates that Saint Nicholas may have originally been entombed in a rock-cut church located at the highest point on the small Turkish island of Gemile, only twenty miles away from his birthplace of Patara. Nicholas's name is painted on part of the ruined building. In antiquity, the island was known as \"Saint Nicholas Island.\" Today, it is known in Turkish as Gemiler Adasi, meaning \"Island of Boats,\" in reference to Saint Nicholas's traditional role as the patron saint of seafarers.\n\n**Myra**\n\nIn the mid-7th century, Gemile was vulnerable to attack by Arab fleets, so Nicholas's remains appear to have been moved from the island to the city of Myra, where Nicholas had served as bishop for most of his life. Myra is located roughly 40 km (25 mi) east of Gemile and its location further inland made it safer from seafaring Arab forces.\n\n**Bari**\n\nAfter the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Byzantine Empire temporarily lost control over most of Asia Minor to the invading Seljuk Turks, and so Greek Christians of Myra became subjects of the Turks. At the same time, the Catholic Church in the West had declared (in 1054 AD) that the Greek church, the official church of the Byzantine Empire, was in schism. Because of the many wars in the region, some Christians were concerned that access to the tomb might become difficult.\n\n**Venice**\n\nThe sailors from Bari took only the main bones of Nicholas's skeleton, leaving all the minor fragments in the grave. The city of Venice had interest in obtaining the remaining fragments of his skeleton. In 1044, they dedicated the San Nicolò al Lido monastery basilica to him on the north end of the Lido di Venezia. According to a single chronicle written by an anonymous monk at this monastery, in 1100, a fleet of Venetian ships accompanied by Bishop Henri sailed past Myra on their way to Palestine for the First Crusade. Bishop Henri insisted for the fleet to turn back and set anchor in Myra. The Venetians took the remaining bones of Saint Nicholas, as well as those of several other bishops of Myra, from the church there, which was only guarded by four Orthodox monks, and brought them to Venice, where they deposited them in the San Nicolò al Lido.\n\n**Other Locations**\n\nBecause of Nicholas's skeleton's long confinement in Myra, after it was brought to Bari, the demand for pieces of it rose. Small bones quickly began to disperse across western Europe. The sailors who had transported the bones gave one tooth and two fragments chipped from Nicholas's sarcophagus to the Norman knight William Pantulf. Pantulf took these relics to his hometown of Noron in Normandy, where they were placed in the local Church of St Peter in June 1092. In 1096, the duke of Apulia gave several bones of Saint Nicholas to the count of Flanders, which he then enshrined in the Abbey of Watten. According to legend, in 1101, Saint Nicholas appeared in a vision to a French clerk visiting the shrine at Bari and told him to take one of his bones with him to his hometown of Port, near Nancy. The clerk took a finger bone back with him to Port, where a chapel was built to Saint Nicholas. Port became an important center of devotion in the following of Nicholas and, in the fifteenth century, a church known as the Basilique Saint-Nicolas was built there dedicated to him. The town itself is now known as \"Saint Nicolas de Port\" in honor of Nicholas.\n\n**Scientific Analysis**\n\nWhereas the devotional importance of relics and the economics associated with pilgrimages caused the remains of most saints to be divided up and spread over numerous churches in several countries, Saint Nicholas is unusual in that most of his bones have been preserved in one spot: his grave crypt in Bari. Even with the allegedly continuing miracle of the manna, the archdiocese of Bari has allowed for one scientific survey of the bones. In the late 1950s, while the crypt was undergoing much-needed restoration, the bones were removed from it for the first time since their interment in 1089. A special Pontiffical Commission permitted Luigi Martino, a professor of human anatomy at the University of Bari, to examine the bones under the commission's supervision. Martino took thousands of measurements, detailed scientific drawings, photographs, and x-rays. These examinations revealed the saint to have died at over seventy years of age and to have been of average height and slender-to-average build. He also suffered from severe chronic arthritis in his spine and pelvis.\n\n**Veneration and Celebrations**\n\nAmong Greeks and Italians, he is a favorite of sailors, fishermen, ships, and sailing. As a result, and over time, he has become the patron saint of several cities which maintain harbors. In centuries of Greek folklore, Nicholas was seen as \"The Lord of the Sea,\" often described by modern Greek scholars as a kind of Christianized version of Poseidon. In modern Greece, he is still easily among the most recognizable saints and 6 December finds many cities celebrating their patron saint. He is also the patron saint of all of Greece and particularly of the Hellenic Navy.\n\n**Eastern Orthodox Feast Days for Saint Nicholas of Myra in Lycia**\n\nSaint Nicholas is a popular subject portrayed on Eastern Orthodox icons, particularly Russian and Serbian ones. He is depicted as an Orthodox bishop, wearing the omophorion and holding a Gospel Book. Sometimes he is depicted wearing the Eastern Orthodox mitre, sometimes he is bareheaded. Iconographically, Nicholas is depicted as an elderly man with a short, full, white, fluffy beard and balding head. In commemoration of the miracle attributed to him by tradition at the Council of Nicaea, he is sometimes depicted with Christ over his left shoulder holding out a Gospel Book to him and the Theotokos over his right shoulder holding the omophorion. Because of his patronage of mariners, occasionally Saint Nicholas will be shown standing in a boat or rescuing drowning sailors.\n\n**Iconography**\n\nSaint Nicholas is a popular subject portrayed on Eastern Orthodox icons, particularly Russian and Serbian ones.

A tenor soloist appears as Saint Nicolas, with a mixed choir, boys singers, strings, piano duet, organ, and percussion.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of saints\n* List of Eastern Orthodox

{"title": "Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal", "content": "\nChronology of events\nAt 09:03 the following morning, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust declared a major incident in response to concerns raised by medical staff; shortly afterwards this became a multi-agency incident named Operation Fairline [39] [40]\n\n\nInvestigation\nThe first public response to the poisoning came on 6 March It was agreed under the Counter Terrorism Policing network that the Counter Terrorism Command based within the Metropolitan Police would take over the investigation from Wiltshire Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, appealed for witnesses to the incident following a COBR meeting chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd [65]\n\n\nResponse of the United Kingdom\nWithin days of the attack, political pressure began to mount on Theresa May's government to take action against the perpetrators, and most senior politicians appeared to believe that the Russian government was behind the attack [125] [126] The situation was additionally sensitive for Russia as Russian president Vladimir Putin was facing his fourth presidential election in mid-March, and Russia was to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup football competition in June [126] [127] When giving a response to an urgent question from Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons, who suggested that Moscow was conducting \"a form of soft war against the West\", Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on 6 March said the government would \"respond appropriately and robustly\" if the Russian state was found to have been involved in the poisoning [128] [129] UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said on 8 March 2018 that the use of a nerve agent on UK soil was a \"brazen and reckless act\" of attempted murder \"in the most cruel and public way\" [130]\n\n\nResponse of Russia\nOn 6 March 2018 Andrey Lugovoy, deputy of Russia's State Duma and alleged killer of Alexander Litvinenko, in his interview with the Echo of Moscow said: \"Something constantly happens to Russian citizens who either run away from Russian justice, or for some reason choose for themselves a way of life they call a change of their Motherland So the more Britain accepts on its territory every good-for-nothing, every scum from all over the world, the more problems they will have.\" [157] [158]\n\n\nRussian government\nOn 6 March 2018 Andrey Lugovoy, deputy of Russia's State Duma and alleged killer of Alexander Litvinenko, in his interview with the Echo of Moscow said: \"Something constantly happens to Russian citizens who either run away from Russian justice, or for some reason choose for themselves a way of life they call a change of their Motherland So the more Britain accepts on its territory every good-for-nothing, every scum from all over the world, the more problems they will have.\" [157] [158]\n\n\nRussian state media\nFor a few days following the poisoning, the story was discussed by web sites, radio stations and newspapers, but Russian state-run main national TV channels largely ignored the incident [182] [183]\n\n\nChemical weapons experts and intelligence\nOn 3 April 2018 Gary Aitkenhead, the chief executive of the Government's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) at Porton Down responsible for testing the substance involved in the case, said they had established the agent was Novichok or from that family but had been unable to verify the \"precise source\" of the nerve agent and that they had \"provided the scientific info to Government who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions you have come to\" [196] [197] Aitkenhead refused to comment on whether the laboratory had developed or maintains stocks of Novichok [197] He also dismissed speculations the substance could have come from Porton Down: \"There is no way anything like that could have come from us or left the four walls of our facility.\" [197] Aitkenhead stated the creation of the nerve agent was \"probably only within the capabilities of a state actor\", and that there was no known antidote [196] [155]\n\n\nPorton Down\nOn 3 April 2018 Gary Aitkenhead, the chief executive of the Government's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) at Porton Down responsible for testing the substance involved in the case, said they had established the agent was Novichok or from that family but had been unable to verify the \"precise source\" of the nerve agent and that they had \"provided the scientific info to Government who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions you have come to\" [196] [197] Aitkenhead refused to comment on whether the laboratory had developed or maintains stocks of Novichok [197] He also dismissed speculations the substance could have come from Porton Down: \"There is no way anything like that could have come from us or left the four walls of our facility.\" [197] Aitkenhead stated the creation of the nerve agent was \"probably only within the capabilities of a state actor\", and that there was no known antidote [196] [155]\n\n\nFormer Russian scientists and intelligence officers\nVil Mirzayanov, a former Soviet Union scientist who worked at the research institute that developed the Novichok class of nerve agents and lives in the United States, believes that hundreds of people could have been affected by residual contamination in Salisbury He said that Sergei and Yulia Skripal, if poisoned with Novichok, would be left with debilitating health issues for the rest of their lives He also criticised the response of Public Health England, saying that washing personal belongings was insufficient to remove traces of the chemical [198] [199]\n\n\nSpiez Laboratory in Switzerland\nThe Swiss Federal Intelligence Service announced on 14 September 2018 that two Russian spies had been caught in the Netherlands and expelled earlier in the year for attempting to hack into the Spiez Laboratory in the Swiss town of Spiez, a designated lab of the OPCW that had been tasked with confirming that the samples of poison collected in Salisbury were Novichok The spies were discovered through a joint investigation by the Swiss, Dutch, and British intelligence services The two men expelled were not the same as the Salisbury suspects [211] [212]\n\n\nResponse from other countries and organisations\nFollowing Theresa May's statement in Parliament, the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson released a statement on 12 March that fully supported the stance of the UK government on the poisoning attack, including \"its assessment that Russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack that took place in Salisbury\" [213] The following day, US President Donald Trump said that Russia was likely responsible [214]\n\n\nUS government\nFollowing Theresa May's statement in Parliament, the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson released a statement on 12 March that fully supported the stance of the UK government on the poisoning attack, including \"its assessment that Russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack that took place in Salisbury\" [213] The following day, US President Donald Trump said that Russia was likely responsible [214]\n\n\nEuropean Union and member states\nEuropean Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans argued for \"unequivocal, unwavering and very strong\" European solidarity with the United Kingdom when speaking to lawmakers in Strasburg on 13 March [227] Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, expressed shock and offered the bloc's support [228] MEP and leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt proclaimed solidarity with the British people [229]\n\n\nOther non-EU countries\nAlbania, Australia, Canada, Georgia, North Macedonia, Moldova, Norway and Ukraine expelled a total of 27 Russian diplomats who were believed to have been intelligence officers [234] Australia's Malcolm Turnbull said, \"We responded with the solidarity we've always shown when Britain's freedoms have been challenged.\" [235] The New Zealand Government also issued a statement supporting the actions, noting that it would have expelled any Russian intelligence agents who had been detected in the country [236]\n\n\nNATO\nNATO issued an official response to the attack on 14 March The alliance expressed its deep concern over the first offensive use of a nerve agent on its territory since its foundation and said that the attack was in breach of international treaties It called on Russia to fully disclose its research of the Novichok agent to the OPCW [149]\n\n\nJoint responses\nThe leaders of France, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom released a joint statement on 15 March which supported the UK's stance on the incident, stating that it was \"highly likely that Russia was responsible\" and calling on Russia to provide complete disclosure to the OPCW concerning its Novichok nerve agent program [238] [239] On 19 March, the European Union also issued a statement strongly condemning the attack and stating it \"takes extremely seriously the UK Government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible\" [230]\n\n\nExpulsion of diplomats\nBy the end of March 2018 a number of countries and other organisations expelled a total of more than 150 Russian diplomats in a show of solidarity with the UK According to the BBC it was \"the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history\" [231] [237] [241]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe failed poisoning of the Skripals would become an embarrassment for Putin, and ended up causing severe damage to Russia's spying organisations [5] [28] [257] [258] Once Bellingcat exposed the agents' names in September, Moscow then targeted interior ministry leaks that may have helped expose dozens of undercover operatives [5] It also prompted fury in the Kremlin, the result of which was a purge in the senior ranks of the GRU [259] Furthermore a number of botched attempts by the GRU were also revealed in October – the Sandworm cybercrime unit had attempted unsuccessfully to hack the UK Foreign Office and the Porton Down facility within a month of the poisonings Another hack was attempted in April this time on the headquarters of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Netherlands [260] The OPCW was investigating the poisonings in the UK, as well the Douma chemical attack in Syria Four Russian intelligence officers, believed to have been part of a 'GRU cleanup' unit for the earlier failed operations, travelled to The Hague on diplomatic passports The incident was thwarted by Dutch military intelligence, who had been tipped off by British intelligence officials The four tried – and failed – to destroy their equipment and were immediately put on a plane back to Moscow [261] Soon after these events Vladimir Putin's tone changed; at the Russian Energy Forum in Moscow he described Skripal as a \"scum and a traitor to the motherland.\" [262]\n\n\nRussia\nThe failed poisoning of the Skripals would become an embarrassment for Putin, and ended up causing severe damage to Russia's spying organisations [5] [28] [257] [258] Once Bellingcat exposed the agents' names in September, Moscow then targeted interior ministry leaks that may have helped expose dozens of undercover

Kingdom\nFor the UK, the response to the poisonings was viewed as a success story [272] Initially there were criticisms of the intelligence failures with the supposed GRU agents gaining access to the UK in the first place [273] However after the Litvinenko poisoning there were calls for more robust action against Russia, should an event like it unfold [274] The Salisbury poisonings put that robustness into action, managing to rally behind it huge solidarity from the West In addition, the response also exposed many Russian intelligence officers, and British officials believe they did real damage to Russian intelligence operations, even if it was short term [5] [272] [274]\n\n\nRecovery money\nAs of 17 October 2018, a total of £7.5 million had been pledged by government in support of the city and to support businesses, boost tourism and to cover unexpected costs Wiltshire Council had spent or pledged £7,338,974 on recovery, and a further £500,000 \"was in the pipeline\":\n\n\nRecognition of responders\nDeputy Chief Constable Paul Mills and Superintendent Dave Minty of Wiltshire Police were each awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the 2020 New Year Honours

intelligence officer and his daughter, occurred on 4 March 2018 in Salisbury, England. The incident has been widely attributed to the Russian government, which has denied any involvement.\n\n**Chronology of events**\n\nThe first public response to the poisoning came on 6 March 2018, when the Counter Terrorism Policing network agreed to take over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, appealed for witnesses to the incident following a COBR meeting chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd.\n\nThe following morning, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust declared a major incident in response to concerns raised by medical staff; shortly afterwards, this became a multi-agency incident named Operation Fairline.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe investigation into the poisoning was led by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, with assistance from Wiltshire Police and other agencies. The investigation focused on identifying the source and nature of the nerve agent used in the attack.\n\n**Response of the United Kingdom**\n\nWithin days of the attack, political pressure began to mount on Theresa May's government to take action against the perpetrators. Most senior politicians appeared to believe that the Russian government was behind the attack. The UK government called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the incident.\n\n**Response of Russia**\n\nRussia denied any involvement in the poisoning, with President Vladimir Putin describing the allegations as \"absurd\" and \"baseless\". Andrey Lugovoy, a Russian politician and alleged killer of Alexander Litvinenko, suggested that the Skripals were responsible for their own poisoning.\n\n**Chemical weapons experts and intelligence**\n\nGary Aitkenhead, the chief executive of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) at Porton Down, stated that the agent used in the attack was likely to be a Novichok nerve agent, but that the precise source of the substance could not be verified.\n\n**Porton Down**\n\nAitkenhead dismissed speculation that the substance could have come from Porton Down, stating that there was no way anything like that could have come from the facility.\n\n**Former Russian scientists and intelligence officers**\n\nVil Mirzayanov, a former Soviet Union scientist who worked at the research institute that developed the Novichok class of nerve agents, believes that hundreds of people could have been affected by residual contamination in Salisbury. He also criticised the response of Public Health England, saying that washing personal belongings was insufficient to remove traces of the chemical.\n\n**Spiez Laboratory in Switzerland**\n\nThe Swiss Federal Intelligence Service announced that two Russian spies had been caught in the Netherlands and expelled earlier in the year for attempting to hack into the Spiez Laboratory in the Swiss town of Spiez.\n\n**Response from other countries and organisations**\n\nThe US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson released a statement fully supporting the stance of the UK government on the poisoning attack, including its assessment that Russia was likely responsible. The US President Donald Trump also stated that Russia was likely responsible.\n\nThe European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans argued for \"unequivocal, unwavering and very strong\" European solidarity with the United Kingdom. The European Union and its member states issued a joint statement strongly condemning the attack and stating that it \"takes extremely seriously the UK Government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible\".\n\n**Expulsion of diplomats**\n\nBy the end of March 2018, a number of countries and other organisations had expelled a total of more than 150 Russian diplomats in a show of solidarity with the UK. According to the BBC, it was \"the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history\".\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe failed poisoning of the Skripals would become an embarrassment for Putin, and ended up causing severe damage to Russia's spying organisations. Once Bellingcat exposed the agents' names in September, Moscow then targeted interior ministry leaks that may have helped expose dozens of undercover operatives.\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\nFor the UK, the response to the poisonings was viewed as a success story. Initially, there were criticisms of the intelligence failures with the supposed GRU agents gaining access to the UK in the first place. However, after the Litvinenko poisoning, there were calls for more robust action against Russia, should an event like it unfold.\n\nThe Salisbury poisonings put that robustness into action, managing to rally behind it huge solidarity from the West. In addition, the response also exposed many Russian intelligence officers, and British officials believe they did real damage to Russian intelligence operations, even if it was short term.\n\n**Recovery money**\n\nAs of 17 October 2018, a total of £7.5 million had been pledged by government in support of the city and to support businesses, boost tourism and to cover unexpected costs.\n\n**Recognition of responders**\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Paul Mills and Superintendent Dave Minty of Wiltshire Police were each awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the 2020 New Year Honours for their roles in responding to the incident.\n\n**Media depictions**\n\nThe Salisbury Poisonings, a three-part dramatisation of the events in Salisbury and Amesbury, with a focus on the response of

{"title": "Margaret_Guido", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nGuido was born Cecily Margaret Preston on 5 August 1912 in Beckenham, Kent She was the daughter of Elsie Marie Fidgeon – whose father was of independent means – and Arthur Gurney Preston, a Cambridge-educated engineer and wealthy ironmaster, who is also recorded as of independent means at the time of her birth [3] [4] The family home was a twenty-room mansion, Wood Lodge, in West Wickham, on the line of a Roman road Her mother \"ran away\" from the family home when Peggy was five, and this was followed by divorce proceedings which started in 1918 [5] Following the completion if the divorce in 1920, her mother married the co-respondent of the divorce (i.e the other party in accusations of adultery), Surgeon Captain Percival James Bodington, a British Army medical officer [5] That year, her father drowned in Cornwall, which the coroner recorded as an accidental death [5] Her father had appointed his brother, brother, Edwin Mumford Preston, as guardian for his children, and so Peggy and her siblings were then brought up by Edwin and his wife [2] [5]\n\n\nCareer\nGuido began her archaeological career by working on the Early Iron Age She began by writing up the rescue excavation of an Early Iron Age site at Southcote (Berkshire), which appeared in the Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society in 1937, and publishing the pottery from Iron Age Theale the following year In 1938–39, she worked on The Prehistoric Society's first research excavation at the Early Iron Age type-site of Little Woodbury (Wiltshire) She worked here with Gerhard Bersu, who seems to have been as great an influence on Guido as the Wheelers [8] In 1939, Guido published a further Early Iron Age site at Langton Matravers (Dorset), greatly enhancing knowledge of a period that by then had only just begun to be elucidated.\n\n\nEarly interests\nGuido began her archaeological career by working on the Early Iron Age She began by writing up the rescue excavation of an Early Iron Age site at Southcote (Berkshire), which appeared in the Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society in 1937, and publishing the pottery from Iron Age Theale the following year In 1938–39, she worked on The Prehistoric Society's first research excavation at the Early Iron Age type-site of Little Woodbury (Wiltshire) She worked here

knowledge of a period that by then had only just begun to be elucidated.\n\n\nBronze Age\nHowever, Guido's own excavations mostly focused on the Bronze Age The first excavation she directed (in 1937) at the age of 25 was the Middle Bronze Age barrow and urnfield cemetery at Latch Farm (Hampshire); its publication the following year also added significantly to the gazetteer of cremation urns known for the period [10]\n\n\nLate Bronze Age\nTowards the end of the war period, she turned her attention to understanding prehistoric linear earthwork sites (Hampshire) as well as producing a detailed study of the Grim's Ditch earthwork complex (Wiltshire) In the later 1940s, Guido began to focus on the Late Bronze Age period and also started producing specialist artefact reports, in particular on Late Bronze Age metalwork Notably, she produced a comprehensive study of British razors, a report on a Late Bronze Age metalwork hoard from Blackrock (Sussex), and individual artefact studies, as well as a report on a Late Bronze Age burial at Orrock (Fife) It was at this point that she began to develop her specialist interest in glass beads [10]\n\n\nHillfort excavations\nGuido was awarded funding in the late 1940s by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland to test the model of Iron Age settlement development in southern Scotland in response to a Council for British Archaeology policy statement regarding the misleading nature of settlement classification from surface remains This was an early attempt to move settlement archaeology beyond typological study [11] In her upland excavations of Hownam Rings (in 1948), Hayhope Knowe (in 1949), [12] and Bonchester Hill (in 1950) – each site published in the same year it was excavated – she tested and refined the CBA model, providing a relative chronological framework for later prehistoric settlement in southern Scotland [13] In the days before the application of radiocarbon dating to archaeological material, this was a huge leap forward for prehistoric studies.\n\n\nRoundhouse excavations\nBeyond elucidating relative settlement chronologies, Guido's reconstruction drawing of the Hayhope roundhouse was to become the modern standard Although Little Woodbury had been successful in exposing an Early Iron Age roundhouse, the report had been remarkably inconclusive with respect to its reconstruction Guido simplified this in line with the earlier Northumbrian work of Wake and Kilbride-Jones, which went on to influence Brewster at Staple Howe The Hayhope-Hownam excavations also suggested the potential for a typology of prehistoric houses – as later undertaken by Richard Feachem and George Jobey, both greatly influenced by Guido's work [16] On the strength of her contribution to British prehistory, Guido became an elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1944, at the age of 32 [2] She also became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1946 [17]\n\n\n1950s and 1960s\nBy the early 1950s, Guido was already working towards what we now consider an understanding of everyday life in prehistory: recording the positions of finds on plans and considering ritual deposits It is in the work of Guido that we see the advent of modern settlement studies, through her excavation strategy and her work on hillforts and roundhouses [16]\n\n\nGlass beads\nReturning to archaeology, in the 1970s, Guido settled down to researching glass beads and traveled around Britain to see excavated examples as well as those in museums In 1978, she published her first volume on ancient British glass beads, an accomplished work covering both prehistoric and Roman periods (dedicated to Tessa Verney Wheeler) after which she began her Anglo-Saxon volume She co-founded the Bead Study Trust (in 1981), and the Peggy Guido Fund for Research on Beads [10] From the 1970s onwards, she produced dozens of specialist reports on beads (for sites including Lankhills Winchester, Colchester, Wilsford, Cadbury-Congresbury, Conderton Camp, Castle Copse – with many more not yet in print) Her bead research saw her driving a camper-van across Europe during the 1980s [6] [2] Her volume on Anglo-Saxon beads was published posthumously (by Martin Welch) in 1999 Both volumes remain the primary reference works on the topic [2]\n\n\nCurator and later career\nIn 1977, Guido moved from Brock Street, Bath to Long Street in Devizes and became involved with Devizes Museum, now the Wiltshire Museum [6] At the age of 70, she turned her attention again to prehistoric field archaeology, publishing a reconsideration of the Inner Enclosure at Figsbury Rings, Wiltshire with Isobel Smith (in 1982) and conducting a fieldwalking survey of Cow Down [19] at Longbridge Deverill with Eve Machin (in 1982–83), to assess plough damage In 1984, she was elected to the position of Vice President of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society [3]\n\n\nAppraisal\nGuido was a highly skilled excavator and a prolific researcher Throughout her career, her excavation methods were known as tactical and efficient, digging a site per year with strategy chosen for site objectives Her most influential site in this respect was that of Hayhope Knowe in the Scottish Borders (1949) where she opened 520 sq m in targeted open-area trenches to investigate three houses and the enclosure sequence This was one of the first times such an approach had been used for the northern Iron Age Guido's method had taken the best of both the Wheeler and Bersu schools of excavation, scaled down for rapid assessment [2]\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn 12 November 1936, Margaret married the archaeologist Stuart Piggott (1910–1996); they had met while students at the Institute of Archaeology in London [3] By 1954, their relationship was over, and they divorced in 1956 [3] [4] In 1957, she married Luigi Guido, whom she had met while undertaking research in Sicily [21] [22] Two years later, her husband had a psychotic breakdown and she spent six months caring for him while he was strapped to his bed At the end of this period, he left her and moved back to Sicily She never heard from him again [21]\n\n\nLegacy\nHer name lives on in Margaret Guido's Charitable Trust, administered by Coutts of the Strand, which provides grants to charities and voluntary bodies, largely those to do with the arts [26] [10] A bequest to the National Trust helped them to acquire the meadowland surrounding the monument of Silbury Hill, Wiltshire [27]\n\n\nSelected works\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

next two directorial vehicles Sources said that he was eyeing a fifth Indiana Jones film, and then would either precede or follow quickly with another film It was reported that one might be his dream project, a new version of West Side Story [36] This was followed a few days later with an open casting call issued for the characters María, Tony, Anita and Bernardo [37] Additional open casting calls were hosted in New York City in April, and in Orlando, Florida, in May [38] In July, the fifth Indiana Jones film was pushed back, allowing Spielberg to begin pre-production on West Side Story [39]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming took place in Harlem and other Manhattan locations and in Flatlands, Brooklyn in New York City in July 2019 [49] There were ten days of shooting in Paterson, New Jersey,

out how to frame the shots [68]\n\n\nCostumes\nPaul Tazewell, known for his work on Hamilton and The Wiz Live!, served as costume designer for the film For inspiration, he looked to a variety of sources including real-life photographs of 1950s life, some in color by Gordon Parks [70] To distinguish the two gangs from one another visually, he had the Jets dressed in cool-toned colors to reflect \"the steel, the concrete, the streets of New York City as it was in the 1950s\" and the Sharks in warm-toned colors to represent \"where they've come from of Puerto Rico, of the island, having a tropical feel, many of the dresses of the Sharks, I reserved all of the floral pattern for that group for the Puerto Rican community\" [61]\n\n\nMusic\nSpielberg initially approached his frequent collaborator John Williams to serve as the film's music director [71] Williams instead suggested composer David Newman and conductor Gustavo Dudamel [71] While Williams instead served as a music consultant, Newman arranged and adapted Bernstein's original score for the film, incorporating alterations originally made to Bernstein's Broadway score by Johnny Green for the 1961 film (e.g., interpolation of the \"Cool\" fugue motif into the \"Prologue\", the extended trumpet solo in \"Mambo\") Dudamel conducted the New York Philharmonic during the film's recording sessions in 2019, with additional recording by the Los Angeles Philharmonic done during the COVID-19 pandemic the following year [29] Jeanine Tesori and Matt Sullivan served as vocal coach and music supervisor, respectively, while Williams served as music consultant [72] [29] All of the songs were pre-recorded and used as playback on set, with the exceptions of \"One Hand, One Heart\", \"Somewhere\" and \"A Boy like That/I Have a Love\", which did not use the playback and were instead sung live on set [73] Portions of \"María\" were also sung live on set without the playback, as per Elgort's request

The film stars Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek, and features a cameo appearance by philosopher Slavoj Žižek as himself.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Greg Wittle (played by Owen Wilson), a man who spends most of his work hours daydreaming and drawing. Despite his lack of productivity, Greg's boss, John (played by Randall Park), seems to tolerate his behavior. However, things take a turn when Greg is called to his boss's office, forgetting his wallet on his desk. As he tries to leave, he discovers that his medication cannot be refilled without a doctor re-prescribing it. Feeling frustrated and anxious, Greg's behavior escalates, and he accidentally kills his boss. To conceal the body, Greg leaves the office and heads to the bar across the street.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Greg's life is not as mundane as it seemed. His daydreams and drawings are not just fantasies, but a way for him to escape the harsh realities of his life. The film explores themes of identity, reality, and the human condition, raising questions about what it means to be alive.\n\n**Cast**\n\nIn addition to Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek, the film features a number of notable actors and cameos. Randall Park plays Greg's boss, John, while Laura Marano plays a supporting role as a love interest. The film also features a cameo appearance by scientist Bill Nye (the Science Guy) as Chris, a quirky character who adds to the film's offbeat humor. Slavoj Žižek, the philosopher, makes a brief appearance as himself, adding a touch of intellectual curiosity to the film.\n\n**Production**\n\nIn June 2019, it was announced that Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek had joined the cast of the film, with Mike Cahill directing from a screenplay he wrote. Amazon Studios was set to distribute the film, which was Cahill's first major production with the company. Despite not having seen the script, Cahill managed to cast the two lead actors based on a twenty-minute pitch, which impressed them with its unique blend of humor and drama.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Los Angeles, with a mix of practical and CGI effects used to create the film's sci-fi elements. The production was notable for its tight schedule and low budget, which added to the film's indie charm.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was released on February 5, 2021, by Amazon Prime Video. The streaming platform provided a wide release for the film, making it available to subscribers worldwide.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising its unique blend of humor and drama, while others found it confusing and disconnected. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 28% approval rating based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 4.90/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"When it comes to building an entertaining sci-fi drama around some cool ideas, this Bliss is largely ignorant.\"\n\nMetacritic sampled 21 critics and calculated a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". The film's poor reception was a surprise to some, given the talent involved and the unique premise. However, the film's flaws and inconsistencies ultimately detracted from its overall impact.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nDespite its mixed reception, the film has developed a cult following over time. Fans of the film praise its unique blend of humor and drama, as well as its thought-provoking themes and ideas. The film's offbeat style and quirky characters have made it a favorite among some viewers, who appreciate its individuality and originality.\n\nIn conclusion, Bliss (2021 film) is a complex and ambitious film that explores themes of identity, reality, and the human condition. While it received mixed reviews from critics, the film has developed a loyal following over time, and its unique blend of humor and drama makes it worth watching for fans of the genre.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bliss_(2021_film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nGreg Wittle spends his work hours daydreaming and drawing After he is called to his boss's office, forgetting his wallet on his desk, Greg's wallet glitches out Greg discovers his medication cannot be refilled without a doctor represcribing it After he is fired, he accidentally kills his boss and conceals the body before leaving the office for the bar across the street.\n\n\nCast\nIn addition, scientist Bill Nye (the Science Guy) appears as Chris, while Slavoj Žižek has a cameo as himself.\n\n\nProduction\nIn June 2019, it was announced Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek had joined the cast of the film, with Mike Cahill directing from a screenplay he wrote [2] and Amazon Studios distributing the film [4] Cahill managed to cast the two lead actors before they had seen the script, based on a twenty minute pitch [5]\n\n\nRelease\nThe film was released on February 5, 2021 by Amazon Prime Video [9]\n\n\nReception\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 28% approval rating based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 4.90/10 The website's critics consensus reads: \"When it comes to building an entertaining sci-fi drama around some cool ideas, this Bliss is largely ignorant.\" [10] Metacritic sampled 21 critics and calculated a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [11]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Ashton-under-Lyne in 183 years, and, as the first woman MP, I promise that I will do all in my power to live up to the examples shown by my predecessors Of course, I could never fill their shoes—mine

{"title": "Buffalo,_New_York", "content": "\nHistory\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, nomadic Paleo-Indians inhabited the western New York region from the 8th millennium BCE The Woodland period began around 1000 BC, marked by the rise of the Iroquois Confederacy and the spread of its tribes throughout the state [11] [12] Seventeenth-century Jesuit missionaries were the first Europeans to visit the area [13]\n\n\nPre-Columbian era to European exploration\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, nomadic Paleo-Indians inhabited the western New York region from the 8th millennium BCE The Woodland period began around 1000 BC, marked by the rise of the Iroquois Confederacy and the spread of its tribes throughout the state [11] [12] Seventeenth-century Jesuit missionaries were the first Europeans to visit the area [13]\n\n\nErie Canal, grain and commerce\nThe village of Buffalo was named for Buffalo Creek [b] [32] British military engineer John Montresor referred to \"Buffalo Creek\" in his 1764 journal, the earliest recorded appearance of the name [33] A road to Pennsylvania from Buffalo was built in 1802 for migrants traveling to the Connecticut Western Reserve in Ohio [34] Before an east–west turnpike across the state was completed, traveling from Albany to Buffalo would take a week; a trip from nearby Williamsville to Batavia could take over three days [35] [c]\n\n\nSteel, challenges, and the modern era\nAt the start of the 20th century, Buffalo was the world's leading grain port and a national flour-milling hub [49] Local mills were among the first to benefit from hydroelectricity generated by the Niagara River Buffalo hosted the 1901 Pan-American Exposition after the Spanish–American War, showcasing the nation's advances in art, architecture, and electricity Its centerpiece was the Electric Tower, with over two million light bulbs, but some exhibits were jingoistic and racially charged [50] [51] [52] At the exposition, President William McKinley was assassinated by anarchist Leon Czolgosz [53] When McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in at the Wilcox Mansion in Buffalo [54]\n\n\nGeography\nBuffalo is on the eastern end of Lake Erie opposite Fort Erie, Ontario It is at the head of the Niagara River, which flows north over Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario.\n\n\nTopography\nBuffalo is on the eastern end of Lake Erie opposite Fort Erie, Ontario It is at the head of the Niagara River, which flows north over Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario.\n\n\nCityscape\nBuffalo's architecture is diverse, with a collection of 19th- and 20th-century buildings [70] Downtown Buffalo landmarks include Louis Sullivan's Guaranty Building, an early skyscraper; [71] [72] the Ellicott Square Building, once one of the largest of its kind in the world; [73] the Art Deco Buffalo City Hall and the McKinley Monument, and the Electric Tower Beyond downtown, the Buffalo Central Terminal was built in the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood in 1929; the Richardson Olmsted Complex, built in 1881, was an insane asylum [74] until its closure in the 1970s [75] Urban renewal from the 1950s to the 1970s spawned the Brutalist-style Buffalo City Court Building and Seneca One Tower, the city's tallest building [76] In the city's Parkside neighborhood, the Darwin D Martin House was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Prairie School style [77] \nSince 2016, Washington DC real estate developer Douglas Jemal has been acquiring, and redeveloping, iconic properties throughout the city [78]\n\n\nNeighborhoods\nAccording to Mark Goldman, the city has a \"tradition of separate and independent settlements\" [79] The boundaries of Buffalo's neighborhoods have changed over time The city is divided into five districts, each containing several neighborhoods, for a total of thirty-five neighborhoods [80] Main Street divides Buffalo's east and west sides, and the west side was fully developed earlier [79] This division is seen in architectural styles, street names, neighborhood and district boundaries, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions; Buffalo's West Side is generally more affluent than its East Side [81] [82]\n\n\nClimate\nBuffalo has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfa), [89] [90] and temperatures have been warming with the rest of the US [91] Lake-effect snow is characteristic of Buffalo winters, with snow bands (producing intense snowfall in the city and surrounding area) depending on wind direction off Lake Erie [92] However, Buffalo is rarely the snowiest city in the state [93] [94] The Blizzard of 1977 resulted from a combination of high winds and snow which accumulated on land and on the frozen Lake Erie [95] Although snow does not typically impair the city's operation, it can cause significant damage in autumn (as the October 2006 storm did) [96] In November 2014 (called \"Snowvember\"), the region had a record-breaking storm which produced over 5+1⁄2 ft (66 in; 170 cm) of snow [97] Buffalo's lowest recorded temperature was −20 °F (−29 °C), which occurred twice: on February 9, 1934, and February 2, 1961 [98]\n\n\nDemographics\nSeveral hundred Seneca, Tuscarora and other Iroquois tribal peoples were the primary residents of the Buffalo area before 1800, concentrated along Buffalo Creek [107] After the Revolutionary War, settlers from New England and eastern New York began to move into the area.\n\n\nReligion\nDuring the early 19th century, Presbyterian missionaries tried to convert the Seneca people on the Buffalo Creek Reservation to Christianity Initially resistant, some tribal members set aside their traditions and practices to form their own sect [119] [107] Later, European immigrants added other faiths Christianity is the predominant religion in Buffalo and Western New York Catholicism (primarily the Latin Church) has a significant presence in the region, with 161 parishes and over 570,000 adherents in the Diocese of Buffalo [120] Major Protestant denominations in the area include Lutheran, Baptist, and Methodist Pentecostals are also significant, and approximately 20,000 persons are non-denominational adherents

manufacturing of steel and automotive parts became central to the city's economy [129] When these industries downsized in the region, Buffalo's economy became service-based Its primary sectors include health care, business services (banking, accounting, and insurance), retail, tourism and logistics, especially with Canada [129] Despite the loss of large-scale manufacturing, some manufacturing of metals, chemicals, machinery, food products, and electronics remains in the region [130] Advanced manufacturing has increased, with an emphasis on research and development (R&D) and automation [130] In 2019, the U.S Bureau of Economic Analysis valued the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls MSA at $53 billion (~$62.3 billion in 2023) [131]\n\n\nCulture\nBuffalo is home to

cultures and ethnicities In 2015, the National Geographic Society ranked Buffalo third on its \"World's Top Ten Food Cities\" list [169] Teressa Bellissimo first prepared Buffalo wings (seasoned chicken wings) at the Anchor Bar in 1964 [170] The Anchor Bar has a crosstown rivalry with Duff's Famous Wings, but Buffalo wings are served at many bars and restaurants throughout the city (some with unique cooking styles and flavor profiles) [171] [172] Buffalo wings are traditionally served with blue cheese dressing and celery [172] In 2003, the Anchor Bar received a James Beard Foundation Award in the America's Classics category [173]\n\n\nMuseums and tourism\nBuffalo was ranked the seventh-best city in the United States to visit in 2021 by Travel + Leisure, which noted the growth and potential of the city's cultural institutions [182] The Albright–Knox Art Gallery is a modern and contemporary art museum with a collection of more than 8,000 works, of which only two percent are on display [183] With a donation from Jeffrey Gundlach, a three-story addition designed by the Dutch architectural firm OMA opened June 2023  [184] Across the street, the Burchfield Penney Art Center contains paintings by Charles E Burchfield and is operated by Buffalo State College [185] Buffalo is home to the Freedom Wall, a 2017 art installation commemorating civil-rights activists throughout history [186] Near both museums is the Buffalo History Museum, featuring artwork, literature and exhibits related to the city's history and major events, and the Buffalo Museum of Science is on the city's East Side [187] [188]\n\n\nSports\nBuffalo has two major professional sports teams: the Buffalo Sabres (National Hockey League) and the Buffalo Bills (National Football League) The Bills were a founding member of the American Football League in 1960, and have played at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park since they moved from War Memorial Stadium in 1973 They are the only NFL team based in New York State [i] Before the Super Bowl era, the Bills won the American Football League Championship in 1964 and 1965 With mixed success throughout their history, the Bills had a close loss in Super Bowl XXV and returned to consecutive Super Bowls after the 1991, 1992, and 1993 seasons (losing each time) [195] The Sabres, an expansion team in 1970, share KeyBank Center with the Buffalo Bandits of the National Lacrosse League The Bandits are the most decorated of the city's professional teams, with six championships [196] The Bills, Sabres and Bandits are owned by Pegula Sports and Entertainment.\n\n\nParks and recreation\nFrederick Law Olmsted described Buffalo as being \"the best planned city  [...] in the United States, if not the world\" [199] With encouragement from city stakeholders, he and Calvert Vaux augmented the city's grid plan by drawing inspiration from Paris and introducing landscape architecture with aspects of the countryside [200] Their plan would introduce a system of interconnected parks, parkways and trails, unlike the singular Central Park in New York City [200] The largest would be Delaware Park, across Forest Lawn Cemetery to amplify the amount of open space [200] With construction of the system finishing in 1876, it is regarded as the country's oldest; however, some of Olmsted's plans were never fully realized [199] Some parks later diminished and succumbed to diseases, highway construction, and weather events such as Lake Storm Aphid in 2006 [96] [200] The non-profit Buffalo Olmsted Park Conservancy was created in 2004 to help preserve the 850 acres (340 ha) of parkland [201] Olmsted's work in Buffalo inspired similar efforts in cities such as San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston [200]\n\n\nGovernment\nBuffalo has a Strong mayor–council government As the chief executive of city government, the mayor oversees the heads of the city's departments, participates in ceremonies, boards and commissions, and is as the liaison between the city and local cultural institutions [214] Some agencies, including utilities, urban renewal and public housing, are state- and federally-funded public benefit-corporations semi-independent of city government [215] Christopher Scanlon has served as acting mayor since 2024, following the resignation of Byron Brown [216] No Republican has been mayor of Buffalo since Chester A Kowal in 1965 [217]\n\n\nPublic safety\nBuffalo is served by the Buffalo Police Department The police commissioner is Byron Lockwood, who was appointed by Mayor Byron Brown in 2018 [226] Although some criminal activity in the city remains higher than the national average, total crimes have decreased since the 1990s; one reason may be the gun buyback program implemented by the Brown administration in the mid-2000s [227] Before this, the city was part of the nationwide crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s and its accompanying record-high crime levels [227] In 2018, city police began wearing 300 body cameras [228]  A 2021 Partnership for the Public Good report noted that the BPD, which had a 2020–21 budget of about $145.7 million, had an above-average police-to-citizen ratio of 28.9 officers per 10,000 residents in 2020 – higher than peer cities Minneapolis and Toledo, Ohio [229] The force had a roster of 740 officers during the year, about two-thirds of whom handled emergency requests, road patrol and other non-office assignments [229] The department has been criticized for misconduct and brutality, including the 2004 wrongful termination of officer Cariol Horne

York\n\nIntroduction\nBuffalo is a city located in the state of New York, in the northeastern United States. It is situated at the eastern end of Lake Erie, opposite Fort Erie, Ontario, and is at the head of the Niagara River, which flows north over Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario. With a rich history dating back to the 18th century, Buffalo has evolved into a vibrant city with a diverse economy, culture, and architecture.\n\nHistory\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, nomadic Paleo-Indians inhabited the western New York region from the 8th millennium BCE. The Woodland period began around 1000 BC, marked by the rise of the Iroquois Confederacy and the spread of its tribes throughout the state. Seventeenth-century Jesuit missionaries were the first Europeans to visit the area.\n\nPre-Columbian era to European exploration\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, nomadic Paleo-Indians inhabited the western New York region from the 8th millennium BCE. The Woodland period began around 1000 BC, marked by the rise of the Iroquois Confederacy and the spread of its tribes throughout the state. Seventeenth-century Jesuit missionaries were the first Europeans to visit the area.\n\nErie Canal, grain and commerce\nThe village of Buffalo was named for Buffalo Creek. British military engineer John Montresor referred to \"Buffalo Creek\" in his 1764 journal, the earliest recorded appearance of the name. A road to Pennsylvania from Buffalo was built in 1802 for migrants traveling to the Connecticut Western Reserve in Ohio. Before an east–west turnpike across the state was completed, traveling from Albany to Buffalo would take a week; a trip from nearby Williamsville to Batavia could take over three days.\n\nSteel, challenges, and the modern era\nAt the start of the 20th century, Buffalo was the world's leading grain port and a national flour-milling hub. Local mills were among the first to benefit from hydroelectricity generated by the Niagara River. Buffalo hosted the 1901 Pan-American Exposition after the Spanish–American War, showcasing the nation's advances in art, architecture, and electricity. Its centerpiece was the Electric Tower, with over two million light bulbs, but some exhibits were jingoistic and racially charged. At the exposition, President William McKinley was assassinated by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. When McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in at the Wilcox Mansion in Buffalo.\n\nGeography\nBuffalo is on the eastern end of Lake Erie opposite Fort Erie, Ontario. It is at the head of the Niagara River, which flows north over Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario.\n\nTopography\nBuffalo is on the eastern end of Lake Erie opposite Fort Erie, Ontario. It is at the head of the Niagara River, which flows north over Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario.\n\nCityscape\nBuffalo's architecture is diverse, with a collection of 19th- and 20th-century buildings. Downtown Buffalo landmarks include Louis Sullivan's Guaranty Building, an early skyscraper; the Ellicott Square Building, once one of the largest of its kind in the world; the Art Deco Buffalo City Hall and the McKinley Monument, and the Electric Tower. Beyond downtown, the Buffalo Central Terminal was built in the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood in 1929; the Richardson Olmsted Complex, built in 1881, was an insane asylum until its closure in the 1970s. Urban renewal from the 1950s to the 1970s spawned the Brutalist-style Buffalo City Court Building and Seneca One Tower, the city's tallest building. In the city's Parkside neighborhood, the Darwin D Martin House was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Prairie School style.\n\nNeighborhoods\nAccording to Mark Goldman, the city has a \"tradition of separate and independent settlements.\" The boundaries of Buffalo's neighborhoods have changed over time. The city is divided into five districts, each containing several neighborhoods, for a total of thirty-five neighborhoods. Main Street divides Buffalo's east and west sides, and the west side was fully developed earlier. This division is seen in architectural styles, street names, neighborhood and district boundaries, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions; Buffalo's West Side is generally more affluent than its East Side.\n\nClimate\nBuffalo has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfa), and temperatures have been warming with the rest of the US. Lake-effect snow is characteristic of Buffalo winters, with snow bands (producing intense snowfall in the city and surrounding area) depending on wind direction off Lake Erie. However, Buffalo is rarely the snowiest city in the state. The Blizzard of 1977 resulted from a combination of high winds and snow which accumulated on land and on the frozen Lake Erie. Although snow does not typically impair the city's operation, it can cause significant damage in autumn (as the October 2006 storm did). In November 2014 (called \"Snowvember\"), the region had a record-breaking storm which produced over 5+1⁄2 feet (66 inches; 170 cm) of snow. Buffalo's lowest recorded temperature was −20 °F (−29 °C), which occurred twice: on February 9, 1934, and February 2, 1961.\n\nDemographics\nSeveral hundred Seneca, Tuscarora and other Iroquois tribal peoples were the primary residents of the Buffalo area before 1800, concentrated along Buffalo Creek. After the Revolutionary War, settlers from New England and eastern New York began to move into the area.\n\nReligion\nDuring the early 19th century, Presbyterian missionaries tried to convert the Seneca people on the Buffalo Creek Reservation to Christianity. Initially resistant, some tribal members set aside their traditions and practices to form their own sect. Later, European immigrants added other faiths. Christianity is the predominant religion in Buffalo and Western New York. Catholicism (primarily the Latin Church) has a significant presence in the region, with 161 parishes and over 570,000 adherents in the Diocese of Buffalo. Major Protestant denominations in the area include Lutheran, Baptist, and Methodist. Pentecostals are also significant, and approximately 20,000 persons are non-denominational adherents.\n\nEconomy\nThe Erie Canal was the impetus for Buffalo's economic growth as a transshipment hub for grain and other agricultural products headed east from the Midwest. Later, manufacturing of steel and automotive parts became central to the city's economy. When these industries downsized in the region, Buffalo's economy became service-based. Its primary sectors include health care, business services (banking, accounting, and insurance), retail, tourism and logistics, especially with Canada. Despite the loss of large-scale manufacturing, some manufacturing of metals, chemicals, machinery, food products, and electronics remains in the region. Advanced manufacturing has increased, with an emphasis on research and development (R&D) and automation. In 2019, the U.S Bureau of Economic Analysis valued the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls MSA at $53 billion.\n\nCulture\nBuffalo is home to over 20 theater companies, with many centered in the downtown Theatre District. Shea's Performing Arts Center is the city's largest theater. Designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany and built in 1926, the theater presents Broadway musicals and concerts. Shakespeare in Delaware Park has been held outdoors every summer since 1976.\n\nPerforming arts and music\nBuffalo is home to over 20 theater companies, with many centered in the downtown Theatre District.

Its Grosvenor Room maintains a special-collections listing of nearly five hundred thousand resources for researchers. A pocket park funded by Southwest Airlines opened in 2020, and brought landscaping improvements and seating to Lafayette Square. The system's free library cards are valid at the city's eight branch libraries and at member libraries throughout Erie County.\n\nInfrastructure\nNine hospitals are operated in the city: Oishei Children's Hospital and Buffalo General Medical Center by Kaleida Health, Mercy Hospital and Sisters of Charity Hospital (Catholic Health), Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, the county-run Erie County Medical Center (ECMC), Buffalo VA Medical Center, BryLin (Psychiatric) Hospital and the state-operated Buffalo Psychiatric Center. John R Oishei Children's Hospital, built in 2017, is adjacent to Buffalo General Medical Center on the 120-acre (49 ha) Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus north of downtown; its Gates Vascular Institute specializes in acute stroke recovery. The medical campus includes the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, ranked the 14th-best cancer-treatment center in the United States by U.S News & World Report.\n\nTransportation\nGrowth and changing transportation needs altered Buffalo's grid plan, which was developed by Joseph Ellicott in 1804. His plan laid out streets like the spokes of a wheel, naming them after Dutch landowners and Native American tribes. City streets expanded outward, denser in the west and spreading out east of Main Street. Buffalo is a port of entry with Canada; the Peace Bridge crosses the Niagara River and links the Niagara Thruway (I-190) and Queen Elizabeth Way. I-190, NY 5 and NY 33 are the primary expressways serving the city, carrying a total of over 245,000 vehicles daily. NY 5 carries traffic to the Southtowns, and NY 33 carries traffic to the eastern suburbs and the Buffalo Airport. The east-west Scajacquada Expressway (NY 198) bisects Delaware Park, connecting I-190 with the Kensington Expressway (NY 33) on the city's East Side to form a partial beltway around the city center. The Scajacquada and Kensington Expressways and the Buffalo Skyway (NY 5) have been targeted for redesign or removal. Other major highways include US 62 on the city's East Side, NY 354 and a portion of NY 130, both east–west routes, and NY 265, NY 266 and NY 384, all north–south routes on the city's West Side. Buffalo has a higher-than-average percentage of households without a car: 30 percent in 2015, decreasing to 28.2 percent in 2016; the 2016 national average was 8.7 percent. Buffalo averaged 1.03 cars per household in 2016, compared to the national average of 1.8.\n\nUtilities\nBuffalo's water system is operated by Veolia Water, and water treatment begins at the Colonel Francis G Ward Pumping Station. When it opened in 1915, the station's capacity was second only to Paris. Wastewater is treated by the Buffalo Sewer Authority, its coverage extending to the eastern suburbs. National Grid and New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG) provide electricity, and National Fuel Gas provides natural gas. The city's primary telecommunications provider is Spectrum; Verizon Fios serves the North Park neighborhood. A 2018 report by Ookla noted that Buffalo was one of the bottom five U.S cities in", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Buffalo,_New_York\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, nomadic Paleo-Indians inhabited the western New York region from the 8th millennium BCE The Woodland period began around 1000 BC, marked by the rise of the Iroquois Confederacy and the spread of its tribes throughout the state [11] [12] Seventeenth-century Jesuit missionaries were the first Europeans to visit the area [13]\n\n\nPre-Columbian era to European exploration\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, nomadic Paleo-Indians inhabited the western New York region from the 8th millennium BCE The Woodland period began around 1000 BC, marked by the rise of the Iroquois Confederacy and the spread of its tribes throughout the state [11] [12] Seventeenth-century Jesuit missionaries were the first Europeans to visit the area [13]\n\n\nErie Canal, grain and commerce\nThe village of Buffalo was named for Buffalo Creek [b] [32] British military engineer John Montresor referred to \"Buffalo Creek\" in his 1764 journal, the earliest recorded appearance of the name [33] A road to Pennsylvania from Buffalo was built in 1802 for migrants traveling to the Connecticut Western Reserve in Ohio [34] Before an east–west turnpike across the state was completed, traveling from Albany to Buffalo would take a week; a trip from nearby Williamsville to Batavia could take over three days [35] [c]\n\n\nSteel, challenges, and the modern era\nAt the start of the 20th century, Buffalo was the world's leading grain port and a national flour-milling hub [49] Local mills were among the first to benefit from hydroelectricity generated by the Niagara River Buffalo hosted the 1901 Pan-American Exposition after the Spanish–American War, showcasing the nation's advances in art, architecture, and electricity Its centerpiece was the Electric Tower, with over two million light bulbs, but some exhibits were jingoistic and racially charged [50] [51] [52] At the exposition, President William McKinley was assassinated by anarchist Leon Czolgosz [53] When McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in at the Wilcox Mansion in Buffalo [54]\n\n\nGeography\nBuffalo is on the eastern end of Lake Erie opposite Fort Erie, Ontario It is at the head of the Niagara River, which flows north over Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario.\n\n\nTopography\nBuffalo is on the eastern end of Lake Erie opposite Fort Erie, Ontario It is at the head of the Niagara River, which flows north over Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario.\n\n\nCityscape\nBuffalo's architecture is diverse, with a collection of 19th- and 20th-century buildings [70] Downtown Buffalo landmarks include Louis Sullivan's Guaranty Building, an early skyscraper; [71] [72] the Ellicott Square Building, once one of the largest of its kind in the world; [73] the Art Deco Buffalo City Hall and the McKinley Monument, and the Electric Tower Beyond downtown, the Buffalo Central Terminal was built in the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood in 1929; the Richardson Olmsted Complex, built in 1881, was an insane asylum [74] until its closure in the 1970s [75] Urban renewal from the 1950s to the 1970s spawned the Brutalist-style Buffalo City Court Building and Seneca One Tower, the city's tallest building [76] In the city's Parkside neighborhood, the Darwin D Martin House was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Prairie School style [77] \nSince 2016, Washington DC real estate developer Douglas Jemal has been acquiring, and redeveloping, iconic properties throughout the city [78]\n\n\nNeighborhoods\nAccording to Mark Goldman, the city has a \"tradition of separate and independent settlements\" [79] The boundaries of Buffalo's neighborhoods have changed over time The city is divided into five districts, each containing several neighborhoods, for a total of thirty-five neighborhoods [80] Main Street divides Buffalo's east and west sides, and the west side was fully developed earlier [79] This division is seen in architectural styles, street names, neighborhood and district boundaries, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions; Buffalo's West Side is generally more affluent than its East Side [81] [82]\n\n\nClimate\nBuffalo has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfa), [89] [90] and temperatures have been warming with the rest of the US [91] Lake-effect snow is characteristic of Buffalo winters, with snow bands (producing intense snowfall in the city and surrounding area) depending on wind direction off Lake Erie [92] However, Buffalo is rarely the snowiest city in the state [93] [94] The Blizzard of 1977 resulted from a combination of high winds and snow which accumulated on land and on the frozen Lake Erie [95] Although snow does not typically impair the city's operation, it can cause significant damage in autumn (as the October 2006 storm did) [96] In November 2014 (called \"Snowvember\"), the region had a record-breaking storm which produced over 5+1⁄2 ft (66 in; 170 cm) of snow [97] Buffalo's lowest recorded temperature was −20 °F (−29 °C), which occurred twice: on February 9, 1934, and February 2, 1961 [98]\n\n\nDemographics\nSeveral hundred Seneca, Tuscarora and other Iroquois tribal peoples were the primary residents of the Buffalo area before 1800, concentrated along Buffalo Creek [107] After the Revolutionary War, settlers from New England and eastern New York began to move into the area.\n\n\nReligion\nDuring the early 19th century, Presbyterian missionaries tried to convert the Seneca people on the Buffalo Creek Reservation to Christianity Initially resistant, some tribal members set aside their traditions and practices to form their own sect [119] [107] Later, European immigrants added other faiths Christianity is the predominant religion in Buffalo and Western New York Catholicism (primarily the Latin Church) has a significant presence in the region, with 161 parishes and over 570,000 adherents in the Diocese of Buffalo [120] Major Protestant denominations in the area include Lutheran, Baptist, and Methodist Pentecostals are also significant, and approximately 20,000 persons are non-denominational adherents [needs update] [121]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Erie Canal was the impetus for Buffalo's economic growth as a transshipment hub for grain and other agricultural products headed east from the Midwest Later, manufacturing of steel and automotive parts became central to the city's economy [129] When these industries downsized in the region, Buffalo's economy became service-based Its primary sectors include health care, business services (banking, accounting, and insurance), retail, tourism and logistics, especially with Canada [129] Despite the loss of large-scale manufacturing, some manufacturing of metals, chemicals, machinery, food products, and electronics remains in the region [130] Advanced manufacturing has increased, with an emphasis on research and development (R&D) and automation [130] In 2019, the U.S Bureau of Economic Analysis valued the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls MSA at $53 billion (~$62.3 billion in 2023) [131]\n\n\nCulture\nBuffalo is home to over 20 theater companies, with many centered in the downtown Theatre District [141] Shea's Performing Arts Center is the city's largest theater Designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany and built in 1926, the theater presents Broadway musicals and concerts [142] Shakespeare in Delaware Park has been held outdoors every summer since 1976 [143]\n\n\nPerforming arts and music\nBuffalo is home to over 20 theater companies, with many centered in the downtown Theatre District [141] Shea's

been held outdoors every summer since 1976 [143]\n\n\nCuisine\nThe city's cuisine encompasses a variety of cultures and ethnicities In 2015, the National Geographic Society ranked Buffalo third on its \"World's Top Ten Food Cities\" list [169] Teressa Bellissimo first prepared Buffalo wings (seasoned chicken wings) at the Anchor Bar in 1964 [170] The Anchor Bar has a crosstown rivalry with Duff's Famous Wings, but Buffalo wings are served at many bars and restaurants throughout the city (some with unique cooking styles and flavor profiles) [171] [172] Buffalo wings are traditionally served with blue cheese dressing and celery [172] In 2003, the Anchor Bar received a James Beard Foundation Award in the America's Classics category [173]\n\n\nMuseums and tourism\nBuffalo was ranked the seventh-best city in the United States to visit in 2021 by Travel + Leisure, which noted the growth and potential of the city's cultural institutions [182] The Albright–Knox Art Gallery is a modern and contemporary art museum with a collection of more than 8,000 works, of which only two percent are on display [183] With a donation from Jeffrey Gundlach, a three-story addition designed by the Dutch architectural firm OMA opened June 2023  [184] Across the street, the Burchfield Penney Art Center contains paintings by Charles E Burchfield and is operated by Buffalo State College [185] Buffalo is home to the Freedom Wall, a 2017 art installation commemorating civil-rights activists throughout history [186] Near both museums is the Buffalo History Museum, featuring artwork, literature and exhibits related to the city's history and major events, and the Buffalo Museum of Science is on the city's East Side [187] [188]\n\n\nSports\nBuffalo has two major professional sports teams: the Buffalo Sabres (National Hockey League) and the Buffalo Bills (National Football League) The Bills were a founding member of the American Football League in 1960, and have played at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park since they moved from War Memorial Stadium in 1973 They are the only NFL team based in New York State [i] Before the Super Bowl era, the Bills won the American Football League Championship in 1964 and 1965 With mixed success throughout their history, the Bills had a close loss in Super Bowl XXV and returned to consecutive Super Bowls after the 1991, 1992, and 1993 seasons (losing each time) [195] The Sabres, an expansion team in 1970, share KeyBank Center with the Buffalo Bandits of the National Lacrosse League The Bandits are the most decorated of the city's professional teams, with six championships [196] The Bills, Sabres and Bandits are owned by Pegula Sports and Entertainment.\n\n\nParks and recreation\nFrederick Law Olmsted described Buffalo as being \"the best planned city  [...] in the United States, if not the world\" [199] With encouragement from city stakeholders, he and Calvert Vaux augmented the city's grid plan by drawing inspiration from Paris and introducing landscape architecture with aspects of the countryside [200] Their plan would introduce a system of interconnected parks, parkways and trails, unlike the singular Central Park in New York City [200] The largest would be Delaware Park, across Forest Lawn Cemetery to amplify the amount of open space [200] With construction of the system finishing in 1876, it is regarded as the country's oldest; however, some of Olmsted's plans were never fully realized [199] Some parks later diminished and succumbed to diseases, highway construction, and weather events such as Lake Storm Aphid in 2006 [96] [200] The non-profit Buffalo Olmsted Park Conservancy was created in 2004 to help preserve the 850 acres (340 ha) of parkland [201] Olmsted's work in Buffalo inspired similar efforts in cities such as San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston [200]\n\n\nGovernment\nBuffalo has a Strong mayor–council government As the chief executive of city government, the mayor oversees the heads of the city's departments, participates in ceremonies, boards and commissions, and is as the liaison between the city and local cultural institutions [214] Some agencies, including utilities, urban renewal and public housing, are state- and federally-funded public benefit-corporations semi-independent of city government [215] Christopher Scanlon has served as acting mayor since 2024, following the resignation of Byron Brown [216] No Republican has been mayor of Buffalo since Chester A Kowal in 1965 [217]\n\n\nPublic safety\nBuffalo is served by the Buffalo Police Department The police commissioner is Byron Lockwood, who was appointed by Mayor Byron Brown in 2018 [226] Although some criminal activity in the city remains higher than the national average, total crimes have decreased since the 1990s; one reason may be the gun buyback program implemented by the Brown administration in the mid-2000s [227] Before this, the city was part of the nationwide crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s and its accompanying record-high crime levels [227] In 2018, city police began wearing 300 body cameras [228]  A 2021 Partnership for the Public Good report noted that the BPD, which had a 2020–21 budget of about $145.7 million, had an above-average police-to-citizen ratio of 28.9 officers per 10,000 residents in 2020 – higher than peer cities Minneapolis and Toledo, Ohio [229] The force had a roster of 740 officers during the year, about two-thirds of whom handled emergency requests, road patrol and other non-office assignments [229] The department has been criticized for misconduct and brutality, including the 2004 wrongful termination of officer Cariol Horne for opposing police brutality toward a suspect [230] and a 2020 protest-shoving incident [231]\n\n\nMedia\nBuffalo's major daily newspaper is The Buffalo News Established in 1880 as the Buffalo Evening News, the newspaper is estimated to have a daily circulation of 87,000 and 125,000 on Sundays (down from a high of 300,000) [240] The newspaper announced a pending sale of its building in February 2023, and the relocation of its printing operations to Cleveland, Ohio [241] [242] Other newspapers in the Buffalo area include the Black-focused Buffalo Criterion and Challenger Community News, The Record of Buffalo State University, [243] The Spectrum of the University at Buffalo, [244] and Buffalo Business First [245]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Buffalo Public Schools have about thirty-four thousand students enrolled in their primary and secondary schools [260] The district administers about sixty public schools, including thirty-six primary schools, five middle high schools, fourteen high schools and three alternative schools, with a total of about 3,500 teachers [261] Its board of education, authorized by the state, has nine elected members who select the superintendent and oversee the budget, curriculum, personnel, and facilities [262] [263] In 2020, the graduation rate was seventy-six percent [264] The public City Honors School was ranked the top high school in the city and 178th nationwide by U.S News & World Report in 2021 [265] There are twenty charter schools in Buffalo, with some oversight by the district [266] The city has over a dozen private schools, including Bishop Timon – St Jude High School, Canisius High School, Mount Mercy Academy, and Nardin Academy—all Roman Catholic, and Darul Uloom Al-Madania and Universal School of Buffalo (both Islamic schools); nonsectarian options include Buffalo Seminary and the Nichols School [267]\n\n\nPrimary

Millard Fillmore, the University at Buffalo (UB) is one of the State University of New York's two flagship universities and the state's largest public university A Research I university, [268] over 32,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students attend its thirteen schools and colleges [269] [270] Two of UB's three campuses (the South and Downtown Campuses) are in the city, but most university functions take place at the large North Campus in Amherst [271] In 2020, U.S News & World Report ranked UB the 34th-best public university and 88th in national universities [272] Buffalo State College, founded as a normal school, is one of SUNY's thirteen comprehensive colleges [273] The city's four-year private institutions include Canisius University, D'Youville University, Medaille University, Trocaire College, and Villa Maria College SUNY Erie, the county's two-year public higher-education institution, and the for-profit Bryant & Stratton College have small downtown campuses

{"title": "Memorial_Day", "content": "\nClaimed origins\nA variety of cities and people have claimed origination of Memorial Day [6] [10] [11] [12] In some such cases, the claims relate to documented events, occurring before or after the Civil War Others may stem from general traditions of decorating soldiers' graves with flowers, rather than specific events leading to the national proclamation [13] Soldiers' graves were decorated in the U.S before [14] and during the American Civil War Other claims may be less respectable, appearing to some researchers as taking credit without evidence, while erasing better-evidenced events or connections [15] [8]\n\n\nPrecedents in the South\nOn June 3, 1861, Warrenton, Virginia was the location of the first Civil War soldier's grave to be decorated, according to an article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch in 1906 [16] This decoration was for the funeral of the first soldier killed during the Civil War, John Quincy Marr, who died on June 1, 1861, during a skirmish at the Battle of Fairfax Courthouse in Virginia [17]\n\n\nVirginia\nOn June 3, 1861, Warrenton, Virginia was the location of the first Civil War soldier's grave to be decorated, according to an article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch in 1906 [16] This decoration was for the funeral of the first soldier killed during the Civil War, John Quincy Marr, who died on June 1, 1861, during a skirmish at the Battle of Fairfax Courthouse in Virginia [17]\n\n\nJackson, Mississippi\nOn April 26, 1865, in Jackson, Mississippi, Sue Landon Vaughan decorated the graves of Confederate and Union soldiers according to her account The first reference to this event however did not appear until many years later [18] Mention of the observance is inscribed on the southeast panel of the Confederate Monument in Jackson, erected in 1891 [19] Vaughan's account is contradicted by contemporary sources [20]\n\n\nCharleston, South Carolina\nOn May 1, 1865, in Charleston, South Carolina, the recently freed Black population held a parade of 10,000 people to honor 257 dead Union soldiers The soldiers had been buried in a mass grave at the Washington Race Course, having died at the Confederate prison camp located there After the city fell, the freed Black population unearthed and properly buried the soldiers, placing flowers at their graves The event was reported contemporaneously in the Charleston Daily Courier and the New-York Tribune [21] Historian David Blight has called this commemoration the first Memorial Day However, no direct link has been established between this event and General John Logan's 1868 proclamation for a national holiday [22] [23] [15]\n\n\nColumbus, Georgia\n    [W]e can keep alive the memory of debt we owe them by dedicating\nat least one day in the year, by embellishing their humble graves with\nflowers, therefore we beg the assistance of the press and the ladies\nthroughout the South to help us in the effort to set apart a certain day\nto be observed, from the Potomac to the Rio Grande and be handed\ndown through time as a religious custom of the country, to wreathe the\ngraves of our martyred dead with flowers   Let the soldiers’ graves,\nfor that day at least, be the Southern Mecca, to whose shrine her\nsorrowing women, like pilgrims, may annually bring their grateful\nhearts and floral offerings  .\n\n\nColumbus, Mississippi\nFollowing Mary William's call for assistance, [8] four women of Columbus, Mississippi a day early on April 25, 1866, gathered together at Friendship Cemetery to decorate the graves of the Confederate soldiers They also felt moved to honor the Union soldiers buried there, and to note the grief of their families, by decorating their graves as well The story of their gesture of humanity and reconciliation is held by some writers as the inspiration of the original Memorial Day [32] [33] [34] [35]\n\n\nOther Southern precedents\nAccording to the United States Library of Congress, \"Southern women decorated the graves of soldiers even before the Civil War’s end Records show that by 1865, Mississippi, Virginia, and South Carolina all had precedents for Memorial Day.\" [36] The earliest Southern Memorial Day celebrations were simple, somber occasions for veterans and their families to honor the dead and tend to local cemeteries [37] In following years, the Ladies' Memorial Association and other groups increasingly focused rituals on preserving Confederate culture and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy narrative [38]\n\n\nPrecedents in the North\nThe 1863 cemetery dedication at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, included a ceremony of commemoration at the graves of dead soldiers Some have therefore claimed that President Abraham Lincoln was the founder of Memorial Day [39] However, Chicago journalist Lloyd Lewis tried to make the case that it was Lincoln's funeral that spurred the soldiers' grave decorating that followed [40]\n\n\nGettysburg, Pennsylvania\nThe 1863 cemetery dedication at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, included a ceremony of commemoration at the graves of dead soldiers Some have therefore claimed that President Abraham Lincoln was the founder of Memorial Day [39] However, Chicago journalist Lloyd Lewis tried to make the case that it was Lincoln's funeral that spurred the soldiers' grave decorating that followed [40]\n\n\nBoalsburg, Pennsylvania\nOn July 4, 1864, ladies decorated soldiers' graves according to local historians in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania [41] Boalsburg promotes itself as the birthplace of Memorial Day [42] However, no published reference to this event has been found earlier than the printing of the History of the 148th Pennsylvania Volunteers in 1904 [43] In a footnote to a story about her brother, Mrs Sophie (Keller) Hall described how she and Emma Hunter decorated the grave of Emma's father, Reuben Hunter, and then the graves of all soldiers in the cemetery The original story did not account for Reuben Hunter's death occurring two months later on September 19, 1864 It also did not mention Mrs Elizabeth Myers as one of the original participants A bronze statue of all three women gazing upon Reuben Hunter's grave now stands near the entrance to the Boalsburg Cemetery Although July 4, 1864, was a Monday, the town now claims that the original decoration was on one of the Sundays in October 1864 [44]\n\n\nNational Decoration Day\n.. Let us then gather around their sacred remains and garland the passionless mounds above them with the choicest flowers of Springtime; let us raise above them the dear old flag they saved from dishonor; let us in this solemn presence renew our pledges to aid and assist those whom they have left among us as a sacred charge upon a Nation's gratitude—the soldiers' and sailors' widow and orphan.\n\n\nState holiday\nIn 1873, New York made Decoration Day an official state holiday and by 1890, every northern state had followed suit [8] There was no standard program for the ceremonies, but they were typically sponsored by the Women's Relief Corps, the women's auxiliary of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), which had 100,000 members By 1870, the remains of nearly 300,000 Union dead had been reinterred in 73 national cemeteries, located near major battlefields and thus mainly in the South The most famous are Gettysburg National Cemetery in Pennsylvania and Arlington National Cemetery, near Washington, D.C [54]\n\n\nWaterloo proclamation\nOn May 26, 1966, President Lyndon B Johnson designated an \"official\" birthplace of the holiday by signing the presidential proclamation naming Waterloo, New York, as the holder of the title This action followed House Concurrent Resolution 587, in which the 89th Congress had officially recognized that the patriotic tradition of observing Memorial Day had begun one hundred years prior in Waterloo, New York [55] The legitimacy of this claim has been called into question by several scholars [56]\n\n\nEarly national history\nIn April 1865, following Lincoln's assassination, commemorations were extensive The more than 600,000 soldiers of both sides who fought and died in the Civil War meant that burial and memorialization took on new cultural significance Under the leadership of women during the war, an increasingly formal practice of decorating graves had taken shape In 1865, the federal government also began creating the United States National Cemetery System for the Union war dead [57]\n\n\nConfederate Memorial Day\nIn 1868, some Southern public figures began adding the label \"Confederate\" to their commemorations and claimed that Northerners had appropriated the holiday [59] [18] [60] The first official celebration of Confederate Memorial Day as a public holiday occurred in 1874, following a proclamation by the Georgia legislature [61] By 1916, ten states celebrated it, on June 3, the birthday of CSA President Jefferson Davis [61] Other states chose late April dates, or May 10, commemorating Davis' capture [61]\n\n\nRenaming\nBy the 20th century, various Union memorial traditions, celebrated on different days, merged, and Memorial Day eventually extended to honor all Americans who fought and died while in the U.S military service [2] Indiana from the 1860s to the 1920s saw numerous debates on how to expand the celebration It was a favorite lobbying activity of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) An 1884 GAR handbook explained that Memorial Day was \"the day of all days in the G.A.R Calendar\" in terms of mobilizing public support for pensions It advised family members to \"exercise great care\" in keeping the veterans sober [62]: 352 \n\n\nCivil religious holiday\nMemorial Day endures as a holiday which most businesses observe because it marks the unofficial beginning of summer (Labor Day is the unofficial end of summer.)

the last Monday of May in the United States, is a federal holiday that honors and remembers the men and women who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. The holiday has its roots in the Civil War and has evolved over time to become a national day of remembrance and tribute to all Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of their country.\n\n**Claimed Origins**\n\nA variety of cities and people have claimed origination of Memorial Day. In some cases, the claims relate to documented events occurring before or after the Civil War. Soldiers' graves were decorated in the United States before and during the American Civil War. Other claims may be less respectable, taking credit without evidence while erasing better-evidenced events or connections.\n\n**Precedents in the South**\n\nOn June 3, 1861, Warrenton, Virginia was the location of the first Civil War soldier's grave to be decorated, according to an article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch in 1906. This decoration was for the funeral of the first soldier killed during the Civil War, John Quincy Marr, who died on June 1, 1861, during a skirmish at the Battle of Fairfax Courthouse in Virginia.\n\n**Virginia**\n\nOn June 3, 1861, Warrenton, Virginia was the location of the first Civil War soldier's grave to be decorated, according to an article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch in 1906. This decoration was for the funeral of the first soldier killed during the Civil War, John Quincy Marr, who died on June 1, 1861, during a skirmish at the Battle of Fairfax Courthouse in Virginia.\n\n**Jackson, Mississippi**\n\nOn April 26, 1865, in Jackson, Mississippi, Sue Landon Vaughan decorated the graves of Confederate and Union soldiers according to her account. The first reference to this event, however, did not appear until many years later. Mention of the observance is inscribed on the southeast panel of the Confederate Monument in Jackson, erected in 1891. Vaughan's account is contradicted by contemporary sources.\n\n**Charleston, South Carolina**\n\nOn May 1, 1865, in Charleston, South Carolina, the recently freed Black population held a parade of 10,000 people to honor 257 dead Union soldiers. The soldiers had been buried in a mass grave at the Washington Race Course, having died at the Confederate prison camp located there. After the city fell, the freed Black population unearthed and properly buried the soldiers, placing flowers at their graves. The event was reported contemporaneously in the Charleston Daily Courier and the New-York Tribune. Historian David Blight has called this commemoration the first Memorial Day, however, no direct link has been established between this event and General John Logan's 1868 proclamation for a national holiday.\n\n**Columbus, Georgia**\n\nA letter published in the Columbus Enquirer in 1866 called for the establishment of a day to decorate the graves of soldiers. The letter stated, \"we can keep alive the memory of debt we owe them by dedicating at least one day in the year, by embellishing their humble graves with flowers, therefore we beg the assistance of the press and the ladies throughout the South to help us in the effort to set apart a certain day to be observed, from the Potomac to the Rio Grande and be handed down through time as a religious custom of the country, to wreathe the graves of our martyred dead with flowers. Let the soldiers' graves, for that day at least, be the Southern Mecca, to whose shrine her sorrowing women, like pilgrims, may annually bring their grateful hearts and floral offerings.\"\n\n**Columbus, Mississippi**\n\nFollowing Mary William's call for assistance, four women of Columbus, Mississippi gathered together at Friendship Cemetery on April 25, 1866, to decorate the graves of the Confederate soldiers. They also felt moved to honor the Union soldiers buried there, and to note the grief of their families, by decorating their graves as well. The story of their gesture of humanity and reconciliation is held by some writers as the inspiration of the original Memorial Day.\n\n**Other Southern Precedents**\n\nAccording to the United States Library of Congress, \"Southern women decorated the graves of soldiers even before the Civil War's end. Records show that by 1865, Mississippi, Virginia, and South Carolina all had precedents for Memorial Day.\" The earliest Southern Memorial Day celebrations were simple, somber occasions for veterans and their families to honor the dead and tend to local cemeteries. In following years, the Ladies' Memorial Association and other groups increasingly focused rituals on preserving Confederate culture and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy narrative.\n\n**Precedents in the North**\n\nThe 1863 cemetery dedication at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, included a ceremony of commemoration at the graves of dead soldiers. Some have therefore claimed that President Abraham Lincoln was the founder of Memorial Day. However, Chicago journalist Lloyd Lewis tried to make the case that it was Lincoln's funeral that spurred the soldiers' grave decorating that followed.\n\n**Gettysburg, Pennsylvania**\n\nThe 1863 cemetery dedication at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, included a ceremony of commemoration at the graves of dead soldiers. Some have therefore claimed that President Abraham Lincoln was the founder of Memorial Day. However, Chicago journalist Lloyd Lewis tried to make the case that it was Lincoln's funeral that spurred the soldiers' grave decorating that followed.\n\n**Boalsburg, Pennsylvania**\n\nOn July 4, 1864, ladies decorated soldiers' graves according to local historians in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania. Boalsburg promotes itself as the birthplace of Memorial Day. However, no published reference to this event has been found earlier than the printing of the History of the 148th Pennsylvania Volunteers in 1904. In a footnote to a story about her brother, Mrs. Sophie (Keller) Hall described how she and Emma Hunter decorated the grave of Emma's father, Reuben Hunter, and then the graves of all soldiers in the cemetery. The original story did not account for Reuben Hunter's death occurring two months later on September 19, 1864. It also did not mention Mrs. Elizabeth Myers as one of the original participants. A bronze statue of all three women gazing upon Reuben Hunter's grave now stands near the entrance to the Boalsburg Cemetery. Although July 4, 1864, was a Monday, the town now claims that the original decoration was on one of the Sundays in October 1864.\n\n**National Decoration Day**\n\nIn 1873, New York made Decoration Day an official state holiday, and by 1890, every northern state had followed suit. There was no standard program for the ceremonies, but they were typically sponsored by the Women's Relief Corps, the women's auxiliary of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), which had 100,000 members. By 1870, the remains of nearly 300,000 Union dead had been reinterred in 73 national cemeteries, located near major battlefields and thus mainly in the South. The most famous are Gettysburg National Cemetery in Pennsylvania and Arlington National Cemetery, near Washington, D.C.\n\n**Waterloo Proclamation**\n\nOn May 26, 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson designated an \"official\" birthplace of the holiday by signing the presidential proclamation naming Waterloo, New York, as the holder of the title. This action followed House Concurrent Resolution 587, in which the 89th Congress had officially recognized that the patriotic tradition of observing Memorial Day had begun one hundred years prior in Waterloo, New York. The legitimacy of this claim has been called into question by several scholars.\n\n**Early National History**\n\nIn April 1865, following Lincoln's assassination, commemorations were extensive. The more than 600,000 soldiers of both sides who fought and died in the Civil War meant that burial and memorialization took on new cultural significance. Under the leadership of women during the war, an increasingly formal practice of decorating graves had taken shape. In 1865, the federal government also began creating the United States National Cemetery System for the Union war dead.\n\n**Confederate Memorial Day**\n\nIn 1868, some Southern public figures began adding the label \"Confederate\" to their commemorations and claimed that Northerners had appropriated the holiday. The first official celebration of Confederate Memorial Day as a public holiday occurred in 1874, following a proclamation by the Georgia legislature. By 1916, ten states celebrated it, on June 3, the birthday of CSA President Jefferson Davis. Other states chose late April dates, or May 10, commemorating Davis' capture.\n\n**Renaming**\n\nBy the 20th century, various Union memorial traditions, celebrated on different days, merged, and Memorial Day eventually extended to honor all Americans who fought and died while in the U.S. military service. Indiana from the 1860s to the 1920s saw numerous debates on how to expand the celebration. It was a favorite lobbying activity of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). An 1884 GAR handbook explained that Memorial Day was \"the day of all days in the G.A.R. Calendar\" in terms of mobilizing public support for pensions. It advised family members to \"exercise great care\" in keeping the veterans sober.\n\n**Civil Religious Holiday**\n\nMemorial Day endures as a holiday which most businesses observe because it marks the unofficial beginning of summer (Labor Day is the unofficial end of summer). The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW) advocated returning to the original date. The VFW stated in 2002, \"We have a sacred duty to remember and honor the sacrifices of those who have given their last full measure of devotion to our country.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete

period of heightened political polarization and social unrest. The phrase has since become a rallying cry for critics of President Joe Biden, with some using it to express their opposition to his policies and leadership. However, the phrase has also taken on a life of its own, with many people using it in a more satirical or ironic manner to poke fun at the original meaning.\n\n**Origins**\n\nIn early September 2021, chants of \"Fuck Joe Biden\" were reported to have broken out in several college football games in the Southern United States. Later that month, the phenomenon spread to other universities, including the University of Wyoming. Similar anti-Biden chants took place during the September 2021 Ryder Cup.\n\n**Background: Anti-Biden Chants**\n\nThe anti-Biden chants were a response to the growing discontent with the president's leadership and policies. Many people felt that Biden was not adequately addressing the country's problems, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy. The chants were often accompanied by signs and banners with anti-Biden messages, and some people even went so far as to burn Biden's campaign merchandise.\n\n**Initial Use**\n\nOn October 2, 2021, racing driver Brandon Brown was being interviewed by NBC Sports reporter Kelli Stavast at the Talladega Superspeedway in Lincoln, Alabama. Brown had just won the NASCAR Xfinity Series victory in the 2021 Sparks 300, and the crowd was celebrating his win. However, some people in the crowd began chanting \"Fuck Joe Biden,\" and this became audible to viewers of the broadcast. Stavast, who was wearing a headset, stated, \"You can hear the chants from the crowd, 'Let's go, Brandon!'\" This was likely a misunderstanding of the chant, as the crowd was actually chanting a profanity about Biden.\n\n**Early Spread and Reactions**\n\nFootage of the interview went viral, leading to the adoption of the phrase by critics of President Biden as an expression of antipathy toward him. Some people used the phrase to express their opposition to Biden's policies, while others used it in a more satirical or ironic manner. The phrase quickly spread across social media, with many people sharing memes and jokes about it.\n\n**Usage**\n\nThe phrase \"Let's Go Brandon\" has been used in a variety of contexts, including politics, sports, and entertainment. Some people use it as a rallying cry for their opposition to Biden, while others use it as a way to poke fun at the original meaning. The phrase has also been used in music, with several artists releasing songs with the title \"Let's Go Brandon.\"\n\n**Linguistic Analysis**\n\nLinguist John McWhorter has analyzed the linguistic attributes of the chant, likening the use of \"Brandon\" to a hlonipha – a substitution of a forbidden word. He wrote that the anti-Biden euphemism has a similar tone to the word SNAFU, which stands for \"Situation Normal – All Fucked Up,\" or to the word \"cuckservatives\" (a portmanteau of \"cuckold\" and \"conservatives\") which is used by some nationalists or paleoconservatives to describe neoconservatives perceived as being in fact liberals.\n\n**Politics**\n\nRepublican politicians have used the phrase publicly, with some even incorporating it into their speeches and social media posts. Texas Governor Greg Abbott used the phrase in an October 22 tweet, attributing the popularity of the phrase to frustration with Biden's \"disastrous policies,\" including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the southern border. Senator Ted Cruz posed with a \"Let's Go Brandon\" sign that was hung in Houston at the 2021 World Series.\n\n**Music**\n\nSoon after the chant went viral, an anti-Biden rap song called \"Let's Go Brandon\" was recorded by Loza Alexander.

On December 30, 2021, LGBcoin announced that it would be sponsoring Brandon Brown's Brandonbilt Motorsports for the 2022 NASCAR Xfinity Series season.

{"title": "Stoneman_Douglas_High_School_shooting", "content": "\nShooting\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72 km) northwest of Miami [19] [20] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver [21] at 2:19 p.m., [22] 20 minutes before dismissal time [23] [24] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case [25] and a backpack [26] An AR-15–style semi-automatic rifle [note 3] and multiple magazines were concealed within the backpack [29] He was spotted and recognized by a campus monitor who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12 [30] [31] The campus monitor did not declare a Code Red lockdown and sent a radio message to a colleague inside Building 12, which Cruz had entered The school's policies did not specify clearly who could order a lockdown, and staff had been trained not to order a lockdown unless they saw a gun or heard shots being fired [note 4] Cruz entered Building 12, [note 5] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers, at approximately 2:21 p.m [34]\n\n\nArrest\nAt about 3:41 p.m., police stopped Cruz 2 miles (3.2 km) from the school in the Wyndham Lakes neighborhood of Coral Springs and arrested him as the suspected shooter [47] [41] [1] [48] He was then taken to a hospital emergency room with \"labored breathing.\" [note 6] After 40 minutes, Cruz was released back into police custody and booked into the Broward County Jail [22] [49]\n\n\nVictims\nSeventeen people were killed, and seventeen more were wounded [57] [58] Three of the wounded remained in a critical condition the day after the shooting, [59] and one remained by the second day [60]\n\n\nFatalities\nFourteen of the fatalities died inside the building; three others died in or en route to the hospital [61]\n\n\nInjuries and survivors\nSixteen students and one teacher were wounded in the shooting The last victim to remain hospitalized, 15-year-old Anthony Borges, was discharged from hospital on April 4 [72] [73] Dubbed \"the real Iron Man\", Borges was shot five times after he used his body to barricade the door of a classroom where twenty students were inside [72] [74] [75] Upon his release, Borges issued a statement that criticized the actions of Broward Sheriff's deputies, Sheriff Scott Israel, and School Superintendent Robert Runcie His family has filed notice of its intent to sue the school district for personal injury to cover costs related to his recovery [76] [77] [78] Borges was honored with a humanitarian award at the 2018 BET Awards [79]\n\n\nPerpetrator\nNikolas Jacob Cruz was born on September 24, 1998, in Margate, Florida, [85] [86] [87] and was adopted at birth by Lynda and Roger Cruz [88] Both his adoptive parents

relatives and friends [91] At the time of the shooting, he was enrolled in a GED program and employed at a local Dollar Tree [92] [93]\n\n\nEarlier warnings to law enforcement\nSheriff Scott Israel said that his office received 23 calls about Cruz during the previous decade, but this figure is in dispute CNN used a public records request to obtain a sheriff's office log, which showed that from 2008 to 2017, at least 45 calls were made in reference to Cruz, his brother, or the family home [106] [107] On February 5, 2016, the calls included an anonymous tip that Cruz had threatened to shoot up the school, and a tip on November 30, 2017, that he might be a \"school shooter in the making\" and that he collected knives and guns On September 23, 2016, a peer counselor notified the school resource officer of his suicide attempt and intent to buy a gun, and the school indicated it would do a \"threat assessment\" [108] [109] [110]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022 [122] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022 [14] [15] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole [16] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation [17] [18] The unanimity required to impose the death penalty has since been overturned by a bill signed by Governor DeSantis, partly as a result of Cruz's sentencing [123]\n\n\nCriminal case\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized

DeSantis, partly as a result of Cruz's sentencing [123]\n\n\nCivil lawsuits\nOn May 23, 2018, the parents of victims Jaime Guttenberg and Alex Schachter sued firearm manufacturer American Outdoor Brands Corporation, formerly known as Smith & Wesson, the manufacturer of the rifle used by Cruz, and distributor Sunrise Tactical Supply, the retailer who sold Cruz the rifle, claiming damages due to \"the defendant's complicity in the entirely foreseeable, deadly use of the assault-style weapons that they place on the market\" [124]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn May 30, 2018, prosecutors released three videos that they claimed Cruz had recorded on his cellphone before the shooting In the videos, Cruz appears to describe his personal feelings, his enthusiasm and plan for the shooting, his hatred of people, and how it would make him notorious [131]\n\n\nSchool response\nThe school district provided grief counseling to students and their families Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said that funeral and counseling fees would be paid for by the state [132]\n\n\nGraduation ceremony\nThe school held its graduation ceremony on June 3, 2018, and diplomas were presented to the families of Nicholas Dworet, Joaquin Oliver, Meadow Pollack, and Carmen Schentrup, four seniors who were killed in the attack [142] Stoneman Douglas principal Ty Thompson began by dedicating the ceremony to

their late classmates Families of the victims also made statements; the mother of Joaquin Oliver accepted his diploma wearing a shirt saying \"This should be my son\" [144] Talk show host Jimmy Fallon made a surprise appearance and gave a commencement speech to the graduating class, thanking them for their courage and bravery [145]\n\n\nFirst anniversary\nOn the first anniversary of the incident, the school opted to establish a voluntary attendance day, organizing a day of community service with early dismissal so that the school was closed at the time of the attack A police line was created to shelter those students who chose to attend The large, planned project for the day was to replace the memorial with a permanent memorial garden [146] A planned moment of silence at 10:17 am ET was held, with support provided from grief counselors and therapy dogs An interfaith memorial service was planned in a separate location [147]\n\n\nOfficer inactivity\nSRO Scot Peterson, who was armed, on-site and in uniform [148] as a Broward Sheriff's Office deputy, was accused of remaining outside Building 12 during the shooting Eight days after the attack, he was suspended without pay by Sheriff Israel, and he immediately retired Sheriff Israel said \"Scot Peterson was absolutely on campus for this entire event\", and that he should have \"gone in, addressed the killer,  [and] killed the killer\" [107] [149] [150]\n\n\nBuilding\nThe building where the shooting occurred was permanently closed, and it served as evidence at the subsequent murder trial Demolition of the structure began on June 14, 2024 and concluded by July 8 The site will be covered with sod until plans for the site are finalized Debby Hixon, a school board member whose husband was among those killed told reporters

not to offer condolences but to take action to prevent more students from being killed in school shootings These students have demanded stricter gun control measures [198] [199] Survivor X González was noted for their speech that rebuked thoughts and prayers from politicians [200] [201] They later helped lead a protest movement against gun violence in the United States [202] Broward County Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said, \"now is the time to have a real conversation about gun control legislation.\" [203] [204] Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter was killed in the shooting, implored Trump to do something to improve school safety [205]\n\n\nState law\nIn March 2018, the Florida Legislature passed a bill titled the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act It raised the minimum age for buying rifles to 21, established waiting periods and background checks, provided a program for the arming of some school employees and hiring of school police, banned bump stocks,

available to help the victims of the Parkland shooting [243]\n\n\nConspiracy theories, disinformation, and harassment\nAnti-gun control conspiracy theories circulated in the wake of the shooting The speculation included false claims that the shooting did not happen or was staged by \"crisis actors\" [247] [248] [249] One such claim was made by Benjamin A Kelly, a district secretary for Republican

the backpack [29] He was spotted and recognized by a campus monitor who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12 [30] [31] The campus monitor did not declare a Code Red lockdown and sent a radio message to a colleague inside Building 12, which Cruz had entered The school's policies did not specify clearly who could order a lockdown, and staff had been trained not to order a lockdown unless they saw a gun or heard shots being fired [note 4] Cruz entered Building 12, [note 5] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers, at approximately 2:21 p.m [34]\n\n\nArrest\nAt about 3:41 p.m., police stopped Cruz 2 miles (3.2 km) from the school in the Wyndham Lakes neighborhood of Coral Springs and arrested him as the suspected shooter [47] [41] [1] [48] He was then taken to a hospital emergency room with \"labored breathing.\" [note 6] After 40 minutes, Cruz was released back into police custody and booked into the Broward County Jail [22] [49]\n\n\nVictims\nSeventeen people were killed, and seventeen more were wounded [57] [58] Three of the wounded remained in a critical condition

Cruz during the previous decade, but this figure is in dispute CNN used a public records request to obtain a sheriff's office log, which showed that from 2008 to 2017, at least 45 calls were made in reference to Cruz, his brother, or the family home [106] [107] On February 5, 2016, the calls included an anonymous tip that Cruz had threatened to shoot up the school, and a tip on November 30, 2017, that he might be a \"school shooter in the making\" and that he collected knives and guns On September 23, 2016, a peer counselor notified the school resource officer of his suicide attempt and intent to buy a gun, and the school indicated it would do a \"threat assessment\" [108] [109] [110]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022 [122] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022 [14] [15] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole [16] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation [17] [18] The unanimity required to impose the death penalty has since been overturned by a bill signed by Governor DeSantis,

of the assault-style weapons that they place on the market\" [124]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn May 30, 2018, prosecutors released three videos that they claimed Cruz had recorded on his cellphone before the

the shooting did not happen or was staged by \"crisis actors\" [247] [248] [249] One such claim was made by Benjamin A Kelly, a district secretary for Republican State Representative Shawn Harrison, who sent an email to the Tampa Bay Times falsely stating that the children in the picture were not students at the school [247] As a result of the backlash, Kelly was fired hours later [247] Former

ball; [269] [270] he was also deployed in a more advanced role, where he usually functioned as a second striker, as he often dropped into deeper positions, from which he could link the midfield with the attack and initiate passing moves [268] He even played as a centre-forward on occasion, seemingly operating as a lone striker, but actually operating false 9 role [271] An elegant left-footed

delivery from set-pieces, [267] [274] [275] [276] [277] which allowed him to get into good attacking positions, create chances, and provide many assists for his teammates, or even score goals himself

Ulrich) was the Emperor of Russia from 1762 until his overthrow and death in 1762. He was a member of the House of Holstein-Gottorp and a grandson of Charles XI of Sweden.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPeter was born in Kiel, in the duchy of Holstein-Gottorp, on February 21, 1728. His parents were Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia. Charles Frederick was a grandson of Charles XI of Sweden, and Anna was a daughter of the Russian monarchs Peter the Great and Catherine I. Peter's mother died shortly after his birth, and his father died in 1739, when Peter was just 11 years old. He became Duke of Holstein-Gottorp as Charles Peter Ulrich.\n\n**Character**\n\nThe classical view of Peter's character is mainly drawn from the memoirs of his wife and successor, Catherine the Great. She described him as an \"idiot\" and as a \"drunkard from Holstein\", and even his idol, Frederick the Great, mentioned him by saying \"he allowed himself to be dethroned like a child sent off to bed\". These descriptions paint a picture of Peter as weak-willed and inept, unable to hold his own in the affairs of state.\n\n**Reign**\n\nAfter Peter succeeded to the Russian throne on January 5, 1762, he withdrew Russian forces from the Seven Years' War and concluded a peace treaty with Prussia on May 5, 1762. This dramatic shift in policy handed the initiative to Frederick the Great, who recaptured southern Silesia and forced Austria to the negotiating table. Peter's decision to ally with Prussia was seen as a betrayal by many of his subjects, and it ultimately led to his downfall.\n\n**Foreign Policy**\n\nPeter's foreign policy was marked by a series of disastrous decisions. He gave up Russian conquests in Prussia and offered 12,000 troops to make an alliance with Frederick II of Prussia. This move was seen as a betrayal by many of his subjects, and it ultimately led to his downfall. Peter's decision to switch sides in the war with Prussia was a major blow to Russia's relations with its European neighbors.\n\n**Domestic Reforms**\n\nDuring his short reign, Peter passed 220 new laws that he had developed and elaborated during his life as a crown prince. These reforms were of a democratic nature, and they included the proclamation of religious freedom. Writer Elena Palmer claims that Peter's reforms were a major step forward for Russia, and that they paved the way for the country's future development.\n\n**Overthrow and Death**\n\nPeter was still asleep at Oranienbaum, the royal residence, while Catherine gained support of the military with the help of Grigori Orlov and his four brothers.

While married, he had an affair with Margaret Whigham, later known as Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll.\n\n**RAF Career**\n\nAs a young man, the Duke came to the opinion that the future lay in aviation.

{"title": "Romania", "content": "\nEtymology\n\"Romania\" derives from the local name for Romanian (Romanian: român), which in turn derives from Latin romanus, meaning \"Roman\" or \"of Rome\" [15] This ethnonym for Romanians is first attested in the 16th century by Italian humanists travelling in Transylvania, Moldavia, and Wallachia [16] [17] [18] The oldest known surviving document written in Romanian that can be precisely dated, a 1521 letter known as the \"Letter of Neacșu from Câmpulung\", [19] is notable for including the first documented occurrence of Romanian in a country name: Wallachia is mentioned as Țara Rumânească.\n\n\nHistory\nHuman remains found in Peștera cu Oase (\"Cave with Bones\"), radiocarbon date from circa 40,000 years ago, and represent the oldest known Homo sapiens in Europe [20] Neolithic agriculture spread after the arrival of a mixed group of people from Thessaly in the 6th millennium BC [21] [22] Excavations near a salt spring at Lunca yielded the earliest evidence for salt exploitation in Europe; here salt production began between the 5th and 4th millennium BC [23] The first permanent settlements developed into \"proto-cities\", [24] which were larger than 320 hectares (800 acres) [25] [26]\n\n\nPrehistory\nHuman remains found in Peștera cu Oase (\"Cave with Bones\"), radiocarbon date from circa 40,000 years ago, and represent the oldest known Homo sapiens in Europe [20] Neolithic agriculture spread after the arrival of a mixed group of people from Thessaly in the 6th millennium BC [21] [22] Excavations near a salt spring at Lunca yielded the earliest evidence for salt exploitation in Europe; here salt production began between the 5th and 4th millennium BC [23] The first permanent settlements developed into \"proto-cities\", [24] which were larger than 320 hectares (800 acres) [25] [26]\n\n\nAntiquity\nGreek colonies established on the Black Sea coast in the 7th century BC became important centres of commerce with the local tribes [29] [30] Among the native peoples, Herodotus listed the Getae of the Lower Danube region, the Agathyrsi of Transylvania and the Syginnae of the plains along the river Tisza at the beginning of the 5th century BC [31] Centuries later, Strabo associated the Getae with the Dacians who dominated the lands along the southern Carpathian Mountains in the 1st century BC [32]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nThe Goths were expanding towards the Lower Danube from the 230s, forcing the native peoples to flee to the Roman Empire or to accept their suzerainty [49] [50] [51] The Goths' rule ended abruptly when the Huns invaded their territory in 376, causing new waves of migrations [49] [51] [52] The Huns forced the remnants of the local population into submission, but their empire collapsed in 454 [49] [53] The Gepids took possession of the former Dacia province [54] [55] Place names that are of Slavic origin abound in Romania, indicating that a significant Slavic-speaking population lived in the territory [56] The first Slavic groups settled in Moldavia and Wallachia in the 6th century, [57] in Transylvania around 600 [58] The nomadic Avars defeated the Gepids and established a powerful empire around 570 [49] [59] The Bulgars, who also came from the European Pontic steppe, occupied the Lower Danube region in 680 [49]\n\n\nEarly Modern Times and national awakening\nThe Kingdom of Hungary collapsed, and the Ottomans occupied parts of Banat and Crișana in 1541 [99] Transylvania and Maramureș, along with the rest of Banat and Crișana developed into a new state under Ottoman suzerainty, the Principality of Transylvania [100] Reformation spread and four denominations—Calvinism, Lutheranism, Unitarianism, and Roman Catholicism—were officially acknowledged in 1568 [101] The Romanians' Orthodox faith remained only tolerated, [101] although they made up more than one-third of the population, according to 17th-century estimations [102] [103]\n\n\nIndependence and monarchy\nThe Treaty of Paris put the Danubian Principalities under the collective guardianship of the Great Powers in 1856 [127] After special assemblies convoked in Moldavia and Wallachia urged the unification of the two principalities, the Great Powers did not prevent the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as their collective domnitor (or ruling prince) in January 1859 [130] The united principalities officially adopted the name Romania on 21 February 1862 [131] Cuza's government carried out a series of reforms, including the secularisation of the property of monasteries and agrarian reform, but a coalition of conservative and radical politicians forced him to abdicate in February 1866 [132] [133]\n\n\nWorld Wars and Greater Romania\nFearing Russian expansionism, Romania secretly joined the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy in 1883, but public opinion remained hostile to Austria-Hungary [141] [142] Romania seized Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War in 1913 [143] German and Austrian-Hungarian diplomacy supported Bulgaria during the war, bringing about a rapprochement between Romania and the Triple Entente of France, Russia and the United Kingdom [143] The country remained neutral when World War I broke out in 1914, but Prime Minister Ion I C Brătianu started negotiations with the Entente Powers [144] After they promised Austrian-Hungarian territories with a majority of ethnic Romanian population to Romania in the Treaty of Bucharest, Romania entered the war against the Central Powers in 1916 [144] [145] The German and Austrian-Hungarian troops defeated the Romanian army and occupied three-quarters of the country by early 1917 [146] After the October Revolution turned Russia from an ally into an enemy, Romania was forced to sign a harsh peace treaty with the Central Powers in May 1918, [147] but the collapse of Russia also enabled the union of Bessarabia with Romania [148] King Ferdinand again mobilised the Romanian army on behalf of the Entente Powers a day before Germany capitulated on 11 November 1918 [147]\n\n\nCommunism\nDuring the Soviet occupation of Romania, the communist-dominated government called for new elections in 1946, which they fraudulently won, with a fabricated 70% majority of the vote [187] Thus, they rapidly established themselves as the dominant political force [188] Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, a communist party leader imprisoned in 1933, escaped in 1944 to become Romania's first communist leader In February 1947, he and others forced King Michael I to abdicate and leave the country and proclaimed Romania a people's republic [189] [190] Romania remained under the direct military occupation and economic control of the USSR until the late 1950s During this period, Romania's vast natural resources were drained continuously by mixed Soviet-Romanian companies (SovRoms) set up for unilateral exploitative purposes [191] [192] [193]\n\n\nContemporary period\nAfter the 1989 revolution, the National Salvation Front (FSN), led by Ion Iliescu, took partial and superficial multi-party democratic and free market measures after seizing power as an ad interim governing body [204] [205] In March 1990, violent outbreaks went on in Târgu Mureș as a result of Hungarian oppression in the region In April 1990, a sit-in protest contesting the results of that year's legislative elections and accusing the FSN, including Iliescu, of being made up of former Communists and members of the Securitate grew rapidly to become what was called the Golaniad Peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by Iliescu This episode has been documented widely by both local [206] and foreign media, [207] and is remembered as the June 1990 Mineriad [208] [209]\n\n\nNATO and EU integration\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Romania developed closer ties with Western Europe and the United States, eventually joining NATO in 2004, and hosting the 2008 summit in Bucharest [221] The country applied in June 1993 for membership in the European Union and became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a full member on 1 January 2007 [222]\n\n\nGeography\nRomania is the largest country in Southeastern Europe and the twelfth-largest in Europe, having an area of 238,397 square kilometres (92,046 sq mi) [231]: 17  It lies between latitudes 43° and 49° N and longitudes 20° and 30° E The terrain is distributed roughly equally between mountains, hills, and plains The Carpathian Mountains dominate the centre of Romania, with 14 mountain ranges reaching above 2,000 m or 6,600 ft—the highest is Moldoveanu Peak at 2,544 m or 8,346 ft [231]: 11  They are surrounded by the Moldavian and Transylvanian plateaus, the Pannonian Plain and the Wallachian plains.\n\n\nClimate\nOwing to its distance from open sea and its position on the southeastern portion of the European continent, Romania has a climate that is continental, with four distinct seasons The average annual temperature is 11 °C (52 °F) in the south and 8 °C (46 °F) in the north [245] In summer, average maximum temperatures in Bucharest rise to 28 °C (82 °F), and temperatures over 35 °C (95 °F) are fairly common in the lower-lying areas of the country [246] In winter, the average maximum temperature is below 2 °C (36 °F) [246] Precipitation is average, with over 750 mm (30 in) per year only on the highest western mountains, while around Bucharest it drops to approximately 570 mm (22 in) [231]: 29 \nThere are some regional differences: in western sections, such as Banat, the climate is milder and has some Mediterranean influences; the eastern part of the country has a more pronounced continental climate In Dobruja, the Black Sea also exerts an influence over the region's climate [247]\n\n\nPolitics\nRomania is a semi-presidential representative democracy The country's head of government is the Prime Minister, who is responsible for directing the executive branch, implementing national policy, and overseeing the administration of government affairs [citation needed] The President is the head of state and holds a largely ceremonial role [citation needed] The President is responsible for foreign policy, signs decrees, approves laws, and appoints the Prime Minister The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislature [citation needed] The Economist Intelligence Unit rated Romania as a \"flawed democracy\" in 2023 Freedom House also considers Romania to be free [248] [249]\n\n\nGovernment\nRomania has a democratic, multi-party system, with legislative power vested in the government and the two chambers of the Parliament, more specifically the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature The latter is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms of five years and appoints the prime minister who in turn appoints the Council of Ministers The legislative branch of the government, collectively known as the Parliament (residing at the Palace of the Parliament), consists of two chambers (Senate and Chamber of Deputies) whose members are elected every four years by simple plurality [250] [251]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSince December 1989, Romania has pursued a policy of strengthening relations with the West in general, more specifically with the United States and the European Union, albeit with limited relations involving the Russian Federation It joined NATO on 29 March 2004, the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007, while it joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1972, and is a founding member of the World Trade Organization [255]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Romanian Armed Forces consist of land, air, and naval forces led by a Commander-in-chief under the supervision of the Ministry of National Defence, and by the president as the Supreme Commander during wartime The Armed Forces consist of approximately 55,000 reservists and 71,500 active military personnel—35,800 for land, 10,700 for air, 6,600 for naval forces, and 16,500 in other fields [264] Total defence spending in 2023 accounted for 2.44% of total national GDP, or approximately US$8.48 billion, [265] with a total of $9 billion intended to be spent until 2026 for modernisation and acquisition of new equipment [266] Conscription stopped in 2007, when Romania switched to a volunteer army.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nRomania is divided into 41 counties (județe) and the municipality of Bucharest Each county is administered by a county council, responsible for local affairs, as well as a prefect responsible for the administration of national affairs at the county level The prefect is appointed by the central government but cannot be a member of any political party [280] Each county is subdivided further into cities and communes, which have their own mayor and local council There are a total of 320 cities and 2,861 communes in Romania [231]: 17  A total of 103 of the larger cities have municipality status, which gives them greater administrative power over local affairs The municipality of Bucharest is a special case, as it enjoys a status on par to that of a county It is further divided into six sectors [231]: 6  and has a prefect, a general mayor (primar general), and a general city council.\n\n\nEconomy\nIn 2024, Romania has a GDP (PPP) of around $894 billion and a GDP per capita (PPP) of $47,203 [8] According to the World Bank, Romania is a high-income economy [284] According to Eurostat, Romania's GDP per capita (PPS) was 77% of the EU average (100%) in 2022, an increase from 44% in 2007 (the year of Romania's accession to the EU), making Romania one of the fastest growing economies in the EU [285]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nAccording to the Romania's National Institute of Statistics (INSSE), Romania's total road network was estimated in 2015 at 86,080 kilometres (53,488 mi) [298] The World Bank estimates the railway network at 22,298 kilometres (13,855 mi) of track, the fourth-largest railroad network in Europe [299] Romania's rail transport experienced a dramatic decline after 1989 and was estimated at 99 million passenger journeys in 2004, but has experienced a recent (2013) revival due to infrastructure improvements and partial privatisation of lines, [250] accounting for 45% of all passenger and freight movements in the country [250] Bucharest Metro, the only underground railway system, was opened in 1979 and measures 80.01 km (49.72 mi) with an average ridership in 2021 of 720,000 passengers during the workweek in the country  [300] There are sixteen international commercial airports in service today Over 12.8 million passengers flew through Bucharest's Henri Coandă International Airport in 2017 [301]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is a significant contributor to the Romanian economy, generating around 5% of GDP [312] The number of tourists has been rising steadily, reaching 9.33 million foreign tourists in 2016, according to the Worldbank [313] Tourism in Romania attracted €400 million in investments in 2005 [314] More than 60% of the foreign visitors in 2007 were from other EU countries [315] The popular summer attractions of Mamaia and other Black Sea Resorts attracted 1.3 million tourists in 2009 [316] [317]\n\n\nScience and technology\nHistorically, Romanian researchers and inventors have made notable contributions to several fields In the history of flight, Traian Vuia built the first airplane to take off under its own power [326] and Aurel Vlaicu built and flew some of the earliest successful aircraft, [327] while Henri Coandă discovered the Coandă effect of fluidics [328] Victor Babeș discovered more than 50 types of bacteria; [329] biologist Nicolae Paulescu developed an extract of the pancreas and showed that it lowers blood sugar in diabetic dogs, thus being significant in the history of insulin; [330] while Emil Palade received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology [331] Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesise amphetamine, and he also invented the procedure of separating valuable petroleum components with selective solvents [332]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2021 Romanian census, Romania's population was 19,053,815 [7] Like other countries in the region, its population is expected to decline gradually as a result of sub-replacement fertility rates and negative net migration rate According to the 2021 Romanian census, Romanians made up 89.33% of the population, Hungarians 6.05% and the Roma 3.44% of the population, [7] but many ethnicities are not recorded, as they do not have ID cards [345] International sources give higher figures for Roma than the official census [346] [347] [348] According to the Council of Europe, the Roma makes up 8.32% of the population [349] [failed verification] Hungarians constitute a majority in the counties of Harghita and Covasna Other minorities include Ukrainians, Germans, Turks, Lipovans, Aromanians, Tatars, and Serbs [350] In 1930, there were 745,421 Germans living in Romania, [351] but only about 36,000 remained in the country to this day [350] As of 2009 [update], there were also approximately 133,000 immigrants living in Romania, primarily from Moldova and China [224]\n\n\nLanguages\nLanguage frequency as spoken in Romania (2021 Census) [361]\n\n\nReligion\nRomania is a secular state and has no state religion An overwhelming majority of the population identify themselves as Christians At the country's 2021 census, [3] 73.86% of respondents identified as Orthodox Christians, with 73.42% belonging to the Romanian Orthodox Church Other denominations include Protestantism (6.22%), Roman Catholicism (3.89%), and Greek Catholicism (0.61%) From the remaining population 128,291 people belong to other Christian denominations or have another religion, which includes 58,335 Muslims (mostly of Turkish and Tatar ethnicity) and 2,707 Jewish (Jews once constituted 4% of the Romanian population—728,115 persons in the 1930 census) Additionally, 71,417 people are irreligious, 57,205 are atheist, 25,485 are agnostic, and 2,895,539 people chose to not declare their religion [3]\n\n\nUrbanisation\nAlthough 54.0% of the population lived in urban areas in 2011, [374] this percentage has been declining since 1996 [375] Counties with over 2⁄3  urban population are Hunedoara, Brașov and Constanța, while those with less than a third are Dâmbovița (30.06%) and Giurgiu and Teleorman [374] Bucharest is the capital and the largest city in Romania, with a population of over 1.7 million in 2021 [376] Its larger urban zone has a population of almost 2.2 million, [377] which are planned to be included into a metropolitan area up to 20 times the area of the city proper [378] [379] [380]\n\n\nEducation\nSince the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the Romanian educational system has been in a continuous process of reform that has received mixed criticism [382] In 2004, some 4.4 million individuals were enrolled in school Of these, 650,000 were in kindergarten (three-six years), 3.11 million in primary and secondary level, and 650,000 in tertiary level (universities) [383] In 2018, the adult literacy rate was 98.8% [384] Kindergarten is optional between three and five years Since 2020, compulsory schooling starts at age 5 with the last year of kindergarten (grupa mare) and is compulsory until twelfth grade [385] [386] Primary and secondary education is divided into 12 or 13 grades There is also a semi-legal, informal private tutoring system used mostly during secondary school, which prospered during the Communist regime [387]\n\n\nHealthcare\n\nRomania has a universal health care system Total health expenditures by the government are roughly 5% of GDP [394]\n\nCulture\nThe topic of the origin of Romanian culture began to be discussed by the end of the 18th century among the Transylvanian School scholars [400] Several writers rose to prominence in the 19th century, including: George Coșbuc, Ioan Slavici, Mihail Kogălniceanu, Vasile Alecsandri, Nicolae Bălcescu, Ion Luca Caragiale, Ion Creangă, and Mihai Eminescu, the later being considered the greatest and most influential Romanian poet, particularly for the poem Luceafărul [401]\n\n\nArts and monuments\nThe topic of the origin of Romanian culture began to be discussed by the end of the

Nicolae Bălcescu, Ion Luca Caragiale, Ion Creangă, and Mihai Eminescu, the later being considered the greatest and most influential Romanian poet, particularly for the poem Luceafărul [401]\n\n\nHolidays, traditions, and cuisine\nThere are 12 non-working public holidays, including the Great Union Day, celebrated on 1 December in commemoration of the 1918 union of Transylvania with Romania [423] Winter holidays include the Christmas and New Year festivities during which various unique folklore dances and games are common: plugușorul, sorcova, ursul, and capra [424] [425] The traditional Romanian dress that otherwise has largely fallen out of use during the 20th century, is a popular ceremonial vestment worn on these festivities, especially in rural areas [426] There are sacrifices of live pigs during Christmas and lambs during Easter that has required a special exemption from EU law after 2007 [427] In the Easter, traditions such as painting the eggs are very common On 1 March mărțișor gifting is featured, which is a tradition whereby females are gifted with a type of talisman that is given for good luck [428]\n\n\nMedia\nFootball is the most popular sport in

The country has a diverse geography, with mountains, hills, and plains covering about 90% of its territory. Romania is the 12th largest country in Europe and has a population of around 19 million people.\n\nEtymology\n\"Romania\" derives from the local name for Romanian (Romanian: român), which in turn derives from Latin romanus, meaning \"Roman\" or \"of Rome.\" This ethnonym for Romanians is first attested in the 16th century by Italian humanists traveling in Transylvania, Moldavia, and Wallachia. The oldest known surviving document written in Romanian that can be precisely dated is the 1521 letter known as the \"Letter of Neacșu from Câmpulung,\" which includes the first documented occurrence of Romanian in a country name: Wallachia is mentioned as Țara Rumânească.\n\nHistory\nHuman remains found in Peștera cu Oase (\"Cave with Bones\"), radiocarbon date from circa 40,000 years ago, and represent the oldest known Homo sapiens in Europe. Neolithic agriculture spread after the arrival of a mixed group of people from Thessaly in the 6th millennium BC. Excavations near a salt spring at Lunca yielded the earliest evidence for salt exploitation in Europe; here salt production began between the 5th and 4th millennium BC. The first permanent settlements developed into \"proto-cities,\" which were larger than 320 hectares (800 acres). These early settlements were established in the fertile plains of the Danube delta and in the valleys of the eastern Carpathian Mountains.\n\nPrehistory\nThe human remains found in Peștera cu Oase represent the oldest known Homo sapiens in Europe, dating back to around 40,000 years ago. The Danube Valley Civilization, which flourished in the 6th millennium BC, is considered one of the earliest complex societies in Europe. The civilization was characterized by the development of agriculture, husbandry, and the construction of fortified settlements. The first permanent settlements developed into \"proto-cities,\" which were larger than 320 hectares (800 acres).\n\nAntiquity\nGreek colonies established on the Black Sea coast in the 7th century BC became important centers of commerce with the local tribes. Among the native peoples, Herodotus listed the Getae of the Lower Danube region, the Agathyrsi of Transylvania, and the Syginnae of the plains along the river Tisza at the beginning of the 5th century BC. Centuries later, Strabo associated the Getae with the Dacians who dominated the lands along the southern Carpathian Mountains in the 1st century BC.\n\nMiddle Ages\nThe Goths were expanding towards the Lower Danube from the 230s, forcing the native peoples to flee to the Roman Empire or to accept their suzerainty. The Goths' rule ended abruptly when the Huns invaded their territory in 376, causing new waves of migrations. The Huns forced the remnants of the local population into submission, but their empire collapsed in 454. The Gepids took possession of the former Dacia province, and the Slavs, who had been migrating to the region since the 6th century, established themselves in the eastern parts of the country. The Bulgars, who also came from the European Pontic steppe, occupied the Lower Danube region in 680.\n\nEarly Modern Times and National Awakening\nThe Kingdom of Hungary collapsed, and the Ottomans occupied parts of Banat and Crișana in 1541. Transylvania and Maramureș, along with the rest of Banat and Crișana, developed into a new state under Ottoman suzerainty, the Principality of Transylvania. Reformation spread, and four denominations—Calvinism, Lutheranism, Unitarianism, and Roman Catholicism—were officially acknowledged in 1568. The Romanians' Orthodox faith remained only tolerated, although they made up more than one-third of the population, according to 17th-century estimations.\n\nIndependence and Monarchy\nThe Treaty of Paris put the Danubian Principalities under the collective guardianship of the Great Powers in 1856. After special assemblies convoked in Moldavia and Wallachia urged the unification of the two principalities, the Great Powers did not prevent the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as their collective domnitor (or ruling prince) in January 1859. The united principalities officially adopted the name Romania on 21 February 1862. Cuza's government carried out a series of reforms, including the secularization of the property of monasteries and agrarian reform, but a coalition of conservative and radical politicians forced him to abdicate in February 1866.\n\nWorld Wars and Greater Romania\nFearing Russian expansionism, Romania secretly joined the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy in 1883, but public opinion remained hostile to Austria-Hungary. Romania seized Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War in 1913. German and Austrian-Hungarian diplomacy supported Bulgaria during the war, bringing about a rapprochement between Romania and the Triple Entente of France, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The country remained neutral when World War I broke out in 1914, but Prime Minister Ion I C Brătianu started negotiations with the Entente Powers. After they promised Austrian-Hungarian territories with a majority of ethnic Romanian population to Romania in the Treaty of Bucharest, Romania entered the war against the Central Powers in 1916. The German and Austrian-Hungarian troops defeated the Romanian army and occupied three-quarters of the country by early 1917. After the October Revolution turned Russia from an ally into an enemy, Romania was forced to sign a harsh peace treaty with the Central Powers in May 1918, but the collapse of Russia also enabled the union of Bessarabia with Romania. King Ferdinand again mobilized the Romanian army on behalf of the Entente Powers a day before Germany capitulated on 11 November 1918.\n\nCommunism\nDuring the Soviet occupation of Romania, the communist-dominated government called for new elections in 1946, which they fraudulently won, with a fabricated 70% majority of the vote. Thus, they rapidly established themselves as the dominant political force. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, a communist party leader imprisoned in 1933, escaped in 1944 to become Romania's first communist leader. In February 1947, he and others forced King Michael I to abdicate and leave the country, and proclaimed Romania a people's republic. Romania remained under the direct military occupation and economic control of the USSR until the late 1950s. During this period, Romania's vast natural resources were drained continuously by mixed Soviet-Romanian companies (SovRoms) set up for unilateral exploitative purposes.\n\nContemporary Period\nAfter the 1989 revolution, the National Salvation Front (FSN), led by Ion Iliescu, took partial and superficial multi-party democratic and free market measures after seizing power as an ad interim governing body. In March 1990, violent outbreaks went on in Târgu Mureș as a result of Hungarian oppression in the region. In April 1990, a sit-in protest contesting the results of that year's legislative elections and accusing the FSN, including Iliescu, of being made up of former Communists and members of the Securitate grew rapidly to become what was called the Golaniad Peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by Iliescu. This episode has been documented widely by both local and foreign media, and is remembered as the June 1990 Mineriad.\n\nNATO and EU Integration\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Romania developed closer ties with Western Europe and the United States, eventually joining NATO in 2004, and hosting the 2008 summit in Bucharest. The country applied in June 1993 for membership in the European Union and became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a full member on 1 January 2007.\n\nGeography\nRomania is the largest country in Southeastern Europe and the twelfth-largest in Europe, with an area of 238,397 square kilometers (92,046 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 43° and 49° N and longitudes 20° and 30° E. The terrain is distributed roughly equally between mountains, hills, and plains. The Carpathian Mountains dominate the centre of Romania, with 14 mountain ranges reaching above 2,000 m or 6,600 ft—the highest is Moldoveanu Peak at 2,544 m or 8,346 ft. They are surrounded by the Moldavian and Transylvanian plateaus, the Pannonian Plain and the Wallachian plains.\n\nClimate\nOwing to its distance from open sea and its position on the southeastern portion of the European continent, Romania has a climate that is continental, with four distinct seasons. The average annual temperature is 11 °C (52 °F) in the south and 8 °C (46 °F) in the north. In summer, average maximum temperatures in Bucharest rise to 28 °C (82 °F), and temperatures over 35 °C (95 °F) are fairly common in the lower-lying areas of the country. In winter, the average maximum temperature is below 2 °C (36 °F). Precipitation is average, with over 750 mm (30 in) per year only on the highest western mountains, while around Bucharest it drops to approximately 570 mm (22 in). There are some regional differences: in western sections, such as Banat, the climate is milder and has some Mediterranean influences; the eastern part of the country has a more pronounced continental climate. In Dobruja, the Black Sea also exerts an influence over the region's climate.\n\nPolitics\nRomania is a semi-presidential representative democracy. The country's head of government is the Prime Minister, who is responsible for directing the executive branch, implementing national policy, and overseeing the administration of government affairs. The President is the head of state and holds a largely ceremonial role. The President is responsible for foreign policy, signs decrees, approves laws, and appoints the Prime Minister. The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislature. The Economist Intelligence Unit rated Romania as a \"flawed democracy\" in 2023. Freedom House also considers Romania to be free.\n\nGovernment\nRomania has a democratic, multi-party system, with legislative power vested in the government and the two chambers of the Parliament, more specifically the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The latter is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms of five years and appoints the prime minister who in turn appoints the Council of Ministers. The legislative branch of the government, collectively known as the Parliament (residing at the Palace of the Parliament), consists of two chambers (Senate and Chamber of Deputies) whose members are elected every four years by simple plurality.\n\nForeign Relations\nSince December 1989, Romania has pursued a policy of strengthening relations with the West in general, more specifically with the United States and the European Union, albeit with limited relations involving the Russian Federation. Romania joined NATO on 29 March 2004, the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007, while it joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1972, and is a founding member of the World Trade Organization.\n\nMilitary\nThe Romanian Armed Forces consist of land, air, and naval forces led by a Commander-in-chief under the supervision of the Ministry of National Defence, and by the president as the Supreme Commander during wartime. The Armed Forces consist of approximately 55,000 reservists and 71,500 active military personnel—35,800 for land, 10,700 for air, 6,600 for naval forces, and 16,500 in other fields. Total defence spending in 2023 accounted for 2.44% of total national GDP, or approximately US$8.48 billion, with a total of $9 billion intended to be spent until 2026 for modernisation and acquisition of new equipment. Conscription stopped in 2007, when Romania switched to a volunteer army.\n\nAdministrative Divisions\nRomania is divided into 41 counties (județe) and the municipality of Bucharest. Each county is administered by a county council, responsible for local affairs, as well as a prefect responsible for the administration of national affairs at the county level. The prefect is appointed by the central government but cannot be a member of any political party. Each county is subdivided further into cities and communes, which have their own mayor and local council. There are a total of 320 cities and 2,861 communes in Romania. A total of 103 of the larger cities have municipality status, which gives them greater administrative power over local affairs. The municipality of Bucharest is a special case, as it enjoys a status on par to that of a county. It is further divided into six sectors and has a prefect, a general mayor (primar general), and a general city council.\n\nEconomy\nIn 2024, Romania has a GDP (PPP) of around $894 billion and a GDP per capita (PPP) of $47,203. According to the World Bank, Romania is a high-income economy. According to Eurostat, Romania's GDP per capita (PPS) was 77% of the EU average (100%) in 2022, an increase from 44% in 2007 (the year of Romania's accession to the EU), making Romania one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU.\n\nInfrastructure\nAccording to the Romania's National Institute of Statistics (INSSE), Romania's total road network was estimated in 2015 at 86,080 kilometers (53,488 mi). The World Bank estimates the railway network at 22,298 kilometers (13,855 mi) of track, the fourth-largest railroad network in Europe. Romania's rail transport experienced a dramatic decline after 1989 and was estimated at 99 million passenger journeys in 2004, but has experienced a recent (2013) revival due to infrastructure improvements and partial privatisation of lines, accounting for 45% of all passenger and freight movements in the country. Bucharest Metro, the only underground railway system, was opened in 1979 and measures 80.01 km (49.72 mi) with an average ridership in 2021 of 720,000 passengers during the workweek in the country. There are sixteen international commercial airports in service today. Over 12.8 million passengers flew through Bucharest's Henri Coandă International Airport in 2017.\n\nTourism\nTourism is a significant contributor to the Romanian economy, generating around 5% of GDP. The number of tourists has been rising steadily, reaching 9.33 million foreign tourists in 2016, according to the Worldbank. Tourism in Romania attracted €400 million in investments in 2005. More than 60% of the foreign visitors in 2007 were from other EU countries. The popular summer attractions of Mamaia and other Black Sea Resorts attracted 1.3 million tourists in 2009.\n\nScience and Technology\nHistorically, Romanian researchers and inventors have made notable contributions to several fields. In the history of flight, Traian Vuia built the first airplane to take off under its own power and Aurel Vlaicu built and flew some of the earliest successful aircraft, while Henri Coandă discovered the Coandă effect of fluidics. Victor Babeș discovered more than 50 types of bacteria, and biologist Nicolae Paulescu developed an extract of the pancreas and showed that it lowers blood sugar in diabetic dogs, thus being significant in the history of insulin. Emil Palade received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology. Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesise amphetamine and he also invented the procedure of separating valuable petroleum components with selective solvents.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2021 Romanian census, Romania's population was 19,053,815. Like other countries in the region, its population is expected to decline gradually as a result of sub-replacement fertility rates and negative net migration rate. According to the 2021 Romanian census, Romanians made up 89.33% of the population, Hungarians 6.05%, and the Roma 3.44% of the population, but many ethnicities are not recorded, as they do not have ID cards. International sources give higher figures for Roma than the official census. According to the Council of Europe, the Roma makes up 8.32% of the population. Hungarians constitute a majority in the counties of Harghita and Covasna. Other minorities include Ukrainians, Germans, Turks, Lipovans, Aromanians, Tatars, and Serbs. In 1930, there were 745,421 Germans living in Romania, but only about 36,000 remained in the country to this day. As of 2009, there were also approximately 133,000 immigrants living in Romania, primarily from Moldova and China.\n\nLanguages\nAccording to the 2021 Romanian census, the most spoken language at home was Romanian, spoken by 93.45% of the population, followed by Hungarian, spoken by 6.29%, and Roma, spoken by 3.51%. Other languages spoken at home included German, Ukrainian, Turkish, and Aromanian.\n\nReligion\nRomania is a secular state and has no state religion. An overwhelming majority of the population identify themselves as Christians. At the country's 2021 census, 73.86% of respondents identified as Orthodox Christians, with 73.42% belonging to the Romanian Orthodox Church. Other denominations include Protestantism, spoken by 6.22%, Roman Catholicism, spoken by 3.89%, and Greek Catholicism, spoken by 0.61%. From the remaining population, 128,291 people belong to other Christian denominations or have another religion, which includes 58,335 Muslims (mostly of Turkish and Tatar ethnicity) and 2,707 Jews (Jews once constituted 4% of the Romanian population—728,115 persons in the 1930 census). Additionally, 71,417 people are irreligious, 57,205 are atheist, 25,485 are agnostic, and 2,895,539 people chose to not declare their religion.\n\nUrbanisation\nAlthough 54.0% of the population lived in urban areas in 2011, this percentage has been declining since 1996. Counties with over 2/3 urban population are Hunedoara, Brașov, and Constanța, while those with less than a third are Dâmbovița (30.06%) and Giurgiu and Teleorman. Bucharest is the capital and the largest city in Romania, with a population of over 1.7 million in 2021. Its larger urban zone has a population of almost 2.2 million, which are planned to be included into a metropolitan area up to 20 times the area of the city proper.\n\nEducation\nSince the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the Romanian educational system has been in a continuous process of reform that has received mixed criticism. In 2004, some 4", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Romania\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\n\"Romania\" derives from the local name for Romanian

Iliescu, took partial and superficial multi-party democratic and free market measures after seizing power as an ad interim governing body [204] [205] In March 1990, violent outbreaks went on in Târgu Mureș as a result of Hungarian oppression in the region In April 1990, a sit-in protest contesting the results of that year's legislative elections and accusing the FSN, including Iliescu, of being made up of former Communists and members of the Securitate grew rapidly to become what was called the Golaniad Peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by Iliescu This episode has been documented widely by both local [206] and foreign media, [207] and is remembered as the June 1990 Mineriad [208] [209]\n\n\nNATO and EU integration\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Romania developed closer ties with Western Europe and the United States, eventually joining NATO in 2004, and hosting the 2008 summit in Bucharest [221] The country applied in June 1993 for membership in the European Union and became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a full member on 1 January 2007 [222]\n\n\nGeography\nRomania is the largest country in Southeastern Europe and the twelfth-largest in Europe, having an area of 238,397 square kilometres (92,046 sq mi) [231]: 17  It lies between latitudes 43° and 49° N and longitudes 20° and 30° E The terrain is distributed roughly equally between mountains, hills, and plains The Carpathian Mountains dominate the centre of Romania, with 14 mountain ranges reaching above 2,000 m or 6,600 ft—the highest is Moldoveanu Peak at 2,544 m or 8,346 ft [231]: 11  They are surrounded by the Moldavian and Transylvanian plateaus, the Pannonian Plain and the Wallachian plains.\n\n\nClimate\nOwing to its distance from open sea and its position on the southeastern portion of the European continent, Romania has a climate that is continental, with four distinct seasons The average annual temperature is 11 °C (52 °F) in the south and 8 °C (46 °F) in the north [245] In summer, average maximum temperatures in Bucharest rise to 28 °C (82 °F), and temperatures over 35 °C (95 °F) are fairly common in the lower-lying areas of the country [246] In winter, the average maximum temperature is below 2 °C (36 °F) [246] Precipitation is average, with over 750 mm (30 in) per year only on the highest western mountains, while around Bucharest it drops to approximately 570 mm (22 in) [231]: 29 \nThere are some regional differences: in western sections, such as Banat, the climate is milder and has some Mediterranean influences; the eastern part of the country has a more pronounced continental climate In Dobruja, the Black Sea also exerts an influence over the region's climate [247]\n\n\nPolitics\nRomania is a semi-presidential representative democracy The country's head of government is the Prime Minister, who is responsible for directing the executive branch, implementing national policy, and overseeing the administration of government affairs [citation needed] The President is the head of state and holds a largely ceremonial role [citation needed] The President is responsible for foreign policy, signs decrees, approves laws, and appoints the Prime Minister The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislature [citation needed] The Economist Intelligence Unit rated Romania as a \"flawed democracy\" in 2023 Freedom House also considers Romania to be free [248] [249]\n\n\nGovernment\nRomania has a democratic, multi-party system, with legislative power vested in the government and the two chambers of the Parliament, more specifically the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature The latter is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms of five years and appoints the prime minister who in turn appoints the Council of Ministers The legislative branch of the government, collectively known as the Parliament (residing at the Palace of the Parliament), consists of two chambers (Senate and Chamber of Deputies) whose members are elected every four years by simple plurality [250] [251]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSince December 1989, Romania has pursued a policy of strengthening relations with the West in general, more specifically with the United States and the European Union, albeit with limited relations involving the Russian Federation It joined NATO on 29 March 2004, the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007, while it joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1972, and is a founding member of the World Trade Organization [255]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Romanian Armed Forces consist of land, air, and naval forces led by a Commander-in-chief under the supervision of the Ministry of National Defence, and by the president as the Supreme Commander during wartime The Armed Forces consist of approximately 55,000 reservists and 71,500 active military personnel—35,800 for land, 10,700 for air, 6,600 for naval forces, and 16,500 in other fields [264] Total defence spending in 2023 accounted for 2.44% of total national GDP, or approximately US$8.48 billion, [265] with a total of $9 billion intended to be spent until 2026 for modernisation and acquisition of new equipment [266] Conscription stopped in 2007, when Romania switched to a volunteer army.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nRomania is divided into 41 counties (județe) and the municipality of Bucharest Each county is administered by a county council, responsible for local affairs, as well as a prefect responsible for the administration of national affairs at the county level The prefect is appointed by the central government but cannot be a member of any political party [280] Each county is subdivided further into cities and communes, which have their own mayor and local council There are a total of 320 cities and 2,861 communes in Romania [231]: 17  A total of 103 of the larger cities have municipality status, which gives them greater administrative power over local affairs The municipality of Bucharest is a special case, as it enjoys a status on par to that of a county It is further divided into six sectors [231]: 6  and has a prefect, a general mayor (primar general), and a general city council.\n\n\nEconomy\nIn 2024, Romania has a GDP (PPP) of around $894 billion and a GDP per capita (PPP) of $47,203 [8] According to the World Bank, Romania is a high-income economy [284] According to Eurostat, Romania's GDP per capita (PPS) was 77% of the EU average (100%) in 2022, an increase from 44% in 2007 (the year of Romania's accession to the EU), making Romania one of the fastest growing economies in the EU [285]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nAccording to the Romania's National Institute of Statistics (INSSE), Romania's total road network was estimated in 2015 at 86,080 kilometres (53,488 mi) [298] The World Bank estimates the railway network at 22,298 kilometres (13,855 mi) of track, the fourth-largest railroad network in Europe [299] Romania's rail transport experienced a dramatic decline after 1989 and was estimated at 99 million passenger journeys in 2004, but has experienced a recent (2013) revival due to infrastructure improvements and partial privatisation of lines, [250] accounting for 45% of all passenger and freight movements in the country [250] Bucharest Metro, the only underground railway system, was opened in 1979 and measures 80.01 km (49.72 mi) with an average ridership in 2021 of 720,000 passengers during the workweek in the country  [300] There are sixteen international commercial airports in service today Over 12.8 million passengers flew through Bucharest's Henri Coandă International Airport in 2017 [301]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is a significant contributor to the Romanian economy, generating around 5% of GDP [312] The number of tourists has been rising steadily, reaching 9.33 million foreign tourists in 2016, according to the Worldbank [313] Tourism in Romania attracted €400 million in investments in 2005 [314] More than 60% of the foreign visitors in 2007 were from other EU countries [315] The popular summer attractions of Mamaia and other Black Sea Resorts attracted 1.3 million tourists in 2009 [316] [317]\n\n\nScience and technology\nHistorically, Romanian researchers and inventors have made notable contributions to several fields In the history of flight, Traian Vuia built the first airplane to take off under its own power [326] and Aurel Vlaicu built and flew some of the earliest successful aircraft, [327] while Henri Coandă discovered the Coandă effect of fluidics [328] Victor Babeș discovered more than 50 types of bacteria; [329] biologist Nicolae Paulescu developed an extract of the pancreas and showed that it lowers blood sugar in diabetic dogs, thus being significant in the history of insulin; [330] while Emil Palade received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology [331] Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesise amphetamine, and he also invented the procedure of separating valuable petroleum components with selective solvents [332]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2021 Romanian census, Romania's population was 19,053,815 [7] Like other countries in the region, its population is expected to decline gradually as a result of sub-replacement fertility rates and negative net migration rate According to the 2021 Romanian census, Romanians made up 89.33% of the population, Hungarians 6.05% and the Roma 3.44% of the population, [7] but many ethnicities are not recorded, as they do not have ID cards [345] International sources give higher figures for Roma than the official census [346] [347] [348] According to the Council of Europe, the Roma makes up 8.32% of the population [349] [failed verification] Hungarians constitute a majority in the counties of Harghita and Covasna Other minorities include Ukrainians, Germans, Turks, Lipovans, Aromanians, Tatars, and Serbs [350] In 1930, there were 745,421 Germans living in Romania, [351] but only about 36,000 remained in the country to this day [350] As of 2009 [update], there were also approximately 133,000 immigrants living in Romania, primarily from Moldova and China [224]\n\n\nLanguages\nLanguage frequency as spoken in Romania (2021 Census) [361]\n\n\nReligion\nRomania is a secular state and has no state religion An overwhelming majority of the population

include Protestantism (6.22%), Roman Catholicism (3.89%), and Greek Catholicism (0.61%) From the remaining population 128,291 people belong to other Christian denominations or have another religion, which includes 58,335 Muslims (mostly of Turkish and Tatar ethnicity) and 2,707 Jewish (Jews once constituted 4% of the Romanian population—728,115 persons in the 1930 census) Additionally, 71,417 people are irreligious, 57,205 are atheist, 25,485 are agnostic, and 2,895,539 people chose to not declare their religion [3]\n\n\nUrbanisation\nAlthough 54.0% of the population lived in urban areas in 2011, [374] this percentage has been declining since 1996 [375] Counties with over 2⁄3  urban population are Hunedoara, Brașov and Constanța, while those with less than a third are Dâmbovița (30.06%) and Giurgiu and Teleorman [374] Bucharest is the capital and the largest city in Romania, with a population of over 1.7 million in 2021 [376] Its larger urban zone has a population of almost 2.2 million, [377] which are planned to be included into a metropolitan area up to 20 times the area of the city proper [378] [379] [380]\n\n\nEducation\nSince the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the Romanian educational system has been in a continuous process of reform that has received mixed criticism [382] In 2004, some 4.4 million individuals were enrolled in school Of these, 650,000 were in kindergarten (three-six years), 3.11 million in primary and secondary level, and 650,000 in tertiary level (universities) [383] In 2018, the adult literacy rate was 98.8% [384] Kindergarten is optional between three and five years Since 2020, compulsory schooling starts at age 5 with the last year of kindergarten (grupa mare) and is compulsory until twelfth grade [385] [386] Primary and secondary education is divided into 12 or 13 grades There is also a semi-legal, informal private tutoring system used mostly during secondary school, which prospered during the Communist regime [387]\n\n\nHealthcare\n\nRomania has a universal health care system Total health expenditures by the government are roughly 5% of GDP [394]\n\nCulture\nThe topic of the origin of Romanian culture began to be discussed by the end of the 18th century among the Transylvanian School scholars [400] Several writers rose to prominence in the 19th century, including: George Coșbuc, Ioan Slavici, Mihail Kogălniceanu, Vasile Alecsandri, Nicolae Bălcescu, Ion Luca Caragiale, Ion Creangă, and Mihai Eminescu, the later being considered the greatest and most influential Romanian poet, particularly

holidays, including the Great Union Day, celebrated on 1 December in commemoration of the 1918 union of Transylvania with Romania [423] Winter holidays include the Christmas and New Year festivities during which various unique folklore dances and games are common: plugușorul, sorcova, ursul, and capra [424] [425] The traditional Romanian dress that otherwise has largely fallen out of use during the 20th century, is a popular ceremonial vestment worn on these festivities, especially in rural areas [426] There are sacrifices of live pigs during Christmas and lambs during Easter that has required a special exemption from EU law after 2007 [427] In the Easter, traditions such as painting the eggs are very common On 1 March mărțișor gifting is featured, which is a tradition whereby females are gifted with a type of talisman that is given for good luck [428]\n\n\nMedia\nFootball is the most popular sport in Romania with over 219,000 registered players as of 2018 [update] The

though not outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC Thus, it was an \"empire\" (a great power) long before it had an emperor [21] The Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense,

power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium, meaning \"command\" (typically in a military sense) [26] Occasionally, successful consuls or generals were given the honorary title imperator (commander); this is the origin of the word emperor, since this title was always bestowed to the early emperors [27] [g]\n\n\nPax Romana\nThe 200 years that began with Augustus's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana (\"Roman Peace\") The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down \"mercilessly and swiftly\" [38] The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs The Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors—Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero—before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as the victor Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, followed by the Nerva–Antonine dynasty which produced the \"Five Good Emperors\": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius [39]\n\n\nTransition from classical to late antiquity\nIn the view of contemporary Greek historian Cassius Dio, the accession of Commodus in 180 marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\", [40] a comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the Empire's decline [41] [42]\n\n\nFall in the West and survival in the East\nThe Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 5th century The Romans fought off all invaders, most famously Attila, [48] but the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself [49] Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer [50] [51] [52]\n\n\nGeography and demography\nThe Roman Empire was one of the largest in history, with contiguous territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East [56] The Latin phrase imperium sine fine (\"empire without end\" [57]) expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire In Virgil's Aeneid, limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by Jupiter [58] This claim of universal dominion was renewed when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century [h] In addition to annexing large regions, the Romans directly altered their geography, for example cutting down entire forests [60]\n\n\nLanguages\nLatin and Greek were the main languages of the Empire, [i] but the Empire was deliberately multilingual [76] Andrew Wallace-Hadrill says \"The main desire of the Roman government was to make itself understood\" [77] At the start of the Empire, knowledge of Greek was useful to pass as educated nobility and knowledge of Latin was useful for a career in the military, government, or law [78] Bilingual inscriptions indicate the everyday interpenetration of the two languages [79]\n\n\nSociety\nThe Empire was remarkably multicultural, with \"astonishing cohesive capacity\" to create shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples [106] Public monuments and communal spaces open to all—such as forums, amphitheatres, racetracks and baths—helped foster a sense of \"Romanness\" [107]\n\n\nLegal status\nAccording to the jurist Gaius, the essential distinction in the Roman \"law of persons\" was that all humans were either free (liberi) or slaves (servi) [119] The legal status of free persons was further defined by their citizenship Most citizens held limited rights (such as the ius Latinum, \"Latin right\"), but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by non-citizens Free people not considered citizens, but living within the Roman world, were peregrini, non-Romans [120] In 212, the Constitutio Antoniniana extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire This legal egalitarianism required a far-reaching revision of existing laws that distinguished between citizens and non-citizens [121]\n\n\nWomen in Roman law\nFreeborn Roman women were considered citizens, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos (\"children born of two Roman citizens\") [j] A Roman woman kept her own family name (nomen) for life Children most often took the father's name, with some exceptions [124] Women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business [125] Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could hold considerable fortunes [126]\n\n\nSlaves and the law\nAt the time of Augustus, as many as 35% of the people in Roman Italy were slaves, [137] making Rome one of five historical \"slave societies\" in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy [k] [137] Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility [138] In urban settings, slaves might be professionals such as teachers, physicians, chefs, and accountants; the majority of slaves provided trained or unskilled labour Agriculture and industry, such as milling and mining, relied on the exploitation of slaves Outside Italy, slaves were on average an estimated 10 to 20% of the population, sparse in Roman Egypt but more concentrated in some Greek areas Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces [139] Although slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries, it remained an integral part of Roman society until gradually ceasing in the 6th and 7th centuries with the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy [140]\n\n\nFreedmen\nRome differed from Greek city-states in allowing freed slaves to become citizens; any future children of a freedman were born free, with full rights of citizenship After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed active political freedom (libertas), including the right to vote [157] His former master became his patron (patronus): the two continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other [158] [159] A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but could play a priestly role He could not marry a woman from a senatorial family, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law [159] The rise of successful freedmen—through political influence or wealth—is a characteristic of early Imperial society The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by inscriptions throughout the Empire.\n\n\nCensus rank\nThe Latin word ordo (plural ordines) is translated variously and inexactly into English as \"class, order, rank\" One purpose of the Roman census was to determine the ordo to which an individual belonged [160] Two of the highest ordines in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian Outside Rome, cities or colonies were led by decurions, also known as curiales [161]\n\n\nUnequal justice\nAs the republican principle of citizens' equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours (honestiores) and humbler folk (humiliores) In general, honestiores were the members of the three higher \"orders\", along with certain military officers [179] The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority affirmed, particularly within the justice system [180] Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative \"worth\" (dignitas) of the defendant: an honestior could pay a fine for a crime for which an humilior might receive a scourging [181]\n\n\nGovernment and military\nThe three major elements of the Imperial state were the central government, the military, and the provincial government [185] The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens, agricultural fields, and religious sites [186] The Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to rule through force alone Cooperation with local elites was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue The Romans often exploited internal political divisions [187]\n\n\nCentral government\nThe Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with divinely sanctioned authority (auctoritas) The rite of apotheosis (also called consecratio) signified the deceased emperor's deification [190] The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of powers from several republican offices [191] The emperor made himself the central religious authority as pontifex maximus, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders [192] While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate [193]\n\n\nMilitary\nAfter the Punic Wars, the Roman army comprised professional soldiers who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves The transition to a professional military began during the late Republic and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism, under which an army of conscript citizens defended the homeland against a specific threat The Romans expanded their war machine by \"organizing the communities that they conquered in Italy into a system that generated huge reservoirs of manpower for their army\" [205] By Imperial times, military service was a full-time career [206] The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of Romanization [207]\n\n\nProvincial government\nAn annexed territory became a Roman province in three steps: making a register of cities, taking a census, and surveying the land [217] Further government recordkeeping included births and deaths, real estate transactions, taxes, and juridical proceedings [218] In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the central government sent out around 160 officials annually to govern outside Italy [22] Among these officials were the Roman governors: magistrates elected at Rome who in the name of the Roman people governed senatorial provinces; or governors, usually of equestrian rank, who held their imperium on behalf of the emperor in imperial provinces, most notably Roman Egypt [219] A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed, but he could delegate various duties [220] His staff, however, was minimal: his official attendants (apparitores), including lictors, heralds, messengers, scribes, and bodyguards; legates, both civil and military, usually of equestrian rank; and friends who accompanied him unofficially [220]\n\n\nLaw\nRoman courts held original jurisdiction over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire, but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces Most parts of the Eastern Empire already had well-established law codes and juridical procedures [109] Generally, it was Roman policy to respect the mos regionis (\"regional tradition\" or \"law of the land\") and to regard local laws as a source of legal precedent and social stability [109] [223] The compatibility of Roman and local law was thought to reflect an underlying ius gentium, the \"law of nations\" or international law regarded as common and customary [224] If provincial law conflicted with Roman law or custom, Roman courts heard appeals, and the emperor held final decision-making authority [109] [223] [o]\n\n\nTaxation\nTaxation under the Empire amounted to about 5% of its gross product [226] The typical tax rate for individuals ranged from 2 to 5% [227] The tax code was \"bewildering\" in its complicated system of direct and indirect taxes, some paid in cash and some in kind Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as fisheries; they might be temporary [228] Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military, [229] and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty [230] In-kind taxes were accepted from less-monetized areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps [231]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Empire is best thought of as a network of regional economies, based on a form of \"political capitalism\" in which the state regulated commerce to assure its own revenues [235] Economic growth, though not comparable to modern economies, was greater than that of most other societies prior to industrialization [236] Territorial conquests permitted a large-scale reorganization of land use that resulted in agricultural surplus and specialization, particularly in north Africa [237] Some cities were known for particular industries The scale of urban building indicates a significant construction industry [237] Papyri preserve complex accounting methods that suggest elements of economic rationalism, [237] and the Empire was highly monetized [238] Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity, transportation in the 1st and 2nd centuries expanded greatly, and trade routes connected regional economies [239] The supply contracts for the army drew on local suppliers near the base (castrum), throughout the province, and across provincial borders [240]\nEconomic historians vary in their calculations of the gross domestic product during the Principate [241] In the sample years of 14, 100, and 150 AD, estimates of per capita GDP range from 166 to 380 HS The GDP per capita of Italy is estimated as 40 [242] to 66% [243] higher than in the rest of the Empire, due to tax transfers from the provinces and the concentration of elite income.\n\n\nCurrency and banking\nThe early Empire was monetized to a near-universal extent, using money as a way to express prices and debts [247] The sestertius (English \"sesterces\", symbolized as HS) was the basic unit of reckoning value into the 4th century, [248] though the silver denarius, worth four sesterces, was also used beginning in the Severan dynasty [249] The smallest coin commonly circulated was the bronze as, one-tenth denarius [250] Bullion and ingots seem not to have counted as pecunia (\"money\") and were used only on the frontiers Romans in the first and second centuries counted coins, rather than weighing them—an indication that the coin was valued on its face This tendency towards fiat money led to the debasement of Roman coinage in the later Empire [251] The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and market integration [247] The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the money supply for trading or saving [252]\nRome had no central bank, and regulation of the banking system was minimal Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers' deposits A typical bank had fairly limited capital, and often only one principal Seneca assumes that anyone involved in Roman commerce needs access to credit [251] A professional deposit banker received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term, and lent money to third parties The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, both as creditors and borrowers [253] The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party, without cash changing hands Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked documentary transactions, the system of banks throughout the Empire permitted the exchange of large sums without physically transferring coins, in part because of the risks of moving large amounts of cash Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire, in 33 AD; [254] generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers [251] The central government itself did not borrow money, and without public debt had to fund deficits from cash reserves [255]\n\n\nMining and metallurgy\nThe main mining regions of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula (silver, copper, lead, iron and gold); [4] Gaul (gold, silver, iron); [256] Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), [257] the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); [258] Macedonia and Thrace (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin) Intensive large-scale mining—of alluvial deposits, and by means of open-cast mining and underground mining—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production [citation needed]\n\n\nTransportation and communication\nThe Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean, which they called \"our sea\" (Mare Nostrum) [267] Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean as well as major rivers [69] Transport by water was preferred where possible, as moving commodities by land was more difficult [268] Vehicles, wheels, and ships indicate the existence of a great number of skilled woodworkers [269]\n\n\nTrade and commodities\nRoman provinces traded among themselves, but trade extended outside the frontiers to regions as far away as China and India [273] Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middle men along the Silk Road; Indian trade also occurred by sea from Egyptian ports The main commodity was grain [274] Also traded were olive oil, foodstuffs, garum (fish sauce), slaves, ore and manufactured metal objects, fibres and textiles, timber, pottery, glassware, marble, papyrus, spices and materia medica, ivory, pearls, and gemstones [275] Though most provinces could produce wine, regional varietals were desirable and wine was a central trade good [276]\n\n\nLabour and occupations\nInscriptions record 268 different occupations in Rome and 85 in Pompeii [211] Professional associations or trade guilds (collegia) are attested for a wide range of occupations, some quite specialized [179]\n\n\nArchitecture and engineering\nThe chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch, vault and dome Some Roman structures still stand today, due in part to sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete [284] Roman temples developed Etruscan and Greek forms, with some distinctive elements Roman roads are considered the most advanced built until the early 19th century [citation needed]\n\n\nDaily life\nThe city was viewed as fostering civilization by being \"properly designed, ordered, and adorned\" [293] Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology, and reorganized the city into neighbourhoods (vici) administered at the local level with police and firefighting services [294] A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the Campus Martius, an open area outside the city centre: the Altar of Augustan Peace (Ara Pacis Augustae) was located there, as was an obelisk imported from Egypt that formed the pointer (gnomon) of a horologium With its public gardens, the Campus was among the most attractive places in Rome to visit [294]\n\n\nCity and country\nThe city was viewed as fostering civilization by being \"properly designed, ordered, and adorned\" [293] Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology, and reorganized the city into neighbourhoods (vici) administered at the local level with police and firefighting services [294] A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the Campus Martius, an open area outside the city centre: the Altar of Augustan Peace (Ara Pacis Augustae) was located there, as was an obelisk imported from Egypt that formed the pointer (gnomon) of a horologium With its public gardens, the Campus was among the most attractive places in Rome to visit [294]\n\n\nHealth and disease\nEpidemics were common in the ancient world, and occasional pandemics in the Empire killed millions The Roman population was unhealthy About 20 percent—a large percentage by ancient standards—lived in cities, Rome being the largest The cities were a \"demographic sink\": the death rate exceeded the birth rate and constant immigration was necessary to maintain the population Average lifespan is estimated at the mid-twenties, and perhaps more than half of children died before reaching adulthood Dense urban populations and poor sanitation contributed to disease Land and sea connections facilitated and sped the transfer of infectious diseases across the empire's territories The rich were not immune; only two of emperor Marcus Aurelius's fourteen children are known to have reached adulthood [321]\n\n\nFood and dining\nMost apartments in Rome lacked kitchens, though a charcoal brazier could be used for rudimentary cookery [324] Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars, inns, and food stalls (tabernae, cauponae, popinae, thermopolia) [325] Carryout and restaurants were for the lower classes; fine dining appeared only at dinner parties in wealthy homes with a chef (archimagirus) and kitchen staff, [326] or banquets hosted by social clubs (collegia) [327]\n\n\nSpectacles\nWhen Juvenal complained that the Roman people had exchanged their political liberty for \"bread and circuses\", he was referring to the state-provided grain dole and the circenses, events held in the entertainment venue called a circus The largest such venue in Rome was the Circus Maximus, the setting of horse races, chariot races, the equestrian Troy Game, staged beast hunts (venationes), athletic contests, gladiator combat, and historical re-enactments From earliest times, several religious festivals had featured games (ludi), primarily horse and chariot races (ludi circenses) [343] The races retained religious significance in connection with agriculture, initiation, and the cycle of birth and death [s]\n\n\nRecreation\nThe singular ludus, \"play, game, sport, training\", had a wide range of meanings such as \"word play\", \"theatrical performance\", \"board game\", \"primary school\", and even \"gladiator training school\" (as in Ludus Magnus) [374] Activities for children and young people in the Empire included hoop rolling and knucklebones (astragali or \"jacks\") Girls had dolls made of wood, terracotta, and especially bone and ivory [375] Ball games include trigon and harpastum [376] People of all ages played board games, including latrunculi (\"Raiders\") and XII scripta (\"Twelve Marks\") [377] A game referred to as alea (dice) or tabula (the board) may have been similar to backgammon [378] Dicing as a form of gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the festival of the Saturnalia [379]\n\n\nClothing\nIn a status-conscious society like that of the Romans, clothing and personal adornment indicated the etiquette of interacting with the wearer [384] Wearing the correct clothing reflected a society in good order [385] There is little direct evidence of how Romans dressed in daily life, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles are rare [386] [387]\n\n\nArts\nGreek art had a profound influence on Roman art [398] Public art—including sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coins—is often analysed for historical or ideological significance [399] In the private sphere, artistic objects were made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce [400] The wealthy advertised their appreciation of culture through artwork and decorative arts in their homes [401] Despite the value placed on art, even famous artists were of low social status, partly as they worked with their hands [402]\n\n\nPortraiture\nPortraiture, which survives mainly in sculpture, was the most copious form of imperial art Portraits during the Augustan period utilize classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism [403] Republican portraits were characterized by verism, but as early as the 2nd century BC, Greek heroic nudity was adopted for conquering generals [404] Imperial portrait sculptures may model a mature head atop a youthful nude or semi-nude body with perfect musculature [405] Clothed in the toga or military regalia, the body communicates rank or role, not individual characteristics [406]\n\n\nSculpture and sarcophagi\nExamples of Roman sculpture survive abundantly, though often in damaged or fragmentary condition, including freestanding statuary in marble, bronze and terracotta, and reliefs from public buildings and monuments Niches in amphitheatres were originally filled with statues, [408] [409] as were formal gardens [410] Temples housed cult images of deities, often by famed sculptors [411]\n\n\nPainting\nInitial Roman painting drew from Etruscan and Greek models and techniques Examples of Roman paintings can be found in palaces, catacombs and villas Much of what is known of Roman painting is from the interior decoration of private homes, particularly as preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius In addition to decorative borders and panels with geometric or vegetative motifs, wall painting depicts scenes from mythology and theatre, landscapes and gardens, spectacles, everyday life, and erotic art.\n\n\nMosaic\nMosaics are among the most enduring of Roman decorative arts, and are found on floors and other architectural features The most common is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass [417] Opus sectile is a related technique in which flat stone, usually coloured marble, is cut precisely into shapes from which geometric or figurative patterns are formed This more difficult technique became especially popular for luxury surfaces in the 4th century (e.g the Basilica of Junius Bassus) [418]\n\n\nDecorative arts\nDecorative arts for luxury consumers included fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels and implements, and glassware Pottery manufacturing was economically important, as were the glass and metalworking industries Imports stimulated new regional centres of production Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss pottery (terra sigillata) that was a major trade good in 1st-century Europe [420] Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century, Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass [421]\n\n\nPerforming arts\nIn Roman tradition, borrowed from the Greeks, literary theatre was performed by all-male troupes that used face masks with exaggerated facial expressions to portray emotion Female roles were played by men in drag (travesti) [422] Roman literary theatre tradition is represented in Latin literature by the tragedies of Seneca, for example.\n\n\nLiteracy, books, and education\nEstimates of the average literacy rate range from 5 to over 30% [436] [437] [438] The Roman obsession with documents and inscriptions indicates the value placed on the written word [439] [440] [u] Laws and edicts were posted as well as read out Illiterate Roman subjects could have a government scribe (scriba) read or write their official documents for them [437] [442] The military produced extensive written records [443] The Babylonian Talmud declared \"if all seas were ink, all reeds were pen, all skies parchment, and all men scribes, they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman government's concerns\" [444]\n\n\nEducation\nTraditional Roman education was moral and practical Stories were meant to instil Roman values (mores maiorum) Parents were expected to act as role models, and working parents passed their skills to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships [471] Young children were attended by a pedagogue, usually a Greek slave or former slave, [472] who kept the child safe, taught self-discipline and public behaviour, attended class and helped with tutoring [473]\n\n\nLiterature\nLiterature under Augustus, along with that of the Republic, has been viewed as the \"Golden Age\" of Latin literature, embodying classical ideals [501] The three most influential Classical Latin poets—Virgil, Horace, and Ovid—belong to this period Virgil's Aeneid was a national epic in the manner of the Homeric epics of Greece Horace perfected the use of Greek lyric metres in Latin verse Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of Augustan morality, contributing to his exile Ovid's Metamorphoses wove together Greco-Roman mythology; his versions of Greek myths became a primary source of later classical mythology, and his work was hugely influential on medieval literature [502] The early Principate produced satirists such as Persius and Juvenal.\n\n\nReligion\nThe Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success to their collective piety (pietas) and good relations with the gods (pax deorum) The archaic religion believed to have come from the earliest kings of Rome was the foundation of the mos maiorum, \"the way of the ancestors\", central to Roman identity [507]\n\n\nLegacy\nSeveral states claimed to be the Roman Empire's successor The Holy Roman Empire was established in 800 when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Roman emperor The Russian Tsardom, as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire's Orthodox Christian tradition, counted itself the Third Rome (Constantinople having been the second), in accordance with the concept of translatio imperii [534] The last Eastern Roman titular, Andreas Palaiologos, sold the title of Emperor of Constantinople to Charles VIII of France; upon Charles' death, Palaiologos reclaimed the title and on his death granted it to Ferdinand and Isabella and their successors, who never used it When the Ottomans, who based their state on the Byzantine model, took Constantinople in 1453, Mehmed II established his capital there and claimed to sit on the throne of the Roman Empire [535] He even launched an invasion of Otranto with the purpose of re-uniting the Empire, which was aborted by his death In the medieval West, \"Roman\" came to mean the church and the Catholic Pope The Greek form Romaioi remained attached to the Greek-speaking Christian population of the Byzantine Empire and is still used by Greeks [536]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Roman Empire was one of the largest and most influential empires in history, spanning over 500 years and covering much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It was a complex and multifaceted society, with a rich culture, politics, and economy.\n\n**History**\nThe Roman Empire began expanding shortly after the founding of the Roman Republic in the 6th century BC, though not outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC. Thus, it was an \"empire\" (a great power) long before it had an emperor. The Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a network of self-ruled towns (with varying degrees of independence from the Senate) and provinces administered by military commanders. It was governed by annually elected magistrates (Roman consuls above all) in conjunction with the Senate.\n\n**Transition from Republic to Empire**\nThe 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately led to rule by emperors. The consuls' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium, meaning \"command\" (typically in a military sense). Occasionally, successful consuls or generals were given the honorary title imperator (commander); this is the origin of the word emperor, since this title was always bestowed to the early emperors.\n\n**Pax Romana**\nThe 200 years that began with Augustus's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana (\"Roman Peace\"). The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down \"mercilessly and swiftly\". The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs.\n\n**Transition from Classical to Late Antiquity**\nIn the view of contemporary Greek historian Cassius Dio, the accession of Commodus in 180 marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\", which has led some historians to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the Empire's decline.\n\n**Fall in the West and Survival in the East**\nThe Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 5th century. The Romans fought off all invaders, most famously Attila, but the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself. Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer.\n\n**Geography and Demography**\nThe Roman Empire was one of the largest in history, with contiguous territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The Latin phrase imperium sine fine (\"empire without end\") expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In addition to annexing large regions, the Romans directly altered their geography, for example, cutting down entire forests.\n\n**Languages**\nLatin and Greek were the main languages of the Empire, but the Empire was deliberately multilingual. The main desire of the Roman government was to make itself understood. At the start of the Empire, knowledge of Greek was useful to pass as educated nobility and knowledge of Latin was useful for a career in the military, government, or law.\n\n**Society**\nThe Empire was remarkably multicultural, with \"astonishing cohesive capacity\" to create shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples. Public monuments and communal spaces open to all—such as forums, amphitheatres, racetracks, and baths—helped foster a sense of \"Romanness\".\n\n**Legal Status**\nAccording to the jurist Gaius, the essential distinction in the Roman \"law of persons\" was that all humans were either free (liberi) or slaves (servi). The legal status of free persons was further defined by their citizenship. Free people not considered citizens, but living within the Roman world, were peregrini, non-Romans.\n\n**Women in Roman Law**\nFreeborn Roman women were considered citizens, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos (\"children born of two Roman citizens\"). A Roman woman kept her own family name (nomen) for life.\n\n**Slaves and the Law**\nAt the time of Augustus, as many as 35% of the people in Roman Italy were slaves, making Rome one of five historical \"slave societies\" in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy. Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility.\n\n**Freedmen**\nRome differed from Greek city-states in allowing freed slaves to become citizens; any future children of a freedman were born free, with full rights of citizenship. A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but could play a priestly role.\n\n**Census Rank**\nThe Latin word ordo (plural ordines) is translated variously and inexactly into English as \"class, order, rank\". One purpose of the Roman census was to determine the ordo to which an individual belonged. Two of the highest ordines in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian.\n\n**Unequal Justice**\nAs the republican principle of citizens' equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours (honestiores) and humbler folk (humiliores).\n\n**Government and Military**\nThe three major elements of the Imperial state were the central government, the military, and the provincial government. The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens, agricultural fields, and religious sites.\n\n**Central Government**\nThe Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with divinely sanctioned authority (auctoritas). The emperor made himself the central religious authority as pontifex maximus, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders.\n\n**Military**\nAfter the Punic Wars, the Roman army comprised professional soldiers who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves. The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of Romanization.\n\n**Provincial Government**\nAn annexed territory became a Roman province in three steps: making a register of cities, taking a census, and surveying the land. Further government record-keeping included births and deaths, real estate transactions, taxes, and juridical proceedings.\n\n**Law**\nRoman courts held original jurisdiction over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire, but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces. Most parts of the Eastern Empire already had well-established law codes and juridical procedures.\n\n**Taxation**\nTaxation under the Empire amounted to about 5% of its gross product. The typical tax rate for individuals ranged from 2 to 5%. The tax code was \"bewildering\" in its complicated system of direct and indirect taxes, some paid in cash and some in kind.\n\n**Economy**\nThe Empire is best thought of as a network of regional economies, based on a form of \"political capitalism\" in which the state regulated commerce to assure its own revenues. Economic growth, though not comparable to modern economies, was greater than that of most other societies prior to industrialization.\n\n**Currency and Banking**\nThe early Empire was monetized to a near-universal extent, using money as a way to express prices and debts. The sestertius (English \"sesterces\", symbolized as HS) was the basic unit of reckoning value into the 4th century.\n\n**Transportation and Communication**\nThe Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean, which they called \"our sea\" (Mare Nostrum). Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean as well as major rivers. Transport by water was preferred where possible, as moving commodities by land was more difficult.\n\n**Trade and Commodities**\nRoman provinces traded among themselves, but trade extended outside the frontiers to regions as far away as China and India. The main commodity was grain, along with olive oil, foodstuffs, garum (fish sauce), slaves, ore and manufactured metal objects, fibres and textiles, timber, pottery, glassware, marble, papyrus, spices and materia medica, ivory, pearls, and gemstones.\n\n**Labour and Occupations**\nInscriptions record 268 different occupations in Rome and 85 in Pompeii. Professional associations or trade guilds (collegia) are attested for a wide range of occupations, some quite specialized.\n\n**Architecture and Engineering**\nThe chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch, vault and dome. Some Roman structures still stand today, due in part to sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete.\n\n**Daily Life**\nThe city was viewed as fostering civilization by being \"properly designed, ordered, and adorned\". Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology, and reorganized the city into neighbourhoods (vici) administered at the local level with police and firefighting services.\n\n**City and Country**\nThe city was viewed as fostering civilization by being \"properly designed, ordered, and adorned\". Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology, and reorganized the city into neighbourhoods (vici) administered at the local level with police and firefighting services.\n\n**Health and Disease**\nEpidemics were common in the ancient world, and occasional pandemics in the Empire killed millions. The Roman population was unhealthy, with about 20 percent living in cities, Rome being the largest. The cities were a \"demographic sink\", with a death rate exceeding the birth rate and constant immigration necessary to maintain the population.\n\n**Food and Dining**\nMost apartments in Rome lacked kitchens, though a charcoal brazier could be used for rudimentary cookery. Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars, inns, and food stalls (tabernae, cauponae, popinae, thermopolia). Carryout and restaurants were for the lower classes, while fine dining appeared only at dinner parties in wealthy homes with a chef (archimagirus) and kitchen staff.\n\n**Spectacles**\nSpectacles were a major part of Roman entertainment, including gladiatorial combat, chariot racing, and beast hunts. The largest such venue in Rome was the Circus Maximus, which hosted events such as horse races, chariot races, and historical re-enactments.\n\n**Recreation**\nThe Romans enjoyed a wide range of recreational activities, including board games, dice, and ball games. Children and young people played games such as hoop rolling and knucklebones, while adults enjoyed more complex games like trigon and harpastum.\n\n**Clothing**\nIn a status-conscious society like that of the Romans, clothing and personal adornment indicated the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing reflected a society in good order.\n\n**Arts**\nThe Romans had a rich and varied artistic culture, with influences from Greek art. Public art, including sculpture, monuments, and iconography on coins, was often analyzed for historical or ideological significance. In the private sphere, artistic objects were made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce.\n\n**Portraiture**\nPortraiture was a popular form of art in the Roman Empire, with many surviving examples in sculpture. Republican portraits were characterized by verism, while imperial portraits often combined realism and idealism.\n\n**Sculpture and Sarcophagi**\nRoman sculpture survived abundantly, often in damaged or fragmentary condition. Examples of freestanding statuary in marble, bronze, and terracotta, as well as reliefs from public buildings and monuments, are still extant.\n\n**Painting**\nRoman painting drew from Etruscan and Greek models and techniques. Examples of Roman paintings can be found in palaces, catacombs, and villas, often depicting scenes from mythology, theatre, landscapes, and everyday life.\n\n**Mosaic**\nMosaics are among the most enduring of Roman decorative arts, found on floors and other architectural features. Tessellated mosaics, formed from uniform pieces of stone and glass, were especially popular.\n\n**Decorative Arts**\nThe Romans had a rich tradition of decorative arts, including fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels, and glassware. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production, such as Southern Gaul, which became a leading producer of terra sigillata.\n\n**Performing Arts**\nThe Romans had a rich tradition of performing arts, including literary theatre, which was performed by all-male troupes using face masks with exaggerated facial expressions. Female roles were played by men in drag (travesti).\n\n**Literacy, Books, and Education**\nEstimates of the average literacy rate range from 5 to over 30%. The Roman obsession with documents and inscriptions indicates the value placed on the written word. Laws and edicts were posted as well as read out, and illiterate Roman subjects could have a government scribe (scriba) read or write their official documents for them.\n\n**Education**\nTraditional Roman education was moral and practical, with stories meant to instil Roman values (mores maiorum). Young children were attended by a pedagogue, who kept the child safe, taught self-discipline and public behaviour, attended class, and helped with tutoring.\n\n**Literature**\nLiterature under Augustus, along with that of the Republic, has been viewed as the \"Golden Age\" of Latin literature, embodying classical ideals. The three most influential Classical Latin poets—Virgil, Horace, and Ovid—belong to this period.\n\n**Religion**\nThe Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, attributing their success to their collective piety (pietas) and good relations with the gods (pax deorum). The archaic religion believed to have come from the earliest kings of Rome was the foundation of the mos maiorum, \"the way of the ancestors\", central to Roman identity.\n\n**Legacy**\nSeveral states claimed to be the Roman Empire's successor, including the Holy Roman Empire and the Russian Tsardom. The last Eastern Roman titular, Andreas Palaiologos, sold the title of Emperor of Constantinople to Charles VIII of France, who never used it.\n\n**See also**\n1. Roman Empire's provinces\n2.

regarded as the Pax Romana (\"Roman Peace\") The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down \"mercilessly and swiftly\" [38] The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs The Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors—Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero—before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as the victor Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, followed by the Nerva–Antonine dynasty which produced the \"Five Good Emperors\": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius [39]\n\n\nTransition from classical to late antiquity\nIn the view of contemporary Greek historian Cassius Dio, the accession of Commodus in 180 marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\", [40] a comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the Empire's decline [41] [42]\n\n\nFall in the West and survival in the East\nThe Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 5th century The Romans fought off all invaders, most famously Attila, [48] but the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself [49] Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer [50] [51] [52]\n\n\nGeography and demography\nThe Roman Empire was one of the largest in history, with contiguous territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East [56] The Latin phrase imperium sine fine (\"empire without end\" [57]) expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire In Virgil's Aeneid, limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by Jupiter [58] This claim of universal dominion was renewed when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century [h] In addition to annexing large regions, the Romans directly altered their geography, for example cutting down entire forests [60]\n\n\nLanguages\nLatin and Greek were the main languages of the Empire, [i] but the Empire was deliberately multilingual [76] Andrew Wallace-Hadrill says \"The main desire of the Roman government was to make itself understood\" [77] At the start of the Empire, knowledge of Greek was useful to pass as educated nobility and knowledge of Latin was useful for a career in the military, government, or law [78] Bilingual inscriptions indicate the everyday interpenetration of the two languages [79]\n\n\nSociety\nThe Empire was remarkably multicultural, with \"astonishing cohesive capacity\" to create shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples [106] Public monuments and communal spaces open to all—such as forums, amphitheatres, racetracks and baths—helped foster a sense of \"Romanness\" [107]\n\n\nLegal status\nAccording to the jurist Gaius, the essential distinction in the Roman \"law of persons\" was that all humans were either free (liberi) or slaves (servi) [119] The legal status of free persons was further defined by their citizenship Most citizens held limited rights (such as the ius Latinum, \"Latin right\"), but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by non-citizens Free people not considered citizens, but living within the Roman world, were peregrini, non-Romans [120] In 212, the Constitutio Antoniniana extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire This legal egalitarianism required a far-reaching revision of existing laws that distinguished between citizens and non-citizens [121]\n\n\nWomen in Roman law\nFreeborn Roman women were considered citizens, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos (\"children born of two Roman citizens\") [j] A Roman woman kept her own family name (nomen) for life Children most often took the father's name, with some exceptions [124] Women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business [125] Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could hold considerable fortunes [126]\n\n\nSlaves and the law\nAt the time of Augustus, as many as 35% of the people in Roman Italy were slaves, [137] making Rome one of five historical \"slave societies\" in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy [k] [137] Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility [138] In urban settings, slaves might be professionals such as teachers, physicians, chefs, and accountants; the majority of slaves provided trained or unskilled labour Agriculture and industry, such as milling and mining, relied on the exploitation of slaves Outside Italy, slaves were on average an estimated 10 to 20% of the population, sparse in Roman Egypt but more concentrated in some Greek areas Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces [139] Although slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries, it remained an integral part of Roman society until gradually ceasing in the 6th and 7th centuries with the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy [140]\n\n\nFreedmen\nRome differed from Greek city-states in allowing freed slaves to become citizens; any future children of a freedman were born free, with full rights of citizenship After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed active political freedom (libertas), including the right to vote [157] His former master became his patron (patronus): the two continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other [158] [159] A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but could play a priestly role He could not marry a woman from a senatorial family, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law [159] The rise of successful freedmen—through political influence or wealth—is a characteristic of early Imperial society The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by inscriptions throughout the Empire.\n\n\nCensus rank\nThe Latin word ordo (plural ordines) is translated variously and inexactly into English as \"class, order, rank\" One purpose of the Roman census was to determine the ordo to which an individual belonged [160] Two of the highest ordines in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian Outside Rome, cities or colonies were led by decurions, also known as curiales [161]\n\n\nUnequal justice\nAs the republican principle of citizens' equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours (honestiores) and humbler folk (humiliores) In general, honestiores were the members of the three higher \"orders\", along with certain military officers [179] The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority affirmed, particularly within the justice system [180] Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative \"worth\" (dignitas) of the defendant: an honestior could pay a fine for a crime for which an humilior might receive a scourging [181]\n\n\nGovernment and military\nThe three major elements of the Imperial state were the central government, the military, and the provincial government [185] The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens, agricultural fields, and religious sites [186] The Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to rule through force alone Cooperation with local elites was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue The Romans often exploited internal political divisions [187]\n\n\nCentral government\nThe Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with divinely sanctioned authority (auctoritas) The rite of apotheosis (also called consecratio) signified the deceased emperor's deification [190] The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of powers from several republican offices [191] The emperor made himself the central religious authority as pontifex maximus, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders [192] While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate [193]\n\n\nMilitary\nAfter the Punic Wars, the Roman army comprised professional soldiers who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves The transition to a professional military began during the late Republic and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism, under which an army of conscript citizens defended the homeland against a specific threat The Romans expanded their war machine by \"organizing the communities that they conquered in Italy into a system that generated huge reservoirs of manpower for their army\" [205] By Imperial times, military service was a full-time career [206] The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of Romanization [207]\n\n\nProvincial government\nAn annexed territory became a Roman province in three steps: making a register of cities, taking a census, and surveying the land [217] Further government recordkeeping included births and deaths, real estate transactions, taxes, and juridical proceedings [218] In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the central government sent out around 160 officials annually to govern outside Italy [22] Among these officials were the Roman governors: magistrates elected at Rome who in the name of the Roman people governed senatorial provinces; or governors, usually of equestrian rank, who held their imperium on behalf of the emperor in imperial provinces, most notably Roman Egypt [219] A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed, but he could delegate various duties [220] His staff, however, was minimal: his official attendants (apparitores), including lictors, heralds, messengers, scribes, and bodyguards; legates, both civil and military, usually of equestrian rank; and friends who accompanied him unofficially [220]\n\n\nLaw\nRoman courts held original jurisdiction over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire, but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces Most parts of the Eastern Empire already had well-established law codes and juridical procedures [109] Generally, it was Roman policy to respect the mos regionis (\"regional tradition\" or \"law of the land\") and to regard local laws as a source of legal precedent and social stability [109] [223] The compatibility of Roman and local law was thought to reflect an underlying ius gentium, the \"law of nations\" or international law regarded as common and customary [224] If provincial law conflicted with Roman law or custom, Roman courts heard appeals, and the emperor held final decision-making authority [109] [223] [o]\n\n\nTaxation\nTaxation under the Empire amounted to about 5% of its gross product [226] The typical tax rate for individuals ranged from 2 to 5% [227] The tax code was \"bewildering\" in its complicated system of direct and indirect taxes, some paid in cash and some in kind Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as fisheries; they might be temporary [228] Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military, [229] and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty [230] In-kind taxes were accepted from less-monetized areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps [231]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Empire is best thought of as a network of regional economies, based on a form of \"political capitalism\" in which the state regulated commerce to assure its own revenues [235] Economic growth, though not comparable to modern economies, was greater than that of most other societies prior to industrialization [236] Territorial conquests permitted a large-scale reorganization of land use that resulted in agricultural surplus and specialization, particularly in north Africa [237] Some cities were known for particular industries The scale of urban building indicates a significant construction industry [237] Papyri preserve complex accounting methods that suggest elements of economic rationalism, [237] and the Empire was highly monetized [238] Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity, transportation in the 1st and 2nd centuries expanded greatly, and trade routes connected regional economies [239] The supply contracts for the army drew on local suppliers near the base (castrum), throughout the province, and across provincial borders [240]\nEconomic historians vary in their calculations of the gross domestic product during the Principate [241] In the sample years of 14, 100, and 150 AD, estimates of per capita GDP range from 166 to 380 HS The GDP per capita of Italy is estimated as 40 [242] to 66% [243] higher than in the rest of the Empire, due to tax transfers from the provinces and the concentration of elite income.\n\n\nCurrency and banking\nThe early Empire was monetized to a near-universal extent, using money as a way to express prices and debts [247] The sestertius (English \"sesterces\", symbolized as HS) was the basic unit of reckoning value into the 4th century, [248] though the silver denarius, worth four sesterces, was also used beginning in the Severan dynasty [249] The smallest coin commonly circulated was the bronze as, one-tenth denarius [250] Bullion and ingots seem not to have counted as pecunia (\"money\") and were used only on the frontiers Romans in the first and second centuries counted coins, rather than weighing them—an indication that the coin was valued on its face This tendency towards fiat money led to the debasement of Roman coinage in the later Empire [251] The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and market integration [247] The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the money supply for trading or saving [252]\nRome had no central bank, and regulation of the banking system was minimal Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers' deposits A typical bank had fairly limited capital, and often only one principal Seneca assumes that anyone involved in Roman commerce needs access to credit [251] A professional deposit banker received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term, and lent money to third parties The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, both as creditors and borrowers [253] The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party, without cash changing hands Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked documentary transactions, the system of banks throughout the Empire permitted the exchange of large sums without physically transferring coins, in part because of the risks of moving large amounts of cash Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire, in 33 AD; [254] generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers [251] The central government itself did not borrow money, and without public debt had to fund deficits from cash reserves [255]\n\n\nMining and metallurgy\nThe main mining regions of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula (silver, copper, lead, iron and gold); [4] Gaul (gold, silver, iron); [256] Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), [257] the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); [258] Macedonia and Thrace (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin) Intensive large-scale mining—of alluvial deposits, and by means of open-cast mining and underground mining—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production [citation needed]\n\n\nTransportation and communication\nThe Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean, which they called \"our sea\" (Mare Nostrum) [267] Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean as well as major rivers [69] Transport by water was preferred where possible, as moving commodities by land was more difficult [268] Vehicles, wheels, and ships indicate the existence of a great number of skilled woodworkers [269]\n\n\nTrade and commodities\nRoman provinces traded among themselves, but trade extended outside the frontiers to regions as far away as China and India [273] Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middle men along the Silk Road; Indian trade also occurred by sea from Egyptian ports The main commodity was grain [274] Also traded were olive oil, foodstuffs, garum (fish sauce), slaves, ore and manufactured metal objects, fibres and textiles, timber, pottery, glassware, marble, papyrus, spices and materia medica, ivory, pearls, and gemstones [275] Though most provinces could produce wine, regional varietals were desirable and wine was a central trade good [276]\n\n\nLabour and occupations\nInscriptions record 268 different occupations in Rome and 85 in Pompeii [211] Professional associations or trade guilds (collegia) are attested for a wide range of occupations, some quite specialized [179]\n\n\nArchitecture and engineering\nThe chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch, vault and dome Some Roman structures still stand today, due in part to sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete [284] Roman temples developed Etruscan and Greek forms, with some distinctive elements Roman roads are considered the most advanced built until the early 19th century [citation needed]\n\n\nDaily life\nThe city was viewed as fostering civilization by being \"properly designed, ordered, and adorned\" [293] Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology, and reorganized the city into neighbourhoods (vici) administered at the local level with police and firefighting services [294] A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the Campus Martius, an open area outside the city centre: the Altar of Augustan Peace (Ara Pacis Augustae) was located there, as was an obelisk imported from Egypt that formed the pointer (gnomon) of a horologium With its public gardens, the Campus was among the most attractive places in Rome to visit [294]\n\n\nCity and country\nThe city was viewed as fostering civilization by being \"properly designed, ordered, and adorned\" [293] Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology, and reorganized the city into neighbourhoods (vici) administered at the local level with police and firefighting services [294] A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the Campus Martius, an open area outside the city centre: the Altar of Augustan Peace (Ara Pacis Augustae) was located there, as was an obelisk imported from Egypt that formed the pointer (gnomon) of a horologium With its public gardens, the Campus was among the most attractive places in Rome to visit [294]\n\n\nHealth and disease\nEpidemics were common in the ancient world, and occasional pandemics in the Empire killed millions The Roman population was unhealthy About 20 percent—a large percentage by ancient standards—lived in cities, Rome being the largest The cities were a \"demographic sink\": the death rate exceeded the birth rate and constant immigration was necessary to maintain the population Average lifespan is estimated at the mid-twenties, and perhaps more than half of children died before reaching adulthood Dense urban populations and poor sanitation contributed to disease Land and sea connections facilitated and sped the transfer of infectious diseases across the empire's territories The rich were not immune; only two of emperor Marcus Aurelius's fourteen children are known to have reached adulthood [321]\n\n\nFood and dining\nMost apartments in Rome lacked kitchens, though a charcoal brazier could be used for rudimentary cookery [324] Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars, inns, and food stalls (tabernae, cauponae, popinae, thermopolia) [325] Carryout and restaurants were for the lower classes; fine dining appeared only at dinner parties in wealthy homes with a chef (archimagirus) and kitchen staff, [326] or banquets hosted by social clubs (collegia) [327]\n\n\nSpectacles\nWhen Juvenal complained that the Roman people had exchanged their political liberty for \"bread and circuses\", he was referring to the state-provided grain dole and the circenses, events held in the entertainment venue called a circus The largest such venue in Rome was the Circus Maximus, the setting of horse races, chariot races, the equestrian Troy Game, staged beast hunts (venationes), athletic contests, gladiator combat, and historical re-enactments From earliest times, several religious festivals had featured games (ludi), primarily horse and chariot races (ludi circenses) [343] The races retained religious significance in connection with agriculture, initiation, and the cycle of birth and death [s]\n\n\nRecreation\nThe singular ludus, \"play, game, sport, training\", had a wide range of meanings such as \"word play\", \"theatrical performance\", \"board game\", \"primary school\", and even \"gladiator training school\" (as in Ludus Magnus) [374] Activities for children and young people in the Empire included hoop rolling and knucklebones (astragali or \"jacks\") Girls had dolls made of wood, terracotta, and especially bone and ivory [375] Ball games include trigon and harpastum [376] People of all ages played board games, including latrunculi (\"Raiders\") and XII scripta (\"Twelve Marks\") [377] A game referred to as alea (dice) or tabula (the board) may have been similar to backgammon [378] Dicing as a form of gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the festival of the Saturnalia [379]\n\n\nClothing\nIn a status-conscious society like that of the Romans, clothing and personal adornment indicated the etiquette of interacting with the wearer [384] Wearing the correct clothing reflected a society in good order [385] There is little direct evidence of how Romans dressed in daily life, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles are rare [386] [387]\n\n\nArts\nGreek art had a profound influence on Roman art [398] Public art—including sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coins—is often analysed for historical or ideological significance [399] In the private sphere, artistic objects were made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce [400] The wealthy advertised their appreciation of culture through artwork and decorative arts in their homes [401] Despite the value placed on art, even famous artists were of low social status, partly as they worked with their hands [402]\n\n\nPortraiture\nPortraiture, which survives mainly in sculpture, was the most copious form of imperial art Portraits during the Augustan period utilize classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism [403] Republican portraits were characterized by verism, but as early as the 2nd century BC, Greek heroic nudity was adopted for conquering generals [404] Imperial portrait sculptures may model a mature head atop a youthful nude or semi-nude body with perfect musculature [405] Clothed in the toga or military regalia, the body communicates rank or role, not individual characteristics [406]\n\n\nSculpture and sarcophagi\nExamples of Roman sculpture survive abundantly, though often in damaged or fragmentary condition, including freestanding statuary in marble, bronze and terracotta, and reliefs from public buildings and monuments Niches in amphitheatres were originally filled with statues, [408] [409] as were formal gardens [410] Temples housed cult images of deities, often by famed sculptors [411]\n\n\nPainting\nInitial Roman painting drew from Etruscan and Greek models and techniques Examples of Roman paintings can be found in palaces, catacombs and villas Much of what is known of Roman painting is from the interior decoration of private homes, particularly as preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius In addition to decorative borders and panels with geometric or vegetative motifs, wall painting depicts scenes from mythology and theatre, landscapes and gardens, spectacles, everyday life, and erotic art.\n\n\nMosaic\nMosaics are among the most enduring of Roman decorative arts, and are found on floors and other architectural features The most common is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass [417] Opus sectile is a related technique in which flat stone, usually coloured marble, is cut precisely into shapes from which geometric or figurative patterns are formed This more difficult technique became especially popular for luxury surfaces in the 4th century (e.g the Basilica of Junius Bassus) [418]\n\n\nDecorative arts\nDecorative arts for luxury consumers included fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels and implements, and glassware Pottery manufacturing was economically important, as were the glass and metalworking industries Imports stimulated new regional centres of production Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss pottery (terra sigillata) that was a major trade good in 1st-century Europe [420] Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century, Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass [421]\n\n\nPerforming arts\nIn Roman tradition, borrowed from the Greeks, literary theatre was performed by all-male troupes that used face masks with exaggerated facial expressions to portray emotion Female roles were played by men in drag (travesti) [422] Roman literary theatre tradition is represented in Latin literature by the tragedies of Seneca, for example.\n\n\nLiteracy, books, and education\nEstimates of the average literacy rate range from 5 to over 30% [436] [437] [438] The Roman obsession with documents and inscriptions indicates the value placed on the written word [439] [440] [u] Laws and edicts were posted as well as read out Illiterate Roman subjects could have a government scribe (scriba) read or write their official documents for them [437] [442] The military produced extensive written records [443] The Babylonian Talmud declared \"if all seas were ink, all reeds were pen, all skies parchment, and all men scribes, they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman government's concerns\" [444]\n\n\nEducation\nTraditional Roman education was moral and practical Stories were meant to instil Roman values (mores maiorum) Parents were expected to act as role models, and working parents passed their skills to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships [471] Young children were attended by a pedagogue, usually a Greek slave or former slave, [472] who kept the child safe, taught self-discipline and public behaviour, attended class and helped with tutoring [473]\n\n\nLiterature\nLiterature under Augustus, along with that of the Republic, has been viewed as the \"Golden Age\" of Latin literature, embodying classical ideals [501] The three most influential Classical Latin poets—Virgil, Horace, and Ovid—belong to this period Virgil's Aeneid was a national epic in the manner of the Homeric epics of Greece Horace perfected the use of Greek lyric metres in Latin verse Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of Augustan morality, contributing to his exile Ovid's Metamorphoses wove together Greco-Roman mythology; his versions of Greek myths became a primary source of later classical mythology, and his work was hugely influential on medieval literature [502] The early Principate produced satirists such as Persius and Juvenal.\n\n\nReligion\nThe Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success to their collective piety (pietas) and good relations with the gods (pax deorum) The archaic religion believed to have come from the earliest kings of Rome was the foundation of the mos maiorum, \"the way of the ancestors\", central to Roman identity [507]\n\n\nLegacy\nSeveral states claimed to be the Roman Empire's successor The Holy Roman Empire was established in 800 when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Roman emperor The Russian Tsardom, as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire's Orthodox Christian tradition, counted itself the Third Rome (Constantinople having been the second), in accordance with the concept of translatio imperii [534] The last Eastern Roman titular, Andreas Palaiologos, sold the title of Emperor of Constantinople to Charles VIII of France; upon Charles' death, Palaiologos reclaimed the title and on his death granted it to Ferdinand and Isabella and their successors, who never used it When the Ottomans, who based their state on the Byzantine model, took Constantinople in 1453, Mehmed II established his capital there and claimed to sit on the throne of the Roman Empire [535] He even launched an invasion of Otranto with the purpose of re-uniting the Empire, which was aborted by his death In the medieval West, \"Roman\" came to mean the church and the Catholic Pope The Greek form Romaioi remained attached to the Greek-speaking Christian population of the Byzantine Empire and is still used by Greeks [536]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of his life, including his early years, his involvement with McDonald's, his baseball ownership, and his philanthropic efforts.\n\nEarly Life\n----------\n\nRay Kroc was born on October 5, 1902, in Oak Park, Illinois, near Chicago, to Czech-American parents, Rose Mary Hrach and Alois \"Louis\" Kroc. Alois was born in Horní Stupno, part of Břasy near Rokycany, while Rose's father, Vojtěch, was from Ševětín and her maternal grandfather, Josef Kotilínek, was from Bořice. After emigrating to America, Alois made a fortune speculating on land during the 1920s, only to lose everything with the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nKroc's family was of Czech descent, and his parents were proud of their heritage. However, Kroc's early life was marked by struggles, including his father's financial setbacks and the family's subsequent poverty. Despite these challenges, Kroc developed a strong work ethic and a passion for business, which would later serve him well in his entrepreneurial endeavors.\n\nMcDonald's\n----------\n\nAfter World War II, Kroc found employment as a milkshake mixer salesman for the foodservice equipment manufacturer Prince Castle. When Prince Castle's mixer sales plummeted due to competition from lower-priced Hamilton Beach products, Kroc was intrigued by Richard and Maurice McDonald, who had purchased eight of his mixers for their restaurant in San Bernardino, California.\n\nKroc visited the brothers in 1954 to see why they were making so many milkshakes. He was impressed by their efficiency and innovative approach to fast food, which included the now-famous \"Speedee Service System.\" This system featured a streamlined menu, standardized portions, and a focus on speedy service. Kroc saw an opportunity to franchise the McDonald's concept and eventually convinced the brothers to let him open the first McDonald's franchise in Des Plaines, Illinois, in 1955.\n\nUnder Kroc's leadership, McDonald's expanded rapidly, and the company went public in 1965. Kroc's aggressive business tactics and focus on standardization helped to establish McDonald's as a global brand. However, his methods also led to conflicts with the McDonald brothers, who eventually sold their share of the company to Kroc in 1961.\n\nBaseball\n--------\n\nIn 1973, Kroc retired from running McDonald's. While he was looking for new challenges, he decided to return to baseball, which was his lifelong favorite sport. One day, while sitting in his yacht in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, he read in the newspaper that the San Diego Padres were for sale. The team had been conditionally sold to Joseph Danzansky, a Washington, D.C. grocery-chain owner, who planned to move the Padres to Washington. However, the sale was tied up in lawsuits when Kroc purchased the team for $12 million, keeping the team in San Diego.\n\nIn Kroc's first year of ownership in 1974, the Padres lost 102 games yet drew over one million in attendance, the standard of box office success in the major leagues during that era. Their previous highest attendance figure was 644,772 in 1972. The San Diego Union praised Kroc, saying he was \"above all, a fan of his team.\" Kroc's ownership of the Padres was marked by his commitment to the community and his efforts to improve the team's performance.\n\nPersonal Life\n------------\n\nThe Kroc Foundation supported research, treatment, and education about various medical conditions, including alcoholism, diabetes, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. It is best known for establishing the Ronald McDonald House, a nonprofit organization that provides free housing for parents close to medical facilities where their children are receiving treatment. The Ronald McDonald House has expanded to over 300 locations worldwide and has helped countless families during times of need.\n\nIn addition to his philanthropic efforts, Kroc was known for his love of baseball and his commitment to his community. He was a beloved figure in San Diego, and his ownership of the Padres helped to bring the team and the community closer together.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n-----------------\n\nKroc's acquisition of the McDonald's franchise as well as his \"Kroc-style\" business tactics are the subject of Mark Knopfler's 2004 song \"Boom, Like That.\" The song is a tribute to Kroc's innovative approach to business and his impact on the fast-food industry.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* McDonald's\n* Ray Kroc's biography\n* The McDonald's Corporation\n* The San Diego Padres\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* \"Ray Kroc: The Man Behind McDonald's.\" Biography.com.\n* \"Ray Kroc: Fast Food Pioneer.\" History.com.\n* \"The McDonald's Corporation.\" McDonald's Corporation.\n* \"The San Diego Padres.\" San Diego Padres.\n\nFurther Reading\n---------------\n\n* \"Ray Kroc: The Man Who Built McDonald's\" by John F.

I don't know.'\" [12] In a 1981 interview with Fangoria magazine, Hill mentions the finished film differs somewhat from initial drafts of the screenplay [4] Upon receiving the script, Yablans was disappointed as he felt it was \"pedestrian and predictable.\" [13] The plot twist of Laurie being Michael's sister was initially never planned by Carpenter or Hill, but was conceived, according to Carpenter, \"purely as a function of having decided to become involved in the sequel to the movie where I didn't think there was really much of a story left.\" [12] He would later refer to this plotline as \"silly\" and \"foolish,\" though it would go on to shape the narrative arc of the series in the subsequent films [14] It was retconned in Halloween, the 2018 rebooted sequel of the franchise, when Laurie's granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) dismisses the idea that Laurie and Michael are siblings as \"just something people made up.\" [15] Screenwriter Danny McBride felt that Michael Myers would be scarier if he had no motive for killing people [16]\n\n\nCasting\nThe main cast of Halloween reprised their roles in the sequel with the exception of Nick Castle, who had played the adult Michael Myers in the original Veteran English actor Donald Pleasence continued the role of Dr Sam Loomis, who had been Myers' psychiatrist for the past 15 years while Myers was institutionalized at Smith's Grove Sanitarium [20] Curtis (then 22), again played the teenage babysitter Laurie Strode, revealed in this film as the younger sister of Myers Curtis required a wig for the role of long-haired Laurie Strode, as she had her own hair cut shorter at the time [21] Charles Cyphers reprised the role of Sheriff Leigh Brackett, though his character disappears from the film when the corpse of his daughter Annie (Nancy Loomis) is discovered Nancy Loomis appears as Annie in a cameo role as her father, Sheriff Brackett, closes her eyes as her corpse is being taken out of the house in a stretcher [22] Actor Hunter von Leer heads the manhunt for Myers in the role of Deputy Gary Hunt He admitted in an interview that he had never watched Halloween before being cast in the part He stated, \"I did not see the original first but being from a small town, I wanted the Deputy to have compassion.\" [citation needed] Nancy Stephens, who played Loomis's nurse colleague Marion Chambers in the original, also reprised the character and was given a more important role, revealing to Loomis the family connection between Laurie and Michael [23]\n\n\nFilming\nHalloween executive producers Irwin Yablans and Moustapha Akkad invested heavily in the sequel, boasting a much larger budget than its predecessor: $2.5 million (compared to only $320,000 for the original) Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis assisted in financing the production [31] There was discussion of filming Halloween II in 3-D; Hill said, \"We investigated a number of 3-D processes .. but they were far too expensive for this particular project Also, most of the projects we do involve a lot of night shooting—evil lurks at night It's hard to do that in 3-D.\" [25] Dean Cundey, the director of photography on the first film, reprised his role as cinematographer, opting out of shooting Tobe Hooper's Poltergeist (1982) as he felt a loyalty to Carpenter and Hill [32]\n\n\nDirection\nReluctant to extend his involvement in the film, [36] Carpenter refused to direct and originally approached Tommy Lee Wallace, the art director from the original Halloween, to take the helm [37] Carpenter told one interviewer: \"I had made that film once and I really didn't want to do it again.\" [38] After Wallace declined, Carpenter chose Rosenthal, a relatively unknown and inexperienced director whose previous credits included episodes of the television series Secrets of Midland Heights (1980–1981) [39] Rosenthal was chosen to direct based on a short film he had made, The Toyer, while a student at the American Film Institute [40] Debra Hill had also considered directing at one point, but did not want to appear as \"just a protégé\" of Carpenter [31]\n\n\nMusic\nCarpenter composed and performed the score with Alan Howarth, who had previously been involved in Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), and worked with Carpenter on several projects including Escape from New York (1981), Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), Christine (1983), and Prince of Darkness (1987) The film's score was a variation of Carpenter compositions from Halloween, particularly the main theme's familiar piano melody played in a compound 5/4 time rhythm The score was performed on a synthesizer organ rather than a piano [45] One reviewer for the BBC described the revised score as having \"a more gothic feel.\" The reviewer asserted that it \"doesn't sound quite as good as the original piece\", but \"it still remains a classic piece of music.\" [46]\n\n\nPost-production\nThe film was principally edited by Mark Goldblatt [49] Skip Schoolnik, an editor who had simultaneously been commissioned to edit the television cut for the original Halloween, was invited by Carpenter and Hill to view the cut of Halloween II at the time [50] Schoolnik and Carpenter spent a weekend editing Goldblatt's cut of the film, ultimately excising around 14 minutes [51] During this editing process, Carpenter realized that an unresolved plot hole was present: It was unclear as to how Michael Myers was able to track Laurie to the hospital [52] To resolve this, Carpenter shot a sequence featuring a young boy walking on the street with a portable radio playing a news broadcast concerning the murders and Laurie's whereabouts; as the boy walks along, he accidentally bumps into Michael, and resumes walking [53] According to Warlock, Carpenter also shot the close-up footage of Michael's burning body shown at the film's conclusion, as well as the murder sequence of Anne Bruner, a teenage girl who is killed by Michael early in the film [54]\n\n\nRelease\nThe theatrical distribution rights to Halloween II were sold to Universal Pictures [55] To advertise Halloween II, Universal printed a poster that featured a skull superimposed onto a pumpkin This imagery is described by film historian and sociologist Robert E Kapsis as \"an unmistakable horror motif.\" Kapsis points out that by 1981 horror had \"become a genre non grata\" with critics The effect of this can be seen in the distributor's promotion of the film as horror while at the same time stressing that the sequel, like its predecessor, \"was more a quality suspense film than a 'slice and dice' horror film.\" [56] Use of the tagline More Of The Night HE Came Home—a modified version of the original Halloween tagline—hoped to accomplish the same task [citation needed] Universal released the film on October 30, 1981 in the United States on 1,211 screens [57] Internationally, Halloween II was released throughout Europe, but it was banned in West Germany [58] from December 1990 until January 2024 [59] and Iceland due to the graphic violence and nudity;

while Yablans's Compass International Pictures would be guaranteed production rights for Halloween II [9]\n\n\nWriting\nThe screenplay of Halloween II was written by Carpenter and Hill [12] Carpenter described that his writing of the screenplay \"mainly dealt with a lot of beer, sitting in front of a typewriter saying 'What the fuck am I doing? I don't know.'\" [12] In a 1981 interview with Fangoria magazine, Hill mentions the finished film differs somewhat from initial drafts of the screenplay [4] Upon receiving the script, Yablans was disappointed as he felt it was \"pedestrian and predictable.\" [13] The plot twist of Laurie being Michael's sister was initially never planned by Carpenter or Hill, but was conceived, according to Carpenter, \"purely as a function of having decided to become involved in the sequel to the movie where I didn't think there was really much of a story left.\" [12] He would later refer to this plotline as \"silly\" and \"foolish,\" though it would go on to shape the narrative arc of the series in the subsequent films [14] It was retconned in Halloween, the 2018 rebooted sequel of the franchise, when Laurie's granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) dismisses the idea that Laurie and Michael are siblings as \"just something people made up.\" [15] Screenwriter Danny McBride felt that Michael Myers would be scarier if he had no motive for killing people [16]\n\n\nCasting\nThe main cast of Halloween reprised their roles in the sequel with the exception of Nick Castle, who had played the adult Michael Myers in the original Veteran English actor Donald Pleasence continued the role of Dr Sam Loomis, who had been Myers' psychiatrist for the past 15 years while Myers was institutionalized at Smith's Grove Sanitarium [20] Curtis (then 22), again played the teenage babysitter Laurie Strode, revealed in this film as the younger sister of Myers Curtis required a wig for the role of long-haired Laurie Strode, as she had her own hair cut shorter at the time [21] Charles Cyphers reprised the role of Sheriff Leigh Brackett, though his character disappears from the film when the corpse of his daughter Annie (Nancy Loomis) is discovered Nancy Loomis appears as Annie in a cameo role as her father, Sheriff Brackett, closes her eyes as her corpse is being taken out of the house in a stretcher [22] Actor Hunter von Leer heads the manhunt for Myers in the role of Deputy Gary Hunt He admitted in an interview that he had never watched Halloween before being cast in the part He stated, \"I did not see the original first but being from a small town, I wanted the Deputy to have compassion.\" [citation needed] Nancy Stephens, who played Loomis's nurse colleague Marion Chambers in the original, also reprised the character and was given a more important role, revealing to Loomis the family connection between Laurie and Michael [23]\n\n\nFilming\nHalloween executive producers Irwin Yablans and Moustapha Akkad invested heavily in the sequel, boasting a much larger budget than its predecessor: $2.5 million (compared to only $320,000 for the original) Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis assisted in financing the production [31] There was discussion of filming Halloween II in 3-D; Hill said, \"We investigated a number of 3-D processes .. but they were far too expensive for this particular project Also, most of the projects we do involve a lot of night shooting—evil lurks at night It's hard to do that in 3-D.\" [25] Dean Cundey, the director of photography on the first film, reprised his role as cinematographer, opting out of shooting Tobe Hooper's Poltergeist (1982) as he felt a loyalty to Carpenter and Hill [32]\n\n\nDirection\nReluctant to extend his involvement in the film, [36] Carpenter refused to direct and originally approached Tommy Lee Wallace, the art director from the original Halloween, to take the helm [37] Carpenter told one interviewer: \"I had made that film once and I really didn't want to do it again.\" [38] After Wallace declined, Carpenter chose Rosenthal, a relatively unknown and inexperienced director whose previous credits included episodes of the television series Secrets of Midland Heights (1980–1981) [39] Rosenthal was chosen to direct based on a short film he had made, The Toyer, while a student at the American Film Institute [40] Debra Hill had also considered directing at one point, but did not want to appear as \"just a protégé\" of Carpenter [31]\n\n\nMusic\nCarpenter composed and performed the score with Alan Howarth, who had previously been involved in Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), and worked with Carpenter on several projects including Escape from New York (1981), Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), Christine (1983), and Prince of Darkness (1987) The film's score was a variation of Carpenter compositions from Halloween, particularly the main theme's familiar piano melody played in a compound 5/4 time rhythm The score was performed on a synthesizer organ rather than a piano [45] One reviewer for the BBC described the revised score as having \"a more gothic feel.\" The reviewer asserted that it \"doesn't sound quite as good as the original piece\", but \"it still remains a classic piece of music.\" [46]\n\n\nPost-production\nThe film was principally edited by Mark Goldblatt [49] Skip Schoolnik, an editor who had simultaneously been commissioned to edit the television cut for the original Halloween, was invited by Carpenter and Hill to view the cut of Halloween II at the time [50] Schoolnik and Carpenter spent a weekend editing Goldblatt's cut of the film, ultimately excising around 14 minutes [51] During this editing process, Carpenter realized that an unresolved plot hole was present: It was unclear as to how Michael Myers was able to track Laurie to the hospital [52] To resolve this, Carpenter shot a sequence featuring a young boy walking on the street with a portable radio playing a news broadcast concerning the murders and Laurie's whereabouts; as the boy walks along, he accidentally bumps into Michael, and resumes walking [53] According to Warlock, Carpenter also shot the close-up footage of Michael's burning body shown at the film's conclusion, as well as the murder sequence of Anne Bruner, a teenage girl who is killed by Michael early in the film [54]\n\n\nRelease\nThe theatrical distribution rights to Halloween II were sold to Universal Pictures [55] To advertise Halloween II, Universal printed a poster that featured a skull superimposed onto a pumpkin This imagery is described by film historian and sociologist Robert E Kapsis as \"an unmistakable horror motif.\" Kapsis points out that by 1981 horror had \"become a genre non grata\" with critics The effect of this can be seen in the distributor's promotion of the film as horror while at the same time stressing that the sequel, like its predecessor, \"was more a quality suspense film than a 'slice and dice' horror film.\" [56] Use of the tagline More Of The Night HE Came Home—a modified version of the original Halloween tagline—hoped to accomplish the same task [citation needed] Universal released the film on October 30, 1981 in the United States on 1,211 screens [57] Internationally, Halloween II was released throughout Europe, but it was banned in West Germany [58] from December 1990 until January 2024 [59] and Iceland due to the graphic violence and nudity; a later 1986 release on home video was banned in Norway The film was shown in Canada, Australia, the Philippines, and Japan [55] [60]\n\n\nTelevision cut\nAn alternate version of Halloween II (sometimes referred to as 'The Television Cut') has aired on network television since the early 1980s, with most of the graphic violence and blood edited out and many minor additional scenes added, while others are removed [61] This cut of the film was released in 2012 by Scream Factory on their Collector's Edition Blu-ray disc, and again in 2014 as a standalone DVD accompanying the \"Complete Collection\" Deluxe Edition Blu-ray set, which features  entire series [62]\n\n\nHome media\nHalloween II was first released on VHS, Capacitance Electronic Disc, and LaserDisc in 1982 by MCA/Universal Home Video [64] and later by Goodtimes Home Video In 1998, Goodtimes released the film on DVD in a non-anamorphic version [65] Three years later, on September 18, 2001, Universal Home Video released an anamorphic widescreen DVD [66]\n\n\nMerchandising\nTrick or Treat Studios has released a series of officially licensed Halloween II masks, costumes, and props from Universal Studios, beginning in October 2012 Some of these include the Halloween II Michael Myers mask, Halloween II Michael Myers mask with blood tears, Michael Myers props, and Michael Myers' coveralls [72] In 2023, an officially licensed tabletop board game based on the film, produced by Stop the Killer and Fright-Rags, was announced [73] [74]\n\n\nNovelization\nAn adaptation of the screenplay was printed as a mass market paperback in 1981 by horror and science-fiction writer Dennis Etchison under the pseudonym Jack Martin [75] Etchison's novelization was distributed by Kensington Books and became a bestseller It also features captioned black and white stills from the film at the beginning of each chapter [76]\n\n\nReception\nThe film grossed $7,446,508 on its opening weekend, ranking number one at the box office, and ultimately went on to gross $25,533,818;

factory, and his wife Patricia (née Fair), a seamstress [1] [2] [3] Her father is Welsh and her mother is of Irish Catholic descent [4] She was named after her grandmothers, Zeta Jones (derived from the name of a ship that her great-grandfather sailed on) [4] and Catherine Fair [5] She has an older brother, David, and a younger brother, Lyndon, who worked as a sales representative before venturing into film production [6] [7] She was raised in the Mumbles district of Swansea [8] Because Zeta-Jones was a hyperactive child, her mother sent her to the Hazel Johnson School of Dance when she was four years old [9] She was educated at Dumbarton House School, a private school in Swansea [6] The family came from a modest background, but their fortunes improved when they won £100,000 in a bingo competition, thus enabling them to pay for their daughter's dance and ballet lessons [5]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1990, Zeta-Jones made her film debut in the director Philippe de Broca's film 1001 Nights An adaptation of the Persian fable One Thousand and One Nights, the French-Italian production recounts the tale from the perspective of Scheherazade (Zeta-Jones), one of the brides of King Sharir (Thierry Lhermitte) [19] 1001 Nights did not perform well at the box office, and according to de Broca's obituary in The Daily Telegraph, the film \"is best remembered for its enjoyable nude scenes.\" [20] Greater success followed when she starred opposite David Jason and Pam Ferris in the ITV period comedy-drama television series The Darling Buds of May from 1991 to 1993 Adapted from H. E Bates' novel of the same name, Zeta-Jones played the role of the eldest daughter of a family living in the countryside in 1950s Britain [4] [21] The series was the highest-rated television show in the country at the time, and Zeta-Jones gained wide public recognition for it \"Literally, with one hour of television my life completely changed I couldn't go anywhere\", she remarked [12] [22]\n\n\n1990–1996: Screen debut and career struggles\nIn 1990, Zeta-Jones made her film debut in the director Philippe de Broca's film 1001 Nights An adaptation of the Persian fable One Thousand and

success\nSteven Spielberg took notice of Zeta-Jones in Titanic and recommended her to Martin Campbell, who was directing The Mask of Zorro (1998) for Spielberg's production company Campbell cast her as the leading lady instead of Izabella Scorupco, who was his original choice for the part [36] Co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas, the film tells the story of Zorro (Hopkins), a Spanish warrior (the film is set in Old California) who sets out to avenge the death of his wife and find his lost daughter Elena (Zeta-Jones) She found similarities between her \"volatile\" Celtic personality and her Latin character's temperament, and in preparation she learnt dancing, riding and sword-fighting, and took diction lessons in Spanish [37] [38] Filming action and dance sequences while wearing heavy corsets in the dry Mexican desert proved challenging for Zeta-Jones, but she found the experience \"worth suffering for\" [36] The Mask of Zorro was positively received by the critics and grossed over $250 million worldwide [39] [40] The role proved to be a breakthrough for her and she was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance [41] [42]\n\n\n2001–2004: Established actress\nThe romantic comedy America's Sweethearts was Zeta-Jones's sole film release of 2001 She starred as a shrewd film star, opposite Julia Roberts who featured as her character's under-confident sibling The critic Roger Ebert compared the film unfavourably to the musical Singin' in the Rain (1952), but thought that Zeta-Jones was aptly \"chilly and manipulative\" in her part [58] The following year, she starred as the murderous nightclub singer Velma Kelly in Chicago (2002), a film adaptation of the stage musical of the same name from director Rob Marshall She based her character's look and mannerisms on the actress Louise Brooks, and as the script did not provide a backstory to Kelly, she worked to convey the character's \"flamboyance\" and \"desperation\" through \"little looks and nuances\" [59] The film and her performance received critical acclaim [60] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer believed that Zeta-Jones had made \"a wonderfully statuesque and bitchy saloon goddess\", and David Edelstein of Slate wrote that she has \"a smoldering confidence that takes your mind off her not-always-fluid dancing – although she's a perfectly fine hoofer, with majestic limbs and a commanding cleavage\" and particularly praised her rendition of the song \"All That Jazz\" [61] [62] Chicago grossed $306 million worldwide, and was the recipient of the Academy Award for Best Picture [63] For her performance, she won the Academy Award, SAG Award, and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, among other awards and

in Lay the Favorite (2012), a comedy co-starring Bruce Willis and Rebecca Hall, in which she played the jealous wife of a gambler (Willis) [95] [96] Reviews of the film were negative, and Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times found Zeta-Jones to be \"far too shrill to amuse\" [97] [98] In the ensemble musical comedy Rock of Ages, co-starring Tom Cruise and Bryan Cranston, Zeta-Jones played the part of a religiously conservative wife of a mayor She was attracted to the idea of playing a \"nightmare of a woman\" and based the role on the politician Michele Bachmann; [88] the film received mixed reviews and failed commercially [99] [100] Her final release of 2012 was Playing for Keeps, a romantic comedy with Gerard Butler, which proved to be her third box office failure of the year [101]\n\n\n2017–present: Television and streaming\nZeta-Jones returned to television in 2017, portraying actress Olivia de Havilland in the first season of Ryan Murphy's anthology drama series Feud, subtitled Bette and Joan, about the rivalry between the actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis (played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, respectively) [113] Dominic Patten of Deadline Hollywood found Zeta-Jones to be \"wonderfully cast\" and Sonia Saraiya of Variety credited her for providing \"the best turn in the show\" [114] [115] Displeased with an \"unauthorized use of her name and identity\" in the series, de Havilland, at 101 years old, sued the network and producers of Feud for invasion of privacy and other personality rights [116] [117] The lawsuit was later dismissed by a California appellate court [118]\n\n\nOther ventures\nAside from acting, Zeta-Jones supports various charities and causes She is a patron of Swansea's Longfields Day Centre for the disabled, and has

Fine Romance, an annual charitable program that helps raise funds for the Motion Picture & Television Fund, and is one of the members of the Cinema for Peace Foundation [137] [138]\n\n\nMedia

stage career\nCatherine Zeta-Jones was born on 25 September 1969 in Swansea, South Wales, to David Jones, the owner of a sweet factory, and his wife Patricia (née Fair), a seamstress [1] [2] [3] Her father is Welsh and her mother is of Irish Catholic descent [4] She was named after her grandmothers, Zeta Jones (derived from the name of a ship that her great-grandfather sailed on) [4] and Catherine Fair [5] She has an older brother, David, and a younger brother, Lyndon, who worked as a sales representative before venturing into film production [6] [7] She was raised in the Mumbles district of Swansea [8] Because Zeta-Jones was a hyperactive child, her mother sent her to the Hazel Johnson School of Dance when she was four years old [9] She was educated at Dumbarton House School, a private school in Swansea [6] The family came from a modest background, but their fortunes improved when they won £100,000 in a bingo competition, thus enabling them to pay for their daughter's dance and ballet lessons [5]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1990, Zeta-Jones made her film debut in the director Philippe de Broca's film 1001 Nights An adaptation of the Persian fable One Thousand and One Nights, the French-Italian production recounts the tale from the perspective of Scheherazade (Zeta-Jones), one of the brides of King Sharir (Thierry Lhermitte) [19] 1001 Nights did not perform well at the box office, and according to de Broca's obituary in The Daily Telegraph, the film \"is best remembered for its enjoyable nude scenes.\" [20] Greater success followed when she starred opposite David Jason and Pam Ferris in the ITV period comedy-drama television series The Darling Buds of May from 1991 to 1993 Adapted from H. E Bates' novel of the same name, Zeta-Jones played the role of the eldest daughter of a family living in the countryside in 1950s Britain [4] [21] The series was the highest-rated television show in the country at the time, and Zeta-Jones gained wide public recognition for it \"Literally, with one hour of television my life completely changed I couldn't go anywhere\", she remarked [12] [22]\n\n\n1990–1996: Screen debut and career struggles\nIn 1990, Zeta-Jones made her film debut in the director Philippe de Broca's film 1001 Nights An adaptation of the Persian fable One Thousand and One Nights, the French-Italian production recounts the tale from the perspective of Scheherazade (Zeta-Jones), one of the brides of King Sharir (Thierry Lhermitte) [19] 1001 Nights did not perform well at the box office, and according to de Broca's obituary in The Daily Telegraph, the film \"is best remembered for its enjoyable nude scenes.\" [20] Greater success followed when she starred opposite David Jason and Pam Ferris in the ITV period comedy-drama television series The Darling Buds of May from 1991 to 1993 Adapted from H. E Bates' novel of the same name, Zeta-Jones played the role of the eldest daughter of a family living in the countryside in 1950s Britain [4] [21] The series was the highest-rated television show in the country at the time, and Zeta-Jones gained wide public recognition for it \"Literally, with one hour of television my life completely changed I couldn't go anywhere\", she remarked [12] [22]\n\n\n1998–2000: Hollywood breakthrough and success\nSteven Spielberg took notice of Zeta-Jones in Titanic and recommended her to Martin Campbell, who was directing The Mask of Zorro (1998) for Spielberg's production company Campbell cast her as the leading lady instead of Izabella Scorupco, who was his original choice for the part [36] Co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas, the film tells the story of Zorro (Hopkins), a Spanish warrior (the film is set in Old California) who sets out to avenge the death of his wife and find his lost daughter Elena (Zeta-Jones) She found similarities between her \"volatile\" Celtic personality and her Latin character's temperament, and in preparation she learnt dancing, riding and sword-fighting, and took diction lessons in Spanish [37] [38] Filming action and dance sequences while wearing heavy corsets in the dry Mexican desert proved challenging for Zeta-Jones, but she found the experience \"worth suffering for\" [36] The Mask of Zorro was positively received by the critics and grossed over $250 million worldwide [39] [40] The role proved to be a breakthrough for her and she was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance [41] [42]\n\n\n2001–2004: Established actress\nThe romantic comedy America's Sweethearts was Zeta-Jones's sole film release of 2001 She starred as a shrewd film star, opposite Julia Roberts who featured as her character's under-confident sibling The critic Roger Ebert compared the film unfavourably to the musical Singin' in the Rain (1952), but thought that Zeta-Jones was aptly \"chilly and manipulative\" in her part [58] The following year, she starred as the murderous nightclub singer Velma Kelly in Chicago (2002), a film adaptation of the stage musical of the same name from director Rob Marshall She based her character's look and mannerisms on the actress Louise Brooks, and as the script did not provide a backstory to Kelly, she worked to convey the character's \"flamboyance\" and \"desperation\" through \"little looks and nuances\" [59] The film and her performance received critical acclaim [60] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer believed that Zeta-Jones had made \"a wonderfully statuesque and bitchy saloon goddess\", and David Edelstein of Slate wrote that she has \"a smoldering confidence that takes your mind off her not-always-fluid dancing – although she's a perfectly fine hoofer, with majestic limbs and a commanding cleavage\" and particularly praised her rendition of the song \"All That Jazz\" [61] [62] Chicago grossed $306 million worldwide, and was the recipient of the Academy Award for Best Picture [63] For her performance, she won the Academy Award, SAG Award, and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, among other awards and nominations [64]\n\n\n2005–2010: Decrease in workload and return to the stage\nThe Legend of Zorro (2005), a sequel to The Mask of Zorro, saw her reprise the role of Eléna opposite Banderas Set ten years after the first film, the sequel follows Eléna struggling with married life [41] Unlike the original, the film was disliked by critics and was a commercial disappointment [79] [80] She did not have any film releases in 2006 A biopic of Harry Houdini, titled Death Defying Acts (2007), starring Guy Pearce as the escapologist Houdini, featured

Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics in the 1960s [5]\n\n\nThe Multiverse Saga films and series\nDisney was reportedly developing a Marvel-based television series for their new streaming service Disney+ by November 2017 [23] In July 2018, Feige said discussions had begun with Disney regarding any potential involvement Marvel Studios could have with the streaming service, which he felt was important for the wider company [24] In September 2018, Marvel Studios was reported to be developing several limited series centered on \"second-tier\" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to headline their own films Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes and would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development [25] Feige said these series would \"tell stories.. that we wouldn't be able to tell in a theatrical experience—a longer-form narrative\" [26] He added that being asked by Disney to create these series \"energized everyone creatively\" within Marvel Studios, since they \"could play in a new medium and throw the rules out the window in terms of structure and format\" [27] Television specials from the studio are marketed as \"Marvel Studios Special Presentations\" [28] [29] The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022), a Special Presentation, was the first project Marvel Studios began planning for Disney+ [30]\n\n\nMarvel Television series\nMarvel Television produced multiple television series set in the MCU across broadcast, streaming, and cable Its ABC series included Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D (2013–2020), Agent Carter (2015–2016), and Inhumans (2017); its Netflix series included Daredevil (2015–2018), Jessica Jones (2015–2019), Luke Cage (2016–2018), Iron Fist (2017–2018), the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017), and The Punisher (2017–2019); its young adult series included Runaways (2017–2019) streaming on Hulu and Cloak & Dagger (2018–2019) airing on Freeform; and the Hulu series Helstrom (2020) was originally intended to be the start of a planned \"Adventure into Fear\" franchise, [117] but was ultimately \"not tied to the MCU\", according to showrunner Paul Zbyszewski [118]\n\n\nExpansion to other media\nIn 2008, the first comic book to tie-into the MCU was released [80] Quesada explained that these comics would be set within the continuity of the films, but were not intended to be direct adaptions Rather, they would explore \"something that happened off screen\" or flesh out something briefly mentioned Feige was involved with the creation of the comics, with the film's screenwriters sometimes as well [81] Marvel Comics worked with Brad Winderbaum, Jeremy Latcham, and Will Corona Pilgrim at Marvel Studios to decide which concepts would be carried over from the Marvel Comics Universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what to show in the tie-in comics, and what to leave for the films [82] Marvel later clarified which of the tie-in comics are considered canonical MCU stories, with the rest being merely inspired by the MCU \"where we get to show off all the characters from the film in costume and in comic form\" [83]\n\n\nBusiness practices\nIn November 2016, Feige explained that the studio would often put together a \"lookbook\" of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for a project These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds approximately every 18 months to plan out future projects and develop the phases of the MCU However, these lookbooks are not always shown to directors, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first [95] When choosing a director for a project, Marvel Studios looks for filmmakers to hire who can guide a film [96] Some of their choices for directors have been considered \"out-of-left-field based on those director's previous work On this, Feige remarked that \"you don't have to have directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome.\" [97]\n\n\nFeature films\nMarvel Studios releases its films in groups called \"Phases\" [12] [13]\n\n\nThe Infinity Saga\nThe first three phases are collectively known as \"The Infinity

were the first to explore the concept of the multiverse within the MCU, [194] [195] as well as the film Spider-Man: No Way Home, which connected the MCU to other Spider-Man film franchises by featuring characters from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films, and Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) [196] [197] The SSU film Venom: Let There Be Carnage briefly featured the main universe of the MCU as well [197] In Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, the main universe of MCU events was designated as Earth-616 (a designation first referenced in Spider-Man: Far From Home), sharing the name of the main Marvel Comics universe, while another universe was designated as Earth-838 [198] Sony's animated film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse references the events of No Way Home, citing the MCU's primary reality as Earth-199999 [199] 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series is designated as Earth-10005 in Deadpool & Wolverine [200] That film features several actors reprising their roles from the X-Men film series along with characters from Fox's films Daredevil and its spin-off Elektra, Fantastic Four (2005) and its sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007), and New Line Cinema's Blade film trilogy [201] [202] Phases Four, Five, and Six comprise \"The Multiverse Saga\" [47]\n\n\nRecurring cast and characters\nThis section includes characters who will appear or have appeared in at least three MCU films/series and received main billing credit in at least two franchises.\n\n\nReception\nEarly on, the shared universe element of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was criticized by some journalists Around the release of The Avengers in 2012, Jim Vorel of Herald & Review called the Marvel Cinematic Universe \"complicated\" and \"impressive\", but said, \"As more and more heroes get their own film adaptations, the overall universe becomes increasingly confusing.\" [316] Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant stated that while The Avengers was a success, \"Marvel Studios still has room to improve their approach to building a shared movie universe\" [317] Some reviewers criticized the fact that the desire to create a shared universe led to films that did not hold as well on their own In his review of Thor: The Dark World, Forbes critic Scott Mendelson likened the MCU to \"a glorified television series\", with The Dark World being a \"'stand-alone' episode that contains little long-range mythology\" [318] Collider's Matt Goldberg considered that while Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger were quality productions, \"they have never really been their own movies\", feeling that the plot detours to S.H.I.E.L.D or lead-ups to The Avengers dragged down the films' narratives [319]\n\n\nCultural impact\nAfter the release of The Avengers in May 2012, Tom Russo of Boston.com noted that aside from the occasional \"novelty\" such as Alien vs Predator (2004), the idea of a shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood [5] Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning \"megafranchises\" for years to come, as opposed to working one blockbuster at a time Amobi added, \"A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust Disney has proved that this  [approach and genre] can be a gold mine.\" [344] With more studios now \"playing the megafranchise game\", Doug Creutz, media analyst for Cowen and Company, feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: \"If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox  [is] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario? I'm not sure they can.\" [344]\n\n\nOther studios\nAfter the release of The Avengers in May 2012, Tom Russo of Boston.com noted that aside from the occasional \"novelty\" such as Alien vs Predator (2004), the idea of a shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood [5] Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning \"megafranchises\" for years to come, as opposed to working one blockbuster at a time Amobi added, \"A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust Disney has proved that this  [approach and genre] can be a gold mine.\" [344] With more studios now \"playing the megafranchise game\", Doug Creutz, media analyst for Cowen and Company, feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: \"If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox  [is] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario?

Pictures\nIn October 2012, following its legal victory over Joe Shuster's estate for the rights to Superman, Warner Bros Pictures announced that it planned to move ahead with its long-awaited Justice League film, uniting such DC Comics superheroes as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a team-up film [346] The release of Man of Steel in 2013 was intended to be the start of a new shared universe for DC, \"laying the groundwork for the future slate of films based on DC Comics\" [347] In 2014, Warner Bros announced that slate of films, similarly to Disney and Marvel claiming dates for films years in advance [348] That year, DC chief creative officer Geoff Johns stated that the television series Arrow and The Flash were set in a separate universe from the new film one, [349] later clarifying that \"We look at it as the multiverse We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through .. It's just a different approach  [from Marvel's].\" [350]\n\n\n20th Century Fox\nIn November 2012, 20th Century Fox announced plans to create their own shared universe, consisting of Marvel properties that it held the rights to including the Fantastic Four and X-Men, with the hiring of Mark Millar as supervising producer Millar said, \"Fox are thinking, 'We're sitting on some really awesome things here There is another side of the Marvel Universe Let's try and get some cohesiveness going.' So they brought me in to oversee that really To meet with the writers and directors to suggest new ways we could take this stuff and new properties that could spin out of it.\" [355] X-Men: Days of Future Past, released in 2014, was Fox's first step towards expanding their stable of Marvel properties and creating this universe, [356] ahead of the release of a Fantastic Four reboot film the next year [357] In May 2014, Days of Future Past and Fantastic Four screenwriter Simon Kinberg stated that the latter film would not take place in the same universe as the X-Men films, explaining that \"none of the X-Men movies have acknowledged the notion of a sort of superhero team—the Fantastic Four And the Fantastic Four acquire powers, so for them to live in a world where mutants are prevalent is kind of complicated, because you're like, 'Oh, you're just a mutant.' Like, 'What's so fantastic about you?' .. they live in discrete universes.\" [357] In July 2015, X-Men director Bryan Singer said that there was still potential for a crossover between the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises, if reactions to Fantastic Four and X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) warranted it [358]\n\n\nSony Pictures\nIn November 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal announced that the studio intended to expand their universe created within director Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films (2012–14), with spin-off adventures for supporting characters, in an attempt to replicate Marvel and Disney's model [356] The next month, Sony announced Venom and Sinister Six films, both set in the Amazing Spider-Man universe With this announcement, IGN stated that the spin-offs are \"the latest example of what we can refer to as \"the Avengers effect\" in Hollywood, as studios work to build interlocking movie universes.\" [360] Sony chose not to replicate the Marvel Studios model of introducing individual characters first before bringing them together in a team-up film, instead making the Spider-Man adversaries the stars of future films [344] In February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that the Spider-Man franchise would be retooled, with a new film co-produced by Feige and Pascal being released in July 2017, and the character being integrated into the MCU Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own, and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films [361] With this announcement, sequels to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) were canceled, [362] and by November 2015 the Venom and Sinister Six films, as well as spin-offs based on female characters in the Spider-Man universe, were no longer moving forward [362] [363] By March 2016, the Venom film had itself been retooled, to start its own franchise unrelated to the MCU Spider-Man [364] A year later, Sony officially announced the Venom film to be in development, for an October 5, 2018, release, [365] along with a film centered on the characters Silver Sable and Black Cat known as Silver & Black [366] Both projects were not intended to be a part of the MCU nor spin-offs to Spider-Man: Homecoming, but rather part of an intended separate shared universe known as the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) [366] [367] [368] The mid-credits scene of Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) hinted at Eddie Brock / Venom joining the MCU, [369] which was confirmed with the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) through an uncredited cameo appearance in its mid-credits scene [370] Spider-Man: No Way Home also featured the Spider-Man iterations from Sam Raimi and Webb's Spider-Man films, respectively reprised by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield [371]\n\n\nAcademia\nIn September 2014, the University of Baltimore announced a course beginning in the 2015 spring semester revolving around the Marvel Cinematic Universe, to be taught by Arnold T Blumberg \"Media Genres: Media Marvels\" examines \"how Marvel's series of interconnected films and television shows, plus related media and comic book sources and Joseph Campbell's monomyth of the 'hero's journey', offer important insights into modern culture\" as well as Marvel's efforts \"to establish a viable universe of plotlines, characters, and backstories.\" [374] [375]\n\n\nOutside

Age of Ultron and Ant-Man, as well as footage from the Agent Carter television series previously screened at New York Comic Con [428] Brian Lowry of Variety felt an hour for the special did not \"do the topic justice\" adding, \"For anyone who has seen more than one Marvel movie but would shrug perplexedly at the mention of Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko, Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp To Pop! should probably be required viewing Fun, fast-paced and encompassing many of the company's highlights along with a few lowlights, it's a solid primer on Marvel's history, while weaving in inevitable self-promotion and synergistic plugs.\" [429] Eric Goldman of IGN also wished the special had been longer, adding, \"Understandably, the more you already know about Marvel, the less you'll be surprised by Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, but it's important to remember who this special is really made for – a mainstream audience who have embraced the Marvel characters, via the hugely successful movies, in a way no one could have imagined.\" [428]\n\n\nMarvel Studios: Expanding the Universe (2019)\nThe special Expanding the Universe was released on Disney+ on November 12, 2019 It

[5]\n\n\nThe Multiverse Saga films and series\nDisney was reportedly developing a Marvel-based television series for their new streaming service Disney+ by November 2017 [23] In July 2018, Feige said discussions had begun with Disney regarding any potential involvement Marvel Studios could have with the streaming service, which he felt was important for the wider company [24] In September 2018, Marvel Studios was reported to be developing several limited series centered on \"second-tier\" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to headline their own films Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes and would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development [25] Feige said these series would \"tell stories.. that we wouldn't be able to tell in a theatrical experience—a longer-form narrative\" [26] He added that being asked by Disney to create these series \"energized everyone creatively\" within Marvel Studios, since they \"could play in a new medium and throw the rules out the window in terms of structure and format\" [27] Television specials from the studio are marketed as \"Marvel Studios Special Presentations\" [28] [29] The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022), a Special Presentation, was the first project Marvel Studios began planning for Disney+ [30]\n\n\nMarvel Television series\nMarvel Television produced multiple television series set in the MCU across broadcast, streaming, and cable Its ABC series included Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D (2013–2020), Agent Carter (2015–2016), and Inhumans (2017); its Netflix series included Daredevil (2015–2018), Jessica Jones (2015–2019), Luke Cage (2016–2018), Iron Fist (2017–2018), the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017), and The Punisher (2017–2019); its young adult series included Runaways (2017–2019) streaming on Hulu and Cloak & Dagger (2018–2019) airing on Freeform; and the Hulu series Helstrom (2020) was originally intended to be the start of a planned \"Adventure into Fear\" franchise, [117] but was ultimately \"not tied to the MCU\", according to showrunner Paul Zbyszewski [118]\n\n\nExpansion to other media\nIn 2008, the first comic book to tie-into the MCU was released [80] Quesada explained that these comics would be set within the continuity of the films, but were not intended to be direct adaptions Rather, they would explore \"something that happened off screen\" or flesh out something briefly mentioned Feige was involved with the creation of the comics, with the film's screenwriters sometimes as well [81] Marvel Comics worked with Brad Winderbaum, Jeremy Latcham, and Will Corona Pilgrim at Marvel Studios to decide which concepts would be carried over from the Marvel Comics Universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what to show in the tie-in comics, and what to leave for the films [82] Marvel later clarified which of the tie-in comics are considered canonical MCU stories, with the rest being merely inspired by the MCU \"where we get to show off all the characters from the film in costume and in comic form\" [83]\n\n\nBusiness practices\nIn November 2016, Feige explained that the studio would often put together a \"lookbook\" of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for a project These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds approximately every 18 months to plan out future projects and develop the phases of the MCU However, these lookbooks are not always shown to directors, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first [95] When choosing a director for a project, Marvel Studios looks for filmmakers to hire who can guide a film [96] Some of their choices for directors have been considered \"out-of-left-field based on those director's previous work On this, Feige remarked that \"you don't have to have directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome.\" [97]\n\n\nFeature films\nMarvel Studios

were the first to explore the concept of the multiverse within the MCU, [194] [195] as well as the film Spider-Man: No Way Home, which connected the MCU to other Spider-Man film franchises by featuring characters from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films, and Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) [196] [197] The SSU film Venom: Let There Be Carnage briefly featured the main universe of the MCU as well [197] In Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, the main universe of MCU events was designated as Earth-616 (a designation first referenced in Spider-Man: Far From Home), sharing the name of the main Marvel Comics universe, while another universe was designated as Earth-838 [198] Sony's animated film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse references the events of No Way Home, citing the MCU's primary reality as Earth-199999 [199] 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series is designated as Earth-10005 in Deadpool & Wolverine [200] That film features several actors reprising their roles from the X-Men film series along with characters from Fox's films Daredevil and its spin-off Elektra, Fantastic Four (2005) and its sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007), and New Line Cinema's Blade film trilogy [201] [202] Phases Four, Five, and Six comprise \"The Multiverse Saga\" [47]\n\n\nRecurring cast and characters\nThis section includes characters who will appear or have appeared in at least three MCU films/series and received main billing credit in at least two franchises.\n\n\nReception\nEarly on, the shared universe element of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was criticized by some journalists Around the release of The Avengers in 2012, Jim Vorel of Herald & Review called the Marvel Cinematic Universe \"complicated\" and \"impressive\", but said, \"As more and more heroes get their own film adaptations, the overall universe becomes increasingly confusing.\" [316] Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant stated that while The Avengers was a success, \"Marvel Studios still has room to improve their approach to building a shared movie universe\" [317] Some reviewers criticized the fact that the desire to create a shared universe led to films that did not hold as well on their own In his review of Thor: The Dark World, Forbes critic Scott Mendelson likened the MCU to \"a glorified television series\", with The Dark World being a \"'stand-alone' episode that contains little long-range mythology\" [318] Collider's Matt Goldberg considered that while Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger were quality productions, \"they have never really been their own movies\", feeling that the plot detours to S.H.I.E.L.D or lead-ups to The Avengers dragged down the films' narratives [319]\n\n\nCultural impact\nAfter the release of The Avengers in May 2012, Tom Russo of Boston.com noted that aside from the occasional \"novelty\" such as Alien vs Predator (2004), the idea of a shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood [5] Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning \"megafranchises\" for years to come, as opposed to working one blockbuster at a time Amobi added, \"A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust Disney has proved that this  [approach and genre] can be a gold mine.\" [344] With more studios now \"playing the megafranchise game\", Doug Creutz, media analyst for Cowen and Company, feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: \"If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox  [is] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario? I'm not sure they can.\" [344]\n\n\nOther studios\nAfter the release of The Avengers in May 2012, Tom Russo of Boston.com noted that aside from the occasional \"novelty\" such as Alien vs Predator (2004), the idea of a shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood [5] Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning \"megafranchises\" for years to come, as opposed to working one blockbuster at a time Amobi added, \"A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust Disney has proved that this  [approach and genre] can be a gold mine.\" [344] With more studios now \"playing the megafranchise game\", Doug Creutz, media analyst for Cowen and Company, feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: \"If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox  [is] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario?

Pictures\nIn October 2012, following its legal victory over Joe Shuster's estate for the rights to Superman, Warner Bros Pictures announced that it planned to move ahead with its long-awaited Justice League film, uniting such DC Comics superheroes as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a team-up film [346] The release of Man of Steel in 2013 was intended to be the start of a new shared universe for DC, \"laying the groundwork for the future slate of films based on DC Comics\" [347] In 2014, Warner Bros announced that slate of films, similarly to Disney and Marvel claiming dates for films years in advance [348] That year, DC chief creative officer Geoff Johns stated that the television series Arrow and The Flash were set in a separate universe from the new film one, [349] later clarifying that \"We look at it as the multiverse We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through .. It's just a different approach  [from Marvel's].\" [350]\n\n\n20th Century Fox\nIn November 2012, 20th Century Fox announced plans to create their own shared universe, consisting of Marvel properties that it held the rights to including the Fantastic Four and X-Men, with the hiring of Mark Millar as supervising producer Millar said, \"Fox are thinking, 'We're sitting on some really awesome things here There is another side of the Marvel Universe Let's try and get some cohesiveness going.' So they brought me in to oversee that really To meet with the writers and directors to suggest new ways we could take this stuff and new properties that could spin out of it.\" [355] X-Men: Days of Future Past, released in 2014, was Fox's first step towards expanding their stable of Marvel properties and creating this universe, [356] ahead of the release of a Fantastic Four reboot film the next year [357] In May 2014, Days of Future Past and Fantastic Four screenwriter Simon Kinberg stated that the latter film would not take place in the same universe as the X-Men films, explaining that \"none of the X-Men movies have acknowledged the notion of a sort of superhero team—the Fantastic Four And the Fantastic Four acquire powers, so for them to live in a world where mutants are prevalent is kind of complicated, because you're like, 'Oh, you're just a mutant.' Like, 'What's so fantastic about you?' .. they live in discrete universes.\" [357] In July 2015, X-Men director Bryan Singer said that there was still potential for a crossover between the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises, if reactions to Fantastic Four and X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) warranted it [358]\n\n\nSony Pictures\nIn November 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal announced that the studio intended to expand their universe created within director Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films (2012–14), with spin-off adventures for supporting characters, in an attempt to replicate Marvel and Disney's model [356] The next month, Sony announced Venom and Sinister Six films, both set in the Amazing Spider-Man universe With this announcement, IGN stated that the spin-offs are \"the latest example of what we can refer to as \"the Avengers effect\" in Hollywood, as studios work to build interlocking movie universes.\" [360] Sony chose not to replicate the Marvel Studios model of introducing individual characters first before bringing them together in a team-up film, instead making the Spider-Man adversaries the stars of future films [344] In February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that the Spider-Man franchise would be retooled, with a new film co-produced by Feige and Pascal being released in July 2017, and the character being integrated into the MCU Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own, and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films [361] With this announcement, sequels to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) were canceled, [362] and by November 2015 the Venom and Sinister Six films, as well as spin-offs based on female characters in the Spider-Man universe, were no longer moving forward [362] [363] By March 2016, the Venom film had itself been retooled, to start its own franchise unrelated to the MCU Spider-Man [364] A year later, Sony officially announced the Venom film to be in development, for an October 5, 2018, release, [365] along with a film centered on the characters Silver Sable and Black Cat known as Silver & Black [366] Both projects were not intended to be a part of the MCU nor spin-offs to Spider-Man: Homecoming, but rather part of an intended separate shared universe known as the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) [366] [367] [368] The mid-credits scene of Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) hinted at Eddie Brock / Venom joining the MCU, [369] which was confirmed with the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) through an uncredited cameo appearance in its mid-credits scene [370] Spider-Man: No Way Home also featured the Spider-Man iterations from Sam Raimi and Webb's Spider-Man films, respectively reprised by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield [371]\n\n\nAcademia\nIn September 2014, the University of Baltimore announced a course beginning in the 2015 spring semester revolving around the Marvel Cinematic Universe, to be taught by Arnold T Blumberg \"Media Genres: Media Marvels\" examines \"how Marvel's series of interconnected films and television shows, plus related media and comic book sources and Joseph Campbell's monomyth of the 'hero's journey', offer important insights into modern culture\" as well as Marvel's efforts \"to establish a viable universe of plotlines, characters, and backstories.\" [374] [375]\n\n\nOutside

Age of Ultron and Ant-Man, as well as footage from the Agent Carter television series previously screened at New York Comic Con [428] Brian Lowry of Variety felt an hour for the special did not \"do the topic justice\" adding, \"For anyone who has seen more than one Marvel movie but would shrug perplexedly at the mention of Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko, Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp To Pop! should probably be required viewing Fun, fast-paced and encompassing many of the company's highlights along with a few lowlights, it's a solid primer on Marvel's history, while weaving in inevitable self-promotion and synergistic plugs.\" [429] Eric Goldman of IGN also wished the special had been longer, adding, \"Understandably, the more you already know about Marvel, the less you'll be surprised by Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, but it's important to remember who this special is really made for – a mainstream audience who have embraced the Marvel characters, via the hugely successful movies, in a way no one could have imagined.\" [428]\n\n\nMarvel Studios: Expanding the Universe (2019)\nThe special Expanding the Universe was released on Disney+ on November 12, 2019 It

the promotion of her debut record [37] [38]\n\n\n2018–2020: El mal querer and international recognition\nThe recording cycle for Rosalía's second studio album, El mal querer, began in early 2017 as her baccalaureate project, graduating from the Catalonia College of Music [42] She personally chose to work alongside Spanish musician el Guincho and spawned its concept alongside friend Ferran Echegaray, who bet on the Romance of Flamenca to follow the album's storyline Despite having no budget to produce the record as she was an independent artist working on a university project, Rosalía invested a lot of her own money, to the point of \"almost going bankrupt\" The album was almost completely recorded at el Guincho's apartment in Barcelona with a computer, a microphone and a sound table It would mix traditional flamenco with today's pop and urban music.\n\n\n2020–2023: Collaborations and Motomami\nRecording sessions for Rosalía's third studio album started as early as 2019 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rosalía relocated to Miami where she continued to work on the album while also providing vocals to multiple songs [81] [82] [83] On 4 September 2020, a remix of Sech's

fourth top-ten hit on the latter chart [116] It also debuted at number 97 on the US Billboard Hot 100 [117]\n\n\nArtistry\nRosalía's music has been described as \"challenging\" both for her and for the listener [119] Noted for the conceptuality and constant genre transformation of her albums and singles, Rosalía's music has evolved from folk to the mainstream and avant-pop As Rosalía has a master's degree in flamenco interpretation, she started her professional career as a full flamenco singer 2017 saw the release of her debut album Los Ángeles, a folk record in which Rosalía \"is posited as the contemporary cantaora who has better understood the current times\" [120] The singer has, ever since, been described as \"an old soul trapped in a young body\" due to the maturity of the genre [121] After the release of \"Malamente\" in May 2018, which rose the singer's popularity to a national level, her music was described as a \"heavily exciting fusion of flamenco and modern arts\" American magazine Pitchfork called the singer's voice \"a soft liquid velvet\" and wrote that \"Malamente consumes the listener with drums and soft synthesizers that drag you to their world completely\" After releasing El mal querer later that year, The Guardian gave it a perfect score and stated: \"the Catalan singer's potent, smart second album is more complex than any Latin pop currently in the charts\" [6] During the three-year droplet era that started with the 2019 release \"Con altura\", Rosalía's music evolved to a more mainstream urbano field without leaving the flamenco essence that characterizes her artistry [122] Described by Rolling Stone as \"one of the most daring and reckless productions of recent years\", Rosalía's 2022 studio album Motomami \"redefined mainstream\" by taking reggaeton as its main influence and blending it with traditional music of Latin America as well as with other genres such as industrial or jazz [123] The singer has stated that she listens to a vast catalogue of music specially when she is making a record in the urge to learn about them Rosalía has cited the 2011 eponymous album by James Blake as one of the most impactful records of her life.\n\n\nMusical style and genres\nRosalía's music has been described as \"challenging\" both for her and for the listener [119] Noted for the conceptuality and constant

record in the urge to learn about them Rosalía has cited the 2011 eponymous album by James Blake as one of the most impactful records of her life.\n\n\nInfluences\nRosalía has cited Camarón de la Isla, James Blake and Björk as her major musical influences In 2019 she told MTV \"when I was 13 years old I started listening to him  [Camarón de la Isla] by chance This genre, flamenco, was what my high-school friends listened to and so did I When I discovered him I was like 'oh my God!' I didn't think anyone was capable to sing with such a voice; it would go right through me so heartily He was my introduction to flamenco Thanks to him I discovered this vast universe within this music style which is almost endless and very exciting.\" Another flamenco influence of Rosalía is La Niña de los Peines She states that despite not enjoying her recordings at first, she ended up appreciating her melodies and realized that she was a true pioneer since most flamenco singers were men at the time she became popular She said: \"flamenco is a masculine art form by tradition and there she was, with all her creativity as a woman She became a professional at the time when it was very unusual\" [131]\n\n\nImpact\nRosalía has been mentioned as an influence by a number of artists including Christina Aguilera, [142] Tate McRae, [143] Camila Cabello, [144] Lauren Jauregui, [145] Marina Satti, [146] Judeline, [147] Julieta, [148] Ralphie Choo, [149] and Maria Hein [150]\n\n\nSpanish music industry\nForbes named Rosalía in their list of \"Most Influential Spanish Women\" in 2020 [151] and in 2022 [152] In 2021, Pitchfork named Rosalía one of the most important artists of the last 25 years [153]\n\n\nOn cultural appropriation\nThe popularization of new flamenco nationally and worldwide has allowed new artists such as María José Llergo to reach a wider audience internationally In 2020, The Atlantic stated that Rosalía had \"turned the harrowing music of Andalusia into a global phenomenon.\" [154] Rosalía has been credited with inspiring contemporary artists like Marina, Kacey Musgraves, and Christina Aguilera [155] [156] [157] The resurgence of flamenco music alongside Rosalía's work has led to discussions of cultural appropriation, sometimes dubbed \"the Rosalía polemic\" [158] [159] Rosalía has been accused of stealing the culture of the Spanish Romani people (Gitanos), who claim this artistic expression as their own, as it has been one of the few ways of free cultural expression Gitanos had available to them in the face of discrimination and persecution within wider society [160] Purists view flamenco performances by Catalans, non-Gitanos, or non-Andalusians, such as Rosalía, as unfair and illegitimate [161] Others have defended [who?] Rosalía, saying that, in a global interconnected world, where exposure to cultural traditions and art forms are widely accessed, Rosalía's success can inspire international appreciation of this art form and compare the situation to Madonna's use of Spanish traditions sparking international interest in Spanish culture and art [162]\n\n\nBusiness and ventures\nIn November 2018, Rosalía released a limited fashion line in collaboration with Pull&Bear, inspired in the music video for \"Malamente\" [170] A second limited edition line was released in May 2019 [171] In September 2020, she launched a solidary lipstick collection with MAC Cosmetics, donating 100% of proceeds in support of women, youth and the LGBT community to a MAC-related fund [172] A second limited eye shadow collection with MAC was released a year later [173] After starring in an Air Max 2090 commercial, Rosalía teamed up with Nike in March 2021 to design espadrilles-like Air Force 1s, a folkloric compliment manifested in Catalan culture [174] These, however, were never commercialized [175] In 2022, Rosalía became a brand ambassador for Skims [176] In January 2023, she teamed up with Coca-Cola Creations to create a \"transformation-flavored\" Coke marketed as Move She released the single \"LLYLM\" (Lie Like You Love Me) to promote the drink Later in March she reimagined the interlude \"Abcdefg\", from her album Motomami, in a commercial for SEAT's Cupra brand [177] A

to \"promote, construct, purchase, sale, lease and create the general marketing of all kinds of buildings\" [179] Her mother María Pilar Tobella became as its chairperson and CEO [180] Through

Tangana They co-wrote eight of the eleven songs of Rosalía's sophomore album El mal querer and twice collaborated vocally They broke up in May 2018 Since then, they have referenced each other in songs, social media posts, interviews and music videos In April 2020, Tangana told the press that there \"exists a good friendship between the two\" [186] Rosalía unfollowed and blocked Tangana on social media in December 2020 after he spoke about her disparagingly in an interview.\n\n\nPolitical views and religion\nRosalía identifies as a feminist After being congratulated at the 2019 Billboard Women in Music gala, the singer stated: \"I was fifteen when I entered a recording studio for the first time having all these women as references I was so shocked by the fact that there were only men in that session that, since that moment, I've been fighting for having the same number of men and women in the studio As simple as that\" [198] Rosalía has a garter belt buckle tattooed on her left thigh in reference to a 1970 body art performance by Valie Export In the tattoo, the garter appears as a symbol of a past slavery, the dress as the suppression of sexuality, the garter as an attribute of a femininity not determined by ourselves A social ritual that covers one of the physical needs, the opposition of our culture to the body is clear The garter as a sign of belonging to a class that demands a specific behavior becomes a memory [199] Rosalía is also pro-choice During a concert in Mexico, she wore a green handkerchief in support of the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe and Free Abortion [200] The singer is also a firm LGBT supporter All profits from her Viva Glam cosmetic campaign were to be given in support of women, youth and the LGBT community [172]

about \"Rosalía_(singer)\" following this outline:\n\n\nLife and career\nRosalia Vila Tobella was born in Sant Cugat del Vallès, Catalonia, in 1992, although she was raised in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, Baix Llobregat [17] Born in a Catalan-speaking family with no artistic background, she is the youngest daughter of María Pilar Tobella Aguilera, a businesswoman of Catalan descent who runs Suprametal, SA, a family company specialising in metalworks founded by Rosalía's grandfather Jaume Tobella Bosch (1933-2019) Her father, José Manuel Vila, was born in Cudillero, Asturias, to a Galician father and an Andalusian mother, with one of his grandfathers being Cuban Her parents separated in 2019 [18] Rosalía has an older sister, Pilar \"Pili\" Vila (born 1989), who works with her as her stylist and creative director The song G3 N15 is dedicated to Vila's son, Genís.\n\n\n1992–2016: Early life and career beginnings\nRosalia Vila Tobella was born in Sant Cugat del Vallès, Catalonia, in 1992, although she was raised in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, Baix Llobregat [17] Born in a Catalan-speaking family with no artistic background, she is the youngest daughter of María Pilar Tobella Aguilera, a

(born 1989), who works with her as her stylist and creative director The song G3 N15 is dedicated to Vila's son, Genís.\n\n\n2016–2017: Los Ángeles\nIn 2016, Rosalía performed to a crowd of a hundred people at the Tablao del Carmen, a flamenco specialized venue at the Pueblo Español, in Barcelona In the audience was Raül Refree, whom she invited to the show [30] They began working on two albums together [31] Rosalía signed with Universal Music later in 2016, and she relocated to California [32] She went on to only release Los Ángeles [33] The album talks about death in a dark way with aggressive guitar chords by Refree [34] It presents reworks of flamenco classics receiving several accolades [35] She was nominated for Best New Artist at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards The album was released on 10 February 2017 through Universal Music and spawned two singles, \"Catalina\", released in October 2016, and \"De Plata\", released in May 2017 The album was very well received by critics Jordi Bardají wrote in 2018 that the record was \"one of the greatest 'sleepers' that Spanish sales lists have known in recent times.\" Los Ángeles reached its peak position of number nine on 11 November 2018 and has remained in the albums chart since its entry, having accumulated a total of 89 weeks Los Ángeles won the \"Album of the Year\" award at the Time Out Awards and the Premio Ruido, among others [36] In 2017, RTVE contacted Rosalía to participate in the pre-selection to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017, which she declined because of scheduling conflicts with the promotion of her debut record [37] [38]\n\n\n2018–2020: El mal querer and international recognition\nThe recording cycle for Rosalía's second studio album, El mal querer, began in early 2017 as her baccalaureate project, graduating from the Catalonia College of Music [42] She personally chose to work alongside Spanish musician el Guincho and spawned its concept alongside friend Ferran Echegaray, who bet on the Romance of Flamenca to follow the album's storyline Despite having no budget to produce the record as she was an independent artist working on a university project, Rosalía invested a lot of her own money, to the point of \"almost going bankrupt\" The album was almost completely recorded at el Guincho's apartment in Barcelona with a computer, a microphone and a sound table It would mix traditional flamenco with today's pop and urban music.\n\n\n2020–2023: Collaborations and Motomami\nRecording sessions for Rosalía's third studio album started as early as 2019 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rosalía relocated to Miami where she continued to work on the album while also providing vocals to multiple songs [81] [82] [83] On 4 September 2020, a remix of Sech's \"Relación\", which also features Daddy Yankee, Farruko and J Balvin, was released, earning Rosalía her second entry on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at 64 [84] She also took part in Bad Bunny's third solo studio album, El Último Tour del Mundo, on the track \"La Noche de Anoche\", which was later released as a single on Valentine's Day [85] [86] The collaboration, performed on Saturday Night Live, became a huge commercial success, debuting at number two on the Spotify global chart with 6.63 million streams in a single day, marking the biggest debut for a song fully sung in Spanish in history [87] A week later, she collaborated alongside the Weeknd on the remix of \"Blinding Lights\" and, in January, with Billie Eilish on \"Lo Vas a Olvidar\", which was featured in a special episode of Euphoria [88] [89] Rosalía later collaborated with Oneohtrix Point Never and Tokischa on \"Nothing's Special\" and \"Linda\" respectively [90] [91]\n\n\n2024–present\nOn 16 August 2024, Rosalía was featured on Thai rapper Lisa's single \"New Woman\" [115] The song debuted at number 15 on the Billboard Global 200 and at number six on the Billboard Global Excl U.S., becoming Lisa's fourth top-ten hit on the latter chart [116] It also debuted at number 97 on the US Billboard Hot 100 [117]\n\n\nArtistry\nRosalía's music has been described as \"challenging\" both for her and for the listener [119] Noted for the conceptuality and constant genre transformation of her albums and singles, Rosalía's music has evolved from folk to the mainstream and avant-pop As Rosalía has a master's degree in flamenco interpretation, she started her professional career as a full flamenco singer 2017 saw the release of her debut album Los Ángeles, a folk record in which Rosalía \"is posited as the contemporary cantaora who has better understood the current times\" [120] The singer has, ever since, been described as \"an old soul trapped in a young body\" due to the maturity of the genre [121] After the release of \"Malamente\" in May 2018, which rose the singer's popularity to a national level, her music was described as a \"heavily exciting fusion of flamenco and modern arts\" American magazine Pitchfork called the singer's voice \"a soft liquid velvet\" and wrote that \"Malamente consumes the listener with drums and soft synthesizers that drag you to their world completely\" After releasing El mal querer later that year, The Guardian gave it a perfect score and stated: \"the Catalan singer's potent, smart second album is more complex than any Latin pop currently in the charts\" [6] During the three-year droplet era that started with the 2019 release \"Con altura\", Rosalía's music evolved to a more mainstream urbano field without leaving the flamenco essence that characterizes her artistry [122] Described by Rolling Stone as \"one of the most daring and reckless productions of recent years\", Rosalía's 2022 studio album Motomami \"redefined mainstream\" by taking reggaeton as its main influence and blending it with traditional music of Latin America as well as with other genres such as industrial or jazz [123] The singer has stated that she listens to a vast catalogue of music specially when she is making a record in the urge to learn about them Rosalía has cited the 2011 eponymous album by James Blake as one of the most impactful records of her life.\n\n\nMusical style and genres\nRosalía's music has been described as \"challenging\" both for her and for the listener [119] Noted for the conceptuality and constant

record in the urge to learn about them Rosalía has cited the 2011 eponymous album by James Blake as one of the most impactful records of her life.\n\n\nInfluences\nRosalía has cited Camarón de la Isla, James Blake and Björk as her major musical influences In 2019 she told MTV \"when I was 13 years old I started listening to him  [Camarón de la Isla] by chance This genre, flamenco, was what my high-school friends listened to and so did I When I discovered him I was like 'oh my God!' I didn't think anyone was capable to sing with such a voice; it would go right through me so heartily He was my introduction to flamenco Thanks to him I discovered this vast universe within this music style which is almost endless and very exciting.\" Another flamenco influence of Rosalía is La Niña de los Peines She states that despite not enjoying her recordings at first, she ended up appreciating her melodies and realized that she was a true pioneer since most flamenco singers were men at the time she became popular She said: \"flamenco is a masculine art form by tradition and there she was, with all her creativity as a woman She became a professional at the time when it was very unusual\" [131]\n\n\nImpact\nRosalía has been mentioned as an influence by a number of artists including Christina Aguilera, [142] Tate McRae, [143] Camila Cabello, [144] Lauren Jauregui, [145] Marina Satti, [146] Judeline, [147] Julieta, [148] Ralphie Choo, [149] and Maria Hein [150]\n\n\nSpanish music industry\nForbes named Rosalía in their list of \"Most Influential Spanish Women\" in 2020 [151] and in 2022 [152] In 2021, Pitchfork named Rosalía one of the most important artists of the last 25 years [153]\n\n\nOn cultural appropriation\nThe popularization of new flamenco nationally and worldwide has allowed new artists such as María José Llergo to reach a wider audience internationally In 2020, The Atlantic stated that Rosalía had \"turned the harrowing music of Andalusia into a global phenomenon.\" [154] Rosalía has been credited with inspiring contemporary artists like Marina, Kacey Musgraves, and Christina Aguilera [155] [156] [157] The resurgence of flamenco music alongside Rosalía's work has led to discussions of cultural appropriation, sometimes dubbed \"the Rosalía polemic\" [158] [159] Rosalía has been accused of stealing the culture of the Spanish Romani people (Gitanos), who claim this artistic expression as their own, as it has been one of the few ways of free cultural expression Gitanos had available to them in the face of discrimination and persecution within wider society [160] Purists view flamenco performances by Catalans, non-Gitanos, or non-Andalusians, such as Rosalía, as unfair and illegitimate [161] Others have defended [who?] Rosalía, saying that, in a global interconnected world, where exposure to cultural traditions and art forms are widely accessed, Rosalía's success can inspire international appreciation of this art form and compare the situation to Madonna's use of Spanish traditions sparking international interest in Spanish culture and art [162]\n\n\nBusiness and ventures\nIn November 2018, Rosalía released a limited fashion line in collaboration with Pull&Bear, inspired in the music video for \"Malamente\" [170] A second limited edition line was released in May 2019 [171] In September 2020, she launched a solidary lipstick collection with MAC Cosmetics, donating 100% of proceeds in support of women, youth and the LGBT community to a MAC-related fund [172] A second limited eye shadow collection with MAC was released a year later [173] After starring in an Air Max 2090 commercial, Rosalía teamed up with Nike in March 2021 to design espadrilles-like Air Force 1s, a folkloric compliment manifested in Catalan culture [174] These, however, were never commercialized [175] In 2022, Rosalía became a brand ambassador for Skims [176] In January 2023, she teamed up with Coca-Cola Creations to create a \"transformation-flavored\" Coke marketed as Move She released the single \"LLYLM\" (Lie Like You Love Me) to promote the drink Later in March she reimagined the interlude \"Abcdefg\", from her album Motomami, in a commercial for SEAT's Cupra brand [177] A collaboration between Rosalía and Zara is expected to launch in late 2024 [178]\n\n\nProducts and endorsements\nIn November 2018, Rosalía released a limited fashion line in collaboration with Pull&Bear, inspired in the music video for \"Malamente\" [170] A second limited edition line was released in May 2019 [171] In September 2020, she launched a solidary lipstick collection with MAC

brand [177] A collaboration between Rosalía and Zara is expected to launch in late 2024 [178]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nOn 12 February 2024, Rosalía's family constitued a new company, Tresmamis SL, settled to \"promote, construct, purchase, sale, lease and create the general marketing of all kinds of buildings\" [179] Her mother María Pilar Tobella became as its chairperson and CEO [180] Through Tresmamis SL, Rosalía is expected to build a recording studio complex in the future Cultural District in l'Hospitalet de Llobregat [181]\n\n\nPersonal life\nShe is of paternal Asturian and maternal Catalan heritage One of her great-grandfathers was Cuban [182] [183] She is fluent in Catalan, Spanish and English [184] [185]\n\n\nRelationships\nIn 2016, Rosalía started dating Spanish rapper C Tangana They co-wrote eight of the eleven songs of Rosalía's sophomore album El mal querer and twice collaborated vocally They broke up in May 2018 Since then, they have referenced each other in songs, social media posts, interviews and music videos In April 2020, Tangana told the press that there \"exists a good friendship between the two\" [186] Rosalía unfollowed and blocked Tangana on social media in December 2020 after he spoke about her disparagingly in an interview.\n\n\nPolitical views and religion\nRosalía identifies as a feminist After being congratulated at the 2019 Billboard Women in Music gala, the singer stated: \"I was fifteen when I entered a recording studio for the first time having all these women as references I was so shocked by the fact that there were only men in that session that, since that moment, I've been fighting for having the same number of men and women in the studio As simple as that\" [198] Rosalía has a garter belt buckle tattooed on her left thigh in reference to a 1970 body art performance by Valie Export In the tattoo, the garter appears as a symbol of a past slavery, the dress as the suppression of sexuality, the garter as an attribute of a femininity not determined by ourselves A social ritual that covers one of the physical needs, the opposition of our culture to the body is clear The garter as a sign of belonging to a class that demands a specific behavior becomes a memory [199] Rosalía is also pro-choice During a concert in Mexico, she wore a green handkerchief in support of the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe and Free Abortion [200] The singer is also a firm LGBT supporter All profits from her Viva Glam cosmetic campaign were to be given in support of women, youth and the LGBT community [172] [201] In July 2021, she condemned the killing of Samuel Luiz, stating, \"Samuel didn't die, he was assassinated\" [202]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nMusic

{"title": "Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024", "content": "\nGeneral path of shadow\nThe totality of the solar eclipse was visible in a strip beginning in the Pacific Ocean, the edge of which passed approximately 60 kilometers north of Penrhyn atoll, [14] 115 kilometers south of Starbuck Island, 275 kilometers north of Vostok Island, and 370 kilometers north of the Marquesas Islands Later, the total solar eclipse was visible from North America, starting from the west coast of Mexico then ascending in a northeasterly direction through Mexico, the United States, and Canada, before ending in the Atlantic Ocean about 700 kilometers southwest of Ireland [15]\n\n\nVisibility in the Americas\nTotality first passed over the Revillagigedo Islands (a federal possession of Mexico and associated with Colima state) and Islas Marías of Nayarit Upon reaching the continental mainland, totality passed through the states of Sinaloa (including Mazatlán), northern Nayarit, Durango (including the city of Durango and Gómez \nPalacio), extreme southeast Chihuahua, and Coahuila (including Torreón, Matamoros, Monclova, Sabinas, Ciudad Acuña, and Piedras Negras) [16] [17] [18]\nA partial eclipse was visible across the remainder of the country, including 79% coverage of the solar disc in Mexico City [19] Torreón was the most populous Mexican city in the path of totality.\n\n\nMexico\nTotality first passed over the Revillagigedo Islands (a federal possession of Mexico and associated with Colima state) and Islas Marías of Nayarit Upon reaching the continental mainland, totality passed through the states of Sinaloa (including Mazatlán), northern Nayarit, Durango (including the city of Durango and Gómez \nPalacio), extreme southeast Chihuahua, and Coahuila (including Torreón,

City [19] Torreón was the most populous Mexican city in the path of totality.\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, totality was visible through the states of Texas (including parts of San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth, and all of Arlington, Dallas, Killeen, Temple, Texarkana, Tyler, Sulphur Springs, and Waco); Oklahoma (including Idabel and Broken Bow); Arkansas (including Morrilton/Petit Jean, Hot Springs, Searcy, Jonesboro, and Little Rock); Missouri (including Cape Girardeau and Poplar Bluff); Tennessee (extreme northwestern corner of Lake County); Illinois (including Carbondale, where it intersected the path of the 2017 eclipse); Kentucky; Indiana (including Bloomington, Evansville, Indianapolis, Anderson, Muncie, Terre Haute, and Vincennes); Ohio (including Akron, Cleveland, Dayton, Lima, Lorain, Roundhead,Toledo, and Warren); Michigan (extreme southeastern corner of Monroe County); Pennsylvania (including Erie); Upstate New York (including Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Rochester, Syracuse, Watertown, the Adirondacks, Potsdam, and Plattsburgh); northern Vermont (including Burlington); New Hampshire; and Maine; [20] [21] with the line of totality going almost directly over the state's highest point Mount Katahdin The largest city that was entirely in the path was Dallas, Texas [22] It was the second total eclipse visible from the central United States in just seven years, after the eclipse of August 21, 2017 It will be the last total solar eclipse visible in the contiguous United States until August 23, 2044 [23]\n\n\nCanada\nIn Canada, totality was visible through parts of Southern Ontario (including Leamington, Fort Erie, [27] Hamilton, Niagara Falls, Kingston, Prince Edward County, and Cornwall), [28] parts of southern Quebec (including Montreal, Sherbrooke, Saint-Georges, and Lac-Mégantic), central New Brunswick (including Fredericton, Woodstock and Miramichi), [29] western Prince Edward Island (including Tignish and Summerside), [30] [31] the northern tip of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, [32] and central Newfoundland (including Gander and Grand Falls-Windsor) Then, it ended on the eastern Atlantic coast of Newfoundland [33] The most populous Canadian city that the path of totality intersected was Montreal Windsor, London, Toronto, and Ottawa lay just north of the path of totality, and Moncton just south of it [34] [35]\n\n\nCentral America and South America\nThe partial eclipse was seen in all Central American countries, from Belize to Panama, all the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica), and northern South America (Colombia) [24]\n\n\nLargest cities and recommended viewing sites\nSpace.com identified the ten largest cities where totality was visible In population order, they were: [9]\n\n\nVisibility in other continents\nA partial eclipse passed over Svalbard (Norway), Iceland, Ireland, western parts of the United Kingdom, north-western parts of Spain and Portugal, the Azores, and the Canary Islands [40] Cloud cover prevented views of it from most of the British Isles, [41] [42] although it was seen in Western Scotland [43] Unusually, this eclipse extended below the horizon, where the greatest phase was observed at mid-nautical twilight in Galicia (Spain) and the beginning of astronomical twilight in Nouvelle-Aquitaine (France) [44] The extension of the eclipse path within the twilight zone created what was likely the best observation window for the 12P/Pons–Brooks comet located closely to Jupiter [45]\n\n\nEurope\nA partial eclipse passed over Svalbard (Norway), Iceland, Ireland, western parts of the United Kingdom, north-western parts of Spain and Portugal, the Azores, and the Canary Islands [40] Cloud cover prevented views of it from most of the British Isles, [41] [42] although it was seen in Western Scotland [43] Unusually, this eclipse extended below the horizon, where the greatest phase was observed at mid-nautical twilight in Galicia (Spain) and the beginning of astronomical twilight in Nouvelle-Aquitaine (France) [44] The extension of the eclipse path within the twilight zone created what was likely the best observation window for the 12P/Pons–Brooks comet located closely to Jupiter [45]\n\n\nOceania\nThe partial eclipse was seen in Hawaii, eastern Kiribati (the eastern Phoenix Islands and the whole Line Islands), Tokelau, American Samoa except for its extreme western part, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, and the Pitcairn Islands Although all located east of the 180th meridian, the local time of the eclipse in Kiribati and Tokelau was Tuesday, April 9, 2024, because either UTC+13 or UTC+14 is observed in these areas [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe magnitude of an eclipse, or the ratio of the angular diameter of the Moon to the angular diameter of the Sun, must be one or greater for a total eclipse to occur The Moon was near perigee (the closest point in its orbit to Earth) during this eclipse Occurring only about 24 hours after perigee (on April 7, 2024, at 18:50 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was larger [49] The Sun had an angular diameter of 31'56\" at the moment of greatest eclipse As the magnitude of this eclipse at that time was 1.0566, the angular diameter of the Moon was 1.0566 times that of the Sun, or 33'44\" This gave the eclipse a wider path of totality and more maximum time in totality (4 min 28 s) compared to the total eclipse in 2017 (2 min 40 s), which had a magnitude of 1.0306.\n\n\nMagnitude\nThe magnitude of an eclipse, or the ratio of the angular diameter of the Moon to the angular diameter of the Sun, must be one or greater for a total eclipse to occur The Moon was near perigee (the closest point in its orbit to Earth) during this eclipse Occurring only about 24 hours after perigee (on April 7, 2024, at 18:50 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was larger [49] The Sun had an angular diameter of 31'56\" at the moment of greatest eclipse As the magnitude of this eclipse at that time was 1.0566, the angular diameter of the Moon was 1.0566 times that of the Sun, or 33'44\" This gave the eclipse a wider path of totality and more maximum time in totality (4 min 28 s) compared to the total eclipse in 2017 (2 min 40 s), which had a magnitude of 1.0306.\n\n\nSolar prominences\nThe eclipse occurred around the solar maximum, a period of greatest solar activity in the Sun's 11-year solar cycle, and it was anticipated that solar prominences would be visible during totality [50] Many observers reported seeing solar prominences during the event [51] [52] [53] Most plainly visible to the naked eye was a very bright red point of light near the lowest portion of the Sun's disk, which on telescopic views and photographs showed as a tent-shaped angular structure The red and pink hues were the result of hydrogen and helium plasma being thrown up in broad arcs but never leaving the sun's atmosphere [54] [55] Telescopic photographs revealed the western limb having several smaller, irregular shapes, of which one large, ragged shape appeared disconnected from the Sun's surface on one side Several smaller prominences were also visible on the eastern limb, though because of the eclipse's relatively high magnitude, prominences on both limbs could not be viewed at the same time  These shapes correlate in detail with the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory solar telescope images taken in space at the same as the earthbound eclipse, and with images from the ground-based National Solar Observatory GONG telescope in Cerro Tololo, Chile.\n\n\nShadow bands\nThe shadow bands phenomenon was observed and documented in some locations with clear skies Attempts to observe and record shadow bands on the ground were disappointed in many areas of totality by the phenomenon not appearing in the event, perhaps having been washed out by the diffuse illumination of cloudy skies in various locations [56] [57]\n\n\nEclipse path intersections\nThe path of the April 8, 2024, eclipse crossed the path of the previous American total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois, in Makanda, just south of Carbondale [58]\n\n\nImpact\nIt was projected before the eclipse that there could be a $6 billion boost to the US economy due to the eclipse The Mayor of Rochester, New York, Malik Evans, told reporters that the city was expected to bring in between $10–12 million to the city's economy from the Friday before the

a $6 billion boost to the US economy due to the eclipse The Mayor of Rochester, New York, Malik Evans, told reporters that the city was expected to bring in between $10–12 million to the city's economy from the Friday before the eclipse to the day of it [60] [61] However, the day was cloudy On April 12 New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced record breaking tourism numbers between April 6-9, that was a 45% increase compared to 2023, with nearly one million visitors to New York State parks and over 5.5 million toll transactions recorded [62]\n\n\nTraffic\nHighways in the area of totality saw significant increases in traffic, with departing tourists caught in traffic jams lasting up to eight hours [69] Many of those trying to drive down Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, for example, found themselves in jams lasting until at least 2 a.m the following morning, resulting in numerous cars breaking down [70] Drivers and passengers spent four to six hours to pass through Franconia Notch where Interstate 93 is reduced to a single lane in each direction Major highways in the state remained crowded through rush hour the following morning and into the afternoon [71] A similar effect was seen during the following morning's rush hour in northbound Interstate 65 in Indianapolis [72] In Vermont there were an estimated 60,000 additional cars and 248 inbound aircraft over the span of the eclipse weekend, with about 160,000 visitors coming into the state per Secretary of Transportation Joe Flynn [73] Drivers in southern Illinois leaving the region of totality to the north toward St Louis, Missouri faced more than 80 miles of stop-and-go heavy congestion [74] Unlike other regions, traffic was lighter in Texas than the state's Department of Transportation had anticipated [68]\n\n\nAnimal behavior\nZookeepers, naturalists, university researchers, and citizen scientists positioned themselves to observe animal behavior during the eclipse, some with the goal of comparing results with observations made during the 1932 and 2017 total solar eclipses, and others opening new avenues of animal behavioral research Wildlife and zoo animals were observed along the path of totality and in areas that saw only a partial eclipse NASA worked with ARISA Lab, LLC, to recruit thousands of citizen scientists to help record sounds and observations of animal behavior during the eclipse As of 16 April 2024 [update], a total of 3,372 written observations had been submitted by citizen scientists, and 770 recording devices had been registered with the project to provide sound and ultrasound recordings of wildlife and other ambient sounds before, during, and after the eclipse in a standardized way [75]\n\n\nWildlife\nChanges in wild animal behavior were recorded during the eclipse, especially among birds These changes were similar to those observed during the 2017 eclipse, but more pronounced [76] Weather radar was adapted to monitor the activity of flying animals, and birds were observed to decrease their daytime activities [76] Radar imaging demonstrated \"noticeable decreases in typical daytime biological activities such as the movements of hawks and other soaring and insect-eating birds.\" [76] Owls began hooting, and vultures and other birds began to roost [77] A team from Purdue University, observing a variety of ecosystems on wild-lands maintained by the university near Butlerville, Indiana, recorded the songs of 20 different species of birds going quiet, leaving only the songs of the robin and the tufted titmouse during the eclipse [78] Birding students at the University of Vermont observed species at Lake Champlain during the eclipse that had not been observed there before, including Bohemian waxwings, red-tailed hawks, and pileated woodpeckers [79]\n\n\nZoo animals\nAt the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, ostriches returned to their barn and began their evening rituals, such as preening and grooming each other When the sunlight returned, the ostriches left their barn and resumed their daytime activities [82] A group of elephants at the zoo gathered together and began thumping their trunks on the ground [82] At the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas, flamingos bunched together, vocalized, and began marching together, which is a bonding behavior [80] A troop of gorillas at that zoo also gathered at the door to their indoor enclosure, where they were normally fed each evening, and appeared to act confused and frustrated, as if having missed their evening meal [83] [80] The Fort Worth Botanic Garden (FWBG) placed hundreds of butterflies in their conservatory March 1, allowed them to acclimate, and observed them during the eclipse The butterflies \"didn’t roost but instead ceased flying and remained very still.\" [81] Goats at the FWBC were observed resting or sleeping during the eclipse [81] Giraffes at the Dallas Zoo also began to gallop, a behavior witnessed there and at many other zoos during the 2017 eclipse [83] Two aldabra tortoises at the same zoo were observed to rear on their hind legs and attack the door to their indoor enclosure, damaging the door’s frame [83] Lions at the Buffalo Zoo started roaring just before totality [84]\n\n\nResponses\nArkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders preemptively declared a state of emergency related to the eclipse, citing the expected increase of travel to the state which could result in transportation difficulties, such as in Fort Smith, where the police prepared for traffic congestion as hotels filled up [88] [89] Bell County, Texas Judge David Blackburn preemptively declared a state of emergency in February 2024 due to the projected number of visitors to the area [90] The region surrounding Niagara Falls, Ontario, also declared a state of emergency; as an existing major tourist destination along the path of totality, it expected an influx of at least one million visitors on April 8 [91]\n\n\nGallery\nShown below are two tables

It was visible from parts of North America, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n\n**General path of shadow**\n\nThe totality of the solar eclipse was visible in a strip beginning in the Pacific Ocean, the edge of which passed approximately 60 kilometers north of Penrhyn atoll, 115 kilometers south of Starbuck Island, 275 kilometers north of Vostok Island, and 370 kilometers north of the Marquesas Islands. Later, the total solar eclipse was visible from North America, starting from the west coast of Mexico then ascending in a northeasterly direction through Mexico, the United States, and Canada, before ending in the Atlantic Ocean about 700 kilometers southwest of Ireland.\n\n**Visibility in the Americas**\n\nTotality first passed over the Revillagigedo Islands (a federal possession of Mexico and associated with Colima state) and Islas Marías of Nayarit. Upon reaching the continental mainland, totality passed through the states of Sinaloa (including Mazatlán), northern Nayarit, Durango (including the city of Durango and Gómez Palacio), extreme southeast Chihuahua, and Coahuila (including Torreón, Matamoros, Monclova, Sabinas, Ciudad Acuña, and Piedras Negras). A partial eclipse was visible across the remainder of the country, including 79% coverage of the solar disc in Mexico City. Torreón was the most populous Mexican city in the path of totality.\n\n**Mexico**\n\nTotality first passed over the Revillagigedo Islands (a federal possession of Mexico and associated with Colima state) and Islas Marías of Nayarit.

A partial eclipse was visible across the remainder of the country, including 79% coverage of the solar disc in Mexico City. Torreón was the most populous Mexican city in the path of totality.\n\n**United States**\n\nIn the United States, totality was visible through the states of Texas (including parts of San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth, and all of Arlington, Dallas, Killeen, Temple, Texarkana, Tyler, Sulphur Springs, and Waco); Oklahoma (including Idabel and Broken Bow); Arkansas (including Morrilton/Petit Jean, Hot Springs, Searcy, Jonesboro, and Little Rock); Missouri (including Cape Girardeau and Poplar Bluff); Tennessee (extreme northwestern corner of Lake County); Illinois (including Carbondale, where it intersected the path of the 2017 eclipse); Kentucky; Indiana (including Bloomington, Evansville, Indianapolis, Anderson, Muncie, Terre Haute, and Vincennes); Ohio (including Akron, Cleveland, Dayton, Lima, Lorain, Roundhead, Toledo, and Warren); Michigan (extreme southeastern corner of Monroe County); Pennsylvania (including Erie); Upstate New York (including Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Rochester, Syracuse, Watertown, the Adirondacks, Potsdam, and Plattsburgh); northern Vermont (including Burlington); New Hampshire; and Maine; with the line of totality going almost directly over the state's highest point Mount Katahdin. The largest city that was entirely in the path was Dallas, Texas. It was the second total eclipse visible from the central United States in just seven years, after the eclipse of August 21, 2017. It will be the last total solar eclipse visible in the contiguous United States until August 23, 2044.\n\n**Canada**\n\nIn Canada, totality was visible through parts of Southern Ontario (including Leamington, Fort Erie, Hamilton, Niagara Falls, Kingston, Prince Edward County, and Cornwall), parts of southern Quebec (including Montreal, Sherbrooke, Saint-Georges, and Lac-Mégantic), central New Brunswick (including Fredericton, Woodstock and Miramichi), western Prince Edward Island (including Tignish and Summerside), the northern tip of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, and central Newfoundland (including Gander and Grand Falls-Windsor). Then, it ended on the eastern Atlantic coast of Newfoundland. The most populous Canadian city that the path of totality intersected was Montreal. Windsor, London, Toronto, and Ottawa lay just north of the path of totality, and Moncton just south of it.\n\n**Central America and South America**\n\nThe partial eclipse was seen in all Central American countries, from Belize to Panama, all the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica), and northern South America (Colombia).\n\n**Largest cities and recommended viewing sites**\n\nSpace.com identified the ten largest cities where totality was visible. In population order, they were:\n\n1. Mexico City\n2. Dallas, Texas\n3. Monterrey, Mexico\n4. Chicago, Illinois\n5. Houston, Texas\n6. Phoenix, Arizona\n7. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n8. San Antonio, Texas\n9. Austin, Texas\n10. San Diego, California\n\n**Visibility in other continents**\n\nA partial eclipse passed over Svalbard (Norway), Iceland, Ireland, western parts of the United Kingdom, north-western parts of Spain and Portugal, the Azores, and the Canary Islands. Cloud cover prevented views of it from most of the British Isles, although it was seen in Western Scotland. Unusually, this eclipse extended below the horizon, where the greatest phase was observed at mid-nautical twilight in Galicia (Spain) and the beginning of astronomical twilight in Nouvelle-Aquitaine (France). The extension of the eclipse path within the twilight zone created what was likely the best observation window for the 12P/Pons–Brooks comet located closely to Jupiter.\n\n**Europe**\n\nA partial eclipse passed over Svalbard (Norway), Iceland, Ireland, western parts of the United Kingdom, north-western parts of Spain and Portugal, the Azores, and the Canary Islands.

The extension of the eclipse path within the twilight zone created what was likely the best observation window for the 12P/Pons–Brooks comet located closely to Jupiter.\n\n**Oceania**\n\nThe partial eclipse was seen in Hawaii, eastern Kiribati (the eastern Phoenix Islands and the whole Line Islands), Tokelau, American Samoa except for its extreme western part, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, and the Pitcairn Islands. Although all located east of the 180th meridian, the local time of the eclipse in Kiribati and Tokelau was Tuesday, April 9, 2024, because either UTC+13 or UTC+14 is observed in these areas.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe magnitude of an eclipse, or the ratio of the angular diameter of the Moon to the angular diameter of the Sun, must be one or greater for a total eclipse to occur. The Moon was near perigee (the closest point in its orbit to Earth) during this eclipse. Occurring only about 24 hours after perigee (on April 7, 2024, at 18:50 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was larger. The Sun had an angular diameter of 31'56\" at the moment of greatest eclipse. As the magnitude of this eclipse at that time was 1.0566, the angular diameter of the Moon was 1.0566 times that of the Sun, or 33'44\". This gave the eclipse a wider path of totality and more maximum time in totality (4 min 28 s) compared to the total eclipse in 2017 (2 min 40 s), which had a magnitude of 1.0306.\n\n**Magnitude**\n\nThe magnitude of an eclipse, or the ratio of the angular diameter of the Moon to the angular diameter of the Sun, must be one or greater for a total eclipse to occur.

This gave the eclipse a wider path of totality and more maximum time in totality (4 min 28 s) compared to the total eclipse in 2017 (2 min 40 s), which had a magnitude of 1.0306.\n\n**Solar prominences**\n\nThe eclipse occurred around the solar maximum, a period of greatest solar activity in the Sun's 11-year solar cycle, and it was anticipated that solar prominences would be visible during totality. Many observers reported seeing solar prominences during the event. Most plainly visible to the naked eye was a very bright red point of light near the lowest portion of the Sun's disk, which on telescopic views and photographs showed as a tent-shaped angular structure. The red and pink hues were the result of hydrogen and helium plasma being thrown up in broad arcs but never leaving the Sun's atmosphere. Telescopic photographs revealed the western limb having several smaller, irregular shapes, of which one large, ragged shape appeared disconnected from the Sun's surface on one side. Several smaller prominences were also visible on the eastern limb, though because of the eclipse's relatively high magnitude, prominences on both limbs could not be viewed at the same time. These shapes correlate in detail with the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory solar telescope images taken in space at the same as the earthbound eclipse, and with images from the ground-based National Solar Observatory GONG telescope in Cerro Tololo, Chile.\n\n**Shadow bands**\n\nThe shadow bands phenomenon was observed and documented in some locations with clear skies. Attempts to observe and record shadow bands on the ground were disappointed in many areas of totality by the phenomenon not appearing in the event, perhaps having been washed out by the diffuse illumination of cloudy skies in various locations.\n\n**Eclipse path intersections**\n\nThe path of the April 8, 2024, eclipse crossed the path of the previous American total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois, in Makanda, just south of Carbondale.\n\n**Impact**\n\nIt was projected before the eclipse that there could be a $6 billion boost to the US economy due to the eclipse. The Mayor of Rochester, New York, Malik Evans, told reporters that the city was expected to bring in between $10–12 million to the city's economy from the Friday before the eclipse to the day of it. However, the day was cloudy. On April 12, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced record-breaking tourism numbers between April 6-9, that was a 45% increase compared to 2023, with nearly one million visitors to New York State parks and over 5.5 million toll transactions recorded.\n\n**Economy and tourism**\n\nIt was projected before the eclipse that there could be a $6 billion boost to the US economy due to the eclipse.

Many of those trying to drive down Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, for example, found themselves in jams lasting until at least 2 a.m. the following morning, resulting in numerous cars breaking down. Drivers and passengers spent four to six hours to pass through Franconia Notch, where Interstate 93 is reduced to a single lane in each direction. Major highways in the state remained crowded through rush hour the following morning and into the afternoon. A similar effect was seen during the following morning's rush hour in northbound Interstate 65 in Indianapolis. In Vermont, there were an estimated 60,000 additional cars and 248 inbound aircraft over the span of the eclipse weekend, with about 160,000 visitors coming into the state per Secretary of Transportation Joe Flynn. Drivers in southern Illinois leaving the region of totality to the north toward St. Louis, Missouri, faced more than 80 miles of stop-and-go heavy congestion. Unlike other regions, traffic was lighter in Texas than the state's Department of Transportation had anticipated.\n\n**Animal behavior**\n\nZookeepers, naturalists, university researchers, and citizen scientists positioned themselves to observe animal behavior during the eclipse, some with the goal of comparing results with observations made during the 1932 and 2017 total solar eclipses, and others opening new avenues of animal behavioral research. Wildlife and zoo animals were observed along the path of totality and in areas that saw only a partial eclipse. NASA worked with ARISA Lab, LLC, to recruit thousands of citizen scientists to help record sounds and observations of animal behavior during the eclipse. As of April 16, 2024, a total of 3,372 written observations had been submitted by citizen scientists, and 770 recording devices had been registered with the project to provide sound and ultrasound recordings of wildlife and other ambient sounds before, during, and after the eclipse in a standardized way.\n\n**Wildlife**\n\nChanges in wild animal behavior were recorded during the eclipse, especially among birds. These changes were similar to those observed during the 2017 eclipse, but more pronounced. Weather radar was adapted to monitor the activity of flying animals, and birds were observed to decrease their daytime activities. Radar imaging demonstrated \"noticeable decreases in typical daytime biological activities such as the movements of hawks and other soaring and insect-eating birds.\" Owls began hooting, and vultures and other birds began to roost. A team from Purdue University, observing a variety of ecosystems on wild-lands maintained by the university near Butlerville, Indiana, recorded the songs of 20 different species of birds going quiet, leaving only the songs of the robin and the tufted titmouse during the eclipse. Birding students at the University of Vermont observed species at Lake Champlain during the eclipse that had not been observed there before, including Bohemian waxwings, red-tailed hawks, and pileated woodpeckers.\n\n**Zoo animals**\n\nAt the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, ostriches returned to their barn and began their evening rituals, such as preening and grooming each other. When the sunlight returned, the ostriches left their barn and resumed their daytime activities. A group of elephants at the zoo gathered together and began thumping their trunks on the ground. At the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas, flamingos bunched together, vocalized, and began marching together, which is a bonding behavior. A troop of gorillas at that zoo also gathered at the door to their indoor enclosure, where they were normally fed each evening, and appeared to act confused and frustrated, as if having missed their evening meal. At the Fort Worth Botanic Garden (FWBG), hundreds of butterflies were placed in their conservatory, March 1, allowed to acclimate, and observed during the eclipse. The butterflies \"didn't roost but instead ceased flying and remained very still.\" Goats at the FWBG were observed resting or sleeping during the eclipse. Giraffes at the Dallas Zoo also began to gallop, a behavior witnessed there and at many other zoos during the 2017 eclipse. Two aldabra tortoises at the same zoo were observed to rear on their hind legs and attack the door to their indoor enclosure, damaging the door's frame. Lions at the Buffalo Zoo started roaring just before totality.\n\n**Responses**\n\nArkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders preemptively declared a state of emergency related to the eclipse, citing the expected increase of travel to the state, which could result in transportation difficulties, such as in Fort Smith, where the police prepared for traffic congestion as hotels filled up. Bell County, Texas Judge David Blackburn preemptively declared a state of emergency in February 2024 due to the projected number of visitors to the area. The region surrounding Niagara Falls, Ontario, also declared a state of emergency; as an existing major tourist destination along the path of totality, it expected an influx of at least one million visitors on April 8.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nShown below are two tables displaying details about this particular solar eclipse.

Piedras Negras) [16] [17] [18]\nA partial eclipse was visible across the remainder of the country, including 79% coverage of the solar disc in Mexico City [19] Torreón was the most populous Mexican city in the path of totality.\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, totality was visible through the states of Texas (including parts of San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth, and all of Arlington, Dallas, Killeen, Temple, Texarkana, Tyler, Sulphur Springs, and Waco); Oklahoma (including Idabel and Broken Bow); Arkansas (including Morrilton/Petit Jean, Hot Springs, Searcy, Jonesboro, and Little Rock); Missouri (including Cape Girardeau and Poplar Bluff); Tennessee (extreme northwestern corner of Lake County); Illinois (including Carbondale, where it intersected the path of the 2017 eclipse); Kentucky; Indiana (including Bloomington, Evansville, Indianapolis, Anderson, Muncie, Terre Haute, and Vincennes); Ohio (including Akron, Cleveland, Dayton, Lima, Lorain, Roundhead,Toledo, and Warren); Michigan (extreme southeastern corner of Monroe County); Pennsylvania (including Erie); Upstate New York (including Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Rochester, Syracuse, Watertown, the Adirondacks, Potsdam, and Plattsburgh); northern Vermont (including Burlington); New Hampshire; and Maine; [20] [21] with the line of totality going almost directly over the state's highest point Mount Katahdin The largest city that was entirely in the path was Dallas, Texas [22] It was the second total eclipse visible from the central United States in just seven years, after the eclipse of August 21, 2017 It will be the last total solar eclipse visible in the contiguous United States until August 23, 2044 [23]\n\n\nCanada\nIn Canada, totality was visible through parts of Southern Ontario (including Leamington, Fort Erie, [27] Hamilton, Niagara Falls, Kingston, Prince Edward County, and Cornwall), [28] parts of southern Quebec (including Montreal, Sherbrooke, Saint-Georges, and Lac-Mégantic), central New Brunswick (including Fredericton, Woodstock and Miramichi), [29] western Prince Edward Island (including Tignish and Summerside), [30] [31] the northern tip of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, [32] and central Newfoundland (including Gander and Grand Falls-Windsor) Then, it ended on the eastern Atlantic coast of Newfoundland [33] The most populous Canadian city that the path of totality intersected was Montreal Windsor, London, Toronto, and Ottawa lay just north of the path of totality, and Moncton just south of it [34] [35]\n\n\nCentral America and South America\nThe partial eclipse was seen in all Central American countries, from Belize to Panama, all the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica), and northern South America (Colombia) [24]\n\n\nLargest cities and recommended viewing sites\nSpace.com identified the ten largest cities where totality was visible In population order, they were: [9]\n\n\nVisibility in other continents\nA partial eclipse passed over Svalbard (Norway), Iceland, Ireland, western parts of the United Kingdom, north-western parts of Spain and Portugal, the Azores, and the Canary Islands [40] Cloud cover prevented views of it from most of the British Isles, [41] [42] although it was seen in Western Scotland [43] Unusually, this eclipse extended below the horizon, where the greatest phase was observed at mid-nautical twilight in Galicia (Spain) and the beginning of astronomical twilight in Nouvelle-Aquitaine (France) [44] The extension of the eclipse path within the twilight zone created what was likely the best observation window for the 12P/Pons–Brooks comet located closely to Jupiter [45]\n\n\nEurope\nA partial eclipse passed over Svalbard (Norway), Iceland, Ireland, western parts of the United Kingdom, north-western parts of Spain and Portugal, the Azores, and the Canary Islands [40] Cloud cover prevented views of it from most of the British Isles, [41] [42] although it was seen in Western Scotland [43] Unusually, this eclipse extended below the horizon, where the greatest phase was observed at mid-nautical twilight in Galicia (Spain) and the beginning of astronomical twilight in Nouvelle-Aquitaine (France) [44] The extension of the eclipse path within the twilight zone created what was likely the best observation window for the 12P/Pons–Brooks comet located closely to Jupiter [45]\n\n\nOceania\nThe partial eclipse was seen in Hawaii, eastern Kiribati (the eastern Phoenix Islands and the whole Line Islands), Tokelau, American Samoa except for its extreme western part, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, and the Pitcairn Islands Although all located east of the 180th meridian, the local time of the eclipse in Kiribati and Tokelau was Tuesday, April 9, 2024, because either UTC+13 or UTC+14 is observed in these areas [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe magnitude of an eclipse, or the ratio of the angular diameter of the Moon to the angular diameter of the Sun, must be one or greater for a total eclipse to occur The Moon was near perigee (the closest point in its orbit to Earth) during this eclipse Occurring only about 24 hours after perigee (on April 7, 2024, at 18:50 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was larger [49] The Sun had an angular diameter of 31'56\" at the moment of greatest eclipse As the magnitude of this eclipse at that time was 1.0566, the angular diameter of the Moon was 1.0566 times that of the Sun, or 33'44\" This gave the eclipse a wider path of totality and more maximum time in totality (4 min 28 s) compared to the total eclipse in 2017 (2 min 40 s), which had a magnitude of 1.0306.\n\n\nMagnitude\nThe magnitude of an eclipse, or the ratio of the angular diameter of the Moon to the angular diameter of the Sun, must be one or greater for a total eclipse to occur The Moon was near perigee (the closest point in its orbit to Earth) during this eclipse Occurring only about 24 hours after perigee (on April 7, 2024, at 18:50 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was larger [49] The Sun had an angular diameter of 31'56\" at the moment of greatest eclipse As the magnitude of this eclipse at

compared to the total eclipse in 2017 (2 min 40 s), which had a magnitude of 1.0306.\n\n\nSolar prominences\nThe eclipse occurred around the solar maximum, a period of greatest solar activity in the Sun's 11-year solar cycle, and it was anticipated that solar prominences would be visible during totality [50] Many observers reported seeing solar prominences during the event [51] [52] [53] Most plainly visible to the naked eye was a very bright red point of light near the lowest portion of the Sun's disk, which on telescopic views and photographs showed as a tent-shaped angular structure The red and pink hues were the result of hydrogen and helium plasma being thrown up in broad arcs but never leaving the sun's atmosphere [54] [55] Telescopic photographs revealed the western limb having several smaller, irregular shapes, of which one large, ragged shape appeared disconnected from the Sun's surface on one side Several smaller prominences were also visible on the eastern limb, though because of the eclipse's relatively high magnitude, prominences on both limbs could not be viewed at the same time  These shapes correlate in detail with the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory solar telescope images taken in space at the same as the earthbound eclipse, and with images from the ground-based National Solar Observatory GONG telescope in Cerro Tololo, Chile.\n\n\nShadow bands\nThe shadow bands phenomenon was observed and documented in some locations with clear skies Attempts to observe and record shadow bands on the ground were disappointed in many areas of totality by the phenomenon not appearing in the event, perhaps having been washed out by the diffuse illumination of cloudy skies in various locations [56] [57]\n\n\nEclipse path intersections\nThe path of the April 8, 2024, eclipse crossed the path of the previous American total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois, in Makanda, just south of Carbondale [58]\n\n\nImpact\nIt was projected before the eclipse that there could be a $6 billion boost to the US economy due to the eclipse The Mayor of Rochester, New York, Malik Evans, told reporters that the city was expected to bring in between $10–12 million to the city's economy from the Friday before the eclipse to the day of it [60] [61] However, the day was cloudy On April 12 New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced record breaking tourism numbers between April 6-9, that was a 45% increase compared to 2023, with nearly one million visitors to New York State parks and over 5.5 million toll transactions recorded [62]\n\n\nEconomy and tourism\nIt was projected before the eclipse that there could be a $6 billion boost to the US economy due to the eclipse The Mayor of Rochester, New York, Malik Evans, told reporters that the city was expected to bring in between $10–12 million to the city's economy from the Friday before the eclipse to the day of it [60] [61] However, the day was cloudy On April 12 New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced record breaking tourism numbers between April 6-9, that was a 45% increase compared to 2023, with nearly one million visitors to New York State parks and over 5.5 million toll transactions recorded [62]\n\n\nTraffic\nHighways in the area of totality saw significant increases in traffic, with departing tourists caught in traffic jams lasting up to eight hours [69] Many of those trying to drive down Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, for example, found themselves in jams lasting until at least 2 a.m the following morning, resulting in numerous cars breaking down [70] Drivers and passengers spent four to six hours to pass through Franconia Notch where Interstate 93 is reduced to a single lane in each direction Major highways in the state remained crowded through rush hour the following morning and into the afternoon [71] A similar effect was seen during the following morning's rush hour in northbound Interstate 65 in Indianapolis [72] In Vermont there were an estimated 60,000 additional cars and 248 inbound aircraft over the span of the eclipse weekend, with about 160,000 visitors coming into the state per Secretary of Transportation Joe Flynn [73] Drivers in southern Illinois leaving the region of totality to the north toward St Louis, Missouri faced more than 80 miles of stop-and-go heavy congestion [74] Unlike other regions, traffic was lighter in Texas than the state's Department of Transportation had anticipated [68]\n\n\nAnimal behavior\nZookeepers, naturalists, university researchers, and citizen scientists positioned themselves to observe animal behavior during the eclipse, some with the goal of comparing results with observations made during the 1932 and 2017 total solar eclipses, and others opening new avenues of animal behavioral research Wildlife and zoo animals were observed along the path of totality and in areas that saw only a partial eclipse NASA worked with ARISA Lab, LLC, to recruit thousands of citizen scientists to help record sounds and observations of animal behavior during the eclipse As of 16 April 2024 [update], a total of 3,372 written observations had been submitted by citizen scientists, and 770 recording devices had been registered with the project to provide sound and ultrasound recordings of wildlife and other ambient sounds before, during, and after the eclipse in a standardized way [75]\n\n\nWildlife\nChanges in wild animal behavior were recorded during the eclipse, especially among birds These changes were similar to those observed during the 2017 eclipse, but more pronounced [76] Weather radar was adapted to monitor the activity of flying animals, and birds were observed to decrease their daytime activities [76] Radar imaging demonstrated \"noticeable decreases in typical daytime biological activities such as the movements of hawks and other soaring and insect-eating birds.\" [76] Owls began hooting, and vultures and other birds began to roost [77] A team from Purdue University, observing a variety of ecosystems on wild-lands maintained by the university near Butlerville, Indiana, recorded the songs of 20 different species of birds going quiet, leaving only the songs of the robin and the tufted titmouse during the eclipse [78] Birding students at the University of Vermont observed species at Lake Champlain during the eclipse that had not been observed there before, including Bohemian waxwings, red-tailed hawks, and pileated woodpeckers [79]\n\n\nZoo animals\nAt the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, ostriches returned to their barn and began their evening rituals, such as preening and grooming each other When the sunlight returned, the ostriches left their barn and resumed their daytime activities [82] A group of elephants at the zoo gathered together and began thumping their trunks on the ground [82] At the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas, flamingos bunched together, vocalized, and began marching together, which is a bonding behavior [80] A troop of gorillas at that zoo also gathered at the door to their indoor enclosure, where they were normally fed each evening, and appeared to act confused and frustrated, as if having missed their evening meal [83] [80] The Fort Worth Botanic Garden (FWBG) placed hundreds of butterflies in their conservatory March 1, allowed them to acclimate, and observed them during the eclipse The butterflies \"didn’t roost but instead ceased flying and remained very still.\" [81] Goats at the FWBC were observed resting or sleeping during the eclipse [81] Giraffes at the Dallas Zoo also began to gallop, a behavior witnessed there and at many other zoos during the 2017 eclipse [83] Two aldabra tortoises at the same zoo were observed to rear on their hind legs and attack the door to their indoor enclosure, damaging the door’s frame [83] Lions at the Buffalo Zoo started roaring just before totality [84]\n\n\nResponses\nArkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders preemptively declared a state of emergency related to the eclipse, citing the expected increase of travel to the state which could result in transportation difficulties, such as in Fort Smith, where the police prepared for traffic congestion as hotels filled up [88] [89] Bell County, Texas Judge David Blackburn preemptively declared a state of emergency in February 2024 due to the projected number of visitors to the area [90] The region surrounding Niagara Falls, Ontario, also declared a state of emergency; as an existing major tourist destination along the path of totality, it expected an influx of at least one million visitors on April 8 [91]\n\n\nGallery\nShown below are two tables displaying details about this particular

18 years, 11 days, and containing 71 events The series started with a partial solar eclipse on May 17, 1501 It contains hybrid eclipses from August 11, 1627 through December 9, 1825 and total eclipses from December 21, 1843 through March 26, 2601 There are no annular eclipses in this set The series ends at member 71 as a partial eclipse on July 3, 2763 Its eclipses are tabulated in three columns; every third eclipse in the same column is one exeligmos apart, so they all cast shadows over approximately the same parts of the Earth \n\n\nMetonic series\nThe metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years (6939.69 days), lasting about 5 cycles Eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date In addition, the octon subseries repeats 1/5 of that or every 3.8 years (1387.94 days) All eclipses in this table occur at the Moon's ascending node.\n\n\nTritos series\nThis eclipse is a part of a tritos cycle, repeating at alternating nodes every 135 synodic months (≈ 3986.63 days, or 11 years minus 1 month) Their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month (period of perigee), but groupings of 3 tritos cycles (≈ 33 years minus 3 months) come close (≈ 434.044 anomalistic months), so eclipses are similar in these groupings.\n\n\nInex series\nThis eclipse is a part of the long period inex cycle, repeating at alternating nodes, every 358 synodic months (≈ 10,571.95 days, or 29 years minus 20 days) Their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month (period of perigee) However, groupings of 3 inex cycles (≈ 87 years minus 2 months) comes close (≈ 1,151.02 anomalistic months), so eclipses are similar in these groupings.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Husayn_ibn_Ali", "content": "\nEarly life\nAccording to majority of narrations, Husayn was born on the 3rd of Sha'ban 4 AH (11 January 626 CE) [11] in Medina and was still a child when his grandfather, Muhammad, died [18] He was the younger son of Ali, the cousin of Muhammad, and Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, both from the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe [19] Both Hasan and Husayn were named by Muhammad, although Ali had other names such as \"Harb\" in mind To celebrate Husayn's birth, Muhammad sacrificed a ram, and Fatima shaved his head and donated the same weight of his hair in silver as alms [20]\nAccording to Islamic traditions, Husayn is mentioned in the Torah as \"Shubayr\" and in the Gospels as \"Tab\" Aaron, Moses' brother, gave the same names to his sons after learning the names God had chosen for Ali's children [21]\n\n\nEvent of Mubahala\n\nIn the year 10 AH (631–632) a Christian envoy from Najran (now in northern Yemen) came to Muhammad to argue which of the two parties erred in its doctrine concerning Jesus After likening Jesus' miraculous birth to Adam's creation —who was born to neither a mother nor a father— and when the Christians did not accept the Islamic doctrine about Jesus, Muhammad reportedly received a revelation instructing him to call them to Mubahala, where each party should ask God to destroy the false party and their families: [25] [26] [27] \n\nDuring the caliphate of Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman\nDuring the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar, Husayn was present at some events such as testifying about the story of Fadak [30] According to a narration, Husayn, while the second caliph was sitting on the pulpit of Muhammad and giving a speech, objected to him for sitting on the pulpit of Muhammad, and Umar also stopped his sermon and came down from the pulpit [31] During the time of Uthman, he defended Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, who had preached against some of the actions of the tyrants and was to be exiled from Medina [32]\n\n\nDuring the caliphate of Ali and Hasan\nDuring the Caliphate of Ali, Husayn, along with his brothers Hasan and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, and his cousin, Abdullah ibn Ja'far were among closest allies of Ali [11] He remained alongside him, accompanying him in the battlefields [18] According to a report by Tabari, Husayn was among Ali's major supporters who were cursed in public by the order of Mu'awiya [11]\n\n\nDuring the caliphate of Mu'awiya\nAccording to the Shi'a, Husayn was the third Imam for a period of ten years after the death of his brother Hasan in 670 AD All of this time except the last six months coincided with the caliphate of Mu'awiya [36] In the nine-year period between Hasan's abdication in AH 41 (660 AD) and his death in AH 49 (669 AD), Hasan and Husayn retreated to Medina, trying to keep aloof from political involvement for or against Mu'awiya [12] [13] Sentiments in favor of the rule of Ahl al-Bayt occasionally emerged in the form of small groups, mostly from Kufa, visiting Hasan and Husayn asking them to be their leaders – a request to which they declined to respond [37] When Hasan was poisoned, he refused to tell Husayn the name of his suspect, probably Mu'awiya, in fear of provoking bloodshed [11] The burial of Hasan's body near that of Muhammad, was another problem which could have led to bloodshed, as Marwan ibn Hakam swore that he would not permit Hasan to be buried near Muhammad with Abu Bakr and Umar, while Uthman was buried in the cemetery of al-Baqi [38] After the death of Hasan, when Iraqis turned to Husayn, concerning an uprising, Husayn instructed them to wait as long as Mu'awiya was alive due to Hasan's peace treaty with him [12] [18] Meanwhile, Marwan reported to Mu'awiya the frequent visits of Shias to Husayn Mu'awiya instructed Marwan not to clash with Husayn, in the same time he wrote a letter to Husayn in which he \"mingled generous promises with the advice not to provoke him.\" Later on, when Mu'awiya was taking allegiance for his son, Yazid, Husayn was among the five prominent persons who did not give his allegiance, [18] as appointing a successor was in violation of Hasan's peace treaty with Mu'awiya [11] Before his death in April 680, Mu'awiya cautioned Yazid that Husayn and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr might challenge his rule and instructed him to defeat them if they did Yazid was further advised to treat Husayn with caution and not to spill his blood, since he was the grandson of Muhammad [39]\n\n\nUprising\nImmediately after Mu'awiya's death on 15th of Rajab 60 AH (22 April 680 AD), Yazid charged the governor of Medina, Walid ibn Utba ibn Abu Sufyan, to secure allegiance from Husayn with force if necessary [40] [41] Yazid's goal was to take control of the situation in the city before the people became aware of Mu'awiya's death Yazid's concern was especially about his two rivals in the caliphate; Husayn and Abdullah ibn Zubayr who had previously renounced allegiance [42]\nHusayn answered the summons but declined to pledge allegiance in the secretive environment of the meeting, suggesting it should be done in public [18]\nMarwan ibn Hakam told Walid to imprison or behead him, but due to Husayn's kinship with Muhammad, Walid was unwilling to take any action against him A few days later, Husayn left for Mecca without acknowledging Yazid [43] He arrived in Mecca at the beginning of May 680, [44] and stayed there until the beginning of September [45] He was accompanied by his wives, children and brothers, as well as Hasan's sons [11]\n\n\nRefusal to give allegiance to Yazid\nImmediately after Mu'awiya's death on 15th of Rajab 60 AH (22 April 680 AD), Yazid charged the governor of Medina, Walid ibn Utba ibn Abu Sufyan, to secure allegiance from Husayn with force if necessary [40] [41] Yazid's goal was to take control of the situation in the city before the people became aware of Mu'awiya's death Yazid's concern was especially about his two rivals

accompanied by his wives, children and brothers, as well as Hasan's sons [11]\n\n\nInvitations from Kufa\nHusayn had considerable support in Kufa, which had been the caliphal capital during the reigns of his father and brother The Kufans had fought the Umayyads and their Syrian allies during the First Fitna, the five-year civil war which had established the Umayyad Caliphate [46] They were dissatisfied with Hasan's abdication [44] and strongly resented Umayyad rule [46] While in Mecca, Husayn received letters from pro-Alids in Kufa informing him that they were tired of the Umayyad rule, which they considered to be oppressive, and that they had no rightful leader They asked him to lead them in revolt against Yazid, promising to remove the Umayyad governor if Husayn would consent to aid them Husayn wrote back affirmatively that a rightful leader is the one who acts according to the Qur'an and promised to lead them with the right guidance Then he sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to assess the situation in Kufa Ibn Aqil attracted widespread support and informed Husayn of the situation, suggesting that he join them there Yazid removed Nu'man ibn Bashir al-Ansari as governor of Kufa due to his inaction, and installed Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, then governor of Basra, in his place As a result of Ibn Ziyad's suppression and political maneuvering, Ibn Aqil's following began to dissipate and he was forced to declare the revolt prematurely It was defeated and Ibn Aqil was killed [47]\nHusayn had also sent a messenger to Basra, another garrison town in Iraq, but the messenger could not attract any following and was quickly apprehended and executed [48] \nHusayn was unaware of the change of political circumstances in Kufa and decided to depart Abd Allah ibn Abbas and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr advised him not to move to Iraq, or, if he was determined, not to take women and children with him [e] [48] [45] [47] Nevertheless, he offered Husayn support if he would stay in Mecca and lead the opposition to Yazid from there Husayn refused this, citing his abhorrence of bloodshed in the sanctuary, [49] and decided to go ahead with his plan [47]\n\n\nJourney towards Kufa\nDespite the advice of Muhammad ibn Hanafiyya, Abdullah ibn Umar, and the constant insistence of Abd Allah ibn Abbas in Mecca, Husayn did not back down from his decision to go to Kufa [18] Ibn 'Abbas pointed out that the Kufis had left both his father Ali and his brother Hasan alone, and suggested that Husayn go to Yemen instead of Kufa, or at least not take women and children with him if he were to go to Iraq [42] Husayn insisted on his decision and wrote about his motives and goals in a famous letter or will that he gave to Muhammad ibn al Hanafiyyah\n\n\nBattle of Karbala\nAfter the morning prayer on 10 October, both parties took up battle positions Husayn appointed Zuhayr ibn Qayn to command the right flank of his army, Habib ibn Muzahir to command the left flank, and his half-brother Abbas as the standard bearer [62] Husayn's companions, according to most accounts, numbered thirty-two horsemen and forty infantrymen [g] [63] Ibn Sa'd's army totaled 4,000 [h] [15] The ditch containing wood were set alight [64] Husayn then delivered a speech to his opponents reminding them of his status as Muhammad's grandson and reproaching them for inviting and then abandoning him He asked to be allowed to leave He was told that first he had to submit to Yazid's authority, which he refused to do [62] Husayn's speech moved Hurr to defect to his side [64]\n\n\nDeath\nDuring the Battle of Karbala the Umayyad soldiers hesitated to initiate a direct attack on Husayn; however, he was struck in the mouth by an arrow as he went to the river to drink [48] He collected his blood in a cupped hand and cast towards the sky, complaining to God of his suffering [68] Later, he was surrounded and struck on the head by Malik ibn Nusayr The blow cut through his hooded cloak, which Husayn removed while cursing his attacker He put a cap on his head and wrapped a turban around it to staunch the bleeding Ibn Nusayr seized the bloodied cloak and retreated [68] [69]\n\n\nAftermath\nSeventy or seventy-two people died on Husayn's side, of whom about twenty were descendants of Abu Talib, the father of Ali This included two of Husayn's sons, six of his paternal brothers, three sons of Hasan ibn Ali, three sons of Jafar ibn Abi Talib and three sons and three grandsons of Aqil ibn Abi Talib [48] Following the battle, Husayn's clothes were stripped, and his sword, shoes and baggage were taken The women's jewelry and cloaks were also seized Shemr wanted to kill Husayn's only surviving son Ali al-Sajjad, who had not taken part in the fighting because of illness, but was prevented by Ibn Sa'd [68] [64] There are reports of more than sixty wounds on Husayn's body, [64] which was then trampled with horses as previously instructed by Ibn Ziyad [48] The bodies of Husayn's companions were decapitated [71] There were eighty-eight dead in Ibn Sa'd's army, who were buried before he left [72] After his departure, members of the Banu Asad tribe, from the nearby village of Ghadiriya, buried the headless bodies of Husayn's companions [68]\n\n\nRelated uprisings\nA few prominent Alid supporters in Kufa felt guilty for abandoning Husayn after having invited him to revolt To atone for what they perceived as their sin, they began a movement known as Tawwabin uprising, under Sulayman ibn Surad, a companion of Muhammad, to fight the Umayyads, and attracted large-scale support [84] The armies met in January 685 at Battle of Ayn al-Warda; which resulted killing most of them including Ibn Surad [84]\nThe defeat of the Tawwabin left the leadership of the Kufan pro-Alids in the hand of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi In October 685, Mukhtar and his supporters seized Kufa His control extended to most of Iraq and parts of northwestern Iran [85] Mukhtar executed Kufans involved in the killing of Husayn, including Ibn Sa'd and Shemr, while thousands of people fled to Basra [86] He then sent his general Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar to fight an approaching Umayyad army, led by Ibn Ziyad, which had been sent to reconquer the province The Umayyad army was routed at the Battle of Khazir in August 686 and Ibn Ziyad was slain [87] Later on, in April 687, Mukhtar was killed [88]\n\n\nHistorical analysis\nBased on an official report sent to caliph Yazid, which describes the battle of Karbala very briefly, stating that it lasted for no longer than a siesta, Lammens concludes that there was no battle at all but a quick massacre that was over in an hour; he suggests that the detailed accounts found in the primary sources are Iraqi fabrications, since their writers were dissatisfied with their hero being killed without putting up a fight [89] This is countered by the historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri, who argues that despite there being some fabricated accounts, all of the contemporary accounts together form \"a coherent and credible narrative\" She criticizes Lammens' hypothesis as being based on a single isolated report and being devoid of critical analysis [90] Similarly, Madelung and Wellhausen assert that the battle lasted from sunrise to sunset and that the overall account of the battle is reliable [48] [91] Vaglieri and Madelung explain the length of the battle despite the numerical disparity between the opposing camps as Ibn Sa'd's attempt to prolong the fight and pressure Husayn into submission instead of attempting to quickly overwhelm and kill him [90] [48]\n\n\nPrimary and classic sources\nThe primary source of the Karbala narrative is the work of the Kufan historian Abu Mikhnaf titled Kitab Maqtal Al-Husayn [i] [95] Abu Mikhnaf's was an adult some twenty years after the Battle of Karbala As such he knew many eyewitnesses and collected firsthand accounts and some with very short chains of transmitters, usually one or two intermediaries [96] The eyewitnesses were of two kinds: those from Husayn's side; and those from Ibn Sa'd's army Since few people from Husayn's camp survived, most eyewitnesses were from the second category According to Julius Wellhausen, most of them regretted their actions in the battle and embellished the accounts of the battle in favor of Husayn in order to dilute their guilt [97] Although as an Iraqi, Abu Mikhnaf had pro-Alid tendencies, his reports generally do not contain much bias on his part [98] Abu Mikhnaf's original text seems to have been lost and the version extant today has been transmitted through secondary sources such as the History of Prophets and Kings by al-Tabari; and Ansab al-Ashraf by Baladhuri [j] [99] Tabari quotes either directly from Abu Mikhnaf or from his student Ibn al-Kalbi, who took most of his material from Abu Mikhnaf [95] Tabari occasionally takes material from Ammar ibn Mu'awiya, [100] Awana [101] and other primary sources, which, however, adds little to the narrative [71] Baladhuri uses same sources as Tabari Information on the battle found in the works of Dinawari and Ya'qubi is also based on Abu Mikhnaf's Maqtal, [95] although they occasionally provide some extra notes and verses [71] Other secondary sources include al-Mas'udi's Muruj al-Dhahab, Ibn Ath'am's Kitab al-Futuh, Shaykh al-Mufid's Kitab al-Irshad, and Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani's Maqatil al-Talibiyyin [102] Most of these sources took material from Abu Mikhnaf, in addition to some from the primary works of Awana, al-Mada'ini and Nasr ibn Muzahim [103]\nAlthough Tabari and other early sources contain some miraculous stories, [99] these sources are mainly historical and rational in nature, [104] in contrast to the literature of later periods, which is mainly hagiographical in nature [104] [105]\nThe Battle of Karbala was also reported by an early Christian source A history by the Syriac Christian scholar Theophilus of Edessa, who was chief astrologer in the Abbasid court between 775 and 785, is partially preserved in a number of extant Christian chronicles, including those by Michael the Syrian and the Byzantine historian Theophanes the Confessor [k] [107]\n\n\nTomb\nHusayn ibn Ali's tomb is located in the city of Karbala, about 90 km southwest of Baghdad This tomb was probably formed two centuries after the event of Karbala and was rebuilt and expanded until the thirteenth century AH This place did not have a building at first and was marked with a simple sign After that, in the third century AH, a monument was built on it, which was considered during the time of some Abbasid caliphs and Dailami princes and patriarchal and Ottoman rulers, and over time, the city of Karbala was built and expanded around it [108]\n\n\nCommemoration\nShi'a Muslims consider pilgrimages to Husayn's tomb to be a source of divine blessings and rewards [109] According to Shi'a tradition the first such visit was performed by Husayn's son Ali al-Sajjad and the surviving family members during their return from Syria to Medina The first historically recorded visit is Sulayman ibn Surad and the Penitents going to Husayn's grave before their departure to Syria They are reported to have lamented and beaten their chests and to have spent a night by the tomb [110] Thereafter this tradition was limited to the Shi'a imams for several decades, before gaining momentum under the sixth Shi'a imam Jafar Sadiq and his followers Buyids and Safavids also encouraged this practice [109] Special visits are paid on 10 Muharram (Ashura Pilgrimage) and 40 days after the anniversary of Husayn's (Arba'in pilgrimage) [111] In Shi'a tradition, Husayn's martyrdom is also connected to the hagiography of John the Baptist [112]\n\n\nFamily life\nHusayn's first marriage was with Rubab Her father, Imra' al-Qais, a chief of Banu Kalb, came to Medina during the Caliphate of Umar, and was appointed by him as the chief of the Quda'a tribes Ali proposed her marriage with Husayn, but since Husayn and Imra al-Qais's daughter were too young at the time, the actual marriage took place later Husayn had a daughter, Amena (or Amina or Omayma) who is known as Sakinah, from her According to a narration recorded by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, Hasan has blamed Husayn for his excessive favors to Rubab Husayn, in response, depicted his great love for Rubab and Sakinah in three lines of poetry Later on Rubab bore a son, Abd Allah (or according to recent Shia sources, Ali al-Asghar) for him Husayn's kunya, Abu Abd Allah, probably refers to this son After Husayn's death, Rubab spent a year in grief at his grave and refused to marry again [11]\n\n\nPersonality and appearance\nHusayn had a white face and sometimes wore a green turban and sometimes a black turban He would travel with the poor or invite them to his house and feed them Mu'awiya said about Husayn that he and his father Ali were not deceitful, and Amr ibn al-As considered him the most beloved of the earthlings to the people of heaven [31]\n\n\nIn the Quran and Hadith\nMany Sunni and Shia'a commentators, such as Fakhr Razi and Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i, in their interpretation of Surah Al-Insan, attribute its revelation to Ali and Fatima and the story of the illness of their child or children and a vow for their recovery [141] [142]\n\n\nIn the verses of the Quran\nMany Sunni and Shia'a commentators, such as Fakhr Razi and Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i, in their interpretation of Surah Al-Insan, attribute its revelation to Ali and Fatima and the story of the illness of their child or children and a vow for their recovery [141] [142]\n\n\nIn the biography of the Prophet of Islam\nHusayn is placed as an example for the second weight in the narrations related to \"Thaqalin\" In another group of narrations related to Hasnain, they are introduced as \"the master of the youth of Paradise\" His name and Hassan's, due to their young age, are among those who pledge allegiance in renewing allegiance to the Prophet, which indicates the Prophet's goal in strengthening their historical and social status [146]\n\n\nNews of Husayn's fate\nThere are narrations that Gabriel informed Muhammad at the time of Husayn's birth that his ummah would kill Husayn and that the Imamate would be from Husayn, and that Muhammad informed his companions of how Husayn had been killed Except for Muhammad, Ali and Hasan, they had said the same thing God also informed the previous prophets about the killing of Husayn [31] Ali also knew that Husayn would be killed in Karbala, and once he passed by this area, he stopped and cried and remembered the news of Muhammad He interpreted Karbala (کربلا) as (کرب) anguish and (بلا) calamity The slain of Karbala will enter Paradise without any reckoning [10]\n\n\nWorks\nThere are narrations, sermons and letters left from Husayn Ibn Ali which are available in Sunni and Shiite sources Narrations about him can be divided into two periods before and after the Imamate In the first period – which is the period of his life in the life of his grandfather, father, mother and brother – there are at least two types of narrations about him: first, his narrations from his relatives, and second, his personal hadiths In Sunni sources, only the aspect of the narration of his hadith has been considered in these hadiths These Musnads, like the Musnad of the Companions of the Prophet of Islam, also have a Musnad named Husayn Ibn Ali In his Musnad, Abu Bakr Bazar has narrated the Musnad of Husayn Ibn Ali with 4 hadiths and Tabarani has narrated his Musnad with 27 hadiths, respectively In the Musnad of Husayn ibn Ali, in addition to the hadiths of Husayn himself, there are also hadiths of the Prophet of Islam and Ali ibn Abi Talib In the present era, Azizullah Atardi has compiled the document of the Imam of the Martyr Abi Abdullah Al-Husayn Ibn Ali [147]\n\n\nViews\nThe killing of Husayn has had an emotional impact on Sunnis, [150] who remember the event as a tragic incident and those killed in the company of Husayn as martyrs [151] The impact on Shi'a Islam has been much deeper [150] [151] According to Vaglieri, only the adherents of the Umayyad who considered him as \"a rebel against the established authority\", condoned his murder by Yazid, but their opinion was opposed by the majority of Muslims [152] Therefore, almost all Muslims consider Husayn honorable because he was the grandson of Muhammad and because of the belief that he sacrificed himself for an ideal [152] Historian Edward Gibbon described the events at Karbala as a tragedy [153] [154] According to historian Syed Akbar Hyder, Mahatma Gandhi attributed the historical progress of Islam, to the \"sacrifices of Muslim saints like Husayn\" rather than military force [155]\n\n\nSunnis\nThe positive attitude of the Sunnis towards Husayn, according to Vaglieri, is most likely due to the sad narrations that Abu Mikhnaf has collected, some of which have been narrated directly or with short chains of transmitters, mostly from Kufis who regretted their actions towards Husayn These sad narrations of the Kufis, which were a sign of Abu Mikhnaf's Shia tendencies, became the source of the narrations used by later historians and spread throughout the Islamic world [152] According to Rasul Jafarian, the Shia historian, fatalism, being promoted by Mu'awiya, caused Husayn's move to never be considered an uprising against corruption by the Sunnis, and they only considered it an illegal insurrection (Fitna) [156]\n\n\nShias\nThe most important components of Shia views about Husayn are the belief in the Imamate of Husayn and the characteristics of an Imam by the Shia religions; Twelvers, Ismailis and Zaydis Like other Imams, Husayn is a mediator with God for those who call on him; \"it is through his intercession (Tawassul) that his faithful followers obtain guidance and attain salvation.\" [152]\n\n\nHusayn's head in Isma'ilism\nThe Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali conquered Palestine under Caliph al-Mustansir Billah and discovered the head of Husayn in AH 448 (1056 AD) He constructed the minbar, a mosque and the mashhad at the place of burial, known as the Shrine of Husayn's Head [160] [161] The shrine was described as the most magnificent building in Ashkelon [162] During the British Mandate it was a \"large maqam on top of a hill\" with no tomb but a fragment of a pillar showing the place where the head had been buried [163] Israeli Defense Forces under Moshe Dayan blew up Mashhad Nabi Husayn in July 1950 as part of a broader operation [164] Around the year 2000, Isma'ilis from India built a marble platform there, on the grounds of the Barzilai Medical Center [165] [166] [164] The head remained buried in Ashkelon until 1153 (for about 250 years) only Fearing the crusaders, Ashkelon's ruler Sayf al-Mamlaka Tamim brought the head to Cairo on 31 August 1153 (8 Jumada al-Thani, AH 548) [167] [166]\n\n\nAhl-e Haqq\nIn the holy text of Yarsanism named Zolāl Zolāl is a long dialogue between angels Ruchiyar and Ayvat and their reincarnations It is written in the book that the angel Ayvat incarnated into Husayn ibn Ali and after his death into an Yari saint named Baba Yadegar [168]\n\n\nModern historical views on motivations of Husayn\nVaglieri considers him to be motivated by ideology, saying that if the materials that have come down to us are authentic, they convey an image of person who is \"convinced that he was in the right, stubbornly determined to achieve his ends...\" [169] Holding a similar view, Madelung has argued that Husayn was not a \"reckless rebel\" but a religious man motivated by pious convictions According to him, Husayn was convinced that \"the family of the Prophet was divinely chosen to lead the community founded by Moḥammad, as the latter had been chosen, and had both an inalienable right and an obligation to seek this leadership.\" He was, however, not seeking martyrdom and wanted to return when his expected support did not materialize [48] Maria Dakake holds that Husayn considered the Umayyad rule oppressive and misguided, and revolted to reorient the Islamic community in the right direction [170] A similar view is held by Mahmoud Ayoub [171] S M Jafri proposes that Husayn, although motivated by ideology, did not intend to secure leadership for himself Husayn, Jafri asserts, was from the start aiming for martyrdom in order to jolt the collective conscience of the Muslim community and reveal what he considers to be the oppressive and anti-Islamic nature of the Umayyad regime [172]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe first political use of the death of Husayn seems to have been during the revolt of Mukhtar, when he seized Kufa under the slogan of \"Revenge for Husayn\" [176] [177] Although the Penitents had used the same slogan, they do not seem to have had a political program [176] In order to enhance their legitimacy, Abbasid rulers claimed to have avenged the death of Husayn by dethroning the Umayyads [178] During the early years of their rule, they also encouraged Muharram rituals [179] Buyids, a Shi'a dynasty originally from Iran which later occupied the Abbasid capital Baghdad while accepting the Abbasid caliph's suzerainty, [180] promoted the public rituals of Muharram to portray themselves as patrons of religion and to strengthen the Shi'a identity in Iraq [117] After taking over Iran in 1501, Safavids, who were previously a Sufi order, declared the state religion to be Twelver Shi'ism In this regard, Karbala and Muharram rituals came to be a vehicle of Safavid propaganda and a means of consolidating the dynasty's Shi'a identity [181] Riza Yildirim has claimed that the impetus of the Safvid revolution was the revenge of the death of Husayn [182] The founder of the dynasty, Shah Ismail, considered himself to be the Mahdi (the twelfth Shi'a Imam) or his forerunner [183] [184] Similarly, Qajars also patronized Muharram rituals such as processions, taziya and majalis, to improve the relationship between the state and the public [185]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe first political use of the death of Husayn seems to have been during the revolt of Mukhtar, when he seized Kufa under the slogan of \"Revenge for Husayn\" [176] [177] Although

taziya and majalis, to improve the relationship between the state and the public [185]\n\n\nIranian Revolution\nKarbala and Shi'a symbolism played a significant role in the Iranian Revolution of 1979 [186] In contrast to the traditional view of Shi'ism as a religion of suffering, mourning and political quietism, Shi'a Islam and Karbala were given a new interpretation in the period preceding the revolution by rationalist intellectuals and religious revisionists like Jalal Al-e-Ahmad, Ali Shariati and Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi [187] [188] According to these, Shi'ism was an ideology of revolution and political struggle against tyranny and exploitation, [189] and the Battle of Karbala and the death of Husayn was to be seen as a model for revolutionary struggle; [190] weeping and mourning was to be replaced by political activism to realize the ideals of Husayn [191]\n\n\nIn art and literature\nMir Mosharraf Hossain's 19th century novel on Karbala, Bishad Sindhu (the Ocean of Sorrow), established the precedent of the Islamic epic in Bangali literature [202] South Asian philosopher and poet Muhammad Iqbal sees Husayn's sacrifice as being similar to that of Ishmael and compares Yazid's opposition to Husayn with the opposition of Pharaoh to Moses [203] Urdu poet Ghalib compares Husayn's suffering with that of Mansur al-Hallaj, a tenth century Sufi, who was executed on a charge of claiming divinity [204]\n\n\nLiterature\nMir Mosharraf Hossain's 19th century novel on Karbala, Bishad Sindhu (the Ocean of Sorrow), established the precedent of the Islamic epic in

and legendary accounts\nMaqtal (pl Maqatil) works narrate the story of someone's death [205] Although Maqatil on the deaths of Ali, Uthman and various others have been written, [206] the Maqtal genre has focused mainly on the story of Husayn's death [207] [208]\n\n\nMarthiya and rawda\nWhen Shi'ism became the official religion of Iran in the 16th century, Safavid rulers such as Shah Tahmasp I, patronized poets who wrote about the Battle of Karbala [215] The genre of marthiya (poems in the memory of the dead, with popular forms of Karbala related marthiya being rawda and nawha), [216] according to Persian scholar Wheeler Thackston, \"was particularly cultivated by the Safavids.\" [215] Various Persian authors wrote texts retelling romanticized and synthesized versions of the battle and events from it, [127] [217] including Sa'id al-Din's Rawdat al-Islam (The Garden of Islam) and Al-Khawarazmi's Maqtal nur 'al-'a'emmah (The Site of the Murder of the Light of the Imams) These influenced the composition of the more popular text Rawdat al-Shuhada (Garden of Martyrs), which was written in 1502 by Husain Wa'iz Kashefi [217] [127] Kashefi's composition was an effective factor in the development of rawda khwani, a ritual recounting of the battle events in majalis [217]\n\n\nSufi poetry\nIn Sufism, where annihilation of the self (nafs) and suffering in the path of God are paramount principles, Husayn is seen as a model Sufi [223] Persian Sufi poet Hakim Sanai describes Husayn as a martyr, higher in rank than all the other martyrs of the world; while Farid ud-Din Attar considers him a prototype of a Sufi who sacrificed himself in the love of God [224] Jalal ud-Din Rumi describes Husayn's suffering at Karbala as a means to achieve union with the divine, and hence considers it to be a matter of jubilation rather than grief [225] Sindhi Sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai devoted a section in his Shah Jo Risalo to the death of Husayn, in which the incident is remembered in laments and elegies [226] He too sees Husayn's death as a sacrifice made in the path of God, and condemns Yazid as being bereft of divine love [227] Turkish Sufi Yunus Emre labels Husayn, along with his brother Hasan, as the \"fountain head of the martyrs\" and \"Kings of the Paradise\" in his songs [228]\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nSee

a member of the Ahl al-Bayt, the family of the Prophet. He was born on the 3rd of Sha'ban 4 AH (11 January 626 CE) in Medina and was the younger son of Ali, the cousin of Muhammad, and Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad. Both Hasan and Husayn were named by Muhammad, although Ali had other names such as \"Harb\" in mind.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHusayn's early life is not well-documented, but it is known that he was still a child when his grandfather Muhammad died. He was raised by his mother, Fatima, and his father, Ali, who was a prominent figure in the early Islamic community. Husayn's childhood was marked by the early struggles and conflicts of the Islamic community, including the assassination of his grandfather's closest friend and companion, Abu Bakr.\n\n**Event of Mubahala**\n\nIn the year 10 AH (631–632), a Christian envoy from Najran came to Muhammad to argue which of the two parties erred in its doctrine concerning Jesus. Muhammad reportedly received a revelation instructing him to call them to Mubahala, where each party should ask God to destroy the false party and their families.\n\n**During the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar**\n\nDuring the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar, Husayn was present at some events, including the testifying about the story of Fadak. According to a narration, Husayn objected to Umar for sitting on the pulpit of Muhammad, and Umar also stopped his sermon and came down from the pulpit.\n\n**During the Caliphate of Ali**\n\nDuring the Caliphate of Ali, Husayn, along with his brothers Hasan and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, and his cousin, Abdullah ibn Ja'far, were among the closest allies of Ali. He remained alongside Ali, accompanying him in the battlefields. According to a report by Tabari, Husayn was among Ali's major supporters who were cursed in public by the order of Mu'awiya.\n\n**During the Caliphate of Mu'awiya**\n\nAccording to the Shi'a, Husayn was the third Imam for a period of ten years after the death of his brother Hasan in 670 AD. All of this time except the last six months coincided with the caliphate of Mu'awiya. In the nine-year period between Hasan's abdication in AH 41 (660 AD) and his death in AH 49 (669 AD), Hasan and Husayn retreated to Medina, trying to keep aloof from political involvement for or against Mu'awiya.\n\n**Refusal to Give Allegiance to Yazid**\n\nImmediately after Mu'awiya's death on 15th of Rajab 60 AH (22 April 680 AD), Yazid charged the governor of Medina, Walid ibn Utba ibn Abu Sufyan, to secure allegiance from Husayn with force if necessary. Husayn answered the summons but declined to pledge allegiance in the secretive environment of the meeting.\n\n**Invitations from Kufa**\n\nHusayn had considerable support in Kufa, which had been the caliphal capital during the reigns of his father and brother. While in Mecca, Husayn received letters from pro-Alids in Kufa informing him that they were tired of the Umayyad rule, which they considered to be oppressive, and that they had no rightful leader.\n\n**Battle of Karbala**\n\nAfter the morning prayer on 10 October, both parties took up battle positions. Husayn appointed Zuhayr ibn Qayn to command the right flank of his army, Habib ibn Muzahir to command the left flank, and his half-brother Abbas as the standard bearer. Husayn's companions, according to most accounts, numbered thirty-two horsemen and forty infantrymen. Ibn Sa'd's army totaled 4,000.\n\n**Personality and Appearance**\n\nHusayn had a white face and sometimes wore a green turban and sometimes a black turban. He would travel with the poor or invite them to his house and feed them.\n\n**Views**\n\nThe killing of Husayn has had an emotional impact on Sunnis, who remember the event as a tragic incident and those killed in the company of Husayn as martyrs.

His ancestors included the Prophet Muhammad, Ali ibn Abi Talib, and Fatima al-Zahra.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Husayn_ibn_Ali\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAccording to majority of narrations, Husayn was born on the 3rd of Sha'ban 4 AH (11 January 626 CE) [11] in Medina and was still a child when his grandfather, Muhammad, died [18] He was the younger son of Ali, the cousin of Muhammad, and Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, both from the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe [19] Both Hasan and Husayn were named by Muhammad, although Ali had other names such as \"Harb\" in mind To celebrate Husayn's birth, Muhammad sacrificed a ram, and Fatima shaved his head and donated the same weight of his hair in silver as alms [20]\nAccording to Islamic traditions, Husayn is mentioned in the Torah as \"Shubayr\" and in the Gospels as \"Tab\" Aaron, Moses' brother, gave the same names to his sons after learning the names God had chosen for Ali's children [21]\n\n\nEvent of Mubahala\n\nIn the year 10 AH (631–632) a Christian envoy from Najran (now in northern Yemen) came to Muhammad to argue which of the two parties erred in its doctrine concerning Jesus After likening Jesus' miraculous birth to Adam's creation —who was born to neither a mother nor a father— and when the Christians did not accept the Islamic doctrine about Jesus, Muhammad reportedly received a revelation instructing him to call them to Mubahala, where each party should ask God to destroy the false party and their families: [25] [26] [27] \n\nDuring the caliphate of Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman\nDuring the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar, Husayn was present at some events such as testifying about the story of Fadak [30] According to a narration, Husayn, while the second caliph was sitting on the pulpit of Muhammad and giving a speech, objected to him for sitting on the pulpit of Muhammad, and Umar also stopped his sermon and came down from the pulpit [31] During the time of Uthman, he defended Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, who had preached against some of the actions of the tyrants and was to be exiled from Medina [32]\n\n\nDuring the caliphate of Ali and Hasan\nDuring the Caliphate of Ali, Husayn, along with his brothers Hasan and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, and his cousin, Abdullah ibn Ja'far were among closest allies of Ali [11] He remained alongside him, accompanying him in the battlefields [18] According to a report by Tabari, Husayn was among Ali's major supporters who were cursed in public by the order of Mu'awiya [11]\n\n\nDuring the caliphate of Mu'awiya\nAccording to the Shi'a, Husayn was the third Imam for a period of ten years after the death of his brother Hasan in 670 AD All of this time except the last six months coincided with the caliphate of Mu'awiya [36] In the nine-year period between Hasan's abdication in AH 41 (660 AD) and his death in AH 49 (669 AD), Hasan and Husayn retreated to Medina, trying to keep aloof from political involvement for or against Mu'awiya [12] [13] Sentiments in favor of the rule of Ahl al-Bayt occasionally emerged in the form of small groups, mostly from Kufa, visiting Hasan and Husayn asking them to be their leaders – a request to which they declined to respond [37] When Hasan was poisoned, he refused to tell Husayn the name of his suspect, probably Mu'awiya, in fear of provoking bloodshed [11] The burial of Hasan's body near that of Muhammad, was another problem which could have led to bloodshed, as Marwan ibn Hakam swore that he would not permit Hasan to be buried near Muhammad with Abu Bakr and Umar, while Uthman was buried in the cemetery of al-Baqi [38] After the death of Hasan, when Iraqis turned to Husayn, concerning an uprising, Husayn instructed them to wait as long as Mu'awiya was alive due to Hasan's peace treaty with him [12] [18] Meanwhile, Marwan reported to Mu'awiya the frequent visits of Shias to Husayn Mu'awiya instructed Marwan not to clash with Husayn, in the same time he wrote a letter to Husayn in which he \"mingled generous promises with the advice not to provoke him.\" Later on, when Mu'awiya was taking allegiance for his son, Yazid, Husayn was among the five prominent persons who did not give his allegiance, [18] as appointing a successor was in violation of Hasan's peace treaty with Mu'awiya [11] Before his death in April 680, Mu'awiya cautioned Yazid that Husayn and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr might challenge his rule and instructed him to defeat them if they did Yazid was further advised to treat Husayn with caution and not to spill his blood, since he was the grandson of Muhammad [39]\n\n\nUprising\nImmediately after Mu'awiya's death on 15th of Rajab 60 AH (22 April 680 AD), Yazid charged the governor of Medina, Walid ibn Utba ibn Abu Sufyan, to secure allegiance from Husayn with force if necessary [40] [41] Yazid's goal was to take control of the situation in the city before the people became aware of Mu'awiya's death Yazid's concern was especially about his two rivals in the caliphate; Husayn and Abdullah ibn Zubayr who had previously renounced allegiance [42]\nHusayn answered the summons but declined to pledge allegiance in the secretive environment of the meeting, suggesting it should be done in public [18]\nMarwan ibn Hakam told Walid to imprison or behead him, but due to Husayn's kinship with Muhammad, Walid was unwilling to take any action against him A few days later, Husayn left for Mecca without acknowledging Yazid [43] He arrived in Mecca at the beginning of May 680, [44] and stayed there until the beginning of September [45] He was accompanied by his wives, children and brothers, as well as Hasan's sons [11]\n\n\nRefusal to give allegiance to Yazid\nImmediately after Mu'awiya's death on 15th of Rajab 60 AH (22 April 680 AD), Yazid charged the governor of Medina, Walid ibn Utba ibn Abu Sufyan, to secure allegiance from Husayn with force if necessary [40] [41] Yazid's goal was to take control of the situation in the city before the people became aware of Mu'awiya's death Yazid's concern was especially about his two rivals in the caliphate; Husayn and Abdullah ibn Zubayr who had previously renounced allegiance [42]\nHusayn answered the summons but declined to pledge allegiance

beginning of September [45] He was accompanied by his wives, children and brothers, as well as Hasan's sons [11]\n\n\nInvitations from Kufa\nHusayn had considerable support in Kufa, which had been the caliphal capital during the reigns of his father and brother The Kufans had fought the Umayyads and their Syrian allies during the First Fitna, the five-year civil war which had established the Umayyad Caliphate [46] They were dissatisfied with Hasan's abdication [44] and strongly resented Umayyad rule [46] While in Mecca, Husayn received letters from pro-Alids in Kufa informing him that they were tired of the Umayyad rule, which they considered to be oppressive, and that they had no rightful leader They asked him to lead them in revolt against Yazid, promising to remove the Umayyad governor if Husayn would consent to aid them Husayn wrote back affirmatively that a rightful leader is the one who acts according to the Qur'an and promised to lead them with the right guidance Then he sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to assess the situation in Kufa Ibn Aqil attracted widespread support and informed Husayn of the situation, suggesting that he join them there Yazid removed Nu'man ibn Bashir al-Ansari as governor of Kufa due to his inaction, and installed Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, then governor of Basra, in his place As a result of Ibn Ziyad's suppression and political maneuvering, Ibn Aqil's following began to dissipate and he was forced to declare the revolt prematurely It was defeated and Ibn Aqil was killed [47]\nHusayn had also sent a messenger to Basra, another garrison town in Iraq, but the messenger could not attract any following and was quickly apprehended and executed [48] \nHusayn was unaware of the change of political circumstances in Kufa and decided to depart Abd Allah ibn Abbas and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr advised him not to move to Iraq, or, if he was determined, not to take women and children with him [e] [48] [45] [47] Nevertheless, he offered Husayn support if he would stay in Mecca and lead the opposition to Yazid from there Husayn refused this, citing his abhorrence of bloodshed in the sanctuary, [49] and decided to go ahead with his plan [47]\n\n\nJourney towards Kufa\nDespite the advice of Muhammad ibn Hanafiyya, Abdullah ibn Umar, and the constant insistence of Abd Allah ibn Abbas in Mecca, Husayn did not back down from his decision to go to Kufa [18] Ibn 'Abbas pointed out that the Kufis had left both his father Ali and his brother Hasan alone, and suggested that Husayn go to Yemen instead of Kufa, or at least not take women and children with him if he were to go to Iraq [42] Husayn insisted on his decision and wrote about his motives and goals in a famous letter or will that he gave to Muhammad ibn al Hanafiyyah\n\n\nBattle of Karbala\nAfter the morning prayer on 10 October, both parties took up battle positions Husayn appointed Zuhayr ibn Qayn to command the right flank of his army, Habib ibn Muzahir to command the left flank, and his half-brother Abbas as the standard bearer [62] Husayn's companions, according to most accounts, numbered thirty-two horsemen and forty infantrymen [g] [63] Ibn Sa'd's army totaled 4,000 [h] [15] The ditch containing wood were set alight [64] Husayn then delivered a speech to his opponents reminding them of his status as Muhammad's grandson and reproaching them for inviting and then abandoning him He asked to be allowed to leave He was told that first he had to submit to Yazid's authority, which he refused to do [62] Husayn's speech moved Hurr to defect to his side [64]\n\n\nDeath\nDuring the Battle of Karbala the Umayyad soldiers hesitated to initiate a direct attack on Husayn; however, he was struck in the mouth by an arrow as he went to the river to drink [48] He collected his blood in a cupped hand and cast towards the sky, complaining to God of his suffering [68] Later, he was surrounded and struck on the head by Malik ibn Nusayr The blow cut through his hooded cloak, which Husayn removed while cursing his attacker He put a cap on his head and wrapped a turban around it to staunch the bleeding Ibn Nusayr seized the bloodied cloak and retreated [68] [69]\n\n\nAftermath\nSeventy or seventy-two people died on Husayn's side, of whom about twenty were descendants of Abu Talib, the father of Ali This included two of Husayn's sons, six of his paternal brothers, three sons of Hasan ibn Ali, three sons of Jafar ibn Abi Talib and three sons and three grandsons of Aqil ibn Abi Talib [48] Following the battle, Husayn's clothes were stripped, and his sword, shoes and baggage were taken The women's jewelry and cloaks were also seized Shemr wanted to kill Husayn's only surviving son Ali al-Sajjad, who had not taken part in the fighting because of illness, but was prevented by Ibn Sa'd [68] [64] There are reports of more than sixty wounds on Husayn's body, [64] which was then trampled with horses as previously instructed by Ibn Ziyad [48] The bodies of Husayn's companions were decapitated [71] There were eighty-eight dead in Ibn Sa'd's army, who were buried before he left [72] After his departure, members of the Banu Asad tribe, from the nearby village of Ghadiriya, buried the headless bodies of Husayn's companions [68]\n\n\nRelated uprisings\nA few prominent Alid supporters in Kufa felt guilty for abandoning Husayn after having invited him to revolt To atone for what they perceived as their sin, they began a movement known as Tawwabin uprising, under Sulayman ibn Surad, a companion of Muhammad, to fight the Umayyads, and attracted large-scale support [84] The armies met in January 685 at Battle of Ayn al-Warda; which resulted killing most of them including Ibn Surad [84]\nThe defeat of the Tawwabin left the leadership of the Kufan pro-Alids in the hand of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi In October 685, Mukhtar and his supporters seized Kufa His control extended to most of Iraq and parts of northwestern Iran [85] Mukhtar executed Kufans involved in the killing of Husayn, including Ibn Sa'd and Shemr, while thousands of people fled to Basra [86] He then sent his general Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar to fight an approaching Umayyad army, led by Ibn Ziyad, which had been sent to reconquer the province The Umayyad army was routed at the Battle of Khazir in August 686 and Ibn Ziyad was slain [87] Later on, in April 687, Mukhtar was killed [88]\n\n\nHistorical analysis\nBased on an official report sent to caliph Yazid, which describes the battle of Karbala very briefly, stating that it lasted for no longer than a siesta, Lammens concludes that there was no battle at all but a quick massacre that was over in an hour; he suggests that the detailed accounts found in the primary sources are Iraqi fabrications, since their writers were dissatisfied with their hero being killed without putting up a fight [89] This is countered by the historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri, who argues that despite there being some fabricated accounts, all of the contemporary accounts together form \"a coherent and credible narrative\" She criticizes Lammens' hypothesis as being based on a single isolated report and being devoid of critical analysis [90] Similarly, Madelung and Wellhausen assert that the battle lasted from sunrise to sunset and that the overall account of the battle is reliable [48] [91] Vaglieri and Madelung explain the length of the battle despite the numerical disparity between the opposing camps as Ibn Sa'd's attempt to prolong the fight and pressure Husayn into submission instead of attempting to quickly overwhelm and kill him [90] [48]\n\n\nPrimary and classic sources\nThe primary source of the Karbala narrative is the work of the Kufan historian Abu Mikhnaf titled Kitab Maqtal Al-Husayn [i] [95] Abu Mikhnaf's was an adult some twenty years after the Battle of Karbala As such he knew many eyewitnesses and collected firsthand accounts and some with very short chains of transmitters, usually one or two intermediaries [96] The eyewitnesses were of two kinds: those from Husayn's side; and those from Ibn Sa'd's army Since few people from Husayn's camp survived, most eyewitnesses were from the second category According to Julius Wellhausen, most of them regretted their actions in the battle and embellished the accounts of the battle in favor of Husayn in order to dilute their guilt [97] Although as an Iraqi, Abu Mikhnaf had pro-Alid tendencies, his reports generally do not contain much bias on his part [98] Abu Mikhnaf's original text seems to have been lost and the version extant today has been transmitted through secondary sources such as the History of Prophets and Kings by al-Tabari; and Ansab al-Ashraf by Baladhuri [j] [99] Tabari quotes either directly from Abu Mikhnaf or from his student Ibn al-Kalbi, who took most of his material from Abu Mikhnaf [95] Tabari occasionally takes material from Ammar ibn Mu'awiya, [100] Awana [101] and other primary sources, which, however, adds little to the narrative [71] Baladhuri uses same sources as Tabari Information on the battle found in the works of Dinawari and Ya'qubi is also based on Abu Mikhnaf's Maqtal, [95] although they occasionally provide some extra notes and verses [71] Other secondary sources include al-Mas'udi's Muruj al-Dhahab, Ibn Ath'am's Kitab al-Futuh, Shaykh al-Mufid's Kitab al-Irshad, and Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani's Maqatil al-Talibiyyin [102] Most of these sources took material from Abu Mikhnaf, in addition to some from the primary works of Awana, al-Mada'ini and Nasr ibn Muzahim [103]\nAlthough Tabari and other early sources contain some miraculous stories, [99] these sources are mainly historical and rational in nature, [104] in contrast to the literature of later periods, which is mainly hagiographical in nature [104] [105]\nThe Battle of Karbala was also reported by an early Christian source A history by the Syriac Christian scholar Theophilus of Edessa, who was chief astrologer in the Abbasid court between 775 and 785, is partially preserved in a number of extant Christian chronicles, including those by Michael the Syrian and the Byzantine historian Theophanes the Confessor [k] [107]\n\n\nTomb\nHusayn ibn Ali's tomb is located in the city of Karbala, about 90 km southwest of Baghdad This tomb was probably formed two centuries after the event of Karbala and was rebuilt and expanded until the thirteenth century AH This place did not have a building at first and was marked with a simple sign After that, in the third century AH, a monument was built on it, which was considered during the time of some Abbasid caliphs and Dailami princes and patriarchal and Ottoman rulers, and over time, the city of Karbala was built and expanded around it [108]\n\n\nCommemoration\nShi'a Muslims consider pilgrimages to Husayn's tomb to be a source of divine blessings and rewards [109] According to Shi'a tradition the first such visit was performed by Husayn's son Ali al-Sajjad and the surviving family members during their return from Syria to Medina The first historically recorded visit is Sulayman ibn Surad and the Penitents going to Husayn's grave before their departure to Syria They are reported to have lamented and beaten their chests and to have spent a night by the tomb [110] Thereafter this tradition was limited to the Shi'a imams for several decades, before gaining momentum under the sixth Shi'a imam Jafar Sadiq and his followers Buyids and Safavids also encouraged this practice [109] Special visits are paid on 10 Muharram (Ashura Pilgrimage) and 40 days after the anniversary of Husayn's (Arba'in pilgrimage) [111] In Shi'a tradition, Husayn's martyrdom is also connected to the hagiography of John the Baptist [112]\n\n\nFamily life\nHusayn's first marriage was with Rubab Her father, Imra' al-Qais, a chief of Banu Kalb, came to Medina during the Caliphate of Umar, and was appointed by him as the chief of the Quda'a tribes Ali proposed her marriage with Husayn, but since Husayn and Imra al-Qais's daughter were too young at the time, the actual marriage took place later Husayn had a daughter, Amena (or Amina or Omayma) who is known as Sakinah, from her According to a narration recorded by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, Hasan has blamed Husayn for his excessive favors to Rubab Husayn, in response, depicted his great love for Rubab and Sakinah in three lines of poetry Later on Rubab bore a son, Abd Allah (or according to recent Shia sources, Ali al-Asghar) for him Husayn's kunya, Abu Abd Allah, probably refers to this son After Husayn's death, Rubab spent a year in grief at his grave and refused to marry again [11]\n\n\nPersonality and appearance\nHusayn had a white face and sometimes wore a green turban and sometimes a black turban He would travel with the poor or invite them to his house and feed them Mu'awiya said about Husayn that he and his father Ali were not deceitful, and Amr ibn al-As considered him the most beloved of the earthlings to the people of heaven [31]\n\n\nIn the Quran and Hadith\nMany Sunni and Shia'a commentators, such as Fakhr Razi and Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i, in their interpretation of Surah Al-Insan, attribute its revelation to Ali and Fatima and the story of the illness of their child or children and a vow for their recovery [141] [142]\n\n\nIn the verses of the Quran\nMany Sunni and Shia'a commentators, such as Fakhr Razi and Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i, in their interpretation of Surah Al-Insan, attribute its revelation to Ali and Fatima and the story of the illness of their child or children and a vow for their recovery [141] [142]\n\n\nIn the biography of the Prophet of Islam\nHusayn is placed as an example for the second weight in the narrations related to \"Thaqalin\" In another group of narrations related to Hasnain, they are introduced as \"the master of the youth of Paradise\" His name and Hassan's, due to their young age, are among those who pledge allegiance in renewing allegiance to the Prophet, which indicates the Prophet's goal in strengthening their historical and social status [146]\n\n\nNews of Husayn's fate\nThere are narrations that Gabriel informed Muhammad at the time of Husayn's birth that his ummah would kill Husayn and that the Imamate would be from Husayn, and that Muhammad informed his companions of how Husayn had been killed Except for Muhammad, Ali and Hasan, they had said the same thing God also informed the previous prophets about the killing of Husayn [31] Ali also knew that Husayn would be killed in Karbala, and once he passed by this area, he stopped and cried and remembered the news of Muhammad He interpreted Karbala (کربلا) as (کرب) anguish and (بلا) calamity The slain of Karbala will enter Paradise without any reckoning [10]\n\n\nWorks\nThere are narrations, sermons and letters left from Husayn Ibn Ali which are available in Sunni and Shiite sources Narrations about him can be divided into two periods before and after the Imamate In the first period – which is the period of his life in the life of his grandfather, father, mother and brother – there are at least two types of narrations about him: first, his narrations from his relatives, and second, his personal hadiths In Sunni sources, only the aspect of the narration of his hadith has been considered in these hadiths These Musnads, like the Musnad of the Companions of the Prophet of Islam, also have a Musnad named Husayn Ibn Ali In his Musnad, Abu Bakr Bazar has narrated the Musnad of Husayn Ibn Ali with 4 hadiths and Tabarani has narrated his Musnad with 27 hadiths, respectively In the Musnad of Husayn ibn Ali, in addition to the hadiths of Husayn himself, there are also hadiths of the Prophet of Islam and Ali ibn Abi Talib In the present era, Azizullah Atardi has compiled the document of the Imam of the Martyr Abi Abdullah Al-Husayn Ibn Ali [147]\n\n\nViews\nThe killing of Husayn has had an emotional impact on Sunnis, [150] who remember the event as a tragic incident and those killed in the company of Husayn as martyrs [151] The impact on Shi'a Islam has been much deeper [150] [151] According to Vaglieri, only the adherents of the Umayyad who considered him as \"a rebel against the established authority\", condoned his murder by Yazid, but their opinion was opposed by the majority of Muslims [152] Therefore, almost all Muslims consider Husayn honorable because he was the grandson of Muhammad and because of the belief that he sacrificed himself for an ideal [152] Historian Edward Gibbon described the events at Karbala as a tragedy [153] [154] According to historian Syed Akbar Hyder, Mahatma Gandhi attributed the historical progress of Islam, to the \"sacrifices of Muslim saints like Husayn\" rather than military force [155]\n\n\nSunnis\nThe positive attitude of the Sunnis towards Husayn, according to Vaglieri, is most likely due to the sad narrations that Abu Mikhnaf has collected, some of which have been narrated directly or with short chains of transmitters, mostly from Kufis who regretted their actions towards Husayn These sad narrations of the Kufis, which were a sign of Abu Mikhnaf's Shia tendencies, became the source of the narrations used by later historians and spread throughout the Islamic world [152] According to Rasul Jafarian, the Shia historian, fatalism, being promoted by Mu'awiya, caused Husayn's move to never be considered an uprising against corruption by the Sunnis, and they only considered it an illegal insurrection (Fitna) [156]\n\n\nShias\nThe most important components of Shia views about Husayn are the belief in the Imamate of Husayn and the characteristics of an Imam by the Shia religions; Twelvers, Ismailis and Zaydis Like other Imams, Husayn is a mediator with God for those who call on him; \"it is through his intercession (Tawassul) that his faithful followers obtain guidance and attain salvation.\" [152]\n\n\nHusayn's head in Isma'ilism\nThe Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali conquered Palestine under Caliph al-Mustansir Billah and discovered the head of Husayn in AH 448 (1056 AD) He constructed the minbar, a mosque and the mashhad at the place of burial, known as the Shrine of Husayn's Head [160] [161] The shrine was described as the most magnificent building in Ashkelon [162] During the British Mandate it was a \"large maqam on top of a hill\" with no tomb but a fragment of a pillar showing the place where the head had been buried [163] Israeli Defense Forces under Moshe Dayan blew up Mashhad Nabi Husayn in July 1950 as part of a broader operation [164] Around the year 2000, Isma'ilis from India built a marble platform there, on the grounds of the Barzilai Medical Center [165] [166] [164] The head remained buried in Ashkelon until 1153 (for about 250 years) only Fearing the crusaders, Ashkelon's ruler Sayf al-Mamlaka Tamim brought the head to Cairo on 31 August 1153 (8 Jumada al-Thani, AH 548) [167] [166]\n\n\nAhl-e Haqq\nIn the holy text of Yarsanism named Zolāl Zolāl is a long dialogue between angels Ruchiyar and Ayvat and their reincarnations It is written in the book that the angel Ayvat incarnated into Husayn ibn Ali and after his death into an Yari saint named Baba Yadegar [168]\n\n\nModern historical views on motivations of Husayn\nVaglieri considers him to be motivated by ideology, saying that if the materials that have come down to us are authentic, they convey an image of person who is \"convinced that he was in the right, stubbornly determined to achieve his ends...\" [169] Holding a similar view, Madelung has argued that Husayn was not a \"reckless rebel\" but a religious man motivated by pious convictions According to him, Husayn was convinced that \"the family of the Prophet was divinely chosen to lead the community founded by Moḥammad, as the latter had been chosen, and had both an inalienable right and an obligation to seek this leadership.\" He was, however, not seeking martyrdom and wanted to return when his expected support did not materialize [48] Maria Dakake holds that Husayn considered the Umayyad rule oppressive and misguided, and revolted to reorient the Islamic community in the right direction [170] A similar view is held by Mahmoud Ayoub [171] S M Jafri proposes that Husayn, although motivated by ideology, did not intend to secure leadership for himself Husayn, Jafri asserts, was from the start aiming for martyrdom in order to jolt the collective conscience of the Muslim community and reveal what he considers to be the oppressive and anti-Islamic nature of the Umayyad regime [172]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe first political use of the death of Husayn seems to have been during the revolt of Mukhtar, when he seized Kufa under the slogan of \"Revenge for Husayn\" [176] [177] Although the Penitents had used the same slogan, they do not seem to have had a political program [176] In order to enhance their legitimacy, Abbasid rulers claimed to have avenged the death of Husayn by dethroning the Umayyads [178] During the early years of their rule, they also encouraged Muharram rituals [179] Buyids, a Shi'a dynasty originally from Iran which later occupied the Abbasid capital Baghdad while accepting the Abbasid caliph's suzerainty, [180] promoted the public rituals of Muharram to portray themselves as patrons of religion and to strengthen the Shi'a identity in Iraq [117] After taking over Iran in 1501, Safavids, who were previously a Sufi order, declared the state religion to be Twelver Shi'ism In this regard, Karbala and Muharram rituals came to be a vehicle of Safavid propaganda and a means of consolidating the dynasty's Shi'a identity [181] Riza Yildirim has claimed that the impetus of the Safvid revolution was the revenge of the death of Husayn [182] The founder of the dynasty, Shah Ismail, considered himself to be the Mahdi (the twelfth Shi'a Imam) or his forerunner [183] [184] Similarly, Qajars also patronized Muharram rituals such as processions, taziya and majalis, to improve the relationship between the state and the public [185]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe first political use of the death of Husayn seems to have been during the revolt of Mukhtar, when he seized Kufa under the slogan of \"Revenge for Husayn\" [176] [177] Although the Penitents had used the same slogan, they do not seem to have had a political program [176] In order to enhance their legitimacy, Abbasid rulers claimed to have avenged the death of Husayn by

taziya and majalis, to improve the relationship between the state and the public [185]\n\n\nIranian Revolution\nKarbala and Shi'a symbolism played a significant role in the Iranian Revolution of 1979 [186] In contrast to the traditional view of Shi'ism as a religion of suffering, mourning and political quietism, Shi'a Islam and Karbala were given a new interpretation in the period preceding the revolution by rationalist intellectuals and religious revisionists like Jalal Al-e-Ahmad, Ali Shariati and Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi [187] [188] According to these, Shi'ism was an ideology of revolution and political struggle against tyranny and exploitation, [189] and the Battle of Karbala and the death of Husayn was to be seen as a model for revolutionary struggle; [190] weeping and mourning was to be replaced by political activism to realize the ideals of Husayn [191]\n\n\nIn art and literature\nMir Mosharraf Hossain's 19th century novel on Karbala, Bishad Sindhu (the Ocean of Sorrow), established the precedent of the Islamic epic in Bangali literature [202] South Asian philosopher and poet Muhammad Iqbal sees Husayn's sacrifice as being similar to that of Ishmael and compares Yazid's opposition to Husayn with the opposition of Pharaoh to Moses [203] Urdu poet Ghalib compares Husayn's suffering with that of Mansur al-Hallaj, a tenth century Sufi, who was executed on a charge of claiming divinity [204]\n\n\nLiterature\nMir Mosharraf Hossain's 19th century novel on Karbala, Bishad Sindhu (the Ocean of Sorrow), established the precedent of the Islamic epic in Bangali literature [202] South Asian philosopher and poet Muhammad Iqbal sees Husayn's sacrifice as being similar to that of Ishmael and compares Yazid's opposition to Husayn with the opposition of Pharaoh to Moses [203] Urdu poet Ghalib compares Husayn's suffering with that of Mansur al-Hallaj, a tenth century Sufi, who was executed on a charge of claiming divinity [204]\n\n\nMaqtal literature and legendary accounts\nMaqtal (pl Maqatil) works narrate the story of someone's death [205] Although Maqatil on the deaths of Ali, Uthman and various others have been written, [206] the Maqtal genre has focused mainly on the story of Husayn's death [207] [208]\n\n\nMarthiya and rawda\nWhen Shi'ism became the official religion of Iran in the 16th century, Safavid rulers such as Shah Tahmasp I, patronized poets who wrote about the Battle of Karbala [215] The genre of marthiya (poems in the memory of the dead, with popular forms of Karbala related marthiya being rawda and nawha), [216] according to Persian scholar Wheeler Thackston, \"was particularly cultivated by the Safavids.\" [215] Various Persian authors wrote texts retelling romanticized and synthesized versions of the battle and events from it, [127] [217] including Sa'id al-Din's Rawdat al-Islam (The Garden of Islam) and Al-Khawarazmi's Maqtal nur 'al-'a'emmah (The Site of the Murder of the Light of the Imams) These influenced the composition of the more popular text Rawdat al-Shuhada (Garden of Martyrs), which was written in 1502 by Husain Wa'iz Kashefi [217] [127] Kashefi's composition was an effective factor in the development of rawda khwani, a ritual recounting of the battle events in majalis [217]\n\n\nSufi poetry\nIn Sufism, where annihilation of the self (nafs) and suffering in the path of God are paramount principles, Husayn is seen as a model Sufi [223] Persian Sufi poet Hakim Sanai describes Husayn as a martyr, higher in rank than all the other martyrs of the world; while Farid ud-Din Attar considers him a prototype of a Sufi who sacrificed himself in the love of God [224] Jalal ud-Din Rumi describes Husayn's suffering at Karbala as a means to achieve union with the divine, and hence considers it to be a matter of jubilation rather than grief [225] Sindhi Sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai devoted a section in his Shah Jo Risalo to the death of Husayn, in which the incident is remembered in laments and elegies [226] He too sees Husayn's death as a sacrifice made in the path of God, and condemns Yazid as being bereft of divine love [227] Turkish Sufi Yunus Emre labels Husayn, along with his brother Hasan, as the \"fountain head of the martyrs\" and \"Kings of the Paradise\" in his songs [228]\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Prithviraj_Chauhan", "content": "\nSources of information\nThe extant inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign are few in number and were not issued by the king himself [2] Much of the information about him comes from the medieval legendary chronicles Besides the Muslim accounts of Battles of Tarain, he has been mentioned in several medieval kavyas (epic poems) by Hindu and Jain authors These include Prithviraja Vijaya, Hammira Mahakavya and Prithviraj Raso These texts contain eulogistic descriptions, and are, therefore, not entirely reliable [3] Prithviraja Vijaya is the only surviving literary text from the reign of Prithviraj [4] Prithviraj Raso, which popularized Prithviraj as a great king, is purported to be written by his court poet Chand Bardai However, it contains many exaggerated accounts, much of which is not useful for the purposes of history [3]\n\n\nEarly life\nPrithviraj was born to the Chahamana king Someshvara and queen Karpuradevi (a Kalachuri princess) [8] Both Prithviraj and his younger brother Hariraja were born in Gujarat, where their father Someshvara was brought up at the Chaulukya court by his maternal relatives [8] According to Prithviraja Vijaya, Prithviraj was born on the 12th day of the Jyeshtha month The text does not mention the year of his birth, but provides some of the astrological planetary positions at the time of his birth, calling them auspicious Based on these positions and assuming certain other planetary positions, Dasharatha Sharma calculated the year of Prithviraj's birth as 1166 CE (1223 VS) [9] [10]\n\n\nReign\nPrithviraj moved from Gujarat to Ajmer, when his father Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of Prithviraja II [12] Someshvara died in 1177 CE (1234 VS), when Prithviraj was around 11 years old The last inscription from Someshvara's reign and the first inscription from Prithviraj's reign are both dated to this year Prithviraj, who was a minor at the time, ascended the throne with his mother as the regent [9] The Hammira Mahakavya claims that Someshvara himself installed Prithviraj on the throne, and then retired to the forest However, this is doubtful [13]\n\n\nEarly reign\nPrithviraj moved from Gujarat to Ajmer, when his father Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of Prithviraja II [12] Someshvara died in 1177 CE (1234 VS), when Prithviraj was around 11 years old The last inscription from Someshvara's reign and the first inscription from Prithviraj's reign are both dated to this year Prithviraj, who was a minor at the time, ascended the throne with his mother as the regent [9] The Hammira Mahakavya claims that Someshvara himself installed Prithviraj on the throne, and then retired to the forest However, this is doubtful [13]\n\n\nConflict with Nagarjuna and Bhadanakas\nThe first military achievement of Prithviraj was his suppression of a revolt by his cousin Nagarjuna, and recapture of Gudapura (IAST: Guḍapura; possibly modern Gurgaon) [3] [14] Nagarjuna was a son of Prithviraj's uncle Vigraharaja IV, and the struggle for the Chahamana throne had led to a rivalry between the two branches of the family [14]\n\n\nWar against Chandelas\nThe 1182–83 CE (1239 VS) Madanpur inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign claim that he \"laid to waste\" Jejakabhukti (present-day Bundelkhand), which was ruled by the Chandela king Paramardi [17] Prithviraj's invasion of the Chandela territory is also described in the later folk legends, such as Prithviraj Raso, Paramal Raso, and Alha-Raso [18] Other texts such as Sarangadhara Paddhati and Prabandha Chintamani also mention Prithviraj's attack on Paramardi [19] The Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali mentions that Prithviraj had embarked upon a digvijaya (conquest of all the regions) This appears to be a reference to the start of Prithviraj's march to Jejakabhukti [17]\n\n\nWars in Gujarat\nThe Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali mentions a peace treaty between Prithviraj, and Bhima II, the Chaulukya (Solanki) king of Gujarat This implies that the two kings were previously at war [5] This war can be dated to sometime before 1187 CE (1244 VS) The Veraval inscription states that Bhima's prime minister Jagaddeva Pratihara was \"the moon to the lotus-like queens of Prithviraja\" (a reference to the belief that the moon-rise causes a day-blooming lotus to close its petals) [23] Since Bhima was a minor at the time, it appears that Jagaddeva led the campaign on the Chaulukya side [24]\n\n\nParamaras\nThe area around Mount Abu was ruled by the Chandravati Paramara ruler Dharavarsha, who was a Chaulukya feudatory Partha-Parakrama-Vyayoga, a text written by his younger brother Prahaladana, describes Prithviraj's night attack on Abu This attack, according to the text, was a failure for the Chahamanas It probably happened during the Gujarat campaign of Prithviraj [25]\n\n\nGahadavala conflict\nThe Gahadavala kingdom, centered around Kannauj and headed by another powerful king Jayachandra, was located to the east of the Chahamana kingdom According to a legend mentioned in Prithviraj Raso, Prithviraj eloped with Jayachandra's daughter Samyogita, leading to a rivalry between the two kings [32]\n\n\nOther rulers\nThe Prithviraj Raso mentions that Prithviraj defeated Nahar Rai of Mandovara and the Mughal chief Mudgala Rai, but these stories appear to be pure fiction No historical records suggest existence of these persons [3]\n\n\nWar with the Ghurids\nPrithviraj's predecessors had faced multiple raids from the Muslim dynasties that had captured the north-western areas of the Indian subcontinent by the 12th century [41] By the late 12th century, the Ghazna-based Ghurid dynasty controlled the territory to the west of the Chahamana kingdom While Prithviraj was still a child, in 1175 CE, the Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghor crossed the Indus River and captured Multan In 1178 CE, he invaded Gujarat, which was ruled by the Chaulukyas (Solankis) During its march to Gujarat, the Ghurid army appears to have passed through the western frontier of the Chahamana kingdom, as evident by the destruction of several temples and sacking of the Bhati-ruled Lodhruva [42] The Prithviraja Vijaya mentions that the activities of the Ghurid army were like Rahu to the Chahamana kingdom (in Hindu mythology, Rahu swallows the Sun, causing a solar eclipse) However, it does not mention any military engagement between the two kingdoms [43] On its way to Gujarat, the Ghurid army besieged the Naddula (Nadol) fort, which was controlled by the Chahamanas of Naddula Prithviraj's chief minister Kadambavasa advised him not to offer any assistance to the rivals of the Ghurids, and to stay away from this conflict [43] [44] The Chahamanas did not immediately face a Ghurid invasion, because the Chaulukyas of Gujarat defeated Muhammad at the Battle of Kasahrada in 1178 CE, forcing the Ghurids to retreat [44]\n\n\nFirst battle of Tarain\nDuring 1190–1191 CE, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Chahamana territory, and captured Tabarhindah or Tabar-e-Hind (identified with Bathinda) He placed it under the charge of Zia-ud-din, the Qazi of Tulak, supported by 1200 horsemen When Prithviraj learned about this, marched towards Tabarhindah with his feudatories, including Govindaraja of Delhi According to the 16th-century Muslim historian Firishta, his force comprised 200,000 horses and 3,000 elephants [53]\n\n\nSecond battle of Tarain\nPrithviraj seems to have treated the first battle of Tarain as merely a frontier fight This view is strengthened by the fact that he made little preparations for any future clash with Muhammad of Ghor According to Prithviraj Raso, during the period preceding his final confrontation with the Ghurids, he neglected the affairs of the state and spent time in merry-making [55] [33]\n\n\nJain accounts of Prithviraj's downfall\nPrabandha Chintamani by the 14th-century Jain scholar Merutunga states that Prithviraj cut off the ears of one of his ministers, who guided the Ghurid invaders to his camp as revenge Prithviraj was in deep sleep after a day of religious fasting, and therefore, was easily captured  [66]\n\n\nDeath and succession\nMost medieval sources state that Prithviraj was taken to the Chahamana capital Ajmer, where Muhammad planned to reinstate him as a Ghurid vassal Sometime later, Prithviraj rebelled against Muhammad, and was killed for treason [65] This is corroborated by numismatic evidence: some 'horse-and-bullman'-style coins bearing names of both Prithviraj and \"Muhammad bin Sam\" were issued from the Delhi mint, [68] [69] although another possibility is that the Ghurids initially used Chahamana-style coinage to ensure greater acceptance of their own coinage in the former Chahamana territory [68] After Prithviraj's death, Muhammad installed the Chahamana prince Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer, which further supports this theory [69]\n\n\nCultural activities\nPrithviraj had a dedicated ministry for pandits (scholars) and poets, which was under the charge of Padmanabha His court had a number of poets and scholars, including: [57]\n\n\nLegacy\nAccording to historian R B Singh, at its height, Prithviraj's empire extended from Sutlej river in the west to the Betwa river in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the foot of Mount Abu in the south Thus, it included parts of present-day Rajasthan, Uttrakhand, southern Punjab, northern Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and western Uttar Pradesh [79] [better source needed]\n\n\nInscriptions\nAccording to historian R B Singh, at its height, Prithviraj's empire extended from Sutlej river in the west to the Betwa river in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the foot of Mount Abu in the south Thus, it included parts of present-day Rajasthan, Uttrakhand, southern Punjab, northern Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and western Uttar Pradesh [79] [better source needed]\n\n\nCharacterization\nThe late medieval (14th and 15th centuries) Sanskrit stories about Prithviraj present him as an unsuccessful king who was memorable only for his defeat against a foreign king [85] Prabandha-Chintamani and Prithviraja-Prabandha, written by Jain authors, portray him as an inept and unworthy king who was responsible for his own downfall, and whose mistreatment of his devout subordinates turned them into traitors In contrast, the Hammira Mahakavya, also written by a Jain author, presents him as a brave man whose subordinates turned against him out of pure greed The Hammira Mahakavya, which was probably intended to please a Chauhan lord, retains the elements of the Jain tradition that occur in the two Prabandha texts, but also attempts to glorify Prithviraj who was an ancestor of the text's hero Hammira [67]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nMemorials dedicated to Prithviraj have been constructed in Ajmer and Delhi [95] A number of Indian films and television series have been made on his life These include: Prithviraj Chouhan (1924), Prithviraj Sanyogita (1929) by Narayanrao D Sarpotdar, Prithviraj (1931) by R N Vaidya, Prithviraj Sanyogita (1933), Prithivirajan (1942) by B Sampathkumar, Prithviraj Samyogita (1946) by Najam Naqvi, Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan (1959) by Harsukh Jagneshwar Bhatt, Rani Samyuktha (1962) by D Yoganand, Samrat Prithviraj (2022) by Chandraprakash Dwivedi; [96] [97] and the Hindi television serials Main Dilli Hoon (1998–1999) and Dharti Ka Veer Yodha Prithviraj Chauhan (2006–2009).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Prithviraj Chauhan**\n\nPrithviraj Chauhan was a king of the Chauhan dynasty who ruled over the kingdom of Ajmer in present-day Rajasthan, India. He is known for his military campaigns and his eventual defeat at the hands of the Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghor. Prithviraj's life and reign are documented in several medieval sources, including the Prithviraja Vijaya, Hammira Mahakavya, and Prithviraj Raso, which provide a comprehensive account of his life and reign.\n\n**Sources of Information**\n\nThe extant inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign are few in number and were not issued by the king himself. Much of the information about him comes from the medieval legendary chronicles, which are not entirely reliable. These chronicles contain eulogistic descriptions and exaggerate Prithviraj's achievements. The Prithviraja Vijaya is the only surviving literary text from the reign of Prithviraj. The Prithviraj Raso, which popularized Prithviraj as a great king, is purported to be written by his court poet Chand Bardai, but it contains many exaggerated accounts that are not useful for historical purposes.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPrithviraj was born to the Chahamana king Someshvara and queen Karpuradevi, a Kalachuri princess. Both Prithviraj and his younger brother Hariraja were born in Gujarat, where their father Someshvara was brought up at the Chaulukya court by his maternal relatives.

Dasharatha Sharma calculated the year of Prithviraj's birth as 1166 CE (1223 VS) based on the astrological planetary positions at the time of his birth.\n\n**Reign**\n\nPrithviraj moved from Gujarat to Ajmer when his father Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of Prithviraja II. Someshvara died in 1177 CE (1234 VS), when Prithviraj was around 11 years old. The last inscription from Someshvara's reign and the first inscription from Prithviraj's reign are both dated to this year. Prithviraj, who was a minor at the time, ascended the throne with his mother as the regent.\n\n**Early Reign**\n\nPrithviraj's early reign was marked by a series of military campaigns against his cousins and neighboring kingdoms. The first military achievement of Prithviraj was his suppression of a revolt by his cousin Nagarjuna and the recapture of Gudapura (IAST: Guḍapura). Nagarjuna was a son of Prithviraj's uncle Vigraharaja IV, and the struggle for the Chahamana throne had led to a rivalry between the two branches of the family.\n\n**Conflict with Nagarjuna and Bhadanakas**\n\nThe conflict with Nagarjuna was followed by a series of military campaigns against the Bhadanakas, a neighboring kingdom. Prithviraj's invasion of the Chandela territory is also described in the later folk legends, such as Prithviraj Raso, Paramal Raso, and Alha-Raso.\n\n**War against Chandelas**\n\nThe 1182–83 CE (1239 VS) Madanpur inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign claim that he \"laid to waste\" Jejakabhukti (present-day Bundelkhand), which was ruled by the Chandela king Paramardi. Prithviraj's invasion of the Chandela territory is also described in the Sarangadhara Paddhati and Prabandha Chintamani. The Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali mentions that Prithviraj had embarked upon a digvijaya (conquest of all the regions) during this period.\n\n**Wars in Gujarat**\n\nThe Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali mentions a peace treaty between Prithviraj and Bhima II, the Chaulukya (Solanki) king of Gujarat. This implies that the two kings were previously at war. The Veraval inscription states that Bhima's prime minister Jagaddeva Pratihara was \"the moon to the lotus-like queens of Prithviraj.\" Since Bhima was a minor at the time, it appears that Jagaddeva led the campaign on the Chaulukya side.\n\n**Paramaras**\n\nThe area around Mount Abu was ruled by the Chandravati Paramara ruler Dharavarsha, who was a Chaulukya feudatory. Partha-Parakrama-Vyayoga, a text written by his younger brother Prahaladana, describes Prithviraj's night attack on Abu. This attack, according to the text, was a failure for the Chahamanas. It probably happened during the Gujarat campaign of Prithviraj.\n\n**Gahadavala Conflict**\n\nThe Gahadavala kingdom, centered around Kannauj and headed by another powerful king Jayachandra, was located to the east of the Chahamana kingdom. According to a legend mentioned in Prithviraj Raso, Prithviraj eloped with Jayachandra's daughter Samyogita, leading to a rivalry between the two kings.\n\n**Other Rulers**\n\nThe Prithviraj Raso mentions that Prithviraj defeated Nahar Rai of Mandovara and the Mughal chief Mudgala Rai, but these stories appear to be pure fiction. No historical records suggest existence of these persons.\n\n**War with the Ghurids**\n\nPrithviraj's predecessors had faced multiple raids from the Muslim dynasties that had captured the north-western areas of the Indian subcontinent by the 12th century. By the late 12th century, the Ghazna-based Ghurid dynasty controlled the territory to the west of the Chahamana kingdom. While Prithviraj was still a child, in 1175 CE, the Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghor crossed the Indus River and captured Multan. In 1178 CE, he invaded Gujarat, which was ruled by the Chaulukyas (Solankis). The Prithviraja Vijaya mentions that the activities of the Ghurid army were like Rahu to the Chahamana kingdom.\n\n**First Battle of Tarain**\n\nDuring 1190–1191 CE, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Chahamana territory, and captured Tabarhindah or Tabar-e-Hind (identified with Bathinda). He placed it under the charge of Zia-ud-din, the Qazi of Tulak, supported by 1200 horsemen. When Prithviraj learned about this, he marched towards Tabarhindah with his feudatories. According to the 16th-century Muslim historian Firishta, his force comprised 200,000 horses and 3,000 elephants.\n\n**Second Battle of Tarain**\n\nPrithviraj seems to have treated the first battle of Tarain as merely a frontier fight. This view is strengthened by the fact that he made little preparations for any future clash with Muhammad of Ghor. According to the Prithviraj Raso, during the period preceding his final confrontation with the Ghurids, he neglected the affairs of the state and spent time in merry-making.\n\n**Jain Accounts of Prithviraj's Downfall**\n\nThe Prabandha Chintamani by the 14th-century Jain scholar Merutunga states that Prithviraj cut off the ears of one of his ministers, who guided the Ghurid invaders to his camp as revenge. Prithviraj was in deep sleep after a day of religious fasting, and therefore, was easily captured.\n\n**Death and Succession**\n\nMost medieval sources state that Prithviraj was taken to the Chahamana capital Ajmer, where Muhammad planned to reinstate him as a Ghurid vassal. Sometime later, Prithviraj rebelled against Muhammad, and was killed for treason. This is corroborated by numismatic evidence: some 'horse-and-bullman'-style coins bearing names of both Prithviraj and \"Muhammad bin Sam\" were issued from the Delhi mint. After Prithviraj's death, Muhammad installed the Chahamana prince Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer.\n\n**Cultural Activities**\n\nPrithviraj had a dedicated ministry for pandits (scholars) and poets, which was under the charge of Padmanabha. His court had a number of poets and scholars, including Chand Bardai, who wrote the Prithviraj Raso.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nAccording to historian R B Singh, at its height, Prithviraj's empire extended from Sutlej river in the west to the Betwa river in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the foot of Mount Abu in the south. Thus, it included parts of present-day Rajasthan, Uttrakhand, southern Punjab, northern Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and western Uttar Pradesh.\n\n**Inscriptions**\n\nAccording to historian R B Singh, at its height, Prithviraj's empire extended from Sutlej river in the west to the Betwa river in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the foot of Mount Abu in the south. Thus, it included parts of present-day Rajasthan, Uttrakhand, southern Punjab, northern Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and western Uttar Pradesh.\n\n**Characterization**\n\nThe late medieval (14th and 15th centuries) Sanskrit stories about Prithviraj present him as an unsuccessful king who was memorable only for his defeat against a foreign king. The Prabandha-Chintamani and Prithviraja-Prabandha, written by Jain authors, portray him as an inept and unworthy king who was responsible for his own downfall, and whose mistreatment of his devout subordinates turned them into traitors. In contrast, the Hammira Mahakavya, also written by a Jain author, presents him as a brave man whose subordinates turned against him out of pure greed.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nMemorials dedicated to Prithviraj have been constructed in Ajmer and Delhi. A number of Indian films and television series have been made on his life, including Prithviraj Chouhan (1924), Prithviraj Sanyogita (1929), Prithviraj (1931), Prithviraj Sanyogita (1933), Prithivirajan (1942), Prithviraj Samyogita (1946), Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan (1959), Rani Samyuktha (1962), and Samrat Prithviraj (2022).", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Prithviraj_Chauhan\" following this outline:\n\n\nSources of information\nThe extant inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign are few in number and were not issued by the king himself [2] Much of the information about him comes from the medieval legendary chronicles Besides the Muslim accounts of Battles of Tarain, he has been mentioned in several medieval kavyas (epic poems) by Hindu and Jain authors These include Prithviraja Vijaya, Hammira Mahakavya and Prithviraj Raso These texts contain eulogistic descriptions, and are, therefore, not entirely reliable [3] Prithviraja Vijaya is the only surviving literary text from the reign of Prithviraj [4] Prithviraj Raso, which popularized Prithviraj as a great king, is purported to be written by his court poet Chand Bardai However, it contains many exaggerated accounts, much of which is not useful for the purposes of history [3]\n\n\nEarly life\nPrithviraj was born to the Chahamana king Someshvara and queen Karpuradevi (a Kalachuri princess) [8] Both Prithviraj and his younger brother Hariraja were born in Gujarat, where their father Someshvara was brought up at the Chaulukya court by his maternal relatives [8] According to Prithviraja Vijaya, Prithviraj was born on the 12th day of the Jyeshtha month The text does not mention the year of his birth, but provides some of the astrological planetary positions at the time of his birth, calling them auspicious Based on these positions and assuming certain other planetary positions, Dasharatha Sharma calculated the year of Prithviraj's birth as 1166 CE (1223 VS) [9] [10]\n\n\nReign\nPrithviraj moved from Gujarat to Ajmer, when his father Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of Prithviraja II [12] Someshvara died in 1177 CE (1234 VS), when Prithviraj was around 11 years old The last inscription from Someshvara's reign and the first inscription from Prithviraj's reign are both dated to this year Prithviraj, who was a minor at the time, ascended the throne with his mother as the regent [9] The Hammira Mahakavya claims that Someshvara himself installed Prithviraj on the throne, and then retired to the forest However, this is doubtful [13]\n\n\nEarly reign\nPrithviraj moved from Gujarat to Ajmer, when his father Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of Prithviraja II [12] Someshvara died in 1177 CE (1234 VS), when Prithviraj was around 11 years old The last inscription from Someshvara's reign and the first inscription from Prithviraj's reign are both dated to this year Prithviraj, who was a minor at the time, ascended the throne with his mother as the regent [9] The Hammira Mahakavya claims that Someshvara himself installed Prithviraj on the throne, and then retired to the forest However, this is doubtful [13]\n\n\nConflict with Nagarjuna and Bhadanakas\nThe first military achievement of Prithviraj was his suppression of a revolt by his cousin Nagarjuna, and recapture of Gudapura (IAST: Guḍapura; possibly modern Gurgaon) [3] [14] Nagarjuna was a son of Prithviraj's uncle Vigraharaja IV, and the struggle for the Chahamana throne had led to a rivalry between the two branches of the family [14]\n\n\nWar against Chandelas\nThe 1182–83 CE (1239 VS) Madanpur inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign claim that he \"laid to waste\" Jejakabhukti (present-day Bundelkhand), which was ruled by the Chandela king Paramardi [17] Prithviraj's invasion of the Chandela territory is also described in the later folk legends, such as Prithviraj Raso, Paramal Raso, and Alha-Raso [18] Other texts such as Sarangadhara Paddhati and Prabandha Chintamani also mention Prithviraj's attack on Paramardi [19] The Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali mentions that Prithviraj had embarked upon a digvijaya (conquest of all the regions) This appears to be a reference to the start of Prithviraj's march to Jejakabhukti [17]\n\n\nWars in Gujarat\nThe Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali mentions a peace treaty between Prithviraj, and Bhima II, the Chaulukya (Solanki) king of Gujarat This implies that the two kings were previously at war [5] This war can be dated to sometime before 1187 CE (1244 VS) The Veraval inscription states that Bhima's prime minister Jagaddeva Pratihara was \"the moon to the lotus-like queens of Prithviraja\" (a reference to the belief that the moon-rise causes a day-blooming lotus to close its petals) [23] Since Bhima was a minor at the time, it appears that Jagaddeva led the campaign on the Chaulukya side [24]\n\n\nParamaras\nThe area around Mount Abu was ruled by the Chandravati Paramara ruler Dharavarsha, who was a Chaulukya feudatory Partha-Parakrama-Vyayoga, a text written by his younger brother Prahaladana, describes Prithviraj's night attack on Abu This attack, according to the text, was a failure for the Chahamanas It probably happened during the Gujarat campaign of Prithviraj [25]\n\n\nGahadavala conflict\nThe Gahadavala kingdom, centered around Kannauj and headed by another powerful king Jayachandra, was located to the east of the Chahamana kingdom According to a legend mentioned in Prithviraj Raso, Prithviraj eloped with Jayachandra's daughter Samyogita, leading to a rivalry between the two kings [32]\n\n\nOther rulers\nThe Prithviraj Raso mentions that Prithviraj defeated Nahar Rai of Mandovara and the Mughal chief Mudgala Rai,

dynasties that had captured the north-western areas of the Indian subcontinent by the 12th century [41] By the late 12th century, the Ghazna-based Ghurid dynasty controlled the territory to the west of the Chahamana kingdom While Prithviraj was still a child, in 1175 CE, the Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghor crossed the Indus River and captured Multan In 1178 CE, he invaded Gujarat, which was ruled by the Chaulukyas (Solankis) During its march to Gujarat, the Ghurid army appears to have passed through the western frontier of the Chahamana kingdom, as evident by the destruction of several temples and sacking of the Bhati-ruled Lodhruva [42] The Prithviraja Vijaya mentions that the activities of the Ghurid army were like Rahu to the Chahamana kingdom (in Hindu mythology, Rahu swallows the Sun, causing a solar eclipse) However, it does not mention any military engagement between the two kingdoms [43] On its way to Gujarat, the Ghurid army besieged the Naddula (Nadol) fort, which was controlled by the Chahamanas of Naddula Prithviraj's chief minister Kadambavasa advised him not to offer any assistance to the rivals of the Ghurids, and to stay away from this conflict [43] [44] The Chahamanas did not immediately face a Ghurid invasion, because the Chaulukyas of Gujarat defeated Muhammad at the Battle of Kasahrada in 1178 CE, forcing the Ghurids to retreat [44]\n\n\nFirst battle of Tarain\nDuring 1190–1191 CE, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Chahamana territory, and captured Tabarhindah or Tabar-e-Hind (identified with Bathinda) He placed it under the charge of Zia-ud-din, the Qazi of Tulak, supported by 1200 horsemen When Prithviraj learned about this, marched towards Tabarhindah with his feudatories, including Govindaraja of Delhi According to the 16th-century Muslim historian Firishta, his force comprised 200,000 horses and 3,000 elephants [53]\n\n\nSecond battle of Tarain\nPrithviraj seems to have treated the first battle of Tarain as merely a frontier fight This view is strengthened by the fact that he made little preparations for any future clash with Muhammad of Ghor According to Prithviraj Raso, during the period preceding his final confrontation with the Ghurids, he neglected the affairs of the state and spent time in merry-making [55] [33]\n\n\nJain accounts of Prithviraj's downfall\nPrabandha Chintamani by the 14th-century Jain scholar Merutunga

Sometime later, Prithviraj rebelled against Muhammad, and was killed for treason [65] This is corroborated by numismatic evidence: some 'horse-and-bullman'-style coins bearing names of both Prithviraj and \"Muhammad bin Sam\" were issued from the Delhi mint, [68] [69] although another possibility is that the Ghurids initially used Chahamana-style coinage to ensure greater acceptance of their own coinage in the former Chahamana territory [68] After Prithviraj's death, Muhammad installed the Chahamana prince Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer, which further supports this theory [69]\n\n\nCultural activities\nPrithviraj had a dedicated ministry for pandits (scholars) and poets, which was under the charge of Padmanabha His court had a number of poets and scholars, including:

subordinates turned against him out of pure greed The Hammira Mahakavya, which was probably intended to please a Chauhan lord, retains the elements of the Jain tradition that occur in the two Prabandha texts, but also attempts to glorify Prithviraj who was an ancestor of the text's hero Hammira [67]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nMemorials dedicated to Prithviraj have been constructed in Ajmer

{"title": "James_Stewart", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nJames Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, [2] the eldest child and only son born to Elizabeth Ruth (née Jackson; 1875–1953) and Alexander Maitland Stewart (1872–1962) [3] Stewart had two younger sisters, Mary (1912–1977) and Virginia (1914–1972) [4] He was of Scottish and Ulster-Scots ancestry [5] The Stewart family had lived in Pennsylvania for many generations [5] Stewart's father ran the family business, the J M Stewart and Company Hardware Store, which he hoped Stewart would take over as an adult after attending Princeton University, as was the family tradition [6] Raised a Presbyterian by his deeply religious father, Stewart was a devout churchgoer for much of his life [7]\n\n\nCareer\nStewart performed in bit parts in the University Players' productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932 [27] The company's directors included Joshua Logan, Bretaigne Windust, and Charles Leatherbee, [28] and amongst its other actors were married couple Henry Fonda and Margaret Sullavan, who became Stewart's close friends [29] At the end of the season, Stewart moved to New York with his Players friends Logan, Myron McCormick, and newly single Henry Fonda [30] [31] Along with McCormick, Stewart debuted on Broadway in the brief run of Carry Nation and a few weeks later – again with McCormick – appeared as a chauffeur in the comedy Goodbye Again, in which he had a walk-on line [32] The New Yorker commented, \"Mr James Stewart's chauffeur.. comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of spontaneous applause.\" [33] Following the seven-month run of Goodbye Again, Stewart took a stage manager position in Boston, but was fired after frequently missing his cues [34] Returning to New York, he then landed a small part in Spring in Autumn and a role in All Good Americans, where he was required to throw a banjo out of the window [35] Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote, \"Throwing a $250 banjo out of the window at the concierge is constructive abuse and should be virtuously applauded.\" [36] Both plays folded after only short runs, and Stewart began to think about going back to his studies [37]\n\n\n1932–1937: Theater and early film roles\nStewart performed in bit parts in the University Players' productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932

virtuously applauded.\" [36] Both plays folded after only short runs, and Stewart began to think about going back to his studies [37]\n\n\n1938–1941: Leading man\nDespite good reviews, Stewart was still a minor star, and MGM remained hesitant to cast him in leading roles, preferring to loan him out to other studios [69] After a well-received supporting part in Of Human Hearts (1938), [70] he was loaned to RKO to act opposite Ginger Rogers in the romantic comedy Vivacious Lady (1938) [71] The production was shut down for months in 1937 as Stewart recovered from an undisclosed illness, during which he was hospitalized RKO initially wanted to replace Stewart, but eventually the project was canceled However, Rogers' success in a stage musical caused the film to be picked up again Stewart was recast in Vivacious Lady at Rogers' insistence and due to his performance in Of Human Hearts [72] It was a critical and commercial success, and showed Stewart's talent for performing in romantic comedies; [73] The New York Herald called him \"one of the most knowing and engaging young actors appearing on the screen at present\" [74]\n\n\n1941–1947: Military service\nStewart became the first major American movie star to enlist in the United States Army to fight in World War II [107] His family had deep military roots: both of his grandfathers had fought in the Civil War, [108] and his father had served during both the Spanish–American War and World War I [109] After first being rejected for low weight in November 1940, he enlisted in February 1941 [110] [a] As an experienced pilot, he reported for induction as a private in the Air Corps on March 22, 1941 [112] Soon to be 33 years old, he was over the age limit for Aviation Cadet training—the normal path of commissioning for pilots, navigators and bombardiers—and therefore applied for an Air Corps commission as both a college graduate and a licensed commercial pilot [113] Stewart received his commission as a second lieutenant on January 1, 1942 [114]\n\n\n1946–1949: Early post-war films\nAfter his experiences in the war, Stewart considered returning to Pennsylvania to run the family store [138] His former agent, Leland Hayward, had also left the talent business in 1944 after selling his roster of stars, including Stewart, to Music Corporation of America (MCA) [139] Stewart decided not to renew his MGM contract and instead signed a deal with MCA He later stated that he was given a new beginning by Frank Capra, who asked him to star in It's a Wonderful Life (1946), the first postwar film for both of them [138] Stewart played George Bailey, an upstanding small-town man who becomes increasingly frustrated by his ordinary existence and financial troubles Driven to suicide on Christmas Eve, he is led to reassess his life by Clarence Odbody, an \"angel, second class\", played by Henry Travers During filming, Stewart experienced doubts about his abilities and continued to consider retiring from acting [140]\n\n\n1950–1959: Collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Mann\nIn the 1950s, Stewart experienced a career renewal as the star of Westerns and collaborated on several films with director Anthony Mann [168] The first of these was the Universal production Winchester '73 (1950), which Stewart agreed to do in exchange for being cast in a screen adaptation of Harvey [169] It also marked a turning point in Hollywood, as Stewart's agent, Lew Wasserman, brokered an innovative deal with Universal, in which Stewart would receive no fee in exchange for a percentage of the profits Stewart was also granted authority to collaborate with the studio on casting and hiring decisions [170] Stewart ended up earning about $600,000 for Winchester '73, significantly more than his usual fee, and other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business, which further undermined the decaying studio system [171]\n\n\n1960–1970: Westerns and later career\nStewart opened the new decade by starring in the war film The Mountain Road (1960) To his surprise, it was a box office failure, despite his claims that it was one of the best scripts he'd ever read [232] He began a new director collaboration with John Ford, making his debut in his films in the Western Two Rode Together (1961), which had thematic echoes of Ford's The Searchers [233] The same year, he also narrated the film X-15 for the USAF [234] Stewart was considered for the role of Atticus Finch in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird, but he turned it down, concerned that the story was too controversial [235]\n\n\n1971–1997: Television and semi-retirement\nIn 1971, Stewart starred in the NBC sitcom The Jimmy Stewart Show [251] He played a small-town college professor whose adult son moves back home with his family Stewart disliked the amount of work needed to film the show each week and was relieved when it was canceled after only one season due to bad reviews and poor ratings [252] His only film release for 1971, the comedy-drama Fools' Parade, was more positively received [253] Robert Greenspun of The New York Times stated that \"the movie belongs to Stewart, who has never been more wonderful\" [254] For his contributions to Western films, Stewart was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City in 1972 [255]\n\n\nPosthumous work\nIn December 2023, meditation app Calm announced that Stewart would be the latest narrator for its Sleep Story series, with an AI-generated voice of the actor reading an original story \"It’s a Wonderful Sleep Story\" The project uses AI voice-cloning technology from Respeecher, and was conducted with the consent of Stewart's family and his estate [278]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAs a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, Margaret Sullavan had a unique influence on Stewart's life.\n\n\nRomantic relationships\nAs a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, Margaret Sullavan had a unique influence on Stewart's life.\n\n\nWar career as pilot (1941–1946)\nA licensed civilian pilot, Stewart enlisted in the U.S Army Air Forces early in 1941, undertaking military flight training and becoming a commissioned officer and USAAF pilot  In January 1944 in the rank of captain, he was assigned to the 453rd Bombardment Group, 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing, Eighth Air Force operating out of East Anglia, England as a bomber pilot flying the B-24 Liberator  After seeing action in Europe during World War II, he attained the rank of colonel and received several awards for his service He remained in the Army Air Forces Reserve after the end of World War II, which would become the Air Force Reserve when the U.S Air Force became an independent service in 1947  He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve in 1959 He retired from the service in 1968, at which time he was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal [d] President Reagan recounted at a White House briefing that he was corrected by Stewart himself after Reagan incorrectly announced he was a major general at a campaign event [293]\n\n\nMarriage and family\nIn 1942, while serving in the military, Stewart met singer Dinah Shore at the Hollywood Canteen, a club mainly for servicemen They began a romantic relationship and were nearly married in Las Vegas in 1943, but Stewart called off the marriage before they arrived, citing cold feet [294] After the war, Stewart began a relationship with Myrna Dell while he was filming The Stratton Story (1949) Although gossip columnists made claims that they were planning to marry, Dell said this was not true [295]\n\n\nFriendships, interests, and character\nStewart was guarded about his personal life and, according to biographer Scott Eyman, tended in interviews to avoid the emotional connection he was known for in his films, preferring to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself [305] He was known as a loner who did not have intimate relationships with many people Director John Ford said of Stewart, \"You don't get to know Jimmy Stewart; Jimmy Stewart gets to know you.\" [306]\n\n\nPolitical views\nStewart was a staunch conservative Republican throughout his life [334] A political argument in 1947 reportedly led to a fistfight with friend Henry Fonda (a liberal Democrat), according to some accounts, but the two maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again [335] The fistfight may be apocryphal, as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying, \"Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other We just didn't talk about certain things I can't remember ever having an argument with him⁠—ever!\" [335]\n\n\nFinal years and death\nStewart's wife Gloria died of lung cancer on February 16, 1994, aged 75 [346] According to biographer Donald Dewey, her death left Stewart depressed and \"lost at sea\" [347] Stewart became even more reclusive, spending most of his time in his bedroom, exiting only to eat and visit with his children He shut out most people from his life, not only media and fans, but also his co-stars and friends His friends Leonard Gershe and Gregory Peck said Stewart was not depressed or unhappy, but finally allowed to rest and be alone [347]\n\n\nActing style and

born on May 20, 1908, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, the eldest child and only son of Elizabeth Ruth (née Jackson; 1875–1953) and Alexander Maitland Stewart (1872–1962). Stewart had two younger sisters, Mary (1912–1977) and Virginia (1914–1972). He was of Scottish and Ulster-Scots ancestry, and the Stewart family had lived in Pennsylvania for many generations. Stewart's father ran the family business, the J M Stewart and Company Hardware Store, which he hoped Stewart would take over as an adult after attending Princeton University, as was the family tradition.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nRaised a Presbyterian by his deeply religious father, Stewart was a devout churchgoer for much of his life. He attended the local Pennsylvania public schools and graduated from Cambria High School in 1927. Stewart's academic record was excellent, and he was particularly interested in English and history. He attended Princeton University, where he studied English and history, and was a member of the Princeton Triangle Club, a theatrical organization. Stewart graduated from Princeton in 1932.\n\n**Career**\n\nStewart performed in bit parts in the University Players' productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932. The company's directors included Joshua Logan, Bretaigne Windust, and Charles Leatherbee, and amongst its other actors were married couple Henry Fonda and Margaret Sullavan, who became Stewart's close friends. At the end of the season, Stewart moved to New York with his Players friends Logan, Myron McCormick, and newly single Henry Fonda. Along with McCormick, Stewart debuted on Broadway in the brief run of Carry Nation and a few weeks later – again with McCormick – appeared as a chauffeur in the comedy Goodbye Again, in which he had a walk-on line.\n\nThe New Yorker commented, \"Mr James Stewart's chauffeur.. comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of spontaneous applause.\" Following the seven-month run of Goodbye Again, Stewart took a stage manager position in Boston, but was fired after frequently missing his cues. Returning to New York, he then landed a small part in Spring in Autumn and a role in All Good Americans, where he was required to throw a banjo out of the window. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote, \"Throwing a $250 banjo out of the window at the concierge is constructive abuse and should be virtuously applauded.\"\n\nBoth plays folded after only short runs, and Stewart began to think about going back to his studies.\n\n**1932-1937: Theater and Early Film Roles**\n\nStewart performed in bit parts in the University Players' productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932. The company's directors included Joshua Logan, Bretaigne Windust, and Charles Leatherbee, and amongst its other actors were married couple Henry Fonda and Margaret Sullavan, who became Stewart's close friends.

Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote, \"Throwing a $250 banjo out of the window at the concierge is constructive abuse and should be virtuously applauded.\"\n\nBoth plays folded after only short runs, and Stewart began to think about going back to his studies.\n\n**1938-1941: Leading Man**\n\nDespite good reviews, Stewart was still a minor star, and MGM remained hesitant to cast him in leading roles, preferring to loan him out to other studios. After a well-received supporting part in Of Human Hearts (1938), he was loaned to RKO to act opposite Ginger Rogers in the romantic comedy Vivacious Lady (1938). The production was shut down for months in 1937 as Stewart recovered from an undisclosed illness, during which RKO initially wanted to replace Stewart, but eventually the project was canceled. However, Rogers' success in a stage musical caused the film to be picked up again. Stewart was recast in Vivacious Lady at Rogers' insistence and due to his performance in Of Human Hearts.\n\nIt was a critical and commercial success, and showed Stewart's talent for performing in romantic comedies; The New York Herald called him \"one of the most knowing and engaging young actors appearing on the screen at present.\"\n\n**1941-1947: Military Service**\n\nStewart became the first major American movie star to enlist in the United States Army to fight in World War II. His family had deep military roots: both of his grandfathers had fought in the Civil War, and his father had served during both the Spanish-American War and World War I. After first being rejected for low weight in November 1940, he enlisted in February 1941. As an experienced pilot, he reported for induction as a private in the Air Corps on March 22, 1941. Soon to be 33 years old, he was over the age limit for Aviation Cadet training—the normal path of commissioning for pilots, navigators, and bombardiers—and therefore applied for an Air Corps commission as both a college graduate and a licensed commercial pilot.\n\nStewart received his commission as a second lieutenant on January 1, 1942.\n\n**1946-1949: Early Post-War Films**\n\nAfter his experiences in the war, Stewart considered returning to Pennsylvania to run the family store. His former agent, Leland Hayward, had also left the talent business in 1944 after selling his roster of stars, including Stewart, to Music Corporation of America (MCA). Stewart decided not to renew his MGM contract and instead signed a deal with MCA. He later stated that he was given a new beginning by Frank Capra, who asked him to star in It's a Wonderful Life (1946), the first postwar film for both of them. Stewart played George Bailey, an upstanding small-town man who becomes increasingly frustrated by his ordinary existence and financial troubles. Driven to suicide on Christmas Eve, he is led to reassess his life by Clarence Odbody, an \"angel, second class,\" played by Henry Travers.\n\nDuring filming, Stewart experienced doubts about his abilities and continued to consider retiring from acting.\n\n**1950-1959: Collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Mann**\n\nIn the 1950s, Stewart experienced a career renewal as the star of Westerns and collaborated on several films with director Anthony Mann. The first of these was the Universal production Winchester '73 (1950), which Stewart agreed to do in exchange for being cast in a screen adaptation of Harvey. It also marked a turning point in Hollywood, as Stewart's agent, Lew Wasserman, brokered an innovative deal with Universal, in which Stewart would receive no fee in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Stewart was also granted authority to collaborate with the studio on casting and hiring decisions.\n\nStewart ended up earning about $600,000 for Winchester '73, significantly more than his usual fee, and other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business, which further undermined the decaying studio system.\n\n**1960-1970: Westerns and Later Career**\n\nStewart opened the new decade by starring in the war film The Mountain Road (1960). To his surprise, it was a box office failure, despite his claims that it was one of the best scripts he'd ever read. He began a new director collaboration with John Ford, making his debut in his films in the Western Two Rode Together (1961), which had thematic echoes of Ford's The Searchers. The same year, he also narrated the film X-15 for the USAF. Stewart was considered for the role of Atticus Finch in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird, but he turned it down, concerned that the story was too controversial.\n\n**1971-1997: Television and Semi-Retirement**\n\nIn 1971, Stewart starred in the NBC sitcom The Jimmy Stewart Show. He played a small-town college professor whose adult son moves back home with his family. Stewart disliked the amount of work needed to film the show each week and was relieved when it was canceled after only one season due to bad reviews and poor ratings. His only film release for 1971, the comedy-drama Fools' Parade, was more positively received. Robert Greenspun of The New York Times stated that \"the movie belongs to Stewart, who has never been more wonderful.\" For his contributions to Western films, Stewart was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City in 1972.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nAs a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, Margaret Sullavan had a unique influence on Stewart's life. Stewart was guarded about his personal life and, according to biographer Scott Eyman, tended in interviews to avoid the emotional connection he was known for in his films, preferring to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself. He was known as a loner who did not have intimate relationships with many people. Director John Ford said of Stewart, \"You don't get to know Jimmy Stewart; Jimmy Stewart gets to know you.\"\n\n**Romantic Relationships**\n\nStewart had a romantic relationship with actress Gloria Hatrick McLean, whom he married in 1949. The couple had two children together, Ronald and Kelly. Stewart also had a close friendship with actress Margaret Sullavan, whom he met while they were both acting in the University Players' productions in Cape Cod. Sullavan was a significant influence on Stewart's life and career.\n\n**War Career as Pilot (1941-1946)**\n\nA licensed civilian pilot, Stewart enlisted in the U.S Army Air Forces early in 1941, undertaking military flight training and becoming a commissioned officer and USAAF pilot. In January 1944, in the rank of captain, he was assigned to the 453rd Bombardment Group, 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing, Eighth Air Force operating out of East Anglia, England as a bomber pilot flying the B-24 Liberator. After seeing action in Europe during World War II, he attained the rank of colonel and received several awards for his service. He remained in the Army Air Forces Reserve after the end of World War II, which would become the Air Force Reserve when the U.S Air Force became an independent service in 1947. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve in 1959. He retired from the service in 1968, at which time he was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal.\n\n**Marriage and Family**\n\nIn 1942, while serving in the military, Stewart met singer Dinah Shore at the Hollywood Canteen, a club mainly for servicemen. They began a romantic relationship and were nearly married in Las Vegas in 1943, but Stewart called off the marriage before they arrived, citing cold feet. After the war, Stewart began a relationship with Myrna Dell while he was filming The Stratton Story (1949). Although gossip columnists made claims that they were planning to marry, Dell said this was not true.\n\n**Friendships, Interests, and Character**\n\nStewart was guarded about his personal life and, according to biographer Scott Eyman, tended in interviews to avoid the emotional connection he was known for in his films, preferring to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself. He was known as a loner who did not have intimate relationships with many people. Director John Ford said of Stewart, \"You don't get to know Jimmy Stewart; Jimmy Stewart gets to know you.\"\n\n**Political Views**\n\nStewart was a staunch conservative Republican throughout his life. A political argument in 1947 reportedly led to a fistfight with friend Henry Fonda (a liberal Democrat), according to some accounts, but the two maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again. The fistfight may be apocryphal, as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying, \"Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other We just didn't talk about certain things I can't remember ever having an argument with him⁠—ever!\"\n\n**Final Years and Death**\n\nStewart's wife Gloria died of lung cancer on February 16, 1994, aged 75. According to biographer Donald Dewey, her death left Stewart depressed and \"lost at sea.\" Stewart became even more reclusive, spending most of his time in his bedroom, exiting only to eat and visit with his children. He shut out most people from his life, not only media and fans, but also his co-stars and friends. His friends Leonard Gershe and Gregory Peck said Stewart was not depressed or unhappy, but finally allowed to rest and be alone.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nStewart is remembered for portraying idealist \"everyman\" characters in his films. His heroism on screen and devotion to his family made him relatable and representative of the American ideal, leading Stewart to be considered one of the best-loved figures in twentieth-century American popular culture. According to film scholar Dennis Bingham, \"his ability to 'play'—even symbolize—honesty and 'American ideals' made him an icon into whose mold later male stars tried to pour themselves.\" Similarly, film scholar James Naremore has called Stewart \"the most successful actor of the 'common man' in the history of movies\" and \"the most intensely-emotional leading man to emerge from the studio system,\" who could cry on screen without losing his masculinity.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nIn 1960, Stewart was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1700 Vine Street for his contributions to the film industry. In 1974, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. His Golden Plate was presented by Awards Council member Helen Hayes. In 1997, Princeton University, Stewart's alma mater, honored him with the dedication of the James M Stewart Theater along with a retrospective of his films. Stewart has also been honored with his own postal stamp as part of the \"Legends of Hollywood\" stamp series. In 1999, a bust of Stewart was unveiled at the Eighth Air Force Heritage Museum in Georgia.\n\n**Memorials**\n\nStewart has several memorials in his childhood hometown, Indiana, Pennsylvania. On May 20, 1995, his 87th birthday, The Jimmy Stewart Museum was established. The museum is located near his birthplace, his childhood home, and the former location of his father's hardware store. The museum has six galleries that include photos, memorabilia, personal mementos, movie posters, props, scripts, costumes, and much more. Stewart had contributed significant donations to his hometown, and had done it quietly as he didn't want the publicity. A large statue of Stewart stands on the lawn of the Indiana County Courthouse, and a plaque marks his birthplace. In 1983, Jimmy Stewart came back to Indiana to celebrate his 75th birthday and unveiled the statue along with getting a phone call from then President Ronald Reagan to congratulate him on his birthday. 2011, the United States Post Office located at 47 South 7th Street in Indiana, Pennsylvania, was designated the \"James M 'Jimmy' Stewart Post Office Building.\" Additionally, the Indiana County–Jimmy Stewart Airport was named in his honor. His personal Cessna-310 airplane is refurbished and on display outside the airport that bears his name. His childhood home is still standing and overlooks his beloved hometown.\n\n**Documentary**\n\nIn 2019, a documentary about Stewart's life and career, \"Jimmy Stewart: An American Legend,\" was released. The documentary features interviews with Stewart's friends, family, and colleagues, as well as archival footage and rare home movies. The documentary explores Stewart's early life, his rise to fame, and his enduring legacy as one of the most beloved actors in American cinema.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in

significantly more than his usual fee, and other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business, which further undermined the decaying studio system [171]\n\n\n1960–1970: Westerns and later career\nStewart opened the new decade by starring in the war film The Mountain Road (1960) To his surprise, it was a box office failure, despite his claims that it was one of the best scripts he'd ever read [232] He began a new director collaboration with John Ford, making his debut in his films in the Western Two Rode Together (1961), which had thematic echoes of Ford's The Searchers [233] The same year, he also narrated the film X-15 for the USAF [234] Stewart was considered for the role of Atticus Finch in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird, but he turned it down, concerned that the story was too controversial [235]\n\n\n1971–1997: Television and semi-retirement\nIn 1971, Stewart starred in the NBC sitcom The Jimmy Stewart Show [251] He played a small-town college professor whose adult son moves back home with his family Stewart disliked the amount of work needed to film the show each week and was relieved when it was canceled after only one season due to bad reviews and poor ratings [252] His only film release for 1971, the comedy-drama Fools' Parade, was more positively received [253] Robert Greenspun of The New York Times stated that \"the movie belongs to Stewart, who has never been more wonderful\" [254] For his contributions to Western films, Stewart was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City in 1972 [255]\n\n\nPosthumous work\nIn December 2023, meditation app Calm announced that Stewart would be the latest narrator for its Sleep Story series, with an AI-generated voice of the actor reading an original story \"It’s a Wonderful Sleep Story\" The project uses AI voice-cloning technology from Respeecher, and was conducted with the consent of Stewart's family and his estate [278]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAs a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, Margaret Sullavan had a unique influence on Stewart's

rank of captain, he was assigned to the 453rd Bombardment Group, 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing, Eighth Air Force operating out of East Anglia, England as a bomber pilot flying the B-24 Liberator  After seeing action in Europe during World War II, he attained the rank of colonel and received several awards for his service He remained in the Army Air Forces Reserve after the end of World War II, which would become the Air Force Reserve when the U.S Air Force became an independent service in 1947  He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve in 1959 He retired from the service in 1968, at which time he was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal [d] President Reagan recounted at a White House briefing that he was corrected by Stewart himself after Reagan incorrectly announced he was a major general at a campaign event [293]\n\n\nMarriage and family\nIn 1942, while serving in the military, Stewart met singer Dinah Shore at the Hollywood Canteen, a club mainly for servicemen They began a romantic relationship and were nearly married in Las Vegas in 1943, but Stewart called off the marriage before they arrived, citing cold feet [294] After the war, Stewart began a relationship with Myrna Dell while he was filming The Stratton Story (1949) Although gossip columnists made claims that they were planning to marry, Dell said this was not true [295]\n\n\nFriendships, interests, and character\nStewart was guarded about his personal life and, according to biographer Scott Eyman, tended in interviews to avoid the emotional connection he was known for in his films, preferring to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself [305] He was known as a loner who did not have intimate relationships with many people Director John Ford said of Stewart, \"You don't get to know Jimmy Stewart; Jimmy Stewart gets to know you.\" [306]\n\n\nPolitical views\nStewart was a staunch conservative Republican throughout his life [334] A political argument in 1947 reportedly led to a fistfight with friend Henry Fonda (a liberal Democrat), according to some accounts, but the two maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again [335] The fistfight may be apocryphal, as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying, \"Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other We just didn't talk about certain things I can't remember ever having an argument with him⁠—ever!\" [335]\n\n\nFinal years and death\nStewart's wife Gloria died of lung cancer on February 16, 1994, aged 75 [346] According to biographer Donald Dewey, her death left Stewart depressed and \"lost at sea\" [347] Stewart became even more reclusive, spending most of his time in his bedroom, exiting only to eat and visit with his children He shut out most people from his life, not only media and fans, but also his co-stars and friends His friends Leonard Gershe and Gregory Peck said Stewart was not depressed or unhappy, but finally allowed to rest and be alone [347]\n\n\nActing style and screen persona\nHe had the ability to talk naturally He knew that in conversations people do often interrupt one another and it's not always so easy to get a thought out It took a little time for the sound men to get used to him, but he had an enormous impact And then, some years later, Marlon came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that Jimmy did it first [353]\n\n\nWork\nSelected credits:\n\n\nFilmography\nSelected credits:\n\n\nTheatre\nStewart is remembered for portraying idealist \"everyman\" characters in his

attorney of Centre County, Pennsylvania on December 31, 2017, followed by an appointment as a special assistant district attorney of Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania on January 6, 2018 On March 29, 2016, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced Castor's appointment (back-dated to March 21, when he actually took office) to the newly created position of Solicitor General of Pennsylvania [5] While he operated freely as the de facto Attorney General and was widely recognized as such, Castor formally became the state's Acting Attorney General, replacing Kane, who resigned on August 17, 2016, following a conviction of a third degree felony perjury charge and several related misdemeanors [6] [7] Governor Tom Wolf later nominated Bruce Beemer to fulfill the remaining balance of Kane's term which expired in January 2017 Castor is the cousin of Steve Castor, who represented Trump during his first impeachment.\n\n\nCareer\nAfter serving in the office since 1985, Castor was twice elected district attorney for Montgomery County, in which he is a lifelong resident, assuming office in January 2000 [8] After his second term ended, he was succeeded by Risa Vetri Ferman When she sought (and won) election as judge in November 2015, Castor sought to return to that office, but lost to Ferman's first assistant, Kevin Steele, who ran an 11th-hour campaign contending Castor should have charged entertainer Bill Cosby in 2005 [9] Castor countered that Steele could have arrested Cosby himself in the intervening years if he believed credible evidence existed to do so A week before the election, Andrea Constand, who had accused Cosby of sexual assault in Montgomery County, sued Castor, claiming he defamed her by intimating she was not credible [10] The Washington Post said that this suit contributed to Castor's defeat [11] In November 2017, Castor sued Constand and her lawyers for defamation, charging that the lawsuit and its timing were retaliatory and ruined his political career [12] In 2017, Cosby stood trial, but the trial ended in a hung jury with jurors unable to agree on Cosby's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, as Castor had predicted in 2005 would happen if he had elected to charge Cosby However at Cosby's retrial he was convicted on all three counts and he was sentenced to serve 3 to 10 years in prison After two years of time served the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the sentence, ruling that Castor's pledge to not prosecute Cosby was binding on all other prosecutors.\n\n\nMontgomery County District

a shareholder and director One of his notable clients was professional basketball player Marko Jaric of the Memphis Grizzlies, who was accused of sexual assault in Philadelphia Jaric was not charged in the case [36] In 2009, Castor represented Mark Sargent, who was investigated (but not charged) for patronizing a brothel while he served as dean of the Villanova University School of Law [37] In 2010, Castor represented his former boss, attorney Michael D Marino, whose nephew accidentally shot and killed a man while hunting [38] Marino, a former Montgomery County D.A., was present when the shooting occurred, despite knowing that his nephew was prohibited from owning and using firearms, owing to a felony conviction [38] Marino was not charged in the case On July 1, 2013, Castor joined the law firm of Rogers & Associates (subsequently renamed Rogers Castor) as a civil-litigation lawyer in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, with former Lower Merion Commissioner and former Republican state senate nominee, Lance Rogers Castor and Rogers Castor, renamed as Rogers Counsel, parted ways on December 31, 2020, and Bruce J Castor joined the personal injury law firm of van der Veen, Hartshorn, Levin & Lindheim [39] In 2017, Castor led the investigation into the Death of Tim Piazza at Pennsylvania State University [40]\n\n\nMontgomery County commissioner\nIn 2007, Castor challenged incumbent County Commissioner Tom Ellis, a one-time friend who had chaired Castor's campaigns in 1999 and 2003 but endorsed Corbett in 2004 [41] Early in the campaign, Castor commissioned a poll showing that Ellis, who had been hobbled by negative press surrounding alleged domestic violence incidents, would lose in a general election [42] Ellis released his own poll to try to refute Castor's charges that he was unelectable [43] In a six candidate field, Castor won the party endorsement on the first ballot, but his preferred running mate, former State Representative Melissa Murphy Weber, was narrowly defeated by incumbent Jim Matthews on the second ballot.\n\n\nSolicitor general and acting attorney general\nOn March 21, 2016, Castor took the oath of office as the first Solicitor General of Pennsylvania Being summoned to her Scranton office by Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen G Kane on March 4, 2016, without explanation, Castor met General Kane expecting her to request him to represent her in a private capacity [citation needed] Instead, Kane offered him the newly created position of Solicitor General of Pennsylvania (later merged into the job of first deputy attorney general) [citation needed], and Castor accepted The move was necessitated because the Attorney General had her license to practice law suspended by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Castor was supposedly subordinate to Kane in all matters except for making legal decisions on behalf of Pennsylvania, though most observers considered him the de facto attorney general, a fact later confirmed upon Kane's resignation In practice, Castor operated as a bridge between Kane and the remainder of the office of attorney general, in addition to being the final word on legal matters, in order to make the executive portion of the office function properly.\n\n\nSecond impeachment trial of Donald Trump\nOn January 31, 2021, Castor was appointed to take the lead for Donald J Trump's defense team for his 2021 impeachment trial, alongside criminal law practitioner David Schoen [4] Castor's opening arguments on February 9, 2021, were widely reported to be confusing and rambling, [55] [56] [57] and famously included the statement \"Nebraska, you’re going to hear, is quite a judicial thinking place\" [58] that became an online meme [59] Trump was reportedly \"furious\" about Castor's \"rambling, almost somnambulant defense.\" [60] Texas Republican U.S Senator John Cornyn commented, \"The president's lawyer just rambled on and on\" and \"I've seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments, and that was not one of the finest I've seen.\" [55] Castor for his part suggested the former president did not criticize his performance \"Far from it,\" he said [61]\n\n\nReferences\nHouse managers:\n\n\nExternal

Castor and Rogers Castor, renamed as Rogers Counsel, parted ways on December 31, 2020, and Bruce J Castor joined the personal injury law firm of van der Veen, Hartshorn, Levin & Lindheim. In 2017, Castor led the investigation into the Death of Tim Piazza at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nMontgomery County Commissioner\nIn 2007, Castor challenged incumbent County Commissioner Tom Ellis, a one-time friend who had chaired Castor's campaigns in 1999 and 2003 but endorsed Corbett in 2004. Early in the campaign, Castor commissioned a poll showing that Ellis, who had been hobbled by negative press surrounding alleged domestic violence incidents, would lose in a general election. Ellis released his own poll to try to refute Castor's charges that he was unelectable. In a six-candidate field, Castor won the party endorsement on the first ballot, but his preferred running mate, former State Representative Melissa Murphy Weber, was narrowly defeated by incumbent Jim Matthews on the second ballot.\n\nSolicitor General and Acting Attorney General\nOn March 21, 2016, Castor took the oath of office as the first Solicitor General of Pennsylvania. Being summoned to her Scranton office by Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen G Kane on March 4, 2016, without explanation, Castor met General Kane expecting her to request him to represent her in a private capacity. Instead, Kane offered him the newly created position of Solicitor General of Pennsylvania (later merged into the job of first deputy attorney general), and Castor accepted. The move was necessitated because the Attorney General had her license to practice law suspended by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Castor was supposedly subordinate to Kane in all matters except for making legal decisions on behalf of Pennsylvania, though most observers considered him the de facto attorney general, a fact later confirmed upon Kane's resignation. In practice, Castor operated as a bridge between Kane and the remainder of the office of attorney general, in addition to being the final word on legal matters, in order to make the executive portion of the office function properly.\n\nSecond Impeachment Trial of Donald Trump\nOn January 31, 2021, Castor was appointed to take the lead for Donald J Trump's defense team for his 2021 impeachment trial, alongside criminal law practitioner David Schoen. Castor's opening arguments on February 9, 2021, were widely reported to be confusing and rambling, and famously included the statement \"Nebraska, you're going to hear, is quite a judicial thinking place\" that became an online meme. Trump was reportedly \"furious\" about Castor's \"rambling, almost somnambulant defense.\" Texas Republican U.S Senator John Cornyn commented, \"The president's lawyer just rambled on and on\" and \"I've seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments, and that was not one of the finest I've seen.\" Castor for his part suggested the former president did not criticize his performance \"Far from it,\" he said.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bruce_Castor\" following this outline:\n\n\nStatewide profile\nAfter serving stints beginning in 1981 with, respectively, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office, the Northampton County (PA) District Attorney's Office, as an LBJ Congressional Scholar (Washington, DC) and defending Federal prisoners at FCI-Alderson (WV), Castor began his professional career as an assistant district attorney in 1985 before becoming district attorney of Montgomery County from 2000 to 2008 He next took a seat on the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, an elected position he held until January 4, 2016, when he was succeeded by Joe Gale Castor was defeated for re-election as Montgomery County's District Attorney in November 2015 Castor completed a nearly three-year term as a special assistant district attorney of Centre County, Pennsylvania on December 31, 2017, followed by an appointment as a special assistant district attorney of Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania on January 6, 2018 On March 29, 2016, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced Castor's appointment (back-dated to March 21, when he actually took office) to the newly created position of Solicitor General of Pennsylvania [5] While he operated freely as the de facto Attorney General and was widely recognized as such, Castor formally became the state's Acting Attorney General, replacing Kane, who resigned on August 17, 2016, following a conviction of a third degree felony perjury charge and several related misdemeanors [6] [7] Governor Tom Wolf later nominated Bruce Beemer to fulfill the remaining balance of Kane's term which expired in January 2017 Castor is the cousin of Steve Castor, who represented Trump during his first impeachment.\n\n\nCareer\nAfter serving in the office since 1985, Castor was twice elected district attorney for Montgomery County, in which he is a lifelong resident, assuming office in January 2000 [8] After his second term ended, he was succeeded by Risa Vetri Ferman When she sought (and won) election as judge in November 2015, Castor sought to return to that office, but lost to Ferman's first assistant, Kevin Steele, who ran an 11th-hour campaign contending Castor should have charged entertainer Bill Cosby in 2005 [9] Castor countered that Steele could have arrested Cosby himself in the intervening years if he believed credible evidence existed to do so A week before the election, Andrea Constand, who had accused Cosby of sexual assault in Montgomery County, sued Castor, claiming he defamed her by intimating she was not credible [10] The Washington Post said that this suit contributed to Castor's defeat [11] In November 2017, Castor sued Constand and her lawyers for defamation, charging that the lawsuit and its timing were retaliatory and ruined his political career [12] In 2017, Cosby stood trial, but the trial ended in a hung jury with jurors unable to agree on Cosby's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, as Castor had predicted in 2005 would happen if he had elected to charge Cosby However at Cosby's retrial he was convicted on all three counts and he was sentenced to serve 3 to 10 years in prison After two years of time served the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the sentence, ruling that Castor's pledge to not prosecute Cosby was binding on all other prosecutors.\n\n\nMontgomery County District Attorney\nAfter serving in the office since 1985, Castor was twice elected district attorney for Montgomery County, in which he is a lifelong

lost endorsements of the southeastern GOP chairmen, Castor attacked Corbett and the county chairmen with allegations of backroom deals with Bob Asher, [30] the state's national GOP committeeman [31] [32] Castor and Asher had feuded for several years due to Asher's prior felony convictions for perjury, bribery, racketeering, and conspiracy in 1986 in the context of a political corruption scandal which also involved the State Treasurer, R Budd Dwyer, leading to Dwyer's committing suicide at a press conference before his sentencing Asher had been state GOP Chair during the scandal and was convicted for participating in the bribery of Dwyer Asher's criminal past, connected to a political bribery scheme while he was the Republican state chair, became a subject of the campaign for the state's top law enforcement post [31] [33]\n\n\nAttorney General race\nCastor ran for the GOP nomination for Pennsylvania Attorney General in 2004 against Republican Tom Corbett Furious that he had

Siedzikowski in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania as a shareholder and director One of his notable clients was professional basketball player Marko Jaric of the Memphis Grizzlies, who was accused of sexual assault in Philadelphia Jaric was not charged in the case [36] In 2009, Castor represented Mark Sargent, who was investigated (but not charged) for patronizing a brothel while he served as dean of the Villanova University School of Law [37] In 2010, Castor represented his former boss, attorney Michael D Marino, whose nephew accidentally shot and killed a man while hunting [38] Marino, a former

It is the first known project by Game Freak in the action role-playing subgenre and was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2022.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nPokémon Legends: Arceus is an action role-playing game that takes place in the Sinnoh region, but in a bygone era long before the events of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl and their remakes. The game is set in a world where Pokémon and humans coexist, and the player takes on the role of a researcher tasked with encountering and studying all the Pokémon in the Hisui region.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nPokémon Legends: Arceus is an action role-playing game that maintains the core gameplay of past mainline entries. The player can freely explore the game map, which is divided into five large areas of individual biomes. Each time the player enters an area, they spawn in a camp and can fast travel to other camps in the same area. Outside of traversing the landscape on foot, the player can unlock rideable Pokémon which can travel faster, swim across bodies of water, climb cliffs, or fly.\n\nIn each area, Pokémon wander the landscape and certain habitats and will interact with both the player and their environments. Some will actively avoid the player, while others act aggressively, and some exhibit other specific behaviors. \"Alpha\" Pokémon – larger, more powerful versions of the Pokémon – can also be found in the areas.\n\nThe game world having multiple areas and a hub system instead of fully open world gameplay resulted in reviewers comparing Legends: Arceus with the Monster Hunter series. Reviewers also drew comparisons between Pokémon Legends: Arceus and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, noting apparent similarities in both gameplay and art style.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe game begins with the player speaking with a disembodied voice which is revealed to be Arceus, the creator deity of the Pokémon universe. Arceus tasks the player with encountering all Pokémon in the Hisui region before transporting them there through a rift in spacetime. Upon arrival, Pokémon researcher Professor Laventon finds them and brings them to the local settlement of Jubilife Village. There, the player is recruited into the Survey Corps of the Galaxy Expedition Team, a group that has arrived in Hisui to chart and study it.\n\nAfter receiving their starter Pokémon, the player travels through the Hisui region to complete the Pokédex; throughout their journey, the spacetime rift causes several powerful \"Noble Pokémon\", which the Diamond and Pearl clans venerate, to turn berserk through powerful lightning, forcing the player to engage them in battle using 'balms' to calm them down.\n\n**Setting**\n\nThe game is set in the Hisui region, a world that is similar to the Sinnoh region but with some key differences. The Hisui region is a land of natural beauty, with vast plains, towering mountains, and dense forests. The region is home to a diverse array of Pokémon, including many that are exclusive to the region.\n\n**Story**\n\nThe game's story is centered around the player's journey to encounter and study all the Pokémon in the Hisui region. Along the way, the player will encounter various characters, including Professor Laventon, who will guide the player on their journey. The player will also encounter other members of the Survey Corps, who will provide assistance and guidance.\n\nAs the player progresses through the game, they will uncover more about the history of the Hisui region and the Pokémon that inhabit it. The player will also discover more about the rift in spacetime that is causing the Noble Pokémon to behave erratically.\n\n**Development**\n\nPokémon Legends: Arceus is the first known project by Game Freak in the action role-playing subgenre. The game was developed by a team of developers at Game Freak, who worked closely with The Pokémon Company to bring the game to life.\n\n**Marketing and release**\n\nPokémon Legends: Arceus was first revealed in the Pokémon Presents on 26 February 2021 alongside Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl as part of the Pokémon 25th Anniversary celebration.

Born on September 25, 1961, in Los Angeles, California, Locklear has established herself as a talented and versatile actress, with a career spanning over three decades.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHeather Deen Locklear was born to Diane (née Tinsley) and Bill Locklear, a production executive and an administrator at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), respectively. Her father was a former colonel in the United States Marine Corps, and Locklear has Lumbee ancestry. Growing up, Locklear was exposed to the entertainment industry through her family connections, which would later influence her decision to pursue a career in acting.\n\n**Career**\n\nLocklear's early career in acting began while she was still a student at UCLA. She started modeling and working in commercials for the school store, which eventually led to her first screen appearances in the early 1980s. Locklear made small roles in episodes of \"CHiPs,\" \"240-Robert,\" and \"Eight Is Enough.\" Her breakthrough role came when she was cast as Sammy Jo Dean in the second season of Aaron Spelling's TV series \"Dynasty.\" The following year, Spelling cast her in the cop show \"T J Hooker\" alongside William Shatner.\n\nLocklear's collaboration with Spelling continued, and she became a series regular on \"T J Hooker\" until the show ended in 1986. After \"T J Hooker\" concluded, Locklear became a full-time cast member on \"Dynasty\" until its cancellation in 1989. In 1991, the cast of \"Dynasty\" reconvened for the four-hour miniseries \"Dynasty: The Reunion,\" which Locklear also participated in.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nLocklear's personal life has been the subject of significant media attention over the years. She was married to Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee from May 10, 1986, to 1993. The couple's marriage was marked by controversy, with Lee being arrested for assault and Locklear being arrested for attacking a police officer. After their divorce, Locklear married Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora on December 17, 1994, in Paris. The couple had a daughter, Ava Elizabeth Sambora, on October 4, 1997.\n\nLocklear filed for divorce from Sambora in February 2006, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\" Sambora responded by filing for joint custody of their daughter and enforcement of a prenuptial agreement. Their divorce was finalized in April 2007. In the same month, Locklear began a relationship with fellow Melrose Place alumnus Jack Wagner, and the couple announced their engagement in August 2011. However, they called off their engagement by November 2011.\n\n**Relationships**\n\nLocklear's romantic relationships have been well-documented over the years. Her marriages to Tommy Lee and Richie Sambora were marked by controversy and eventually ended in divorce. Locklear's relationship with Jack Wagner was also high-profile, with the couple becoming engaged before ultimately calling off their engagement.\n\n**Health and Legal Troubles**\n\nIn March 2008, a 911 call was made by someone claiming to be Locklear's doctor, stating that Locklear was trying to kill herself. Emergency responders were dispatched to Locklear's home, but she was found to be fine. The Ventura County Sheriff's Department later stated that they believed the call was genuine. This incident sparked concerns about Locklear's mental health, and the incident was widely reported in the media.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nThroughout her career, Locklear has been recognized for her contributions to the entertainment industry. While she has not received any major awards, Locklear has been nominated for several awards, including a Golden Globe nomination for her role in \"Melrose Place.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Heather_Locklear\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHeather Deen Locklear was born on September 25, 1961, [1] in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Diane (née Tinsley), a production executive, and Bill Locklear, an administrator at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) [2] and former colonel in the United States Marine Corps [3] She has Lumbee ancestry [4]\n\n\nCareer\nWhile at UCLA, she began modeling and working in commercials for the school store She made her earliest screen appearances in the early 1980s with small roles in episodes of CHiPs, 240-Robert and Eight Is Enough, before beginning a long-term collaboration with Aaron Spelling Spelling cast her in the role of Sammy Jo Dean during season 2 of his TV series Dynasty, and the following year, he cast her in the cop show T J Hooker with William Shatner Until the mid-1980s, Locklear appeared as a series regular on T J Hooker, while making semi-regular appearances on Dynasty After T J Hooker ended in 1986, she became a full-time cast member on Dynasty until its cancellation in 1989 In 1991, the cast of Dynasty (including Locklear) reconvened for the four-hour miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion.\n\n\nPersonal life\nLocklear was married to Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee from May 10, 1986, to 1993 [27] After their divorce, she married Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, on December 17, 1994, in Paris [28] She gave birth to their only child, daughter Ava Elizabeth Sambora, on October 4, 1997 [29] Locklear filed for divorce from Sambora in February 2006 The following month Sambora filed for joint custody of their daughter and enforcement of a prenuptial agreement Their divorce was finalized in April 2007 [30] In the same month, Locklear began a relationship with fellow Melrose Place alumnus Jack Wagner [31] In August 2011, Locklear and Wagner announced they were engaged [32] The couple had called off their engagement by that November [33]\n\n\nRelationships\nLocklear was married to Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee from May 10, 1986, to 1993 [27] After their divorce, she married Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, on December 17, 1994, in Paris [28] She gave birth to their only child, daughter Ava Elizabeth Sambora, on October 4, 1997 [29] Locklear filed for divorce from Sambora in February 2006 The following month Sambora filed for joint custody of their daughter and enforcement of a prenuptial agreement Their divorce was finalized in April 2007 [30] In the same month, Locklear began a relationship with fellow Melrose Place alumnus Jack Wagner [31] In August 2011, Locklear and Wagner announced they were engaged [32] The couple had called off their engagement by that November [33]\n\n\nHealth and legal troubles\nIn March 2008, a 911 call was made by someone who claimed to be Locklear's doctor, who said that Locklear was trying to kill herself [36] [37] Emergency responders were dispatched to Locklear's home Her publicist later said that Locklear had never requested any medical assistance, and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department later stated that no further action was taken once they arrived at Locklear's Westlake Village home, as she appeared to be fine They did, however, state that they believed the call was genuine.\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nProducer\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was the first child of Prince William and Catherine, then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. George's birth was announced by press release and followed by the display of a traditional easel in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. Celebrations were staged in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms, and the newborn was widely hailed as a future king in the majority of British newspapers.\n\nHis name was announced as George Alexander Louis on 24 July. The name George was chosen in honor of Prince William's father, Charles, Prince of Wales, whose full name is George Alexander Louis. Alexander was chosen as the middle name in honor of Prince William's grandfather, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whose full name is Prince Philip Alexander George, Duke of Edinburgh. Louis was chosen as the third name in honor of Prince William's great-grandfather, King George VI.\n\n**Upbringing**\n\nGeorge spent his first months in Anglesey, Wales, before his family relocated to Kensington Palace in 2014. He embarked on his first royal tour with his parents in April 2014, during which they spent three weeks in New Zealand and Australia. Although George appeared only twice, the BBC described the \"nine-month-old future king\" as \"the star of the show.\" The then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott predicted in the Parliament House, Canberra, that George would one day be welcomed there as King of Australia. Australian media called him \"the republican slayer,\" after polls showed the lowest support for republicanism in the country for 35 years.\n\nIn June 2015, George made his first public appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Trooping the Colour parade. From 2015 to 2017, his family lived at Anmer Hall in Norfolk, where he started at West Acre Montessori School Nursery in January 2016. George met Barack and Michelle Obama on 22 April 2016.

in particular, the Admiralty wished to consult him about its further proposals for the rescue of Discovery [52] With Sir Clements Markham's blessing, he accepted a temporary post assisting the outfitting of the Terra Nova for the second Discovery relief operation, but turned down the offer to sail with her as chief officer He also assisted in the equipping of the Argentine Uruguay, which was being fitted out for the relief of the stranded Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Otto Nordenskjöld [51]\n\n\nNimrod Expedition, 1907–1909\nOn 7 August 1907, the Nimrod set sail from England for the start of the British Antarctic Expedition, reaching New Zealand at the end of November [69] After some final preparations, the expedition set off from Lyttelton Harbour on 1 January 1908, heading for the Antarctic [70] Shackleton had originally planned to use the old Discovery base in McMurdo Sound to launch his attempts on the South Pole and South Magnetic Pole, [66] but before leaving England, he had been pressured into giving Scott an undertaking not to base himself in the McMurdo area, which Scott was claiming as his own field of work Shackleton reluctantly agreed to seek out winter quarters at either the Barrier Inlet—which he had briefly visited in 1902 on Discovery—or King Edward VII Land [71]\n\n\nBetween expeditions, 1909–1914\nOn Shackleton's return home, public honours were quickly forthcoming He was received by King Edward VII on 10 July 1909, and raised to a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order [87] [88] He received a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours list in November, becoming Sir Ernest Shackleton [89] [90] The RGS awarded him a gold medal;

One option was a Royal Navy officer cadetship in the Britannia at Dartmouth, but this was too expensive, and Shackleton passed the upper age limit of fourteen and a half in 1888. Alternatives were the mercantile marine cadet ships Worcester and Conway, or an apprenticeship \"before the mast\" on a sailing vessel. This third option was chosen. His father was able to secure him a berth with the North Western Shipping Company, aboard the square-rigged sailing ship Hoghton Tower.\n\n**Discovery Expedition, 1901-1903**\n\nThe British National Antarctic Expedition—known as the Discovery Expedition after the ship Discovery—was the brainchild of Sir Clements Markham, president of the Royal Geographical Society, and had been many years in preparation. Led by Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy torpedo lieutenant lately promoted commander, the expedition had objectives that included scientific and geographical discovery. Shackleton joined the expedition as a member of the ship's crew and played a key role in the expedition's success.\n\n**Shore Work, 1903-1907**\n\nAfter a period of convalescence in New Zealand, Shackleton returned to England via San Francisco and New York.

He was received by King Edward VII on 10 July 1909, and raised to a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. He received a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours list in November, becoming Sir Ernest Shackleton. The RGS awarded him a gold medal; a proposal to present him with a smaller medal than that earlier awarded to Captain Scott was not acted on. Each member of the Nimrod Expedition shore party received a silver Polar Medal on 23 November, Shackleton himself receiving a clasp to attach to his earlier medal. He was also appointed a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a significant honour for British mariners.\n\n**Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914-1917**\n\nIn December 1913, Shackleton published details of his new expedition, grandly titled the \"Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition.\" There is a legend that Shackleton posted an advertisement emphasising the hardship and danger of the planned voyage, so that he could better narrow down the selection of candidates for his expedition, but no record of any such advertisement has survived and its existence is considered doubtful.

On the Endurance, the second-in-command was the experienced explorer Frank Wild, and the first officer was Lionel Greenstreet. The meteorologist was Leonard Hussey, who was also an able banjo player. Surgeon James McIlroy was head of the scientific staff, which included geologist James Wordie. Alexander Macklin was the second of the two surgeons, also in charge of keeping the 70 dogs healthy. Tom Crean was in more immediate charge as head dog-handler. Other crew included navigator Hubert Hudson, physicist Reginald James, carpenter Harry McNish, and biologist Robert Clark.\n\n**Loss of Endurance**\n\nEndurance departed from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5 December 1914, heading for Vahsel Bay.

In 1920, tired of public speaking, he began to consider the possibility of a last expedition. He thought seriously of going to the Beaufort Sea area of the Arctic, a largely unexplored region, and raised some interest in this idea from the Canadian government. With funds supplied by former schoolfriend John Quiller Rowett, Shackleton acquired a 125-ton Norwegian sealer, named Foca I, which he renamed Quest.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBefore the return of Shackleton's body to South Georgia, there was a memorial service held for him with full military honours at Holy Trinity Church, Montevideo, and a service was held on 2 March 1922 at St Paul's Cathedral, London, at which King George V and other members of the royal family were represented.

This negative picture of Scott became accepted as the popular truth, as the kind of heroism that he represented fell victim to the cultural shifts of the late twentieth century. Within a few years, Scott was thoroughly overtaken in public esteem by Shackleton, whose popularity surged while that of his erstwhile rival declined. In 2002, in a BBC poll conducted to determine the \"100 Greatest Britons\", Shackleton was ranked 11th while Scott was down in 54th place.\n\n**Awards and Decorations**\n\nShackleton was awarded the following British decorations:\n\n* Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) (1910)\n* Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) (1911)\n* Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) (1911)\n* Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) (1915)\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) (1919)\n\nShackleton was also awarded the Polar Medal (1911) and the South Pole Medal (1912).\n\n**Arms**\n\nThe Shackleton family arms are: Quarterly, 1st and 4th, argent three fusils in fess sable (for Shackleton); 2nd and 3rd, azure a chevron between three escallops or (for Gavan).\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Shackleton, Ernest (1874-1922)\n* Antarctic exploration\n* Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition\n* Endurance (ship)\n* Discovery (ship)\n* Shackleton's crew\n* South Georgia Island\n* Elephant Island\n* Weddell Sea\n* McMurdo Sound\n* King Edward VII Land\n* Beaufort Sea\n* Arctic exploration\n* First World War\n* Russian Civil War\n* North Russia Expeditionary Force\n* Major-General Edmund Ironside\n* John Quiller Rowett\n* Hugh Robert Mill\n* Alfred Lansing\n* Roland Huntford\n* Robert Falcon Scott\n* Robert Amundsen\n* Scott and Amundsen (book)\n\n**References**\n\n* Shackleton, E.

[7] the second, Frank, achieved notoriety as a suspect, later exonerated, in the 1907 theft of the so-called Irish Crown Jewels, which have never been recovered [13]\n\n\nMerchant Navy officer\nShackleton's restlessness at school was such that he was allowed to leave at sixteen and go to sea [19] One option was a Royal Navy officer cadetship in the Britannia at Dartmouth, but this was too expensive, and Shackleton passed the upper age limit of fourteen and a half in 1888 Alternatives were the mercantile marine cadet ships Worcester and Conway, or an apprenticeship \"before the mast\" on a sailing vessel This third option was chosen [19] His father was able to secure him a berth with the North Western Shipping Company, aboard the square-rigged sailing ship Hoghton Tower [19]\n\n\nDiscovery Expedition, 1901–1903\nThe British National Antarctic Expedition—known as the Discovery Expedition after the ship Discovery—was the brainchild of Sir Clements Markham, president of the Royal Geographical Society, and had been many years in preparation [26] Led by Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy torpedo lieutenant lately promoted commander, [27] the expedition had objectives that included scientific and geographical discovery [28]\n\n\nShore work, 1903–1907\nAfter a period of convalescence in New Zealand, Shackleton returned to England via San Francisco and New York [51] As the first significant person to return from the Antarctic, he found that he was in demand; in particular, the Admiralty wished to consult him about its further proposals for the rescue of Discovery [52] With Sir Clements Markham's blessing, he accepted a temporary post assisting the outfitting of the Terra Nova for the second Discovery relief operation, but turned down the offer to sail with her as chief officer He also assisted in the equipping of the Argentine Uruguay, which was being fitted out for the relief of the stranded Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Otto Nordenskjöld [51]\n\n\nNimrod Expedition, 1907–1909\nOn 7 August 1907, the Nimrod set sail from England for the start of the British Antarctic Expedition, reaching New Zealand at the end of November [69] After some final preparations, the expedition set off from Lyttelton Harbour on 1 January 1908, heading for the Antarctic [70] Shackleton had originally planned to use the old Discovery base in McMurdo Sound to launch his attempts on the South Pole and South Magnetic Pole, [66] but before leaving England, he had been pressured into giving Scott an undertaking not to base himself in the McMurdo area, which Scott was claiming as his own field of work Shackleton reluctantly agreed to seek out winter quarters at either the Barrier Inlet—which he had briefly visited in 1902 on Discovery—or King Edward VII Land [71]\n\n\nBetween expeditions, 1909–1914\nOn Shackleton's return home, public honours were quickly forthcoming He was received by King Edward VII on 10 July 1909, and raised to a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order [87] [88] He received a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours list in November, becoming Sir Ernest Shackleton [89] [90] The RGS awarded him a gold medal; a proposal to present him with a smaller medal than that earlier awarded to Captain Scott was not acted on [91] Each member of the Nimrod Expedition shore party received a silver Polar Medal on 23 November, Shackleton himself receiving a clasp to attach to his earlier medal [89] [92] He was also appointed a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a significant honour for British mariners [87]\n\n\nPublic hero\nOn Shackleton's return home, public honours were quickly forthcoming He was received by King Edward VII on 10 July 1909, and raised to a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order [87] [88] He received a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours list in November, becoming Sir Ernest Shackleton [89] [90] The RGS awarded him a gold medal;

meanwhile, a second ship, the Aurora, would take a supporting party under Captain Aeneas Mackintosh to McMurdo Sound on the far side of the continent [109] This party would be tasked with laying supply depots across the Great Ice Barrier as far as the Beardmore Glacier, the depots holding the food and fuel required to enable Shackleton's party to complete their journey of 1,800 miles (2,900 km) across the continent [110]\n\n\nPreparations\nIn December 1913, Shackleton published details of his new expedition, grandly titled the \"Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition\" [105] [106] There is a legend that Shackleton posted an advertisement emphasising the hardship and danger of the planned voyage, so that he could better narrow down the selection of candidates for his expedition, but no record of any such advertisement has survived and its existence is considered doubtful [107] [108] Two ships were to be employed: Endurance would carry the main party into the Weddell Sea, aiming for Vahsel Bay from where a team of six, led by Shackleton, would begin the crossing of the continent;

Shackleton had died some £40,000 in debt (equivalent to £2,758,944 in 2023) [65] [191] [192] A further initiative was the formation of a Shackleton Memorial Fund, which was used to assist with his children's education and the support of his mother [198]\n\n\nEarly\nBefore the return of Shackleton's body to South Georgia, there was a memorial service held for him with full military honours at Holy Trinity Church, Montevideo, and a service was held on 2 March 1922 at St Paul's Cathedral, London, at which King George V and other members of the royal family were represented [187] Within a year, the first biography was published: The Life of Sir Ernest Shackleton by Hugh Robert Mill [197] As well as being a tribute to the explorer, this book was a practical effort to assist his family;

within the Uasin Gishu County; and he sat for his Certificate of Primary Education (CPE) at the latter He then proceeded to Wareng Secondary School, still in Uasin Gishu County, and later Kapsabet High School in Nandi County, where he obtained his Ordinary Level and Advanced Level education respectively [10]\n\n\nPolitical career\nAfter graduating from the University of Nairobi in 1990, Ruto was employed as a temporary teacher in the North Rift region of Kenya from 1990 to 1992, where he was also a leader of the local church choir, the Africa Inland Church (AIC) [16]\n\n\nYK'92\nRuto began his political career when he became the treasurer of the YK'92 campaign group that was lobbying for the re-election of President Moi in 1992, from which he learned the basics of Kenyan politics [15] [17] He is also believed to have accumulated some wealth in this period [18] After the 1992 elections, President Moi disbanded YK'92 and Ruto unsuccessfully vied for various branch-level positions in KANU, which was at that time Kenya's ruling party [19]\n\n\nMember of Parliament\nRuto ran for a parliamentary seat in the 1997 general election He surprisingly beat the incumbent, Reuben Chesire, Moi's preferred candidate, as well as the Uasin Gishu KANU branch chairman and assistant minister [20] [21] He later gained favour with Moi and was appointed KANU Director of Elections [22] His strong support in 2002 for Moi's preferred successor, Uhuru Kenyatta, saw him get a place as assistant minister in the Home Affairs (Interior) ministry Later in that election, when some government ministers resigned to join the opposition, he was promoted to full Cabinet Minister [18] KANU lost the election but he retained his parliamentary seat Ruto was elected KANU Secretary General in 2005,

state and government The inauguration day was declared a public holiday [45] Attendance was very high, with groups of the general public clashing with security officials when trying to enter the stadium; however, the event continued peacefully [46] Following his inauguration he officially began his term as President of Kenya [47] [48]\n\n\nControversies\nRuto has been involved in a land grabbing saga involving his mysterious acquisition of Weston Hotel land, pitted against public counteraccusations with several state corporations in Kenya, all surrounding the original owner of the land According to The Standard, the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA), a state agency, was duped into surrendering the land on which the Weston Hotel was built [61] [62] In 2001, KCAA, which originally occupied the land, was given alternative pieces of land belonging to another state agency, the meteorological department [62] KCAA did not occupy the alternative piece of land upon which Ruto's Weston Hotel was built According to KCAA, a powerful cartel, working in the lands ministry was involved in a conspiracy to relinquish the same piece of land with several land ministry officers also involved in the conspiracy [62] In January 2019, it emerged that according to another state agency, the National Lands Commission, Ruto owed and needed to pay the people of Kenya for the land 0.773 acres opposite Wilson Airport upon which the Weston Hotel was built In February 2019, Ruto publicly admitted the Weston Hotel land had been acquired illegally by the original owners who sold him the land, and that he had no knowledge of the matter [63] [64] [65]\nIn August 2020, Ruto offered to pay the state agency for the land [66] Later in 2020, KCAA was refused to be compensated for the land and so, demanded demolition of the hotel because of acquisition through illegality, fraud and corruption.\nAccording to the KCAA, the public land was designated for the construction of headquarters and flight paths, and it had been disposed of the land by collusion with private entities, Priority Ltd and Monene Investments both reported to be associated with Ruto [67] [68] [69] Later in the same month, another legislator, Ngunjiri Wambugu, demanded all other cases in Kenya involving stolen property be thrown out as long as suspects were willing to compensate for it, in an effort to complain about the preferential treatment Ruto was receiving for his involvement in the state's stolen property In December 2020, the KCB Bank backed Ruto in the court battle to repossess the land, fearing the loss of security against the advancement of 1.2 billion shillings  in Weston hotel associated with Ruto [70]\n\n\nLand grabbing\nRuto has been involved in a land grabbing saga

Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC), of huge amounts of money through dubious land deals [61] He was acquitted in 2011 but in 2020, as his relationship with President Uhuru Kenyatta seemed to falter amid the President's push for an anti-corruption war, [71] the police re-opened investigations in the case [72]\n\n\nMuteshi land\nIn June 2013, a court ordered Ruto to pay a victim of 2007/08 post-election violence 5 million shillings for illegally taking away his land during the post-election violence [73] [61] In the same judgement, Ruto was evicted from the grabbed land in Uasin Gishu Adrian Muteshi had accused Ruto of grabbing [61] and trespassing on his 100-acre piece of land in Uasin Gishu after he, Adrian, had fled his land for safety during the post-election violence of 2007/08 [73] In February 2014, Ruto appealed the court order to pay the 5 million shilling fine In 2017, Ruto withdrew the appeal against the judgment In October 2020, Adrian Muteshi died of an unspecified cause at the age of 86 [73]\n\n\nJoseph Murumbi's 900 acres\nIn October 2019, the Daily Nation reported that Ruto's acquisition of a 900-acre piece of land of another former vice president, Joseph Murumbi, haunted Ruto because he had been involved in the irregular acquisition of the land [74] In the same month, Ruto claimed that the articles were persistent, and obviously sponsored fake news Later that month, a human rights lobby activist, Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance, called for an investigation into the mysterious acquisition of a 900-acre piece of land that formerly belonged to former vice-president Murumbi [75] According to the allegations, Murumbi had been involved in a dispute over loan defaults with a state corporation, AFC, against the land that was pledged as a security for the loan [75] It is alleged that Murumbi defaulted the loan and AFC took over ownership of the land that was eventually sold to Ruto after he paid off the loan owed to the state corporation [75]\n\n\nJacob Juma assassination\nRuto has been widely and repeatedly linked to the assassination of Jacob Juma by several media, activists, politicians, opposition figures in Kenya, including Jacob Juma himself [76] [77] Jacob Juma was a wealthy businessman [78] who became a fierce government critic and anti-corruption crusader who became known for posting targeted cryptic tweets against Ruto and the Jubilee government months before he was assassinated in Nairobi [79] [80] [81] In December 2015, Jacob Juma, in his tweets, claimed Ruto was obsessed with killing him [77] [82] In May 2016, Jacob Juma was shot dead along Ngong Road [83] In the same month, during the burial of Jacob Juma, a former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo and previously a close ally of Ruto claimed Jacob Juma had physically assaulted Ruto by slapping him for having a sour relationship over unspecified reasons [84] Jirongo urged police to investigate the assassination based on the assault [85] Later in the month, Ruto threatened to sue Jirongo for linking him to the assassination [86] [87] Jirongo claimed that he and another former minister, Chris Okemo, were personally involved in paying the murdered government critic university's tuition fees, and that he knew the matter surrounding the controversy all too well [84] According to Jirongo, the same assassins were involved in the murder of Meshack Yebei, another murdered prospective defence witness in the ICC trial against Ruto [84]\n\n\nInternational Criminal Court summons\nIn December 2010, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced that he was seeking the summons of six people, including Ruto, over their involvement in the 2007–8 electoral violence [100] The ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber subsequently issued a summons for Ruto at the prosecutor's request [101] Ruto was accused of planning and organizing crimes against supporters of President Kibaki's Party of National Unity He was charged with three counts of crimes against humanity, one for murder, one for the forcible transfer of population, and one for persecution On 23 January 2012, the ICC confirmed the charges against Ruto and Joshua Sang, in a case that also involved Uhuru Kenyatta, Francis Muthaura, Henry Kosgey and Major General Mohammed Hussein Ali [102] Ruto told the US government that the Kiambaa church fire on 1 January 2008 after the 2007 general election was accidental [103] In 2009 the Waki Commission report stated that \"the incident which captured the attention of both Kenyans and the world was a deliberate burning of live people, mostly Kikuyu women, and children huddled together in a church\" in Kiambaa on 1 January 2008 [104] In April 2016, the International Criminal Court abandoned the prosecution of Ruto [33]\n\n\nHome attack\nOn 28 July 2017, Ruto's home was targeted by at least one attacker armed with a machete, and the police officer on duty guarding the residence was injured [105] During the time of the attack, he and his family were not at the compound as he had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in Kitale There were reports of gunfire and several security sources said the attack was staged by multiple people Police initially thought there were a few attackers because the attacker used different firearms [106] [107] Around 48 hours later, Kenya Police chief Joseph Boinnet announced that the attacker had been shot dead and the situation was under control [108]\n\n\nPersonal life\nRuto is married to Rachel Chebet They first lived in Dagoretti, where they had their first child [109] They were

The inauguration ceremony was attended by over 20 heads of state and government, including Chief Justice Martha Koome. Ruto officially began his term as President of Kenya after the inauguration.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nRuto has been involved in several controversies, including a land grabbing saga involving his mysterious acquisition of Weston Hotel land. According to the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA), a state agency, was duped into surrendering the land on which the Weston Hotel was built. KCAA did not occupy the alternative piece of land upon which Ruto's Weston Hotel was built.\n\nRuto has also been accused of defrauding another state corporation, Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC), of huge amounts of money through dubious land deals. Ruto was acquitted in 2011, but the police re-opened investigations in the case in 2020.\n\nIn 2004, Ruto was charged with defrauding KPC of huge amounts of money through dubious land deals.

Ruto was evicted from the grabbed land in Uasin Gishu.\n\nRuto's acquisition of a 900-acre piece of land of another former vice president, Joseph Murumbi, has been reported to haunt Ruto because he had been involved in the irregular acquisition of the land. Ruto claimed that the articles were persistent, and obviously sponsored fake news.\n\nRuto has been widely and repeatedly linked to the assassination of Jacob Juma by several media, activists, politicians, opposition figures in Kenya, including Jacob Juma himself. Jacob Juma was a wealthy businessman who became a fierce government critic and anti-corruption crusader.\n\n**International Criminal Court Summons**\n\nIn December 2010, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced that he was seeking the summons of six people, including Ruto, over their involvement in the 2007-8 electoral violence. Ruto was accused of planning and organizing crimes against supporters of President Kibaki's Party of National Unity.\n\n**Home Attack**\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Ruto's home was targeted by at least one attacker armed with a machete, and the police officer on duty guarding the residence was injured. During the time of the attack, Ruto and his family were not at the compound as he had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in Kitale.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRuto is married to Rachel Chebet, and they have six children.

He was known for his unconventional approach to Christianity, which emphasized spiritual experiences and emotional expression. Frisbee's life was marked by controversy, as he struggled with his own personal demons, including addiction and promiscuity. Despite his troubled past, Frisbee became a prominent figure in the Jesus movement, and his legacy continues to be felt today.\n\n**Early Life and Career**\n\nLonnie Frisbee was born on July 12, 1949, in Los Angeles, California. He was raised in a single-parent home by his mother, who struggled to make ends meet. Frisbee's early life was marked by instability and chaos, and he was exposed to \"sketchy, dangerous characters\" from a young age. He ran away from home frequently, and at the age of 15, he entered into Laguna Beach's homosexual underground scene with a friend. This experience had a profound impact on Frisbee, and he struggled to reconcile his faith with his same-sex attractions.\n\n**Frisbee's Attachment to the Charismatic Pentecostal Style**\n\nIn 1968, Frisbee met Chuck Smith, the founder of Calvary Chapel, who was looking for a young man to lead a Bible study. Smith was struck by Frisbee's charisma and his ability to connect with young people. Frisbee became one of the most important ministers in the church, leading the Wednesday night Bible study, which soon became the central night for the church, attracting thousands of young people. Frisbee's attachment to the charismatic Pentecostal style caused some disagreement within the church, since he seemed focused more on gaining converts and experiencing the presence of the Holy Spirit than on teaching newer converts Biblical doctrine.\n\n**Fame and the Jesus Movement**\n\nBy 1971, the Jesus movement was covered in the media with major media outlets like Life, Newsweek, and Rolling Stone reporting on it. Frisbee, due to his prominence in the movement, was often photographed and interviewed. He appeared on the Kathryn Kuhlman I Believe In Miracles show, talking about Jesus, the prophets, and quoting scripture. Frisbee's fame brought both opportunities and challenges, as he struggled to maintain his integrity and stay true to his faith.\n\n**Theological Differences and the Shepherding Movement**\n\nIn 1971, Frisbee and Smith parted ways due to their theological differences. Smith discounted Pentecostalism, maintaining that love was the greatest manifestation of the Holy Spirit, while Frisbee was strongly involved in theology that centered on spiritual gifts and New Testament experiences. Frisbee announced that he would leave California altogether and go to a movement in Florida led by Derek Prince and Bob Mumford, which taught a pyramid shepherding style of leadership and was later referred to as the Shepherding Movement.\n\n**The Vineyard Movement**\n\nMeanwhile, in May 1977, John Wimber laid the groundwork for what would become the Association of Vineyard Churches, also known as the Vineyard Movement. He witnessed the explosive growth of Calvary Chapel and wanted to build a church that would embrace the healings and miracles that he had previously been taught were no longer a part of Christian life. He began teaching and preaching about spiritual gifts and healings, but Wimber held that it wasn't until May 1979, when Frisbee gave his testimony during an evening service at what was then the Yorba Linda branch of the Calvary Chapel movement (later the Anaheim Vineyard Christian Fellowship), that the charismatic gifts of the Holy Spirit took hold of the church.\n\n**Sexuality Revealed**\n\nAlthough Frisbee's homosexuality was documented as a \"bit of an open secret in the church community\" and that he would \"party\" on Saturday night then preach Sunday morning, many in the church were unaware of his \"other life.\" Eventually, some church officials felt that Frisbee's inability to overcome sexual immorality became a hindrance to his ministry. An article in The Orange County Weekly chronicles Frisbee's life, in which Matt Coker writes, \"Chuck Smith Jr says he was having lunch with Wimber one day when he asked how the pastor reconciled working with a known homosexual like Frisbee. Wimber asked how the younger Smith knew this. Smith said he'd received a call from a pastor who'd just heard a young man confess to having been in a six-month relationship with Frisbee. Wimber called Smith the next day to say he'd confronted Frisbee, who openly admitted to the affair and agreed to leave.\"\n\n**Death**\n\nAt the time of his death in 1993, a brain tumor was named as the cause. However, a source claimed that Frisbee contracted AIDS and died from complications associated with the condition. Frisbee was interred in the Crystal Cathedral Memorial Gardens.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nDespite his troubled past and controversies, Lonnie Frisbee's legacy continues to be felt today. He was a key figure in the Jesus movement, and his charismatic approach to Christianity helped to inspire a new generation of young people to explore their faith. The Vineyard Movement, which he helped to launch, continues to be a prominent force in the Christian world, with thousands of churches around the globe. Frisbee's story is a complex and multifaceted one, full of contradictions and paradoxes. Yet, despite the challenges and controversies that he faced, he remained a passionate and dedicated servant of God, committed to spreading the message of Jesus Christ to a world in need.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThe 2023 movie Jesus Revolution starred Jonathan Roumie as Lonnie Frisbee, and Kelsey Grammer as Pastor Chuck Smith. The movie's theme is the rise of the Jesus Movement and features Frisbee as one of the film's main characters.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lonnie_Frisbee\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and career\nFrisbee was mostly raised in a single-parent home and was exposed to \"sketchy, dangerous characters\" as a child [6] [11] While researching his documentary, Frisbee: The Life and Death of a Hippie Preacher, filmmaker David di Sabatino stated Frisbee's  brother claimed Lonnie was raped at the age of eight  Also revealed in the film was that Frisbee ran away frequently and entered into Laguna Beach's homosexual underground scene with a friend when he was 15  Di Sabatino further commented that an incident such as the alleged rape, \"fragments your identity\", and that he saw Frisbee's homosexuality as a flaw [4] [6] During his childhood, Frisbee's father ended up leaving their home, and the boy, fatherless  His mother later tracked down and married the former husband of the woman Frisbee's father became involved with [12]\n\n\nJesus movement, Calvary Chapel\nChuck Smith had been making plans to build a chapel out of a surplus school building in the city of Santa Ana, near Costa Mesa, when he met Frisbee Smith's daughter's boyfriend John Nicholson was a former addict who had turned to Christianity When Smith said he wanted to meet a hippie, John brought home Frisbee (who was hitch-hiking), so he could meet people to talk about Jesus and salvation [11] Frisbee and his wife Connie joined the fledgling Calvary Chapel congregation and Smith was struck by Frisbee's charisma Smith said, \"I was not at all prepared for the love that this young man would radiate.\" [15] Frisbee became one of the most important ministers in the church when on May 17, 1968, Smith put the young couple in charge of the Costa Mesa rehab house called \"The House of Miracles\" with John Higgins and his wife Jackie Within a week it had 35 new converts Bunk beds were built in the garage to house the new converts [11] Frisbee led the Wednesday night Bible study, which soon became the central night for the church attracting thousands [15] Frisbee's attachment to the charismatic Pentecostal style caused some disagreement within the church, since he seemed focused more on gaining converts and experiencing the presence of the Holy Spirit than on teaching newer converts Biblical doctrine [5] Chuck Smith took over teaching and welcomed Frisbee into his church [17] Frisbee's appearance helped appeal to hippies and those interested in youth culture, and he believed that the youth culture would play a prominent role in the Christian movement in the United States He cited Joel the prophet and remained upbeat despite what the young couple saw as unbalanced treatment, as Frisbee was never paid for his work and another person was hired full-time as Smith's assistant [9]\n\n\nFame\n\"Jesus Freaks\", or \"Jesus People\" as they were often called, were documented in media including the Kathryn Kuhlman I Believe In Miracles show; Frisbee was a featured guest on the show talking about Jesus, the prophets, and quoting scripture [20] By 1971, the Jesus Movement was covered in the media with major media outlets like Life, Newsweek and Rolling Stone reporting on it Frisbee, due to his prominence in the movement, was often photographed and interviewed Also in 1971 Frisbee and Smith parted ways because their theological differences had become too great Smith discounted Pentecostalism, maintaining that love was the greatest manifestation of the Holy Spirit, while Frisbee was strongly involved in theology which centered on spiritual gifts and New Testament experiences Frisbee announced that he would leave California altogether and go to a movement in Florida led by Derek Prince and Bob Mumford which taught a pyramid shepherding style of leadership and was later referred to as the Shepherding Movement [11]\n\n\nVineyard movement\nMeanwhile in May 1977, John Wimber laid the groundwork for what would become the Association of Vineyard Churches, also known as the Vineyard Movement He witnessed the explosive growth of Calvary Chapel and wanted to build a church which embraced the healings and miracles that he had previously been taught were no longer a part of Christian life [citation needed] He began teaching and preaching about spiritual gifts and healings, but Wimber held that it wasn't until May 1979, when Frisbee gave his testimony during an evening service at what was then the Yorba Linda branch of the Calvary Chapel movement (later the Anaheim Vineyard Christian Fellowship), that the charismatic gifts of the Holy Spirit took hold of the church [21]\n\n\nSexuality revealed\nAlthough Frisbee's homosexuality was documented as a \"bit of an open secret in the church community\" and that he would \"party\" on Saturday night then preach Sunday morning, many in the church were unaware of his \"other life.\" [24] Eventually some church officials felt that Frisbee's inability to overcome sexual immorality became a hindrance to his ministry An article in The Orange County Weekly, headlined \"The First Jesus Freak,\" chronicles Frisbee's life in which Matt Coker writes, \"Chuck Smith Jr says he was having lunch with Wimber one day when he asked how the pastor reconciled working with a known homosexual like Frisbee Wimber asked how the younger Smith knew this Smith said he'd received a call from a pastor who'd just heard a young man confess to having been in a six-month relationship with Frisbee Wimber called Smith the next day to say he'd confronted Frisbee, who openly admitted to the affair and agreed to leave.\" [6]\n\n\nDeath\nAt the time of his death in 1993, a brain tumor was named as the cause A source claimed Frisbee contracted AIDS and died from complications associated with the condition; [11] At his funeral at the Crystal Cathedral, Calvary Chapel's Chuck Smith eulogized Frisbee as a spiritual son and said he was a Samson-like figure, saying that he was a man through whom God did many great works, but that he was the victim of his own struggles and temptations [27] Some saw this as further maligning Frisbee's work and an inappropriate characterization at the service [5] Others including Frisbee's friend John Ruttkay, saw the Samson analogy as being spot on, and said so at his funeral [5] Frisbee was interred in the Crystal Cathedral Memorial Gardens [28]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDavid Di Sabatino produced and directed the video documentary: Frisbee: The Life and Death of a Hippie Preacher Narrated by Jim Palosaari, it received an Emmy Award nomination from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (San Francisco/NorCal chapter).\n\n\nFrisbee: The Life and Death of a Hippie Preacher\nDavid Di Sabatino produced and directed the video documentary: Frisbee: The Life and Death of a Hippie Preacher Narrated by Jim Palosaari, it received an Emmy Award nomination from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (San Francisco/NorCal chapter).\n\n\nJesus Revolution\nThe 2023 movie Jesus Revolution starred Jonathan Roumie as Lonnie Frisbee, and Kelsey Grammer as Pastor Chuck Smith The movie's theme is the rise of the Jesus Movement and features Frisbee as one of the film's main characters.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Democratic National Convention held in various parts of the United States, including its main host city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in a virtual format impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was discussion among some notable individuals in Milwaukee about the city pushing to receive the 2024 convention as consolation [18] [19] [20] Speculation existed that, due to the circumstances surrounding the downsizing of the 2020 convention, Milwaukee would be a front-runner to host the convention if it pursued it [21] Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett was open to the city hosting either a Democratic or Republican convention in 2024 [22]\n\n\nEarly developments\nAmid the downsizing of the 2020 Democratic National Convention held in various parts of the United States, including its main host city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in a virtual format impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was discussion among some notable individuals in Milwaukee about the city pushing to receive the 2024 convention as consolation [18] [19] [20] Speculation existed that, due to the circumstances surrounding the downsizing of the 2020 convention, Milwaukee would be a front-runner to host the convention if it pursued it [21] Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett was open to the city hosting either a Democratic or Republican convention in 2024 [22]\n\n\nOfficial bid process\nAtlanta, Chicago, Houston, and New York City submitted bids by the May 28, 2022, deadline [34] In January 2023, Democratic National Committee officials confirmed that the finalist cities would be Atlanta, Chicago, and New York City, with Houston no longer being considered [35]\n\n\nLogistics\nThe convention was held on August 19–22, 2024 The United Center, previously the location of the 1996 Democratic National Convention, was the convention's primary location McCormick Place hosted secondary business of the convention The convention was attended by between 5,000 and 7,000 delegates and alternate delegates Approximately thirty hotels in the city provided lodging to convention delegates The convention was expected to bring an overall 50,000 visitors to Chicago [38]\n\n\nConvention leadership\nOn August 8, 2023, convention leadership was announced Minyon Moore was named the chair of the convention [49] Alex Hornbrook was named executive director, and Louisa Terrell was named a senior advisor In his role as senior advisor to the Biden Victory Fund, Roger Lau was assigned an expanded role to provide advice to the convention leadership [50]\n\n\nSecurity\n$50 million in federal funding was provided for security spending [48] As a major party presidential nominating convention, the 2024 Democratic National Convention was designated a National Special Security Event It was the second such event held in Chicago to receive this designation, with the first having been the 2012 NATO Summit By June 2023, the United States Secret Service had begun collaborating on preparations for the convention with the Chicago Police Department and other police departments that will be involved in convention security [51]\n\n\nAdoption of early virtual nomination vote\nBy tradition, [65] because the Democratic Party held the White House, its convention was scheduled for after the 2024 Republican National Convention, starting on August 19 In April, Ohio officials warned the Biden campaign that they would not delay Ohio's August 7, deadline to get on the ballot, as Ohio had done in 2012 and 2020 On May 28, the Democratic National Committee proposed an early online nomination vote, but its Rules and Bylaws Committee needed to vote on amending the call to the convention, and the full Democratic National Committee needed to vote on adopting the amendment [66] On June 2, Ohio passed a law delaying its deadline, but because the law was set to take effect at the end of August, the DNC said it would continue with a virtual roll call vote in order to avoid litigation from Republicans [67] [68] On June 4, the Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee voted to amend the call to let the Democratic National Convention Committee to advance the convention's dates and to allow the convention's committees to adopt the permanent rules and permanent list of delegates early for the virtual nomination vote [67] [69] On June 20, the full Democratic National Committee voted 360 to 2 to approve the amendment for an official online nomination vote before Ohio's deadline [70]\n\n\nMedia\nIn addition to traditional journalists, the Democratic National Committee recruited content creators, with large followings on YouTube, Instagram, and other social media platforms and provided them with access to media space at the convention [78]\n\n\nAbbreviated campaign\nOn July 21, presumptive nominee President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek reelection That same day, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee [79] Biden dropping out freed the DNC delegates bound to him from their pledge to vote for his nomination [80] A couple of hours after Biden's announcement, Harris announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination [81] The Biden campaign officially changed its name to Harris for President and officially registered Harris as its presidential candidate [82] [83] Key progressive voices swiftly rallied behind Harris, with Reps Cori Bush, [84] Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ayanna Pressley, [85] and Indivisible endorsing her [86]\n\n\nDelegate support by candidate\nThe \"Pledged delegates by candidate following primaries\" table below reflects the delegate count after the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries, while the \"Final virtual roll call results\" table reflects the totals following the virtual roll call that nominated Kamala Harris Superdelegates were allowed to vote during the signature collection and on the first ballot of the virtual roll call for the presidential nomination [4] The Democratic National Committee had imposed reforms on superdelegates back in August 2018, barring superdelegates from voting on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention unless a candidate has secured a majority of the convention's delegates using only pledged delegates, whose votes were earned during the primary process This rule allowed superdelegates to vote only in a contested convention on the second ballot or vote on the first ballot only in the event of an overwhelming victory for the candidate with the support of pledged delegates that were attained for them in the primaries [119] The new superdelegate rules adopted for the virtual roll call in the presidential nomination process by the Permanent Rules of the 2024 Democratic National Convention undid the DNC's 2018 reforms on superdelegates in this presidential election cycle Harris did not secure a majority of the convention's delegates using only delegates pledged to her, which were earned during the primary process Harris earned zero pledged delegates from the results of the primaries Yet, superdelegates were permitted to vote on the first ballot Harris’s delegates, whom she secured an overall majority of during the virtual roll call, were uncommitted delegates once pledged to Biden They decided to support her after Biden's withdrawal from the race, which took place after the results of the primaries had already been over [120] [121] [122]\n\n\nVice presidential nomination\nSome speculated candidates included Governors Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Tim Walz of Minnesota, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg of Michigan [i] [134] Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan declined consideration for the nomination, while Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina withdrew his name from consideration during vetting [135] [136]\n\n\nPlatform\nOn July 9, the convention's Platform Committee held a hearing in which there was a call for an end to U.S military aid to the government of Israel [139] On July 11, the committee held a meeting to draft the party platform Although it removed mentions of \"Black lives matter\", it included police reform and the studying of reparations It removed a mention of Medicare for All but called for ending medical debt [140] On July 16, the Platform Committee submitted the draft platform for the approval of the full convention [141]\n\n\nNotable provisions\nThe platform was drafted before Biden withdrew and largely refers to Biden's presidency, though it also mentions Harris.\n\n\nSchedule\nThere were two official venues for the convention:\n\n\nFirst night (Monday, August 19: For the People)\nThe first night was emceed by actor

{"title": "Edward_Snowden", "content": "\nPersonal life\nEdward Joseph Snowden was born on June 21, 1983, [17] in Elizabeth City, North Carolina [18] Snowden's father, Lonnie, was a warrant officer in the U.S Coast Guard, [19] and his mother, Elizabeth, was a clerk at the U.S District Court for the District of Maryland [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] His older sister, Jessica, was a lawyer at the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, D.C His maternal grandfather, Edward J Barrett, [25] [26] a rear admiral in the Coast Guard, became a senior official with the FBI and was at the Pentagon in 2001 during the September 11 attacks [27] Edward Snowden said that he had expected to work for the federal government, as had the rest of his family [28] His parents divorced in 2001, [29] and his father remarried [30]\n\n\nCareer\nFeeling a duty to fight in the Iraq War, [11] Snowden enlisted in the United States Army on May 7, 2004, and became a Special Forces candidate through its 18X enlistment option [42] He did not complete the training [17] due to  a leg injury and was given an administrative discharge [43] on September 28, 2004 [44]\n\n\nEmployment at the CIA\nAfter attending a 2006 job-fair focused on intelligence agencies, Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA [28] [48] The Agency assigned him to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia [28]\n\n\nNSA sub-contractor as an employee at Dell\nIn 2009, Snowden began work as a contractor for Dell, [55] which manages computer systems for multiple government agencies Assigned to an NSA facility at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo, Snowden instructed top officials and military officers on how to defend their networks from Chinese hackers [28] Snowden looked into mass surveillance in China which prompted him to investigate and then expose Washington's mass surveillance program after he was asked in 2009 to brief a conference in Tokyo [56]\n\n\nNSA sub-contractor as an employee at Booz Allen Hamilton\nOn March 15, 2013—three days after what he later called his \"breaking point\" of \"seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress\" [59]—Snowden quit his job at Dell [60] Although he has said his career high annual salary was $200,000, [61] Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, [61] where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the NSA's worldwide surveillance activity [62]\n\n\nWhistleblower status\nSnowden has described himself as a whistleblower, [75] a description used by many sources, including CNBC, [76] The New Yorker, [77] Reuters, [78] and The Guardian, [79] among others [80] [81] [82] The term has both informal and legal meanings.\n\n\nSurveillance disclosures\nThe exact size of Snowden's disclosure is unknown, [93] but Australian officials have estimated 15,000 or more Australian intelligence files [94] and British officials estimate at least 58,000 British intelligence files were included [95] NSA Director Keith Alexander initially estimated that Snowden had copied anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 NSA documents [96] Later estimates provided by U.S officials were in the order of 1.7 million, [97] a number that originally came from Department of Defense talking points [98] In July 2014, The Washington Post reported on a cache previously provided by Snowden from domestic NSA operations consisting of \"roughly 160,000 intercepted e-mail and instant-message conversations, some of them hundreds of pages long, and 7,900 documents taken from more than 11,000 online accounts.\" [99] A DIA report declassified in June 2015 said that Snowden took 900,000 Department of Defense files, more than he downloaded from the NSA [98]\n\n\nSize and scope of disclosures\nThe exact size of Snowden's disclosure is unknown, [93] but Australian officials have estimated 15,000 or more Australian intelligence files [94] and British officials estimate at least 58,000 British intelligence files were included [95] NSA Director Keith Alexander initially estimated that Snowden had copied anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 NSA documents [96] Later estimates provided by U.S officials were in the order of 1.7 million, [97] a number that originally came from Department of Defense talking points [98] In July 2014, The Washington Post reported on a cache previously provided by Snowden from domestic NSA operations consisting of \"roughly 160,000 intercepted e-mail and instant-message conversations, some of them hundreds of pages long, and 7,900 documents taken from more than 11,000 online accounts.\" [99] A DIA report declassified in June 2015 said that Snowden took 900,000 Department of Defense files, more than he downloaded from the NSA [98]\n\n\nPotential impact on U.S. national security\nIn March 2014, Army General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee, \"The vast majority of the documents that Snowden .. exfiltrated from our highest levels of security .. had nothing to do with exposing government oversight of domestic activities The vast majority of those were related to our military capabilities, operations, tactics, techniques, and procedures.\" [100] When asked in a May 2014 interview to quantify the number of documents Snowden stole, retired NSA director Keith Alexander said there was no accurate way of counting what he took, but Snowden may have downloaded more than a million documents [101] The September 15, 2016 HPSCI report [92] estimated the number of downloaded documents at 1.5 million.\n\n\nRelease of NSA documents\nSnowden's decision to leak NSA documents developed gradually following his March 2007 posting as a technician to the Geneva CIA station [111] Snowden later made contact with Glenn Greenwald, a journalist working at The Guardian [112] He contacted Greenwald anonymously as \"Cincinnatus\" [113] [114] and said he had sensitive documents that he would like to share [115] Greenwald found the measures that the source asked him to take to secure their communications, such as encrypting email, too annoying to employ Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras in January 2013 [116] According to Poitras, Snowden chose to contact her after seeing her New York Times article about NSA whistleblower William Binney [117] What originally attracted Snowden to Greenwald and Poitras was a Salon article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras's controversial films had made her a target of the government [115]\n\n\nPublication\nOn May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong, [122] where he was staying when the initial articles based on the leaked documents were published, [123] beginning with The Guardian on June 5 [124] Greenwald later said Snowden disclosed 9,000 to 10,000 documents [125]\n\n\nRevelations\nThe ongoing publication of leaked documents has revealed previously unknown details of a global surveillance apparatus run by the NSA [133] in close cooperation with three of its four Five Eyes partners: Australia's ASD, [134] the UK's GCHQ, [135] and Canada's CSEC [136]\n\n\nMotivations\nSnowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms [6] After the disclosures, his identity was made public by The Guardian at his request on June 9, 2013 [118] \"I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,\" he said \"My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.\" [122]\n\n\nSimilarities to previous espionage incidents\nSnowden's disclosure, association with foreign intelligence services and subsequent public relations campaign and flight to avoid prosecution is similar in nature to the case of Philip Agee, a former CIA case officer and alleged spy for Russian and Cuban Intelligence during the 1970s and Kim Philby, a former British intelligence officer.\n\n\nNew Zealand\nSnowden made a number of claims about the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) of New Zealand He accused the agency of conducting surveillance on New Zealand citizens and engaging in espionage between 2008 and 2016, when John Key served as the Prime Minister of New Zealand [188] [189]\n\n\nFlight from the United States\nIn May 2013, Snowden quit his job, telling his supervisors he required epilepsy treatment, but instead fled the United States for Hong Kong on May 10 He chose Hong Kong for its \"spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent\" at the time [11] [190] Snowden remained in his room at the Mira Hotel after his arrival in the city, rarely going out [191]\n\n\nHong Kong\nIn May 2013, Snowden quit his job, telling his supervisors he required epilepsy treatment, but instead fled the United States for Hong Kong on May 10 He chose Hong Kong for its \"spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent\" at the time [11] [190] Snowden remained in his room at the Mira Hotel after his arrival in the city, rarely going out [191]\n\n\nRussia\nOn June 23, 2013, Snowden landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport [221] WikiLeaks said he was on a circuitous but safe route to asylum in Ecuador [222] Snowden had a seat reserved to continue to Cuba [223] but did not board that onward flight, saying in a January 2014 interview that he intended to transit through Russia but was stopped en route He said \"a planeload of reporters documented the seat I was supposed to be in\" when he was ticketed for Havana, but the U.S canceled his passport [201] He said the U.S wanted him to stay in Moscow so \"they could say, 'He's a Russian spy.'\" [72] Greenwald's account differed on the point of Snowden being already ticketed According to Greenwald, Snowden's passport was valid when he departed Hong Kong but was revoked during the hours he was in transit to Moscow, preventing him from obtaining a ticket to leave Russia Greenwald said Snowden was thus forced to stay in Moscow and seek asylum [224]\n\n\nMorales plane incident\nOn July 1, 2013, president Evo Morales of Bolivia, who had been attending a conference in Russia, suggested during an interview with RT (formerly Russia Today) that he would consider a request by Snowden for asylum [240] The following day, Morales's plane, en route to La Paz, was rerouted to Austria and landed there, after France, Spain, and Italy denied access to their airspace While the plane was parked in Vienna, the Spanish ambassador to Austria arrived with two embassy personnel and asked to search the plane but they were denied permission by Morales himself [241] U.S officials had raised suspicions that Snowden may have been on board [242] Morales blamed the U.S for putting pressure on European countries and said that the grounding of his plane was a violation of international law [243]\n\n\nAsylum applications\nSnowden applied for political asylum to 21 countries [246] [247] A statement attributed to him contended that the U.S administration, and specifically then–Vice President Joe Biden, had pressured the governments to refuse his asylum petitions Biden had telephoned Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa days prior to Snowden's remarks, asking the Ecuadorian leader not to grant Snowden asylum [248] Ecuador had initially offered Snowden a temporary travel document but later withdrew it, [249] and Correa later called the offer a mistake [250]\n\n\nEric Holder letter to Russian Justice Minister\nIn a letter to Russian Minister of Justice Aleksandr Konovalov dated July 23, 2013, U.S Attorney General Eric Holder repudiated Snowden's claim to refugee status and offered a limited validity passport good for direct return to the U.S [279] He stated that Snowden would not be subject to torture or the death penalty, and would receive a trial in a civilian court with proper legal counsel [280] The same day, the Russian president's spokesman reiterated that his government would not hand over Snowden, commenting that Putin was not personally involved in the matter and that it was being handled through talks between the FBI and Russia's FSB [281]\n\n\nCriminal charges\nOn June 14, 2013, United States federal prosecutors filed a criminal complaint [282] against Snowden, charging him with three felonies: theft of government property and two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 (18 U S C Sect 792 et seq.; Publ L 65-24) through unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person [5] [279]\n\n\nAnalysis of Criminal Complaint\nStephen P Mulligan and Jennifer K Elsea, Legislative attorneys for the Congressional Research Service, provide a 2017 analysis [283] of the uses of the Espionage Act to prosecute unauthorized disclosures of classified information, based on what was disclosed, to whom, and how; the burden of proof requirements e.g degrees of Mens Rea (guilty mind), and the relationship of such considerations to the First Amendment framework of protections of free speech are also analyzed The analysis includes the charges against Snowden, among several other cases The discussion also covers gaps in the legal framework used to prosecute such cases.\n\n\nSnowden response to Criminal Complaint\n\nSnowden was asked in a January 2014 interview about returning to the U.S to face the charges in court, as Obama had suggested a few days prior Snowden explained why he rejected the request: \n\nCivil lawsuit\nOn September 17, 2019, the United States filed a lawsuit, Civil Action No 1:19-cv-1197-LO-TCB, against Snowden for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and NSA [286]\nThe two-count civil complaint alleged that Snowden had violated prepublication obligations related to the publication of his memoir Permanent Record The complaint listed the publishers Macmillan Publishing Group, LLC d.b.a Henry Holt and Company and Holtzbrink, as relief-defendants [287]\nThe Hon Liam O'Grady, a judge in the Alexandria Division of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found for the United States (Plaintiff) by summary judgment, on both counts of the action [288] The judgment also found that Snowden had been paid speaker honorariums totaling $1.03 million for a series of 56 speeches delivered by video link The effect of the ruling was that the US government can collect the proceeds from his book and speeches and means that Snowden has to relinquish more than $5.2 million earned to a \"constructive trust\", created to transfer the money to the government [14]\n\n\nAsylum in Russia\nOn June 23, 2013, Snowden landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport aboard a commercial Aeroflot flight from Hong Kong [289] [208] [290] After 39 days in the transit section, he left the airport on August 1 and was granted temporary asylum in Russia for one year by the Federal Migration Service [291]\n\n\nPolitical views\nSnowden has said that, in the 2008 United States presidential election, he voted for a third-party candidate; he also said that he \"believed in Obama's promises\" Following the election, he said that Barack Obama was continuing policies instated by George W Bush [309]\n\n\nReaction\nIn response to outrage by European leaders, President Barack Obama said in

response to outrage by European leaders, President Barack Obama said in early July 2013 that all nations collect intelligence, including those expressing outrage His remarks came in response to an article in the German magazine Der Spiegel [314]\n\n\nBarack Obama\nIn response to outrage by European leaders, President Barack Obama said in early July 2013 that all nations collect intelligence, including those expressing outrage His remarks came in response to an article in the German magazine Der Spiegel [314]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nIn 2013, Donald Trump made a series of tweets in which he referred to Snowden as a \"traitor\", saying he gave \"serious information to China and Russia\" and \"should be executed\" Later that year he added a caveat, tweeting \"if it and he could reveal Obama's  [birth] records, I might become a major fan\" [317]\n\n\nPublic figures\nPentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg called Snowden's release of NSA material the most significant leak in U.S history [321] [322] Shortly before the September 2016 release of his biographical thriller film Snowden, a semi-fictionalized drama based on the life of Edward Snowden with a short appearance by Snowden himself, Oliver Stone said that Snowden should be pardoned, calling him a \"patriot above all\" and suggesting that he should run the NSA himself [323]\n\n\nGovernment officials\nNumerous high-ranking current or former U.S government officials reacted publicly to Snowden's disclosures.\n\n\nDebate\nIn the U.S., Snowden's actions precipitated an intense debate on privacy and warrantless domestic surveillance [338] [339] President Obama was initially dismissive of Snowden, saying \"I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.\" [340] [341] [342] In August 2013, Obama rejected the suggestion that Snowden was a patriot, [343] and in November said that \"the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done, because there was another way of doing it.\" [344]\n\n\nPresidential panel\nIn August 2013, President Obama said that he had called for a review of U.S surveillance activities before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations, [343] and announced that he was directing DNI James Clapper \"to establish a review group on intelligence and communications technologies.\" [352] [353] In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the NSA to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using backdoors in hardware or software [354] Panel member Geoffrey R Stone said there was no evidence that the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any terror attacks [355]\n\n\nCourt rulings (United States)\nOn June 6, 2013, in the wake of Snowden's leaks, conservative public interest lawyer and Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had unlawfully collected metadata for his telephone calls and was harassing him In Klayman v Obama, Judge Richard J Leon referred to the NSA's \"almost-Orwellian technology\" and ruled the bulk telephone metadata program to be likely unconstitutional [356]\nLeon's ruling was stayed pending an appeal by the government.\nSnowden later described Judge Leon's decision as vindication [357]\n\n\nUSA Freedom Act\nOn June 2, 2015, the U.S Senate passed, and President Obama signed, the USA Freedom Act which restored in modified form several provisions of the Patriot Act that had expired the day before, while for the first time imposing some limits on the bulk collection of telecommunication data on U.S citizens by American intelligence agencies The new restrictions were widely seen as stemming from Snowden's revelations [361] [362]\n\n\nEurope\nIn an official report published in October 2015, the United Nations special rapporteur for the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of speech, Professor David Kaye, criticized the U.S government's harsh treatment of, and bringing criminal charges against, whistleblowers, including Edward Snowden The report found that Snowden's revelations were important for people everywhere and made \"a deep and lasting impact on law, policy, and politics.\" [363] [364] The European Parliament invited Snowden to make a pre-recorded video appearance to aid their NSA investigation [365] [366] Snowden gave written testimony in which he said that he was seeking asylum in the EU, but that he was told by European Parliamentarians that the U.S would not allow EU partners to make such an offer [367] He told the Parliament that the NSA was working with the security agencies of EU states to \"get access to as much data of EU citizens as possible.\" [368] He said that the NSA's Foreign Affairs Division lobbies the EU and other countries to change their laws, allowing for \"everyone in the country\" to be spied on legally [369]\n\n\nAustria, Italy and Switzerland\nSnowden applied for asylum in Austria, [370] Italy [371] and Switzerland [372] [373] [374]\nSnowden, speaking to a Geneva, Switzerland audience via video link from Moscow, said he would love to return to Geneva, where he had previously worked undercover for the CIA Swiss media said that the Swiss Attorney General had determined that Switzerland would not extradite Snowden if the US request were considered \"politically motivated\" Switzerland would grant Snowden asylum if he revealed the extent of espionage activities by the United States government According to the paper Sonntags Zeitung, Snowden would be granted safe entry and residency in Switzerland, in return for his knowledge of American intelligence activities Swiss paper Le Matin reported that Snowden's activity could be part of criminal proceedings or part of a parliamentary inquiry.\n\n\nFrance\nOn September 16, 2019, it was reported that Snowden had said he \"would love\" to get political asylum in France [375]\nSnowden first applied unsuccessfully for asylum in France in 2013, under then French President François Hollande His second request, under President Emmanuel Macron, was favorably received by Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet However, no other members of the French government were known to express support for Snowden's asylum request, possibly due to the potential adverse diplomatic consequences.\n\n\nGermany\nHans-Georg Maaßen, head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's domestic security agency, speculated that Snowden could have been working for the Russian government [376] [377] Snowden rejected this insinuation, [378] speculating on Twitter in German that \"it cannot be proven if Maaßen is an agent of the SVR or FSB.\" [379]\nOn October 31, 2013, Snowden met with German Green Party lawmaker Hans-Christian Ströbele in Moscow to discuss the possibility of Snowden giving testimony in Germany [380]\nAt the meeting, Snowden gave Ströbele a letter to the German government, parliament, and federal Attorney-General, the details of which were to later be made public.\nGermany later blocked Snowden from testifying in person in an NSA inquiry, citing a potential grave strain on US-German relations [381]\n\n\nNordic countries\nThe FBI demanded that Nordic countries arrest Snowden should he visit their countries [382] Snowden made asylum requests to Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark [246] All requests were ultimately denied, with varying degrees of severity in the response.\nAccording to Finnish foreign ministry spokeswoman Tytti Pylkkö, Snowden made an asylum request to Finland by sending an application to the Finnish embassy in Moscow while he was confined to the transit area of the Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow, but was told that Finnish law required him to be on Finnish soil [383]\nAccording to SVT News, Snowden met with three Swedish MP's; Matthias Sundin (L), Jakop Dalunde (MP) and Cecilia Magnusson (M), in Moscow, to discuss his views on mass surveillance [384]\nThe meeting was organized by the Right Livelihood Award Foundation, which awarded Snowden the Right Livelihood Honorary Award, [385] often called Sweden's \"Alternative Nobel Prize\" According to the foundation, the prize was for Snowden's work on press freedom Sweden ultimately rejected Snowden's asylum, however, so the award was accepted by his father, Lon Snowden, on his behalf.\n\n\nLatin and South America\nSupport for Snowden came from Latin and South American leaders including the Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, Bolivian President Evo Morales, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega [391] [392]\n\n\nGlobal community\nCrediting the Snowden leaks, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted Resolution 68/167 in December 2013 The non-binding resolution denounced unwarranted digital surveillance and included a symbolic declaration of the right of all individuals to online privacy [393] [394] [395]\n\n\nPublic opinion polls\nSurveys conducted by news outlets and professional polling organizations found that American public opinion was divided on Snowden's disclosures and that those polled in Canada and Europe were more supportive of Snowden than respondents in the U.S., although more Americans have grown more supportive of Snowden's disclosure In Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, more than 80% of people familiar with Snowden view him positively [397]\n\n\nRecognition\nFor his global surveillance disclosures, Snowden has been honored by publications and organizations based in Europe and the United States He was voted as The Guardian's person of the year 2013, garnering four times the number of votes as any other candidate [398]\n\n\nTeleconference speaking engagements\nIn March 2014, Snowden spoke at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive technology conference in Austin, Texas, in front of 3,500 attendees He participated by teleconference carried over multiple routers running the Google Hangouts platform On-stage moderators were Christopher Soghoian and Snowden's legal counsel Wizner, both from the ACLU [399] Snowden said that the NSA was \"setting fire to the future of the internet,\" and that the SXSW audience was \"the firefighters\" [400] [401] [402] Attendees could use Twitter to send questions to Snowden, who answered one by saying that information gathered by corporations was much less dangerous than that gathered by a government agency, because \"governments have the power to deprive you of your rights.\" [400] Then-Representative Mike Pompeo (R-KS) of the House Intelligence Committee, later director of the CIA and secretary of state, had tried unsuccessfully to get the SXSW management to cancel Snowden's appearance; instead, SXSW director Hugh Forrest said that the NSA was welcome to respond to Snowden at the 2015 conference [400]\n\n\nThe \"Snowden effect\"\nIn July 2013, media critic Jay Rosen defined the \"Snowden effect\" as \"Direct and indirect gains in public knowledge from the cascade of events and further reporting that followed Edward Snowden's leaks of classified information about the surveillance state in the U.S.\" [422] In December 2013, The Nation wrote that Snowden had sparked an overdue debate about national security and individual privacy [423] In Forbes, the effect was seen to have nearly united the U.S Congress in opposition to the massive post-9/11 domestic intelligence gathering system [424] In its Spring 2014 Global Attitudes Survey, the Pew Research Center found that Snowden's disclosures had tarnished the image of the United States, especially in Europe and Latin America [425]\n\n\nJewel v. NSA\nOn November 2, 2018, Snowden provided a court declaration in Jewel v National Security Agency, confirming that a document relied upon in the case, discussing the mass surveillance program known as Stellar Wind, is actually the same document that he came upon during the course of his employment as an NSA contractor [426] [427] [428]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Edward Snowden**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nEdward Joseph Snowden is a former American intelligence contractor and whistleblower who in 2013 leaked classified information about the global surveillance programs of the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and other countries. Snowden's disclosures revealed the extent of the NSA's mass surveillance activities, including the collection of phone records, emails, and online communications of millions of people around the world. Snowden's actions sparked a global debate on the balance between national security and individual privacy, and he has become a polarizing figure in the debate on surveillance and whistle-blowing.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nEdward Snowden was born on June 21, 1983, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. His father, Lonnie, was a warrant officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, and his mother, Elizabeth, was a clerk at the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Snowden's older sister, Jessica, was a lawyer at the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, D.C. Snowden's maternal grandfather, Edward J. Barrett, was a rear admiral in the Coast Guard and later became a senior official with the FBI.\n\nSnowden's parents divorced in 2001, and his father remarried. Snowden has said that he grew up in a family that valued public service and that he expected to work for the federal government, as had the rest of his family.\n\n**Career**\n\nSnowden enlisted in the United States Army on May 7, 2004, and became a Special Forces candidate through its 18X enlistment option. However, he did not complete the training due to a leg injury and was given an administrative discharge on September 28, 2004.\n\nAfter attending a 2006 job-fair focused on intelligence agencies, Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA. The Agency assigned him to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.\n\nIn 2009, Snowden began work as a contractor for Dell, which manages computer systems for multiple government agencies. He was assigned to an NSA facility at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo, where he instructed top officials and military officers on how to defend their networks from Chinese hackers.\n\n**NSA Sub-contractor as an Employee at Booz Allen Hamilton**\n\nOn March 15, 2013, Snowden quit his job at Dell and began working at Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting firm that provides services to the NSA. He told his supervisors that he had taken the job to gather data on the NSA's surveillance activities, which he planned to reveal to the public.\n\nOn May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong, where he was staying when the initial articles based on the leaked documents were published. He contacted journalist Glenn Greenwald and documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras to discuss the possibility of releasing the documents to the public.\n\n**Whistleblower Status**\n\nSnowden has described himself as a whistleblower, a description used by many sources, including The New Yorker, Reuters, and The Guardian. The term has both informal and legal meanings.\n\n**Surveillance Disclosures**\n\nThe exact size of Snowden's disclosure is unknown, but Australian officials have estimated 15,000 or more Australian intelligence files, and British officials estimate at least 58,000 British intelligence files were included.\n\nNSA Director Keith Alexander initially estimated that Snowden had copied anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 NSA documents. Later estimates provided by U.S. officials were in the order of 1.7 million, a number that originally came from Department of Defense talking points.\n\n**Potential Impact on U.S. National Security**\n\nIn March 2014, Army General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee that the vast majority of the documents Snowden exfiltrated from the highest levels of security had nothing to do with exposing government oversight of domestic activities.\n\n**Release of NSA Documents**\n\nSnowden's decision to leak NSA documents developed gradually following his March 2007 posting as a technician to the Geneva CIA station. He later made contact with Glenn Greenwald, a journalist working at The Guardian, and said he had sensitive documents that he would like to share.\n\n**Public Figures**\n\nPentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg called Snowden's release of NSA material the most significant leak in U.S. history. Oliver Stone said that Snowden should be pardoned, calling him a \"patriot above all\" and suggesting that he should run the NSA himself.\n\n**Government Officials**\n\nNumerous high-ranking current or former U.S. government officials reacted publicly to Snowden's disclosures.\n\n**Debate**\n\nThe debate on Snowden's actions precipitated an intense debate on privacy and warrantless domestic surveillance.

subject of several books, films, and documentaries.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Edward_Snowden\" following this outline:\n\n\nPersonal life\nEdward Joseph

Snowden began work as a contractor for Dell, [55] which manages computer systems for multiple government agencies Assigned to an NSA facility at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo, Snowden instructed top officials and military officers on how to defend their networks from Chinese hackers [28] Snowden looked into mass surveillance in China which prompted him to investigate and then expose Washington's mass surveillance program after he was asked in 2009 to brief a conference in Tokyo [56]\n\n\nNSA sub-contractor as an employee at Booz Allen Hamilton\nOn March 15, 2013—three days after what he later called his \"breaking point\" of \"seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress\" [59]—Snowden quit his job at Dell [60] Although he has said his career high annual salary was $200,000, [61] Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, [61] where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the NSA's worldwide surveillance activity [62]\n\n\nWhistleblower status\nSnowden has described himself as a whistleblower, [75] a description used by many sources, including CNBC, [76] The New Yorker, [77] Reuters, [78] and The Guardian, [79] among others [80] [81] [82] The term has both informal and legal meanings.\n\n\nSurveillance disclosures\nThe exact size of Snowden's disclosure is unknown, [93] but Australian officials have estimated 15,000 or more Australian intelligence files [94] and British officials estimate at least 58,000 British intelligence files were included [95] NSA Director Keith Alexander initially estimated that Snowden had copied anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 NSA documents [96] Later estimates provided by U.S officials were in the order of 1.7 million, [97] a number that originally came from Department of Defense talking points [98] In July 2014, The Washington Post reported on a cache previously provided by Snowden from domestic NSA operations consisting of \"roughly 160,000 intercepted e-mail and instant-message conversations, some of them hundreds of pages long, and 7,900 documents taken from more than 11,000 online accounts.\" [99] A DIA report declassified in June 2015 said that Snowden took 900,000 Department of Defense files, more than he downloaded from the NSA [98]\n\n\nSize and scope of disclosures\nThe exact size of Snowden's disclosure is unknown, [93] but Australian officials have estimated 15,000 or more Australian intelligence files [94] and British officials estimate at least 58,000 British intelligence files were included [95] NSA Director Keith Alexander initially estimated that Snowden had copied anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 NSA documents [96] Later estimates provided by U.S officials were in the order of

[99] A DIA report declassified in June 2015 said that Snowden took 900,000 Department of Defense files, more than he downloaded from the NSA [98]\n\n\nPotential impact on U.S. national security\nIn March 2014, Army General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee, \"The vast majority of the documents that Snowden .. exfiltrated from our highest levels of security .. had nothing to do with exposing government oversight of domestic activities The vast majority of those were related to our military capabilities, operations, tactics, techniques, and procedures.\" [100] When asked in a May 2014 interview to quantify the number of documents Snowden stole, retired NSA director Keith Alexander said there was no accurate way of counting what he took, but Snowden may have downloaded more than a million documents [101] The September 15, 2016 HPSCI report [92] estimated the number of downloaded documents at 1.5 million.\n\n\nRelease of NSA documents\nSnowden's decision to leak NSA documents developed gradually following his March 2007 posting as a technician to the Geneva CIA station [111] Snowden later made contact with Glenn Greenwald, a journalist working at The Guardian [112] He contacted Greenwald anonymously as \"Cincinnatus\" [113] [114] and said he had sensitive documents that he would like to share [115] Greenwald found the measures that the source asked him to take to secure their communications, such as encrypting email, too annoying to employ Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras in January 2013 [116] According to Poitras, Snowden chose to contact her after seeing her New York Times article about NSA whistleblower William Binney [117] What originally attracted Snowden to Greenwald and Poitras was a Salon article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras's controversial films had made her a target of the government [115]\n\n\nPublication\nOn May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong, [122] where he was staying when the initial articles based on the leaked documents were published, [123] beginning with The Guardian on June 5 [124] Greenwald later said Snowden disclosed 9,000 to 10,000 documents [125]\n\n\nRevelations\nThe ongoing publication of leaked documents has revealed previously unknown details of a global surveillance apparatus run by the NSA [133] in close cooperation with three of its four Five Eyes partners: Australia's ASD, [134] the UK's GCHQ, [135] and Canada's CSEC [136]\n\n\nMotivations\nSnowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms [6] After the disclosures, his identity was made public by The Guardian at his request on June 9, 2013 [118] \"I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,\" he said \"My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.\" [122]\n\n\nSimilarities to previous espionage incidents\nSnowden's disclosure, association with foreign intelligence services and subsequent public relations campaign and flight to avoid prosecution is similar in nature to the case of Philip Agee, a former CIA case officer and alleged spy for Russian and Cuban Intelligence during the 1970s and Kim Philby, a former British intelligence officer.\n\n\nNew Zealand\nSnowden made a number of claims about the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) of New Zealand He accused the agency of conducting surveillance on New Zealand citizens and engaging in espionage between 2008 and 2016, when John Key served as the Prime Minister of New Zealand [188] [189]\n\n\nFlight from the United States\nIn May 2013, Snowden quit his job, telling his supervisors he required epilepsy treatment, but instead fled the United States for Hong Kong on May 10 He chose Hong Kong for its \"spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent\" at the time [11] [190] Snowden remained in his room at the Mira Hotel after his arrival in the city, rarely going out [191]\n\n\nHong Kong\nIn May 2013, Snowden quit his job, telling his supervisors he required epilepsy treatment, but instead fled the United States for Hong Kong on May 10 He chose Hong Kong for its \"spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent\" at the time [11] [190] Snowden remained in his room at the Mira Hotel after his arrival in the city, rarely going out [191]\n\n\nRussia\nOn June 23, 2013, Snowden landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport [221] WikiLeaks said he was on a circuitous but safe route to asylum in Ecuador [222] Snowden had a seat reserved to continue to Cuba [223] but did not board that onward flight, saying in a January 2014 interview that he intended to transit through Russia but was stopped en route He said \"a planeload of reporters documented the seat I was supposed to be in\" when he was ticketed for Havana, but the U.S canceled his passport [201] He said the U.S wanted him to stay in Moscow so \"they could say, 'He's a Russian spy.'\" [72] Greenwald's account differed on the point of Snowden being already ticketed According to Greenwald, Snowden's passport was valid when he departed Hong Kong but was revoked during the hours he was in transit to Moscow, preventing him from obtaining a ticket to leave Russia Greenwald said Snowden was thus forced to stay in Moscow and seek asylum [224]\n\n\nMorales plane incident\nOn July 1, 2013, president Evo Morales of Bolivia, who had been attending a conference in Russia, suggested during an interview with RT (formerly Russia Today) that he would consider a request by Snowden for asylum [240] The following day, Morales's plane, en route to La Paz, was rerouted to Austria and landed there, after France, Spain, and Italy denied access to their airspace While the plane was parked in Vienna, the Spanish ambassador to Austria arrived with two embassy personnel and asked to search the plane but they were denied permission by Morales himself [241] U.S officials had raised suspicions that Snowden may have been on board [242] Morales blamed the U.S for putting pressure on European countries and said that the grounding of his plane was a violation of international law [243]\n\n\nAsylum applications\nSnowden applied for political asylum to 21 countries [246] [247] A statement attributed to him contended that the U.S administration, and specifically then–Vice President Joe Biden, had pressured the governments to refuse his asylum petitions Biden had telephoned Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa days prior to Snowden's remarks, asking the Ecuadorian leader not to grant Snowden asylum [248] Ecuador had initially offered Snowden a temporary travel document but later withdrew it, [249] and Correa later called the offer a mistake [250]\n\n\nEric Holder letter to Russian Justice Minister\nIn a letter to Russian Minister of Justice Aleksandr Konovalov dated July 23, 2013, U.S Attorney General Eric Holder repudiated Snowden's claim to refugee status and offered a limited validity passport good for direct return to the U.S [279] He stated that Snowden would not be subject to torture or the death penalty, and would receive a trial in a civilian court with proper legal counsel [280] The same day, the Russian president's spokesman reiterated that his government would not hand over Snowden, commenting that Putin was not personally involved in the matter and that it was being handled through talks between the FBI and Russia's FSB [281]\n\n\nCriminal charges\nOn June 14, 2013, United States federal prosecutors filed a criminal complaint [282] against Snowden, charging him with three felonies: theft of government property and two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 (18 U S C Sect 792 et seq.; Publ L 65-24) through unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person [5] [279]\n\n\nAnalysis of Criminal Complaint\nStephen P Mulligan and Jennifer K Elsea, Legislative attorneys for the Congressional Research Service, provide a 2017 analysis [283] of the uses of the Espionage Act to prosecute unauthorized disclosures of classified information, based on what was disclosed, to whom, and how; the burden of proof requirements e.g degrees of Mens Rea (guilty mind), and the relationship of such considerations to the First Amendment framework of protections of free speech are also analyzed The analysis includes the charges against Snowden, among several other cases The discussion also covers gaps in the legal framework used to prosecute such cases.\n\n\nSnowden response to Criminal Complaint\n\nSnowden was asked in a January 2014 interview about returning to the U.S to face the charges in court, as Obama had suggested a few days prior Snowden explained why he rejected the request: \n\nCivil lawsuit\nOn September 17, 2019, the United States filed a lawsuit, Civil Action No 1:19-cv-1197-LO-TCB, against Snowden for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and NSA [286]\nThe two-count civil complaint alleged that Snowden had violated prepublication obligations related to the publication of his memoir Permanent Record The complaint listed the publishers Macmillan Publishing Group, LLC d.b.a Henry Holt and Company and Holtzbrink, as relief-defendants [287]\nThe Hon Liam O'Grady, a judge in the Alexandria Division of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found for the United States (Plaintiff) by summary judgment, on both counts of the action [288] The judgment also found that Snowden had been paid speaker honorariums totaling $1.03 million for a series of 56 speeches delivered by video link The effect of the ruling was that the US government can collect the proceeds from his book and speeches and means that Snowden has to relinquish more than $5.2 million earned to a \"constructive trust\", created to transfer the money to the government [14]\n\n\nAsylum in Russia\nOn June 23, 2013, Snowden landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport aboard a commercial Aeroflot flight from Hong Kong [289] [208] [290] After 39 days in the transit section, he left the airport on August 1 and was granted temporary asylum in Russia for one year by the Federal Migration Service [291]\n\n\nPolitical views\nSnowden has said that, in the 2008 United States presidential election, he voted for a third-party candidate; he also said that he \"believed in Obama's promises\" Following the election, he said that Barack Obama was continuing policies instated by George W Bush [309]\n\n\nReaction\nIn response to outrage by European leaders, President Barack Obama said in early July 2013 that all nations collect intelligence, including those expressing outrage His remarks came in response to an article in the German magazine Der Spiegel [314]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn response to outrage by European leaders, President Barack Obama said in early July 2013 that all nations collect intelligence, including those expressing outrage His remarks came in response to an article in the German magazine Der Spiegel [314]\n\n\nBarack Obama\nIn response to outrage by European leaders, President Barack Obama said in early July 2013 that all nations collect intelligence, including those expressing outrage His remarks came in response to an article in the German magazine Der Spiegel [314]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nIn 2013, Donald Trump made a series of tweets in which he referred to Snowden as a \"traitor\", saying he gave \"serious information to China and Russia\" and \"should be executed\" Later that year he added a caveat, tweeting \"if it and he could reveal Obama's  [birth] records, I might become a major fan\" [317]\n\n\nPublic figures\nPentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg called Snowden's release of NSA material the most significant leak in U.S history [321] [322] Shortly before the September 2016 release of his biographical thriller film Snowden, a semi-fictionalized drama based on the life of Edward Snowden with a short appearance by Snowden himself, Oliver Stone said that Snowden should be pardoned, calling him a \"patriot above all\" and suggesting that he should run the NSA himself [323]\n\n\nGovernment officials\nNumerous high-ranking current or former U.S government officials reacted publicly to Snowden's disclosures.\n\n\nDebate\nIn the U.S., Snowden's actions precipitated an intense debate on privacy and warrantless domestic surveillance [338] [339] President Obama was initially dismissive of Snowden, saying \"I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.\" [340] [341] [342] In August 2013, Obama rejected the suggestion that Snowden was a patriot, [343] and in November said that \"the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done, because there was another way of doing it.\" [344]\n\n\nPresidential panel\nIn August 2013, President Obama said that he had called for a review of U.S surveillance activities before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations, [343] and announced that he was directing DNI James Clapper \"to establish a review group on intelligence and communications technologies.\" [352] [353] In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the NSA to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using backdoors in hardware or software [354] Panel member Geoffrey R Stone said there was no evidence that the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any terror attacks [355]\n\n\nCourt rulings (United States)\nOn June 6, 2013, in the wake of Snowden's leaks, conservative public interest lawyer and Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had unlawfully collected metadata for his telephone calls and was harassing him In Klayman v Obama, Judge Richard J Leon referred to the NSA's \"almost-Orwellian technology\" and ruled the bulk telephone metadata program to be likely unconstitutional [356]\nLeon's ruling was stayed pending an appeal by the government.\nSnowden later described Judge Leon's decision as vindication [357]\n\n\nUSA Freedom Act\nOn June 2, 2015, the U.S Senate passed, and President Obama signed, the USA Freedom Act which restored in modified form several provisions of the Patriot Act that had expired the day before, while for the first time imposing some limits on the bulk collection of telecommunication data on U.S citizens by American intelligence agencies The new restrictions were widely seen as stemming from Snowden's revelations [361] [362]\n\n\nEurope\nIn an official report published in October 2015, the United Nations special rapporteur for the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of speech, Professor David Kaye, criticized the U.S government's harsh treatment of, and bringing criminal charges against, whistleblowers, including Edward Snowden The report found that Snowden's revelations were important for people everywhere and made \"a deep and lasting impact on law, policy, and politics.\" [363] [364] The European Parliament invited Snowden to make a pre-recorded video appearance to aid their NSA investigation [365] [366] Snowden gave written testimony in which he said that he was seeking asylum in the EU, but that he was told by European Parliamentarians that the U.S would not allow EU partners to make such an offer [367] He told the Parliament that the NSA was working with the security agencies of EU states to \"get access to as much data of EU citizens as possible.\" [368] He said that the NSA's Foreign Affairs Division lobbies the EU and other countries to change their laws, allowing for \"everyone in the country\" to be spied on legally [369]\n\n\nAustria, Italy and Switzerland\nSnowden applied for asylum in Austria, [370] Italy [371] and Switzerland [372] [373] [374]\nSnowden, speaking to a Geneva, Switzerland audience via video link from Moscow, said he would love to return to Geneva, where he had previously worked undercover for the CIA Swiss media said that the Swiss Attorney General had determined that Switzerland would not extradite Snowden if the US request were considered \"politically motivated\" Switzerland would grant Snowden asylum if he revealed the extent of espionage activities by the United States government According to the paper Sonntags Zeitung, Snowden would be granted safe entry and residency in Switzerland, in return for his knowledge of American intelligence activities Swiss paper Le Matin reported that Snowden's activity could be part of criminal proceedings or part of a parliamentary inquiry.\n\n\nFrance\nOn September 16, 2019, it was reported that Snowden had said he \"would love\" to get political asylum in France [375]\nSnowden first applied unsuccessfully for asylum in France in 2013, under then French President François Hollande His second request, under President Emmanuel Macron, was favorably received by Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet However, no other members of the French government were known to express support for Snowden's asylum request, possibly due to the potential adverse diplomatic consequences.\n\n\nGermany\nHans-Georg Maaßen, head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's domestic security agency, speculated that Snowden could have been working for the Russian government [376] [377] Snowden rejected this insinuation, [378] speculating on Twitter in German that \"it cannot be proven if Maaßen is an agent of the SVR or FSB.\" [379]\nOn October 31, 2013, Snowden met with German Green Party lawmaker Hans-Christian Ströbele in Moscow to discuss the possibility of Snowden giving testimony in Germany [380]\nAt the meeting, Snowden gave Ströbele a letter to the German government, parliament, and federal Attorney-General, the details of which were to later be made public.\nGermany later blocked Snowden from testifying in person in an NSA inquiry, citing a potential grave strain on US-German relations [381]\n\n\nNordic countries\nThe FBI demanded that Nordic countries arrest Snowden should he visit their countries [382] Snowden made asylum requests to Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark [246] All requests were ultimately denied, with varying degrees of severity in the response.\nAccording to Finnish foreign ministry spokeswoman Tytti Pylkkö, Snowden made an asylum request to Finland by sending an application to the Finnish embassy in Moscow while he was confined to the transit area of the Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow, but was told that Finnish law required him to be on Finnish soil [383]\nAccording to SVT News, Snowden met with three Swedish MP's; Matthias Sundin (L), Jakop Dalunde (MP) and Cecilia Magnusson (M), in Moscow, to discuss his views on mass surveillance [384]\nThe meeting was organized by the Right Livelihood Award Foundation, which awarded Snowden the Right Livelihood Honorary Award, [385] often called Sweden's \"Alternative Nobel Prize\" According to the foundation, the prize was for Snowden's work on press freedom Sweden ultimately rejected Snowden's asylum, however, so the award was accepted by his father, Lon Snowden, on his behalf.\n\n\nLatin and South America\nSupport for Snowden came from Latin and South American leaders including the Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, Bolivian President Evo Morales, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega [391] [392]\n\n\nGlobal community\nCrediting the Snowden leaks, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted Resolution 68/167 in December 2013 The non-binding resolution denounced unwarranted digital surveillance and included a symbolic declaration of the right of all individuals to online privacy [393] [394] [395]\n\n\nPublic opinion polls\nSurveys conducted by news outlets and professional polling organizations found that American public opinion was divided on Snowden's disclosures and that those polled in Canada and Europe were more supportive of Snowden than respondents in the U.S., although more Americans have grown more supportive of Snowden's disclosure In Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, more than 80% of people familiar with Snowden view him positively [397]\n\n\nRecognition\nFor his global surveillance disclosures, Snowden has been honored by publications and organizations based in Europe and the United States He was voted as The Guardian's person of the year 2013, garnering four times the number of votes as any other candidate [398]\n\n\nTeleconference speaking engagements\nIn March 2014, Snowden spoke at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive technology conference in Austin, Texas, in front of 3,500 attendees He participated by teleconference carried over multiple routers running the Google Hangouts platform On-stage moderators were Christopher Soghoian and Snowden's legal counsel Wizner, both from the ACLU [399] Snowden said that the NSA was \"setting fire to the future of the internet,\" and that the SXSW audience was \"the firefighters\" [400] [401] [402] Attendees could use Twitter to send questions to Snowden, who answered one by saying that information gathered by corporations was much less dangerous than that gathered by a government agency, because \"governments have the power to deprive you of your rights.\" [400] Then-Representative Mike Pompeo (R-KS) of the House Intelligence Committee, later director of the CIA and secretary of state, had tried unsuccessfully to get the SXSW management to cancel Snowden's appearance; instead, SXSW director Hugh Forrest said that the NSA was welcome to respond to Snowden at the 2015 conference [400]\n\n\nThe \"Snowden effect\"\nIn July 2013, media critic Jay Rosen defined the \"Snowden effect\" as \"Direct and indirect gains in public knowledge from the cascade of events and further reporting that followed Edward Snowden's leaks of classified information about the surveillance state in the U.S.\" [422] In December 2013, The Nation wrote that Snowden had sparked an overdue debate about national security and individual privacy [423] In Forbes, the effect was seen to have nearly united the U.S Congress in opposition to the massive post-9/11 domestic intelligence gathering system [424] In its Spring 2014 Global Attitudes Survey, the Pew Research Center found that Snowden's disclosures had tarnished the image of the United States, especially in Europe and Latin America [425]\n\n\nJewel v. NSA\nOn November 2, 2018, Snowden provided a court declaration in Jewel v National Security Agency, confirming that a document relied upon in the case, discussing the mass surveillance program known as Stellar Wind, is actually the same document that he came upon during the course of his employment as an NSA contractor [426] [427] [428]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Stalin viewed parliamentary process as a waste of time [53] In April 1906, Stalin attended the RSDLP's Fourth Congress in Stockholm, where the party—then led by its Menshevik majority—agreed that it would not raise funds using armed robbery [54] Lenin and Stalin disagreed with this, [55] and privately discussed continuing the robberies for the Bolshevik cause [56]\n\n1912–1917: Rise to the Central Committee and Pravda\nIn January 1912, the first Bolshevik Central Committee was elected at the Prague Conference [78] Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev decided to co-opt Stalin to the committee, which Stalin (still in exile in Vologda) agreed to [78] [79] Lenin believed that Stalin, as a Georgian, would help secure support from the empire's minority ethnicities [80] In February 1912, Stalin again escaped to Saint Petersburg, [81] where he was tasked with converting the Bolshevik weekly newspaper, Zvezda (\"Star\") into a daily, Pravda (\"Truth\") [82] The new newspaper was launched in April 1912 and Stalin's role as editor was kept secret [83] In May 1912, he was again arrested and sentenced to three years of exile in Siberia [84] In July, he arrived in Narym, [85] where he shared a room with fellow Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov [86] After two months, they escaped to Saint Petersburg, [87] where Stalin continued work on Pravda [88]\n\n\n1917: Russian Revolution\nWhile Stalin was in exile, Russia entered the First World War, and in October 1916 he and other exiled Bolsheviks were conscripted into the Russian Army [99] They arrived in Krasnoyarsk in February 1917, [100] where a medical examiner ruled Stalin unfit for service due to his crippled arm [101] Stalin was required to serve four more months of his exile and successfully requested to serve it in Achinsk [102] Stalin was in the city when the February Revolution took place; the Tsar abdicated and the Empire became a de facto republic [103] In a celebratory mood, Stalin travelled by train to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg had been renamed) in March [104] He assumed control of Pravda alongside Lev Kamenev, [105] and was appointed as a Bolshevik delegate to the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet, an influential workers' council [106]\n\n\nIn Lenin's government\nOn 26 October 1917, Lenin declared himself chairman of the new government, the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) [120] Stalin supported Lenin's decision not to form a coalition with the Socialist Revolutionary Party, although a coalition was formed with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries [121] Stalin became part of an informal leadership group alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov, and his importance within the Bolshevik ranks grew [122] Stalin's office was near Lenin's in the Smolny Institute, [123] and he and Trotsky had direct access to Lenin without an appointment [124] Stalin co-signed Lenin's decrees shutting down hostile newspapers, [125] and co-chaired the committee drafting a constitution for the newly-formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [126] He supported Lenin's formation of the Cheka security service and the Red Terror, arguing that state violence was an effective tool for capitalist powers [127] Unlike some Bolsheviks, Stalin never expressed concern about the Cheka's rapid expansion and the Red Terror [127]\n\n\n1917–1918: People's Commissar for Nationalities\nOn 26 October 1917, Lenin declared himself chairman of the new government, the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) [120] Stalin supported Lenin's decision not to form a coalition with the Socialist Revolutionary Party, although a coalition was formed with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries [121] Stalin became part of an informal leadership group alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov, and his importance within the Bolshevik ranks grew [122] Stalin's office was near Lenin's in the Smolny Institute, [123] and he and Trotsky had direct access to Lenin without an appointment [124] Stalin co-signed Lenin's decrees shutting down hostile newspapers, [125] and co-chaired the committee drafting a constitution for the newly-formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [126] He supported Lenin's formation of the Cheka security service and the Red Terror, arguing that state violence was an effective tool for capitalist powers [127] Unlike some Bolsheviks, Stalin never expressed concern about the Cheka's rapid expansion and the Red Terror [127]\n\n\n1918–1921: Military command\nIn May 1918, during the intensifying Russian Civil War, Sovnarkom sent Stalin to Tsaritsyn to take charge of food procurement in Southern Russia [140] Eager to prove himself as a commander, [141] he took control of regional military operations and befriended Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, who later formed the core of his military support base [142] Stalin sent large numbers of Red Army troops to battle the region's White armies, resulting in heavy losses and drawing Lenin's concern [143] In Tsaritsyn, Stalin commanded the local Cheka branch to execute suspected counter-revolutionaries, often without trial, [144] and purged the military and food collection agencies of middle-class specialists, whom were also executed [145] His use of state violence was at a greater scale than most Bolshevik leaders approved of, [146] for instance, he ordered several villages torched to ensure compliance with his food procurement program [147]\n\n\n1921–1924: Lenin's final years\nThe Soviet government sought to bring neighbouring states under its domination; in February 1921 it invaded the Menshevik-governed Georgia, [168] and in April 1921, Stalin ordered the Red Army into Turkestan to reassert Soviet control [169] As People's Commissar for Nationalities, Stalin believed that each ethnic group had the right to an \"autonomous republic\" within the Russian state in which it could oversee various regional affairs [170] In taking this view, some Marxists accused him of bending too much to bourgeois nationalism, while others accused him of remaining too Russo-centric [171] In his diverse native Caucasus, however, Stalin opposed the idea of separate autonomous republics, arguing that these would oppress ethnic minorities within their territories; instead, he called for a Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic [172] The Georgian Communist Party opposed the idea, resulting in the Georgian affair [173] In mid-1921, Stalin returned to the South Caucasus, calling on Georgian communists to reject the chauvinistic nationalism which he argued had marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities [174] In March 1921, Nadezhda gave birth to another of Stalin's sons, Vasily [175]\n\n\nConsolidation of power\nUpon Lenin's death in January 1924, [193] Stalin took charge of the funeral and was a pallbearer [194] To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist amid his growing personality cult, Stalin gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the Foundations of Leninism, later published in book form [195] At the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, Lenin's Testament was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations [196] Embarrassed by its contents, Stalin offered his resignation as General Secretary; this act of humility saved him, and he was retained in the post [197]\n\n\n1924–1928: Succeeding Lenin\nUpon Lenin's death in January 1924, [193] Stalin took charge of the funeral and was a pallbearer [194] To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist amid his growing personality cult, Stalin gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the Foundations of Leninism, later published in book form [195] At the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, Lenin's Testament was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations [196] Embarrassed by its contents, Stalin offered his resignation as General Secretary; this act of humility saved him, and he was retained in the post [197]\n\n\n1928–1932: First five-year plan\nWe have fallen behind the advanced countries by fifty to a hundred years We must close that gap in ten years Either we do this or we'll be crushed.\n\n\nEconomic policy\nWe have fallen behind the advanced countries by fifty to a hundred years We must close that gap in ten years Either we do this or we'll be crushed.\n\n\nCultural and foreign policy\nIn 1928, Stalin declared that class war between the proletariat and their enemies would intensify as socialism developed [265] He warned of a \"danger from the right\", including from within the Communist Party [266] The first major show trial in the USSR was the Shakhty Trial of 1928, in which middle-class \"industrial specialists\" were convicted of sabotage [267] From 1929 to 1930, show trials were held to intimidate opposition; [268] these included the Industrial Party Trial, Menshevik Trial, and Metro-Vickers Trial [269] Aware that the ethnic Russian majority may have concerns about being ruled by a Georgian, [270] he promoted ethnic Russians throughout the state bureaucracy and made Russian compulsory in schools, albeit in tandem with local languages [271] Nationalist sentiment was suppressed [272] Conservative social policies were promoted to boost population growth; this included a focus on strong family units, re-criminalisation of homosexuality, restrictions on abortion and divorce, and abolition of the Zhenotdel women's department [273]\n\n\n1932–1939: Major crises\nWithin the Soviet Union, civic disgruntlement against Stalin's government was widespread [295] Social unrest in urban areas led Stalin to ease some economic policies in 1932 [296] In May 1932, he introduced kolkhoz markets where peasants could trade surplus produce [297] However, penal sanctions became harsher; a decree in August 1932 made the theft of a handful of grain a capital offence [298] The second five-year plan reduced production quotas from the first, focusing more on improving living conditions [296] through housing and consumer goods [296] Emphasis on armament production increased after Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933 [299]\n\n\nFamine of 1932–1933\nWithin the Soviet Union, civic disgruntlement against Stalin's government was widespread [295] Social unrest in urban areas led Stalin to ease some economic policies in 1932 [296] In May 1932, he introduced kolkhoz markets where peasants could trade surplus produce [297] However, penal sanctions became harsher; a decree in August 1932 made the theft of a handful of grain a capital offence [298] The second five-year plan reduced production quotas from the first, focusing more on improving living conditions [296] through housing and consumer goods [296] Emphasis on armament production increased after Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933 [299]\n\n\nIdeological and foreign affairs\nIn 1936, Stalin oversaw the adoption of a new constitution with expansive democratic features; it was designed as propaganda, as all power rested in his hands [312] He declared that \"socialism, the first phase of communism, has been achieved\" [312] In 1938, the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) was released; [313] commonly known as the \"Short Course\", it became the central text of Stalinism [314] Authorised Stalin biographies were also published, [315] though Stalin preferred to be viewed as the embodiment of the Communist Party, rather than have his life story explored [316]\n\n\nGreat Purge\nStalin's approach to state repression was often contradictory [329] In May 1933, he released many convicted of minor offences, ordering the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations, [330] and in September 1934, he launched a commission to investigate false imprisonments That same month, he called for the execution of workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Japan [329] [330] After Sergei Kirov was murdered in December 1934, Stalin became increasingly concerned about assassination threats, [331] and state repression intensified [332] Stalin issued a decree establishing NKVD troikas which could issue rapid and severe sentences without involving the courts [333] In 1935, he ordered the NKVD to expel suspected counterrevolutionaries from urban areas; [299] over 11,000 were expelled from Leningrad alone in early 1935 [299]\n\n\nWorld War II\nAs a Marxist–Leninist, Stalin considered conflict between competing capitalist powers inevitable; after Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, he recognised a major war was looming [364] He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and the United Kingdom would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe [365] The Soviets also faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese in the latter part of the 1930s, culminating in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939 [366] Stalin initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling in total size between January 1939 and June 1941, although in its haste to expand many of its officers were poorly trained [367] Between 1940 and 1941 Stalin also purged the military, leaving it with a severe shortage of trained officers when war later broke out [368]\n\n\n1939–1941: Pact with Nazi Germany\nAs a Marxist–Leninist, Stalin considered conflict between competing capitalist powers inevitable; after Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, he recognised a major war was looming [364] He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and the United Kingdom would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe [365] The Soviets also faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese in the latter part of the 1930s, culminating in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939 [366] Stalin initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling in total size between January 1939 and June 1941, although in its haste to expand many of its officers were poorly trained [367] Between 1940 and 1941 Stalin also purged the military, leaving it with a severe shortage of trained officers when war later broke out [368]\n\n\n1941–1942: German invasion\nIn June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, initiating the war on the Eastern Front [390] Despite intelligence agencies repeatedly warning him of Germany's intentions, Stalin was taken by surprise [391] He formed a State Defence Committee, which he headed as Supreme Commander, [392] as well as a military Supreme Command (Stavka), [393] with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff [394] The German tactic of blitzkrieg was initially highly effective; the Soviet air force in the western borderlands was destroyed within two days [395] The German Wehrmacht pushed deep into Soviet territory; [396] soon, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and the Baltic states were under German occupation, and Leningrad was under siege; [397] and Soviet refugees were flooding into Moscow and surrounding cities [398] By July, Germany's Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow, [397] and by October the Wehrmacht was amassing for a full assault on the capital Plans were made for the Soviet government to evacuate to Kuibyshev, although Stalin decided to remain in Moscow, believing his flight would damage troop morale [399] The German advance on Moscow was halted after two months of battle in increasingly harsh weather conditions [400]\n\n\n1942–1945: Soviet counter-attack\nBy November 1942, the Soviets had begun to repulse the German southern campaign and, although there were 2.5 million Soviet casualties in that effort, it permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front [427] In summer 1943, Germany attempted an encirclement attack at Kursk, which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets [428] By the end of the year, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans to that point [429] Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after Stalin had moved factories well to the east of the front, safe from invasion and aerial assault [430]\n\n\n1945: Victory\nIn April 1945, the Red Army seized Berlin, Hitler killed himself, and Germany surrendered in May [455] Stalin had wanted Hitler captured alive; he had his remains brought to Moscow in order to prevent them becoming a relic for Nazi sympathisers [456] Many Soviet soldiers engaged in looting, pillaging, and rape, both in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe [457] Stalin refused to punish the offenders [454] With Germany defeated, Stalin switched focus to the war with Japan, transferring half a million troops to the Far East [458] Stalin was pressed by his allies to enter the war and wanted to cement the Soviet Union's strategic position in Asia [459] On 8 August, in between the U.S atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria and northern Korea, defeating the Kwantung Army [460] These events led to the Japanese surrender and the war's end [461] The U.S rebuffed Stalin's desire for the Red Army to take a role in the Allied occupation of Japan [462]\n\n\nPost-war era\nAfter the war, Stalin was at the apex of his career [466] Within the Soviet Union he was widely regarded as the embodiment of victory and patriotism, [467] and his armies controlled Central and Eastern Europe up to the River Elbe [466] In June 1945, Stalin adopted the title of Generalissimo [468] and stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square [469] At a banquet held for army commanders, he described the Russian people as \"the outstanding nation\" and \"leading force\" within the Soviet Union, the first time that he had unequivocally endorsed Russians over the other Soviet nationalities [470] In 1946, the state published Stalin's Collected Works [471] In 1947, it brought out a second edition of his official biography, which glorified him to a greater extent than its predecessor [472] He was quoted in Pravda on a daily basis and pictures of him remained pervasive on the walls of workplaces and homes [473]\n\n\n1945–1947: Post-war reconstruction\nAfter the war, Stalin was at the apex of his career [466] Within the Soviet Union he was widely regarded as the embodiment of victory and patriotism, [467] and his armies controlled Central and Eastern Europe up to the River Elbe [466] In June 1945, Stalin adopted the title of Generalissimo [468] and stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square [469] At a banquet held for army commanders, he described the Russian people as \"the outstanding nation\" and \"leading force\" within the Soviet Union, the first time that he had unequivocally endorsed Russians over the other Soviet nationalities [470] In 1946, the state published Stalin's Collected Works [471] In 1947, it brought out a second edition of his official biography, which glorified him to a greater extent than its predecessor [472] He was quoted in Pravda on a daily basis and pictures of him remained pervasive on the walls of workplaces and homes [473]\n\n\n1947–1950: Cold War policy\nIn the aftermath of the war, the British Empire declined, leaving the U.S and USSR as the dominant world powers [496] Tensions among these former Allies grew, [467] resulting in the Cold War [497] Although Stalin publicly described the British and U.S governments as aggressive, he thought it unlikely that a war with them would be imminent, believing that several decades of peace was likely [498] He nevertheless secretly intensified Soviet research into nuclear weaponry, intent on creating an atom bomb [466] Still, Stalin foresaw the undesirability of a nuclear conflict, stating that \"atomic weapons can hardly be used without spelling the end of the world.\" [499] He personally took a keen interest in the development of the weapon [500] In August 1949, the bomb was successfully tested in the deserts outside Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan [501] Stalin also initiated a new military build-up; the Soviet army was expanded from 2.9 million soldiers, as it stood in 1949, to 5.8 million by 1953 [502]\n\n\nEastern Bloc\nAfter the war, Stalin sought to retain Soviet dominance across Eastern Europe while expanding its influence in Asia [446] Cautiously regarding the responses from the Western Allies, Stalin avoided immediately installing Communist Party governments in Eastern Europe, instead initially ensuring that Marxist-Leninists were placed in coalition ministries [507] In contrast to his approach to the Baltic states, he rejected the proposal of merging the new communist states into the Soviet Union, rather recognising them as independent nation-states [513] He was faced with the problem that there were few Marxists left in Eastern Europe, with most having been killed by the Nazis [514] He demanded that war reparations be paid by Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic [467] Aware that the countries of Eastern Europe had been pushed to socialism through invasion rather than revolution, Stalin called them  \"people's democracies\" instead of \"dictatorships of the proletariat\" [515]\n\n\nAsia\nIn October 1949, Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took power in China and proclaimed the People's Republic of China [528] Marxist governments now controlled a third of the world's land mass [529] Privately, Stalin revealed that he had underestimated the Chinese Communists and their ability to win the civil war, instead encouraging them to make another peace with the KMT [530] In December 1949, Mao visited Stalin Initially Stalin refused to repeal the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945, which significantly benefited the Soviet Union over China, although in January 1950 he relented and agreed to sign a new treaty [531] Stalin was concerned that Mao might follow Tito's example by pursuing a course independent of Soviet influence, and made it known that if displeased he would withdraw assistance; the Chinese desperately needed said assistance after decades of civil war [532]\n\n\n1950–1953: Final years\nIn his later years, Stalin was in poor health [548] He took increasingly long holidays; in 1950 and again in 1951 he spent almost five months on holiday at his Abkhazian dacha [549] Stalin nevertheless mistrusted his doctors; in January 1952 he had one imprisoned after they suggested that he should retire to improve his health [548] In September 1952, several Kremlin doctors were arrested for allegedly plotting to kill senior politicians in what came to be known as the doctors' plot; the majority of the accused were Jewish [550] Stalin ordered that the doctors be tortured to ensure confessions [551] In November, the Slánský trial took place in Czechoslovakia, in which 13 senior Communist Party figures, 11 of them Jewish, were accused and convicted of being part of a vast Zionist-American conspiracy to subvert the Eastern Bloc [552] The same month, a much publicised trial of accused Jewish industrial wreckers took place in Ukraine [553] In 1951, Stalin initiated the Mingrelian affair, a purge of the Georgian Communist Party which resulted in over 11,000 deportations [554]\n\n\nDeath, funeral and aftermath\nOn 1 March 1953, Stalin's staff found him semi-conscious on the bedroom floor of his Kuntsevo Dacha [561] He was moved onto a couch and remained there for three days, [562] during which he was hand-fed using a spoon and given various medicines and injections [563] Stalin's condition continued to deteriorate, and he died on 5 March [564] An autopsy revealed that he had died of a cerebral haemorrhage, and that his cerebral arteries had been severely damaged by atherosclerosis [565] Stalin's death was announced on 6 March; [566] his body was embalmed, [567] and then displayed in Moscow's House of Unions for three days [568] The crowds coming to view the body were so large and disorganised that many people were killed in a crowd crush [569] At the funeral on 9 March, attended by hundreds of thousands, Stalin was laid to rest in Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square [570]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nStalin claimed to have embraced Marxism at the age of 15, [581] and it served as the guiding philosophy throughout his adult life; [582] according to Kotkin, Stalin held \"zealous Marxist convictions\", [583] while Montefiore suggested that Marxism held a \"quasi-religious\" value for Stalin [584] Although he never became a Georgian nationalist, [585] during his early life elements from Georgian nationalist thought blended with Marxism in his outlook [586] Stalin believed in the need to adapt Marxism to changing circumstances; in 1917, he declared that \"there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism I stand on the ground of the latter\" [587] According to scholar Robert Service, Stalin's \"few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism\" [582]\n\n\nPersonal life and characteristics\nEthnically Georgian, [606] Stalin grew up speaking the Georgian language, [607] and did not begin learning Russian until age eight or nine [608] It has been argued that his ancestry was genetically Ossetian, but he never acknowledged an Ossetian identity [609] He remained proud of his Georgian identity, [610] and throughout his life retained a heavy Georgian accent when speaking Russian [611] [612] Some colleagues described him as \"Asiatic\", and he supposedly said that \"I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian\" [613]\n\n\nPersonality\nTrotsky and several other Soviet figures promoted the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity, [630] a characterisation which gained widespread acceptance outside of the Soviet Union during his lifetime [631] However, historians note that he possessed a complex mind, [632] remarkable self-control, [633] and excellent memory [634] Stalin was a diligent worker [635] and an effective and strategic organiser, [636] with a keen interest in learning [637] As a leader, he meticulously scrutinised details, from film scripts to military plans, [638] and judged others by their inner strength and cleverness [639] He was skilled at playing different roles depending on the audience, [640] as well as in deception [641]  Although he could be rude, [642] Stalin rarely raised his voice; [643] however, as his health deteriorated, he became unpredictable and bad-tempered [644] He could be charming and enjoyed cracking jokes when relaxed [637] At social events, Stalin encouraged singing and drinking, hoping others would drunkenly reveal secrets to him [645]\n\n\nRelationships and family\nStalin married his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in 1906 Volkogonov suggested that she was \"probably the one human being he had really loved\" [667] When she died, Stalin allegedly said: \"This creature softened my heart of stone She died and with her died my last warm feelings for humanity.\" [668] They had a son, Yakov, who frequently frustrated and annoyed Stalin [669] After Yakov was captured by the German Army during World War II, Stalin refused to agree to a prisoner exchange between him and German field marshal Friedrich Paulus, and Yakov died at a Nazi concentration camp in 1943 [670]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe historian Robert Conquest stated that Stalin perhaps \"determined the course of the twentieth century\" more than any other individual [688] Leninists remain divided in their views on Stalin; some view him as Lenin's authentic successor, while others believe he betrayed Lenin's ideas by deviating from them [605] For most Westerners and anti-communist Russians, he is viewed overwhelmingly negatively as a mass murderer; [689] for significant numbers of Russians and Georgians, he is regarded as a great statesman and state-builder [689] The historian Dmitri Volkogonov characterised him as \"one of the most powerful figures in human history.\" [690]\n\n\nDeath toll\nBefore the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the archival revelations, some Western historians estimated that the numbers killed by Stalin's regime were 20 million or higher [714] [715] [716] The scholarly consensus affirms that Soviet archival materials declassified in 1991 contain irrefutable data much lower than Western sources used prior to 1991, such as statements from emigres and other informants [717]\n\n\nIn the Soviet Union and post-Soviet states\nShortly after his death, the Soviet Union went through a period of de-Stalinisation Malenkov denounced the Stalin personality cult, [729] and the cult was subsequently criticised in Pravda [730] In 1956, Khrushchev gave his \"Secret Speech\", titled \"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\", to a closed session of the Party's 20th Congress There, Khrushchev denounced Stalin for both his mass repression and his personality cult [731] He repeated these denunciations at the 22nd Party Congress in October 1962 [732] In October 1961, Stalin's body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, the location marked by a bust [733] Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd that year [734]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nAcademic books and journals\n\n\nMagazines, newspapers and websites\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Joseph Stalin\n\nJoseph Stalin was born on 18 December 1878 in Gori, Georgia, then part of the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire. He was an ethnic Georgian and his birth name was Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili. His parents were Besarion Jughashvili and Ekaterine Geladze. Stalin was their only child to survive past infancy.\n\n## Early Life\n\nAfter Besarion's shoemaking workshop went into decline, the family fell into poverty, and he became an alcoholic who beat his wife and son. Ekaterine and Stalin left the home by 1883 and began wandering, moving through nine different rented rooms over the next decade. In 1888, Stalin enrolled at the Gori Church School in a position secured by a family friend, where he excelled academically. He faced health problems: an 1884 smallpox infection left him with facial scars, and at age 12 he was seriously injured when he was struck by a phaeton, causing a lifelong disability in his left arm.\n\n## 1878–1899: Childhood to young adulthood\n\nStalin was born on 18 December 1878 in Gori, Georgia, then part of the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire. He was an ethnic Georgian and his birth name was Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili. His parents were Besarion Jughashvili and Ekaterine Geladze. Stalin was their only child to survive past infancy. After Besarion's shoemaking workshop went into decline, the family fell into poverty, and he became an alcoholic who beat his wife and son.

In 1888, Stalin enrolled at the Gori Church School in a position secured by a family friend, where he excelled academically. He faced health problems: an 1884 smallpox infection left him with facial scars, and at age 12 he was seriously injured when he was struck by a phaeton, causing a lifelong disability in his left arm.\n\n## 1899–1905: Russian Social Democratic Labour Party\n\nIn October 1899, Stalin began working as a meteorologist at the Tiflis observatory. He attracted a group of socialist supporters and co-organised a secret workers' meeting at which he convinced many to take strike action on May Day 1900. The empire's secret police, the Okhrana, became aware of Stalin's activities and attempted to arrest him in March 1901, but he went into hiding and began living off donations from friends. He helped plan a demonstration in Tiflis on May Day 1901 at which 3,000 marchers clashed with the authorities. In November 1901, Stalin was elected to the Tiflis Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), a Marxist party founded in 1898.\n\n## 1905–1912: Revolution of 1905 and aftermath\n\nIn January 1905, government troops massacred protesters in Saint Petersburg and unrest spread across the Empire in the Revolution of 1905. Stalin was in Baku when ethnic violence broke out between Armenians and Azeris, and he formed Bolshevik \"battle squads\" which he used to keep the city's warring ethnic factions apart. His armed squads also attacked local police and troops, raided arsenals, and raised funds via protection rackets on large local businesses and mines. In November 1905, the Georgian Bolsheviks elected Stalin as one of their delegates to a Bolshevik conference in Tampere, Finland, where he met Lenin for the first time.\n\n## 1912–1917: Rise to the Central Committee and Pravda\n\nIn January 1912, the first Bolshevik Central Committee was elected at the Prague Conference. Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev decided to co-opt Stalin to the committee, which Stalin (still in exile in Vologda) agreed to. Lenin believed that Stalin, as a Georgian, would help secure support from the empire's minority ethnicities. In February 1912, Stalin again escaped to Saint Petersburg, where he was tasked with converting the Bolshevik weekly newspaper, Zvezda (\"Star\") into a daily, Pravda (\"Truth\"). The new newspaper was launched in April 1912 and Stalin's role as editor was kept secret. In May 1912, he was again arrested and sentenced to three years of exile in Siberia.\n\n## 1917: Russian Revolution\n\nWhile Stalin was in exile, Russia entered the First World War, and in October 1916 he and other exiled Bolsheviks were conscripted into the Russian Army. They arrived in Krasnoyarsk in February 1917, where a medical examiner ruled Stalin unfit for service due to his crippled arm. Stalin was required to serve four more months of his exile and successfully requested to serve it in Achinsk. Stalin was in the city when the February Revolution took place; the Tsar abdicated and the Empire became a de facto republic. In a celebratory mood, Stalin travelled by train to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg had been renamed) in March. He assumed control of Pravda alongside Lev Kamenev and was appointed as a Bolshevik delegate to the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet, an influential workers' council.\n\n## 1917–1918: People's Commissar for Nationalities\n\nOn 26 October 1917, Lenin declared himself chairman of the new government, the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom). Stalin supported Lenin's decision not to form a coalition with the Socialist Revolutionary Party, although a coalition was formed with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. Stalin became part of an informal leadership group alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov, and his importance within the Bolshevik ranks grew. Stalin's office was near Lenin's in the Smolny Institute, and he and Trotsky had direct access to Lenin without an appointment. Stalin co-signed Lenin's decrees shutting down hostile newspapers and co-chaired the committee drafting a constitution for the newly-formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He supported Lenin's formation of the Cheka security service and the Red Terror, arguing that state violence was an effective tool for capitalist powers.\n\n## 1918–1921: Military command\n\nIn May 1918, during the intensifying Russian Civil War, Sovnarkom sent Stalin to Tsaritsyn to take charge of food procurement in Southern Russia. Eager to prove himself as a commander, Stalin took control of regional military operations and befriended Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, who later formed the core of his military support base. Stalin sent large numbers of Red Army troops to battle the region's White armies, resulting in heavy losses and drawing Lenin's concern. In Tsaritsyn, Stalin commanded the local Cheka branch to execute suspected counter-revolutionaries, often without trial, and purged the military and food collection agencies of middle-class specialists, whom were also executed. His use of state violence was at a greater scale than most Bolshevik leaders approved of, for instance, he ordered several villages torched to ensure compliance with his food procurement program.\n\n## 1921–1924: Lenin's final years\n\nThe Soviet government sought to bring neighbouring states under its domination; in February 1921 it invaded the Menshevik-governed Georgia, and in April 1921, Stalin ordered the Red Army into Turkestan to reassert Soviet control. As People's Commissar for Nationalities, Stalin believed that each ethnic group had the right to an \"autonomous republic\" within the Russian state in which it could oversee various regional affairs. In taking this view, some Marxists accused him of bending too much to bourgeois nationalism, while others accused him of remaining too Russo-centric. In mid-1921, Stalin returned to the South Caucasus, calling on Georgian communists to reject the chauvinistic nationalism which he argued had marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities.\n\n## 1924: Consolidation of power\n\nUpon Lenin's death in January 1924, Stalin took charge of the funeral and was a pallbearer. To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist amid his growing personality cult, Stalin gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the Foundations of Leninism, later published in book form. At the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, Lenin's Testament was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations, embarrassing Stalin. He offered his resignation as General Secretary, saving himself from being removed from the post.\n\n## 1924–1928: Succeeding Lenin\n\nAfter Lenin's death, Stalin emerged as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He used his position to consolidate power, gradually eliminating his rivals and opponents. In 1925, he defeated his main rival, Leon Trotsky, in a power struggle. Stalin's rise to power was marked by a series of purges and executions of party members who opposed him.\n\n## 1928–1932: First five-year plan\n\nIn 1928, Stalin declared that the Soviet Union had fallen behind the advanced countries and needed to catch up in a short period of time. He introduced the First Five-Year Plan, a series of economic reforms aimed at rapid industrialization and collectivization. The plan was implemented with great speed and brutality, leading to widespread famine and unrest.\n\n## 1932–1939: Major crises\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Soviet economy began to experience severe difficulties, including widespread famine and economic stagnation. Stalin responded by increasing repression and terror, executing thousands of people accused of being enemies of the state.\n\n## 1939–1941: Pact with Nazi Germany\n\nIn 1939, Stalin signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, which allowed the Soviet Union to annex Eastern Poland and other territories. The pact was seen as a major turning point in Soviet history, marking a shift towards a more aggressive and expansionist foreign policy.\n\n## 1941–1942: German invasion\n\nIn June 1941, Germany launched a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, known as Operation Barbarossa. The Soviet army was initially caught off guard and suffered heavy losses, but eventually managed to repel the German advance.\n\n## 1942–1945: Soviet counter-attack\n\nIn 1942, the Soviet army launched a major counter-attack against the German army, which led to a series of significant victories and the eventual defeat of Germany.\n\n## 1945: Victory\n\nIn April 1945, the Soviet army captured Berlin, and Germany surrendered. Stalin's leadership during the war had made him a hero in the Soviet Union, and he was hailed as a great leader.\n\n## 1945–1947: Post-war reconstruction\n\nAfter the war, Stalin focused on rebuilding the Soviet economy and society. He introduced a series of economic reforms and invested heavily in education and healthcare.\n\n## 1947–1950: Cold War policy\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Stalin became increasingly concerned about the spread of communism in Eastern Europe and the threat of nuclear war with the United States. He introduced a series of policies aimed at countering these threats, including the establishment of the Warsaw Pact and the development of the Soviet nuclear program.\n\n## 1950–1953: Final years\n\nIn his final years, Stalin's health began to decline, and he became increasingly isolated and paranoid. He died on March 5, 1953, and was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev.\n\n## 1953: Death and funeral\n\nStalin's death was announced on March 5, 1953, and his funeral was held on March 9. He was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.\n\n## Legacy\n\nStalin's legacy is complex and disputed. Some view him as a great leader who modernized and industrialized the Soviet Union, while others see him as a brutal dictator responsible for millions of deaths. His policies had a profound impact on the Soviet Union and the world, and his legacy continues to be debated and studied today.\n\n## Death toll\n\nThe exact number of deaths attributed to Stalin's regime is still a matter of debate. Some estimates range from 20 million to 40 million people.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of Stalin's victims\n\n## References\n\n* Kotkin, Stephen (2017). Stalin: Volume I: Paradoxes of Power, 1878-1928.

Stalin viewed parliamentary process as a waste of time [53] In April 1906, Stalin attended the RSDLP's Fourth Congress in Stockholm, where the party—then led by its Menshevik majority—agreed that it would not raise funds using armed robbery [54] Lenin and Stalin disagreed with this, [55] and privately discussed continuing the robberies for the Bolshevik cause [56]\n\n1912–1917: Rise to the Central Committee and Pravda\nIn January 1912, the first Bolshevik Central Committee was elected at the Prague Conference [78] Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev decided to co-opt Stalin to the committee, which Stalin (still in exile in Vologda) agreed to [78] [79] Lenin believed that Stalin, as a Georgian, would help secure support from the empire's minority ethnicities [80] In February 1912, Stalin again escaped to Saint Petersburg, [81] where he was tasked with converting the Bolshevik weekly newspaper, Zvezda (\"Star\") into a daily, Pravda (\"Truth\") [82] The new newspaper was launched in April 1912 and Stalin's role as editor was kept secret [83] In May 1912, he was again arrested and sentenced to three years of exile in Siberia [84] In July, he arrived in Narym, [85] where he shared a room with fellow Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov [86] After two months, they escaped to Saint Petersburg, [87] where Stalin continued work on Pravda [88]\n\n\n1917: Russian Revolution\nWhile Stalin was in exile, Russia entered the First World War, and in October 1916 he and other exiled Bolsheviks were conscripted into the Russian Army [99] They arrived in Krasnoyarsk in February 1917, [100] where a medical examiner ruled Stalin unfit for service due to his crippled arm [101] Stalin was required to serve four more months of his exile and successfully requested to serve it in Achinsk [102] Stalin was in the city when the February Revolution took place; the Tsar abdicated and the Empire became a de facto republic [103] In a celebratory mood, Stalin travelled by train to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg had been renamed) in March [104] He assumed control of Pravda alongside Lev Kamenev, [105] and was appointed as a Bolshevik delegate to the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet, an influential workers' council [106]\n\n\nIn Lenin's government\nOn 26 October 1917, Lenin declared himself chairman of the new government, the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) [120] Stalin supported Lenin's decision not to form a coalition with the Socialist Revolutionary Party, although a coalition was formed with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries [121] Stalin became part of an informal leadership group alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov, and his importance within the Bolshevik ranks grew [122] Stalin's office was near Lenin's in the Smolny Institute, [123] and he and Trotsky had direct access to Lenin without an appointment [124] Stalin co-signed Lenin's decrees shutting down hostile newspapers, [125] and co-chaired the committee drafting a constitution for the newly-formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [126] He supported Lenin's formation of the Cheka security service and the Red Terror, arguing that state violence was an effective tool for capitalist powers [127] Unlike some Bolsheviks, Stalin never expressed concern about the Cheka's rapid expansion and the Red Terror [127]\n\n\n1917–1918: People's Commissar for Nationalities\nOn 26 October 1917, Lenin declared himself chairman of the new government, the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) [120] Stalin supported Lenin's decision not to form a coalition with the Socialist Revolutionary Party, although a coalition was formed with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries [121] Stalin became part of an informal leadership group alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov, and his importance within the Bolshevik ranks grew [122] Stalin's office was near Lenin's in the Smolny Institute, [123] and he and Trotsky had direct access to Lenin without an appointment [124] Stalin co-signed Lenin's decrees shutting down hostile newspapers, [125] and co-chaired the committee drafting a constitution for the newly-formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [126] He supported Lenin's formation of the Cheka security service and the Red Terror, arguing that state violence was an effective tool for capitalist powers [127] Unlike some Bolsheviks, Stalin never expressed concern about the Cheka's rapid expansion and the Red Terror [127]\n\n\n1918–1921: Military command\nIn May 1918, during the intensifying Russian Civil War, Sovnarkom sent Stalin to Tsaritsyn to take charge of food procurement in Southern Russia [140] Eager to prove himself as a commander, [141] he took control of regional military operations and befriended Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, who later formed the core of his military support base [142] Stalin sent large numbers of Red Army troops to battle the region's White armies, resulting in heavy losses and drawing Lenin's concern [143] In Tsaritsyn, Stalin commanded the local Cheka branch to execute suspected counter-revolutionaries, often without trial, [144] and purged the military and food collection agencies of middle-class specialists, whom were also executed [145] His use of state violence was at a greater scale than most Bolshevik leaders approved of, [146] for instance, he ordered several villages torched to ensure compliance with his food procurement program [147]\n\n\n1921–1924: Lenin's final years\nThe Soviet government sought to bring neighbouring states under its domination; in February 1921 it invaded the Menshevik-governed Georgia, [168] and in April 1921, Stalin ordered the Red Army into Turkestan to reassert Soviet control [169] As People's Commissar for Nationalities, Stalin believed that each ethnic group had the right to an \"autonomous republic\" within the Russian state in which it could oversee various regional affairs [170] In taking this view, some Marxists accused him of bending too much to bourgeois nationalism, while others accused him of remaining too Russo-centric [171] In his diverse native Caucasus, however, Stalin opposed the idea of separate autonomous republics, arguing that these would oppress ethnic minorities within their territories; instead, he called for a Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic [172] The Georgian Communist Party opposed the idea, resulting in the Georgian affair [173] In mid-1921, Stalin returned to the South Caucasus, calling on Georgian communists to reject the chauvinistic nationalism which he argued had marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities [174] In March 1921, Nadezhda gave birth to another of Stalin's sons, Vasily [175]\n\n\nConsolidation of power\nUpon Lenin's death in January 1924, [193] Stalin took charge of the funeral and was a pallbearer [194] To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist amid his growing personality cult, Stalin gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the Foundations of Leninism, later published in book form [195] At the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, Lenin's Testament was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations [196] Embarrassed by its contents, Stalin offered his resignation as General Secretary; this act of humility saved him, and he was retained in the post [197]\n\n\n1924–1928: Succeeding Lenin\nUpon Lenin's death in January 1924, [193] Stalin took charge of the funeral and was a pallbearer [194] To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist amid his growing personality cult, Stalin gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the Foundations of Leninism, later published in book form [195] At the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, Lenin's Testament was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations [196] Embarrassed by its contents, Stalin offered his resignation as General Secretary; this act of humility saved him, and he was retained in the post [197]\n\n\n1928–1932: First five-year plan\nWe have fallen behind the advanced countries by fifty to a hundred years We must close that gap in ten years Either we do this or we'll be crushed.\n\n\nEconomic policy\nWe have fallen behind the advanced countries by fifty to a hundred years We must close that gap in ten years Either we do this or we'll be crushed.\n\n\nCultural and foreign policy\nIn 1928, Stalin declared that class war between the proletariat and their enemies would intensify as socialism developed [265] He warned of a \"danger from the right\", including from within the Communist Party [266] The first major show trial in the USSR was the Shakhty Trial of 1928, in which middle-class \"industrial specialists\" were convicted of sabotage [267] From 1929 to 1930, show trials were held to intimidate opposition; [268] these included the Industrial Party Trial, Menshevik Trial, and Metro-Vickers Trial [269] Aware that the ethnic Russian majority may have concerns about being ruled by a Georgian, [270] he promoted ethnic Russians throughout the state bureaucracy and made Russian compulsory in schools, albeit in tandem with local languages [271] Nationalist sentiment was suppressed [272] Conservative social policies were promoted to boost population growth; this included a focus on strong family units, re-criminalisation of homosexuality, restrictions on abortion and divorce, and abolition of the Zhenotdel women's department [273]\n\n\n1932–1939: Major crises\nWithin the Soviet Union, civic disgruntlement against Stalin's government was widespread [295] Social unrest in urban areas led Stalin to ease some economic policies in 1932 [296] In May 1932, he introduced kolkhoz markets where peasants could trade surplus produce [297] However, penal sanctions became harsher; a decree in August 1932 made the theft of a handful of grain a capital offence [298] The second five-year plan reduced production quotas from the first, focusing more on improving living conditions [296] through housing and consumer goods [296] Emphasis on armament production increased after Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933 [299]\n\n\nFamine of 1932–1933\nWithin the Soviet Union, civic disgruntlement against Stalin's government was widespread [295] Social unrest in urban areas led Stalin to ease some economic policies in 1932 [296] In May 1932, he introduced kolkhoz markets where peasants could trade surplus produce [297] However, penal sanctions became harsher; a decree in August 1932 made the theft of a handful of grain a capital offence [298] The second five-year plan reduced production quotas from the first, focusing more on improving living conditions [296] through housing and consumer goods [296] Emphasis on armament production increased after Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933 [299]\n\n\nIdeological and foreign affairs\nIn 1936, Stalin oversaw the adoption of a new constitution with expansive democratic features; it was designed as propaganda, as all power rested in his hands [312] He declared that \"socialism, the first phase of communism, has been achieved\" [312] In 1938, the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) was released; [313] commonly known as the \"Short Course\", it became the central text of Stalinism [314] Authorised Stalin biographies were also published, [315] though Stalin preferred to be viewed as the embodiment of the Communist Party, rather than have his life story explored [316]\n\n\nGreat Purge\nStalin's approach to state repression was often contradictory [329] In May 1933, he released many convicted of minor offences, ordering the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations, [330] and in September 1934, he launched a commission to investigate false imprisonments That same month, he called for the execution of workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Japan [329] [330] After Sergei Kirov was murdered in December 1934, Stalin became increasingly concerned about assassination threats, [331] and state repression intensified [332] Stalin issued a decree establishing NKVD troikas which could issue rapid and severe sentences without involving the courts [333] In 1935, he ordered the NKVD to expel suspected counterrevolutionaries from urban areas; [299] over 11,000 were expelled from Leningrad alone in early 1935 [299]\n\n\nWorld War II\nAs a Marxist–Leninist, Stalin considered conflict between competing capitalist powers inevitable; after Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, he recognised a major war was looming [364] He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and the United Kingdom would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe [365] The Soviets also faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese in the latter part of the 1930s, culminating in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939 [366] Stalin initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling in total size between January 1939 and June 1941, although in its haste to expand many of its officers were poorly trained [367] Between 1940 and 1941 Stalin also purged the military, leaving it with a severe shortage of trained officers when war later broke out [368]\n\n\n1939–1941: Pact with Nazi Germany\nAs a Marxist–Leninist, Stalin considered conflict between competing capitalist powers inevitable; after Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, he recognised a major war was looming [364] He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and the United Kingdom would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe [365] The Soviets also faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese in the latter part of the 1930s, culminating in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939 [366] Stalin initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling in total size between January 1939 and June 1941, although in its haste to expand many of its officers were poorly trained [367] Between 1940 and 1941 Stalin also purged the military, leaving it with a severe shortage of trained officers when war later broke out [368]\n\n\n1941–1942: German invasion\nIn June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, initiating the war on the Eastern Front [390] Despite intelligence agencies repeatedly warning him of Germany's intentions, Stalin was taken by surprise [391] He formed a State Defence Committee, which he headed as Supreme Commander, [392] as well as a military Supreme Command (Stavka), [393] with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff [394] The German tactic of blitzkrieg was initially highly effective; the Soviet air force in the western borderlands was destroyed within two days [395] The German Wehrmacht pushed deep into Soviet territory; [396] soon, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and the Baltic states were under German occupation, and Leningrad was under siege; [397] and Soviet refugees were flooding into Moscow and surrounding cities [398] By July, Germany's Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow, [397] and by October the Wehrmacht was amassing for a full assault on the capital Plans were made for the Soviet government to evacuate to Kuibyshev, although Stalin decided to remain in Moscow, believing his flight would damage troop morale [399] The German advance on Moscow was halted after two months of battle in increasingly harsh weather conditions [400]\n\n\n1942–1945: Soviet counter-attack\nBy November 1942, the Soviets had begun to repulse the German southern campaign and, although there were 2.5 million Soviet casualties in that effort, it permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front [427] In summer 1943, Germany attempted an encirclement attack at Kursk, which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets [428] By the end of the year, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans to that point [429] Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after Stalin had moved factories well to the east of the front, safe from invasion and aerial assault [430]\n\n\n1945: Victory\nIn April 1945, the Red Army seized Berlin, Hitler killed himself, and Germany surrendered in May [455] Stalin had wanted Hitler captured alive; he had his remains brought to Moscow in order to prevent them becoming a relic for Nazi sympathisers [456] Many Soviet soldiers engaged in looting, pillaging, and rape, both in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe [457] Stalin refused to punish the offenders [454] With Germany defeated, Stalin switched focus to the war with Japan, transferring half a million troops to the Far East [458] Stalin was pressed by his allies to enter the war and wanted to cement the Soviet Union's strategic position in Asia [459] On 8 August, in between the U.S atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria and northern Korea, defeating the Kwantung Army [460] These events led to the Japanese surrender and the war's end [461] The U.S rebuffed Stalin's desire for the Red Army to take a role in the Allied occupation of Japan [462]\n\n\nPost-war era\nAfter the war, Stalin was at the apex of his career [466] Within the Soviet Union he was widely regarded as the embodiment of victory and patriotism, [467] and his armies controlled Central and Eastern Europe up to the River Elbe [466] In June 1945, Stalin adopted the title of Generalissimo [468] and stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square [469] At a banquet held for army commanders, he described the Russian people as \"the outstanding nation\" and \"leading force\" within the Soviet Union, the first time that he had unequivocally endorsed Russians over the other Soviet nationalities [470] In 1946, the state published Stalin's Collected Works [471] In 1947, it brought out a second edition of his official biography, which glorified him to a greater extent than its predecessor [472] He was quoted in Pravda on a daily basis and pictures of him remained pervasive on the walls of workplaces and homes [473]\n\n\n1945–1947: Post-war reconstruction\nAfter the war, Stalin was at the apex of his career [466] Within the Soviet Union he was widely regarded as the embodiment of victory and patriotism, [467] and his armies controlled Central and Eastern Europe up to the River Elbe [466] In June 1945, Stalin adopted the title of Generalissimo [468] and stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square [469] At a banquet held for army commanders, he described the Russian people as \"the outstanding nation\" and \"leading force\" within the Soviet Union, the first time that he had unequivocally endorsed Russians over the other Soviet nationalities [470] In 1946, the state published Stalin's Collected Works [471] In 1947, it brought out a second edition of his official biography, which glorified him to a greater extent than its predecessor [472] He was quoted in Pravda on a daily basis and pictures of him remained pervasive on the walls of workplaces and homes [473]\n\n\n1947–1950: Cold War policy\nIn the aftermath of the war, the British Empire declined, leaving the U.S and USSR as the dominant world powers [496] Tensions among these former Allies grew, [467] resulting in the Cold War [497] Although Stalin publicly described the British and U.S governments as aggressive, he thought it unlikely that a war with them would be imminent, believing that several decades of peace was likely [498] He nevertheless secretly intensified Soviet research into nuclear weaponry, intent on creating an atom bomb [466] Still, Stalin foresaw the undesirability of a nuclear conflict, stating that \"atomic weapons can hardly be used without spelling the end of the world.\" [499] He personally took a keen interest in the development of the weapon [500] In August 1949, the bomb was successfully tested in the deserts outside Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan [501] Stalin also initiated a new military build-up; the Soviet army was expanded from 2.9 million soldiers, as it stood in 1949, to 5.8 million by 1953 [502]\n\n\nEastern Bloc\nAfter the war, Stalin sought to retain Soviet dominance across Eastern Europe while expanding its influence in Asia [446] Cautiously regarding the responses from the Western Allies, Stalin avoided immediately installing Communist Party governments in Eastern Europe, instead initially ensuring that Marxist-Leninists were placed in coalition ministries [507] In contrast to his approach to the Baltic states, he rejected the proposal of merging the new communist states into the Soviet Union, rather recognising them as independent nation-states [513] He was faced with the problem that there were few Marxists left in Eastern Europe, with most having been killed by the Nazis [514] He demanded that war reparations be paid by Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic [467] Aware that the countries of Eastern Europe had been pushed to socialism through invasion rather than revolution, Stalin called them  \"people's democracies\" instead of \"dictatorships of the proletariat\" [515]\n\n\nAsia\nIn October 1949, Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took power in China and proclaimed the People's Republic of China [528] Marxist governments now controlled a third of the world's land mass [529] Privately, Stalin revealed that he had underestimated the Chinese Communists and their ability to win the civil war, instead encouraging them to make another peace with the KMT [530] In December 1949, Mao visited Stalin Initially Stalin refused to repeal the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945, which significantly benefited the Soviet Union over China, although in January 1950 he relented and agreed to sign a new treaty [531] Stalin was concerned that Mao might follow Tito's example by pursuing a course independent of Soviet influence, and made it known that if displeased he would withdraw assistance; the Chinese desperately needed said assistance after decades of civil war [532]\n\n\n1950–1953: Final years\nIn his later years, Stalin was in poor health [548] He took increasingly long holidays; in 1950 and again in 1951 he spent almost five months on holiday at his Abkhazian dacha [549] Stalin nevertheless mistrusted his doctors; in January 1952 he had one imprisoned after they suggested that he should retire to improve his health [548] In September 1952, several Kremlin doctors were arrested for allegedly plotting to kill senior politicians in what came to be known as the doctors' plot; the majority of the accused were Jewish [550] Stalin ordered that the doctors be tortured to ensure confessions [551] In November, the Slánský trial took place in Czechoslovakia, in which 13 senior Communist Party figures, 11 of them Jewish, were accused and convicted of being part of a vast Zionist-American conspiracy to subvert the Eastern Bloc [552] The same month, a much publicised trial of accused Jewish industrial wreckers took place in Ukraine [553] In 1951, Stalin initiated the Mingrelian affair, a purge of the Georgian Communist Party which resulted in over 11,000 deportations [554]\n\n\nDeath, funeral and aftermath\nOn 1 March 1953, Stalin's staff found him semi-conscious on the bedroom floor of his Kuntsevo Dacha [561] He was moved onto a couch and remained there for three days, [562] during which he was hand-fed using a spoon and given various medicines and injections [563] Stalin's condition continued to deteriorate, and he died on 5 March [564] An autopsy revealed that he had died of a cerebral haemorrhage, and that his cerebral arteries had been severely damaged by atherosclerosis [565] Stalin's death was announced on 6 March; [566] his body was embalmed, [567] and then displayed in Moscow's House of Unions for three days [568] The crowds coming to view the body were so large and disorganised that many people were killed in a crowd crush [569] At the funeral on 9 March, attended by hundreds of thousands, Stalin was laid to rest in Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square [570]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nStalin claimed to have embraced Marxism at the age of 15, [581] and it served as the guiding philosophy throughout his adult life; [582] according to Kotkin, Stalin held \"zealous Marxist convictions\", [583] while Montefiore suggested that Marxism held a \"quasi-religious\" value for Stalin [584] Although he never became a Georgian nationalist, [585] during his early life elements from Georgian nationalist thought blended with Marxism in his outlook [586] Stalin believed in the need to adapt Marxism to changing circumstances; in 1917, he declared that \"there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism I stand on the ground of the latter\" [587] According to scholar Robert Service, Stalin's \"few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism\" [582]\n\n\nPersonal life and characteristics\nEthnically Georgian, [606] Stalin grew up speaking the Georgian language, [607] and did not begin learning Russian until age eight or nine [608] It has been argued that his ancestry was genetically Ossetian, but he never acknowledged an Ossetian identity [609] He remained proud of his Georgian identity, [610] and throughout his life retained a heavy Georgian accent when speaking Russian [611] [612] Some colleagues described him as \"Asiatic\", and he supposedly said that \"I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian\" [613]\n\n\nPersonality\nTrotsky and several other Soviet figures promoted the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity, [630] a characterisation which gained widespread acceptance outside of the Soviet Union during his lifetime [631] However, historians note that he possessed a complex mind, [632] remarkable self-control, [633] and excellent memory [634] Stalin was a diligent worker [635] and an effective and strategic organiser, [636] with a keen interest in learning [637] As a leader, he meticulously scrutinised details, from film scripts to military plans, [638] and judged others by their inner strength and cleverness [639] He was skilled at playing different roles depending on the audience, [640] as well as in deception [641]  Although he could be rude, [642] Stalin rarely raised his voice; [643] however, as his health deteriorated, he became unpredictable and bad-tempered [644] He could be charming and enjoyed cracking jokes when relaxed [637] At social events, Stalin encouraged singing and drinking, hoping others would drunkenly reveal secrets to him [645]\n\n\nRelationships and family\nStalin married his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in 1906 Volkogonov suggested that she was \"probably the one human being he had really loved\" [667] When she died, Stalin allegedly said: \"This creature softened my heart of stone She died and with her died my last warm feelings for humanity.\" [668] They had a son, Yakov, who frequently frustrated and annoyed Stalin [669] After Yakov was captured by the German Army during World War II, Stalin refused to agree to a prisoner exchange between him and German field marshal Friedrich Paulus, and Yakov died at a Nazi concentration camp in 1943 [670]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe historian Robert Conquest stated that Stalin perhaps \"determined the course of the twentieth century\" more than any other individual [688] Leninists remain divided in their views on Stalin; some view him as Lenin's authentic successor, while others believe he betrayed Lenin's ideas by deviating from them [605] For most Westerners and anti-communist Russians, he is viewed overwhelmingly negatively as a mass murderer; [689] for significant numbers of Russians and Georgians, he is regarded as a great statesman and state-builder [689] The historian Dmitri Volkogonov characterised him as \"one of the most powerful figures in human history.\" [690]\n\n\nDeath toll\nBefore the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the archival revelations, some Western historians estimated that the numbers killed by Stalin's regime were 20 million or higher [714] [715] [716] The scholarly consensus affirms that Soviet archival materials declassified in 1991 contain irrefutable data much lower than Western sources used prior to 1991, such as statements from emigres and other informants [717]\n\n\nIn the Soviet Union and post-Soviet states\nShortly after his death, the Soviet Union went through a period of de-Stalinisation Malenkov denounced the Stalin personality cult, [729] and the cult was subsequently criticised in Pravda [730] In 1956, Khrushchev gave his \"Secret Speech\", titled \"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\", to a closed session of the Party's 20th Congress There, Khrushchev denounced Stalin for both his mass repression and his personality cult [731] He repeated these denunciations at the 22nd Party Congress in October 1962 [732] In October 1961, Stalin's body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, the location marked by a bust [733] Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd that year [734]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nAcademic books and journals\n\n\nMagazines, newspapers and websites\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Her remarkable life and longevity have been extensively documented, providing valuable insights into the human aging process.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nTanaka was born as Kane Ota (太田 カ子, Ōta Kane) on 2 January 1903 in the village of Wajiro, now part of Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, on the southern island of Kyushu. She was the third daughter and seventh child of Kumayoshi and Kuma Ota. According to her family, Tanaka was actually born on 2 December 1902, and her parents delayed the process of filing the report for a week because they were unsure if she would survive, as she was born prematurely.\n\nTanaka's early life was marked by the traditional Japanese family dynamics, where women were expected to be subservient to their husbands and elderly family members. Her father, Kumayoshi, was a Buddhist priest, and the family lived a relatively simple life. Kane's education was limited, but she developed a strong sense of responsibility and duty towards her family.\n\n## Marriage and Family\n\nIn 1922, at the age of 19, Tanaka married Horiuchi Tanaka, a local businessman. The couple had six children together, with three sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, Hiroshi, became a prominent businessman and played a significant role in documenting his mother's life and longevity.\n\n## Health and Longevity\n\nTanaka's life was not without health challenges. At the age of 35, she was infected with paratyphoid fever, which she shared with her adopted daughter. In 1948, at the age of 45, she underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer. Despite these health issues, Tanaka continued to live a relatively active life.\n\nIn 2006, at the age of 103, Tanaka was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Her second son, Kazuo, and his wife documented her life and health in a book called \"In Good and Bad Times, 107 Years Old.\" The book provides a detailed account of Tanaka's life, including her health challenges and her remarkable longevity.\n\n## Record-Breaking Longevity\n\nOn 9 March 2019, Guinness World Records officially recognized Tanaka as the world's oldest living person and the world's oldest living woman, verifying her claim. Her longevity was further confirmed when she surpassed Nabi Tajima's age of 117 years, 260 days in 2020, becoming the longest-lived Japanese person and the third-oldest person in the world.\n\nOn 8 April 2022, Tanaka broke the record for the second-oldest verified person, surpassing the lifespan of Sarah Knauss. Her remarkable longevity has provided valuable insights into the human aging process, and her life has been a testament to the human capacity for resilience and determination.\n\n## See Also\n\n* List of the verified oldest people\n* Longevity\n* Human aging\n* Guinness World Records\n\n## External Links\n\n* Kane Tanaka's profile on Guinness World Records\n* \"In Good and Bad Times, 107 Years Old\" by Hiroshi and Kazuo Tanaka\n* \"The World's Oldest Living Person\" by KBC (September 2017)\n* \"Kane Tanaka: The World's Oldest Living Person\" by The Japan Times (March 2019)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kane_Tanaka\" following this outline:\n\n\nPersonal life\nTanaka was born as Kane Ota (太田 カ子, Ōta Kane) on 2 January 1903 in the village of Wajiro (now part of Higashi-ku, Fukuoka), on the southern island of Kyushu, [7] the third daughter and seventh child of Kumayoshi and Kuma Ota [8] [9] Kane and her family said she was actually born on 2 December 1902 and that her parents delayed the process of filing the report for a week because they were not sure if she would survive [10] as she was born prematurely [11]\n\n\nHealth and longevity\nTanaka had several major illnesses and was infected with paratyphoid fever with her adopted daughter at the age of 35 [26] She underwent pancreatic cancer surgery at the age of 45 [26] In 2006, Tanaka was diagnosed with colorectal cancer and underwent surgery when she was 103 years old [7] Her life and longevity were noted by her second son and his wife four years later when they published a book called In Good and Bad Times, 107 Years Old [9] At the age of 114, she was interviewed by KBC in September 2017 [27] On 9 March 2019, Tanaka was officially presented with the \"World's Oldest Living Person\" and \"World's Oldest Living Woman\" titles by Guinness World Records, verifying her longevity claim [18] On 19 September 2020, she broke the record of longest-lived Japanese person, as well as the third-oldest person in the world, after surpassing Nabi Tajima's age of 117 years, 260 days [5] On 8 April 2022, she surpassed the lifespan of Sarah Knauss to become the second-oldest verified person [28]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Norway", "content": "\nEtymology\nNorway has two official names: Norge in Bokmål and Noreg in Nynorsk The English name Norway comes from the Old English word Norþweg mentioned in 880, meaning \"northern way\" or \"way leading to the north\", which is how the Anglo-Saxons referred to the coastline of Atlantic Norway [28] [29] [30] The Anglo-Saxons of Britain also referred to the kingdom of Norway in 880 as Norðmanna land [28] [29]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest traces of human occupation in Norway are found along the coast, where the huge ice shelf of the last ice age first melted between 11,000 and 8000 BC The oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9500 to 6000 BC, discovered in Finnmark (Komsa culture) in the north and Rogaland (Fosna culture) in the southwest Theories about the two cultures being separate were deemed obsolete in the 1970s [32]\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe earliest traces of human occupation in Norway are found along the coast, where the huge ice shelf of the last ice age first melted between 11,000 and 8000 BC The oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9500 to 6000 BC, discovered in Finnmark (Komsa culture) in the north and Rogaland (Fosna culture) in the southwest Theories about the two cultures being separate were deemed obsolete in the 1970s [32]\n\n\nMetal Ages\nFrom about 1500 BC, bronze was gradually introduced Burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as Harstad and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period, with rock carving motifs that differ from those of the Stone Age, depicting ships resembling the Hjortspring boat, while large stone burial monuments known as stone ships were also erected [33]\n\n\nViking Age\nBy the time of the first historical records of Scandinavia, about the 8th century, several small political entities existed in Norway It has been estimated that there were nine petty realms in Western Norway during the early Viking Age [34] Archaeologist Bergljot Solberg on this basis estimates that there would have been at least 20 in the whole country [35]\n\n\nHigh Middle Ages\nFrom the 1040s to 1130, the country was at peace [42] In 1130, the civil war era broke out on the basis of unclear succession laws, which allowed the king's sons to rule jointly The Archdiocese of Nidaros was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings [43] The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts The wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of Håkon IV Håkonsson, who introduced clear laws of succession [44]\n\n\nKalmar Union\nUpon the death of King Haakon V in 1319, Magnus Eriksson, at just three years old, inherited the throne as King Magnus VII A simultaneous movement to make Magnus King of Sweden proved successful (he was a grandson of King Magnus Ladulås of Sweden), and both the kings of Sweden and of Denmark were elected to the throne by their respective nobles Thus Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus VII [55]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nAfter Sweden broke out of the Kalmar Union in 1521, Norway tried to follow suit, [citation needed] but the subsequent rebellion was defeated, and Norway remained in a union with Denmark until 1814 This period was by some referred to as the \"400-Year Night\", since all of the kingdom's intellectual and administrative power was centred in Copenhagen.\n\n\nLater modern period\nAfter Denmark–Norway was attacked by the United Kingdom at the 1807 Battle of Copenhagen, it entered into an alliance with Napoleon, with the war leading to dire conditions and mass starvation in 1812 As the Danish kingdom was on the losing side in 1814, it was forced by the Treaty of Kiel to cede Norway to Sweden, while the old Norwegian provinces of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands remained with the Danish crown [63] Norway took this opportunity to declare independence, adopted a constitution based on American and French models, and elected the Crown Prince of Denmark and Norway, Christian Frederick, as king on 17 May 1814 – celebrated as the Syttende mai (Seventeenth of May) holiday.\n\n\nDissolution of the union and the First World War\nChristian Michelsen, Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907, played a central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on 7 June 1905 A national referendum confirmed the people's preference for a monarchy over a republic However, no Norwegian could legitimately claim the throne, since none of Norway's noble families could claim royal descent.\n\n\nSecond World War\nNorway once more proclaimed its neutrality during the Second World War, but was invaded by German forces on 9 April 1940 Although Norway was unprepared for the German surprise attack (see: Battle of Drøbak Sound, Norwegian Campaign, and Invasion of Norway), military and naval resistance lasted for two months Norwegian armed forces in the north launched an offensive against the German forces in the Battles of Narvik, but were forced to surrender on 10 June after losing British support which had been diverted to France during the German invasion of France.\n\n\nPost–World War II history\nFrom 1945 to 1962, the Labour Party held an absolute majority in the parliament The government, led by prime minister Einar Gerhardsen, embarked on a programme inspired by Keynesian economics, emphasising state financed industrialisation and co-operation between trade unions and employers' organisations Many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued, although the rationing of dairy products was lifted in 1949, while price controls and rationing of housing and cars continued until 1960.\n\n\nGeography\nNorway's core territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula; the remote island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard are also included [note 5] The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom Norway also claims a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land [86] Norwegian possessions in the North Atlantic, Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland, remained Danish when Norway was passed to Sweden at the Treaty of Kiel [87] Norway also comprised Bohuslän until 1658, Jämtland and Härjedalen until 1645, [86] Shetland and Orkney until 1468, [88] and the Hebrides and Isle of Man until the Treaty of Perth in 1266 [89]\n\n\nClimate\nBecause of the Gulf Stream and prevailing westerlies, Norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes, especially along the coast The mainland experiences four distinct seasons, with colder winters and less precipitation inland The northernmost part has a mostly maritime Subarctic climate, while Svalbard has an Arctic tundra climate The southern and western parts of Norway, fully exposed to Atlantic storm fronts, experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts Areas to the east of the coastal mountains are in a rain shadow, and have lower rain and snow totals than the west The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest summers, but also cold weather and snow in wintertime The sunniest weather is along the south coast, but sometimes even the coast far north can be very sunny – the sunniest month with 430 sun hours was recorded in Tromsø [98] [99]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nNorway has a larger number of different habitats than almost any other European country There are approximately 60,000 species in Norway and adjacent waters (excluding bacteria and viruses) The Norwegian Shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive [105] The total number of species include 16,000 species of insects (probably 4,000 more species yet to be described), 20,000 species of algae, 1,800 species of lichen, 1,050 species of mosses, 2,800 species of vascular plants, up to 7,000 species of fungi, 450 species of birds (250 species nesting in Norway), 90 species of mammals, 45 fresh-water species of fish, 150 salt-water species of fish, 1,000 species of fresh-water invertebrates, and 3,500 species of salt-water invertebrates [106] About 40,000 of these species have been described by science The red list of 2010 encompasses 4,599 species [107] Norway contains five terrestrial ecoregions: Sarmatic mixed forests, Scandinavian coastal conifer forests, Scandinavian and Russian taiga, Kola Peninsula tundra, and Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands [108]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAttractive and dramatic scenery and landscape are found throughout Norway [110] The west coast of southern Norway and the coast of northern Norway present some of the most visually impressive coastal sceneries in the world National Geographic has listed the Norwegian fjords as the world's top tourist attraction [111] The country is also home to the natural phenomena of the Midnight sun (during summer), as well as the Aurora borealis known also as the Northern lights [112]\n\n\nPolitics and government\nNorway is considered to be one of the most developed democracies and states of justice in the world Since 2010, Norway has been classified as the world's most democratic country by the Democracy Index [116] [117] [118]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nNorway, a unitary state, is divided into fifteen first-level administrative counties (fylke) [132] The counties are administered through directly elected county councils who elect the County Mayor Additionally, the King and government are represented in every county by a County Governor (Norwegian: statsforvalteren) [133] The counties are then sub-divided into 357 second-level municipalities (Norwegian: kommuner), which in turn are administered by directly elected municipal council, headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet The capital of Oslo is considered both a county and a municipality Norway has two integral overseas territories out of mainland: Jan Mayen and Svalbard, the only developed island in the archipelago of the same name, located far to the north of the Norwegian mainland [134]\n\n\nDependencies of Norway\nThere are three Antarctic and Subantarctic dependencies: Bouvet Island, Peter I Island, and Queen Maud Land On most maps, there was an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land and the South Pole until 12 June 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area [136]\n\n\nLargest populated areas\nNorway uses a civil law system where laws are created and amended in Parliament and the system regulated through the Courts of justice of Norway It consists of the Supreme Court of 20 permanent judges and a Chief Justice, appellate courts, city and district courts, and conciliation councils [137] The judiciary is independent of executive and legislative branches While the Prime Minister nominates Supreme Court Justices for office, their nomination must be approved by Parliament and formally confirmed by the Monarch Usually, judges attached to regular courts are formally appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\n\nJudicial system and law enforcement\nNorway uses a civil law system where laws are created and amended in Parliament and the system regulated through the Courts of justice of Norway It consists of the Supreme Court of 20 permanent judges and a Chief Justice, appellate courts, city and district courts, and conciliation councils [137] The judiciary is independent of executive and legislative branches While the Prime Minister nominates Supreme Court Justices for office, their nomination must be approved by Parliament and formally confirmed by the Monarch Usually, judges attached to regular courts are formally appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\n\nHuman rights\nNorway has been considered a progressive country, which has adopted legislation and policies to support women's rights, minority rights, and LGBT rights As early as 1884, 171 of the leading figures, among them five Prime Ministers, co-founded the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights [141] They successfully campaigned for women's right to education, women's suffrage, the right to work, and other gender equality policies From the 1970s, gender equality also came high on the state agenda, with the establishment of a public body to promote gender equality, which evolved into the Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud Civil society organisations also continue to play an important role; women's rights organisations are today organised in the Norwegian Women's Lobby umbrella organisation.\n\n\nForeign relations\nNorway maintains embassies in 82 countries [147] 60 countries maintain an embassy in Norway, all of them in the capital, Oslo.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Norwegian Armed Forces numbers about 25,000 personnel, including civilian employees According to 2009 mobilisation plans, full mobilisation produces approximately 83,000 combatant personnel Norway has conscription (including 6–12 months of training); [150] in 2013, the country became the first in Europe and NATO to draft women as well as men However, due to less need for conscripts after the Cold War, few people have to serve if they are not motivated [151] The Armed Forces are subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Defence The Commander-in-Chief is King Harald V The military of Norway is divided into the Norwegian Army, the Royal Norwegian Navy, the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the Norwegian Cyber Defence Force and the Home Guard.\n\n\nEconomy\nNorwegians enjoy the second-highest GDP per capita among European countries (after Luxembourg), and the sixth-highest GDP (PPP) per capita in the world Norway ranks as the second-wealthiest country in monetary value, with the largest capital reserve per capita of any nation [153] According to the CIA World Factbook, Norway is a net external creditor of debt [94] Norway reclaimed first place in the world in the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) in 2009 [154] The standard of living in Norway is among the highest in the world Foreign Policy magazine ranks Norway last in its Failed States Index for 2009 and 2023, judging Norway to be the world's most well-functioning and stable country The OECD ranks Norway fourth in the 2013 equalised Better Life Index and third in intergenerational earnings elasticity according to a 2010 study [155] [156]\n\n\nResources\nExport revenues from oil and gas have risen to over 40% of total exports and constitute almost 20% of the GDP [168] Norway is the fifth-largest oil exporter and third-largest gas exporter in the world, but it is not a member of OPEC In 1995, the Norwegian government established the sovereign wealth fund (\"Government Pension Fund – Global\") to be funded with oil revenues.\n\n\nOil industry\nExport revenues from oil and gas have risen to over 40% of total exports and constitute almost 20%

fund (\"Government Pension Fund – Global\") to be funded with oil revenues.\n\n\nTransport\nDue to the low population density, narrow shape and long coastlines of Norway, its public transport is less developed than in many European countries, especially outside the major cities The country has long-standing water transport traditions, but the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications has in recent years implemented rail, road, and air transport through numerous subsidiaries to develop the country's infrastructure [185] Under discussion is development of a new high-speed rail system between the nation's largest cities [186] [187]\n\n\nResearch\nInternationally recognised Norwegian scientists include the mathematicians Niels Henrik Abel and Sophus Lie Caspar Wessel was the first to describe vectors and complex numbers in the complex plane Ernst S Selmer's advanced research lead to the modernisation of crypto-algorithms Thoralf Skolem made revolutionary contributions to mathematical logic Øystein Ore and Ludwig Sylow made important contributions in group theory Atle Selberg was one of the most significant mathematicians of the 20th century, for which he was awarded a Fields Medal, Wolf Prize and Abel Prize.\n\n\nTourism\nIn 2008, Norway ranked 17th in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report [210] Tourism in Norway contributed to 4.2% of the gross domestic product as reported in 2016 [211] Every one in fifteen people throughout the country work in the tourism industry [211] Tourism is seasonal in Norway, with more than half of total tourists visiting between the months of May and August [211]\n\n\nDemographics\nNorway's population was 5,384,576 people in the third quarter of 2020 [212] Norwegians are an ethnic North Germanic people The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2018 was estimated at 1.56 children born per woman, [213] below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 4.69 children born per woman in 1877 [214] In 2018 the median age of the Norwegian population was 39.3 years.\n\n\nPopulation\nNorway's population was 5,384,576 people in the third quarter of 2020 [212] Norwegians

high of 4.69 children born per woman in 1877 [214] In 2018 the median age of the Norwegian population was 39.3 years.\n\n\nMigration\nParticularly in the 19th century, when economic conditions were difficult in Norway, tens of thousands of people migrated to the United States and Canada, where they could work and buy land in frontier areas Many went to the Midwest and Pacific Northwest In 2006, according to the US Census Bureau, almost 4.7 million persons identified as Norwegian Americans, [219] which was larger than the population of ethnic Norwegians in Norway itself [220] In the 2011 Canadian census, 452,705 Canadian citizens identified as having Norwegian ancestry [221]\n\n\nReligion\nSeparation of church and state happened significantly later in Norway than in most of Europe, and remains incomplete In 2012, the Norwegian parliament voted to grant the Church of Norway greater autonomy, [226] a decision which was confirmed in a constitutional amendment on 21 May 2012 [227]\n\n\nChurch of Norway\nSeparation of church and state happened significantly later in Norway than in most of Europe, and remains incomplete In 2012, the Norwegian parliament voted to grant the

December 2019): [231] [232] [233]\n\n\nIndigenous religions\nAs in other Scandinavian countries, the ancient Norse followed a form of Germanic paganism known as Norse paganism By the end of the 11th century, when Norway had been Christianised, the indigenous Norse religion and practices were prohibited Remnants of the native religion and beliefs of Norway survive today in the form of names, referential names of cities and locations, the days of the week, and everyday language Modern interest in the old ways has led to a revival of pagan religious practices in the form of Åsatru The Norwegian Åsatrufellesskapet Bifrost formed in 1996; in 2011, the fellowship had about 300 members Foreningen Forn Sed was formed in 1999 and has been recognised by the Norwegian government.\n\n\nHealth\nNorway was awarded first place according to the UN's Human Development Index (HDI) for 2013 [247] From the 1900s, improvements in public health occurred as a result of development in several areas such as social and living conditions, changes in disease and medical outbreaks, establishment of the health care system, and emphasis on public health matters Vaccination and increased treatment opportunities with antibiotics resulted in great improvements within the Norwegian population Improved hygiene and better nutrition were factors that contributed to improved health.\n\n\nEducation\nHigher education in Norway is offered by a range of seven universities, five specialised colleges, 25 university colleges as well as a range of private colleges Education follows the Bologna Process involving Bachelor (3 years), Master (2 years) and PhD (3 years) degrees [250] Acceptance is offered after finishing upper secondary school with general study competence.\n\n\nLanguages\nNorwegian in its two forms, Bokmål and Nynorsk, is the main national official language of all of Norway Sámi, a group which includes three separate languages, is recognised as a minority language on the national level and is a co-official language alongside Norwegian in the Sámi administrative linguistic area (Forvaltningsområdet for samisk språk) in Northern Norway [1] Kven is a minority language and is a co-official language alongside Norwegian in one municipality, also in Northern Norway [256] [257] [258]\n\n\nNorwegian\nNorwegian is a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse It is the main national language of Norway and is spoken throughout the country Norwegian is spoken natively by over 5 million people mainly in Norway, but is generally understood throughout Scandinavia and to a lesser degree other Nordic countries It has two official written forms, Bokmål and Nynorsk Both are used in public administration, schools, churches, and media Bokmål is the written language used by a majority of about 85% Around 95% of the population speak Norwegian as their first or native language, although many speak dialects that may differ significantly from the written languages Norwegian dialects are mutually intelligible, although listeners with limited exposure to dialects other than their own may struggle with certain phrases and pronunciations.\n\n\nSámi and Kven\nSeveral Uralic Sámi languages, which are related but not generally mutually intelligible, are traditionally spoken by the Sámi people primarily in Northern Norway and to much lesser extent in some parts of Central Norway Around 15,000 people have officially registered as Sámi in the Sámi census (Samemanntallet), but the number of people of recent Sámi heritage is often estimated at 50,000 people The number of people who have some knowledge of Northern Sámi, including as a second language, is estimated at 25,000 people, but only a minority are native speakers The other Sámi languages are heavily endangered and spoken by at most a few hundred people Most people of Sámi heritage are today native speakers of Norwegian as a result of past assimilation policies [260]\n\n\nOther languages\nSome supporters have also advocated making Norwegian Sign Language an official language [266] [267]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Norwegian farm culture continues to play a role in contemporary Norwegian culture In the 19th century, it inspired a strong romantic nationalistic movement, which is still visible in the Norwegian language and media Norwegian culture expanded with nationalist efforts to achieve an independent identity in the areas of literature, art and music This continues today in the performing arts and as a result of government support for exhibitions, cultural projects and artwork [269]\n\n\nCinema\nNorwegian cinema has received international recognition The documentary film Kon-Tiki (1950) won an Academy Award Another notable film is The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix, an animated feature film directed by Ivo Caprino The film was released in 1975 and is the most widely seen Norwegian film of all time [citation needed] Nils Gaup's Pathfinder (1987), the story of the Sámi, was nominated for an Oscar Berit Nesheim's The Other Side of Sunday was nominated for an Oscar in 1997.\n\n\nMusic\nThe classical music of the romantic composers Edvard Grieg, Rikard Nordraak and Johan Svendsen is internationally known, as is the modern music of Arne Nordheim Norway's classical performers include Leif Ove Andsnes, a pianist; Truls Mørk, an outstanding cellist; and the Wagnerian soprano Kirsten Flagstad.\n\n\nLiterature\nThe history of Norwegian literature starts with the pagan Eddaic poems and skaldic verse of the ninth and tenth centuries, with poets such as Bragi Boddason and Eyvindr skáldaspillir The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European medieval learning, hagiography and history writing Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence, this influenced the literature written in the late 12th and early 13th centuries Major works of that period include Historia Norwegiæ, Þiðrekssaga and Konungs skuggsjá.\n\n\nArchitecture\nWith expansive forests, Norway has long had a tradition of building in wood Many of today's most interesting new buildings are made of wood, reflecting the strong appeal that this material continues to hold for Norwegian designers and builders [278]\n\n\nArt\nFor an extended period, the Norwegian art scene was dominated by artwork from Germany and Holland as well as by the influence of Copenhagen It was in the 19th century that a truly Norwegian era began, first with portraits, later with impressive landscapes Johan Christian Dahl, originally from the Dresden school, eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.\" [280]\n\n\nCuisine\nNorway's culinary traditions show the influence of long seafaring and farming traditions, with salmon (fresh and cured), herring (pickled or marinated), trout, codfish, and other seafood, balanced by cheeses (such as brunost, Jarlsberg cheese, and gamalost), dairy products, and breads (predominantly dark/darker).\n\n\nSports\nSports are a central part of Norwegian culture, and popular sports include cross-country skiing, ski jumping, mountaineering, hiking, association football, handball, biathlon, speed skating, and, to a lesser degree, ice hockey.\n\n\nSee also\n61°N 8°E﻿ / ﻿61°N 8°E﻿ / 61; 8\n\nNotes\n61°N

Russia to the east, and the North Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy, with Oslo as its capital and largest city. Norway has a population of around 5.3 million people, with a diverse culture, history, and geography.\n\n## Etymology\n\nNorway has two official names: Norge in Bokmål and Noreg in Nynorsk. The English name Norway comes from the Old English word Norþweg, meaning \"northern way\" or \"way leading to the north\", which is how the Anglo-Saxons referred to the coastline of Atlantic Norway. The Anglo-Saxons of Britain also referred to the kingdom of Norway in 880 as Norðmanna land.\n\n## History\n\n### Prehistory\n\nThe earliest traces of human occupation in Norway are found along the coast, where the huge ice shelf of the last ice age first melted between 11,000 and 8,000 BC. The oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9,500 to 6,000 BC, discovered in Finnmark (Komsa culture) in the north and Rogaland (Fosna culture) in the southwest. Theories about the two cultures being separate were deemed obsolete in the 1970s.\n\n### Metal Ages\n\nFrom about 1,500 BC, bronze was gradually introduced. Burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as Harstad and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period, with rock carving motifs that differ from those of the Stone Age, depicting ships resembling the Hjortspring boat, while large stone burial monuments known as stone ships were also erected.\n\n### Viking Age\n\nBy the time of the first historical records of Scandinavia, about the 8th century, several small political entities existed in Norway. It has been estimated that there were nine petty realms in Western Norway during the early Viking Age. Archaeologist Bergljot Solberg on this basis estimates that there would have been at least 20 in the whole country.\n\n### High Middle Ages\n\nFrom the 1040s to 1130, the country was at peace. In 1130, the civil war era broke out on the basis of unclear succession laws, which allowed the king's sons to rule jointly. The Archdiocese of Nidaros was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings. The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts. The wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of Håkon IV Håkonsson, who introduced clear laws of succession.\n\n### Kalmar Union\n\nUpon the death of King Haakon V in 1319, Magnus Eriksson, at just three years old, inherited the throne as King Magnus VII. A simultaneous movement to make Magnus King of Sweden proved successful (he was a grandson of King Magnus Ladulås of Sweden), and both the kings of Sweden and of Denmark were elected to the throne by their respective nobles. Thus Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus VII.\n\n### Early modern period\n\nAfter Sweden broke out of the Kalmar Union in 1521, Norway tried to follow suit, but the subsequent rebellion was defeated, and Norway remained in a union with Denmark until 1814. This period was by some referred to as the \"400-Year Night\", since all of the kingdom's intellectual and administrative power was centred in Copenhagen.\n\n### Later modern period\n\nAfter Denmark-Norway was attacked by the United Kingdom at the 1807 Battle of Copenhagen, it entered into an alliance with Napoleon, with the war leading to dire conditions and mass starvation in 1812. As the Danish kingdom was on the losing side in 1814, it was forced by the Treaty of Kiel to cede Norway to Sweden, while the old Norwegian provinces of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands remained with the Danish crown. Norway took this opportunity to declare independence, adopted a constitution based on American and French models, and elected the Crown Prince of Denmark and Norway, Christian Frederick, as king on 17 May 1814 – celebrated as the Syttende mai (Seventeenth of May) holiday.\n\n### Dissolution of the union and the First World War\n\nChristian Michelsen, Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907, played a central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on 7 June 1905. A national referendum confirmed the people's preference for a monarchy over a republic. However, no Norwegian could legitimately claim the throne, since none of Norway's noble families could claim royal descent.\n\n### Second World War\n\nNorway once more proclaimed its neutrality during the Second World War, but was invaded by German forces on 9 April 1940. Although Norway was unprepared for the German surprise attack (see: Battle of Drøbak Sound, Norwegian Campaign, and Invasion of Norway), military and naval resistance lasted for two months. Norwegian armed forces in the north launched an offensive against the German forces in the Battles of Narvik, but were forced to surrender on 10 June after losing British support which had been diverted to France during the German invasion of France.\n\n### Post–World War II history\n\nFrom 1945 to 1962, the Labour Party held an absolute majority in the parliament. The government, led by prime minister Einar Gerhardsen, embarked on a programme inspired by Keynesian economics, emphasising state financed industrialisation and co-operation between trade unions and employers' organisations. Many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued, although the rationing of dairy products was lifted in 1949, while price controls and rationing of housing and cars continued until 1960.\n\n## Geography\n\nNorway's core territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula; the remote island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard are also included. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also claims a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land.\n\n## Climate\n\nBecause of the Gulf Stream and prevailing westerlies, Norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes, especially along the coast. The mainland experiences four distinct seasons, with colder winters and less precipitation inland. The northernmost part has a mostly maritime Subarctic climate, while Svalbard has an Arctic tundra climate.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nNorway has a larger number of different habitats than almost any other European country. There are approximately 60,000 species in Norway and adjacent waters (excluding bacteria and viruses). The Norwegian Shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive.\n\n## Environment\n\nAttractive and dramatic scenery and landscape are found throughout Norway. The west coast of southern Norway and the coast of northern Norway present some of the most visually impressive coastal sceneries in the world. National Geographic has listed the Norwegian fjords as the world's top tourist attraction.\n\n## Politics and government\n\nNorway is considered to be one of the most developed democracies and states of justice in the world. Since 2010, Norway has been classified as the world's most democratic country by the Democracy Index.\n\n## Administrative divisions\n\nNorway, a unitary state, is divided into fifteen first-level administrative counties (fylke). The counties are administered through directly elected county councils who elect the County Mayor. Additionally, the King and government are represented in every county by a County Governor (Norwegian: statsforvalteren). The counties are then sub-divided into 357 second-level municipalities (Norwegian: kommuner), which in turn are administered by directly elected municipal council, headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet.\n\n## Economy\n\nNorwegians enjoy the second-highest GDP per capita among European countries (after Luxembourg), and the sixth-highest GDP (PPP) per capita in the world. Norway ranks as the second-wealthiest country in monetary value, with the largest capital reserve per capita of any nation. According to the CIA World Factbook, Norway is a net external creditor of debt.\n\n## Resources\n\nExport revenues from oil and gas have risen to over 40% of total exports and constitute almost 20% of the GDP. Norway is the fifth-largest oil exporter and third-largest gas exporter in the world, but it is not a member of OPEC. In 1995, the Norwegian government established the sovereign wealth fund (\"Government Pension Fund – Global\") to be funded with oil revenues.\n\n## Transport\n\nDue to the low population density, narrow shape and long coastlines of Norway, its public transport is less developed than in many European countries, especially outside the major cities. The country has long-standing water transport traditions, but the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications has in recent years implemented rail, road, and air transport through numerous subsidiaries to develop the country's infrastructure. Under discussion is development of a new high-speed rail system between the nation's largest cities.\n\n## Research\n\nInternationally recognised Norwegian scientists include the mathematicians Niels Henrik Abel and Sophus Lie. Caspar Wessel was the first to describe vectors and complex numbers in the complex plane. Ernst S Selmer's advanced research lead to the modernisation of crypto-algorithms. Thoralf Skolem made revolutionary contributions to mathematical logic. Øystein Ore and Ludwig Sylow made important contributions in group theory. Atle Selberg was one of the most significant mathematicians of the 20th century, for which he was awarded a Fields Medal, Wolf Prize and Abel Prize.\n\n## Tourism\n\nIn 2008, Norway ranked 17th in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report. Tourism in Norway contributed to 4.2% of the gross domestic product as reported in 2016. Every one in fifteen people throughout the country work in the tourism industry. Tourism is seasonal in Norway, with more than half of total tourists visiting between the months of May and August.\n\n## Demographics\n\nNorway's population was 5,384,576 people in the third quarter of 2020. Norwegians are an ethnic North Germanic people. The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2018 was estimated at 1.56 children born per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. In 2018 the median age of the Norwegian population was 39.3 years.\n\n## Migration\n\nParticularly in the 19th century, when economic conditions were difficult in Norway, tens of thousands of people migrated to the United States and Canada, where they could work and buy land in frontier areas. Many went to the Midwest and Pacific Northwest. In 2006, according to the US Census Bureau, almost 4.7 million persons identified as Norwegian Americans. In the 2011 Canadian census, 452,705 Canadian citizens identified as having Norwegian ancestry.\n\n## Language\n\nNorwegian is a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse. It is the main national language of Norway and is spoken throughout the country. Norwegian is spoken natively by over 5 million people mainly in Norway, but is generally understood throughout Scandinavia and to a lesser degree other Nordic countries. It has two official written forms, Bokmål and Nynorsk. Both are used in public administration, schools, churches, and media. Bokmål is the written language used by a majority of about 85%. Around 95% of the population speak Norwegian as their first or native language, although many speak dialects that may differ significantly from the written languages.\n\n## Cuisine\n\nNorway's culinary traditions show the influence of long seafaring and farming traditions, with salmon (fresh and cured), herring (pickled or marinated), trout, codfish, and other seafood, balanced by cheeses (such as brunost, Jarlsberg cheese, and gamalost), dairy products, and breads (predominantly dark/darker).\n\n## Sports\n\nSports are a central part of Norwegian culture, and popular sports include cross-country skiing, ski jumping, mountaineering, hiking, association football, handball, biathlon, speed skating, and, to a lesser degree, ice hockey.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of Norway-related

part has a mostly maritime Subarctic climate, while Svalbard has an Arctic tundra climate The southern and western parts of Norway, fully exposed to Atlantic storm fronts, experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts Areas to the east of the coastal mountains are in a rain shadow, and have lower rain and snow totals than the west The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest summers, but also cold weather and snow in wintertime The sunniest weather is along the south coast, but sometimes even the coast far north can be very sunny – the sunniest month with 430 sun hours was recorded in Tromsø [98] [99]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nNorway has a larger number of different habitats than almost any other European country There are

minority rights, and LGBT rights As early as 1884, 171 of the leading figures, among them five Prime Ministers, co-founded the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights [141] They successfully campaigned for women's right to education, women's suffrage, the right to work, and other gender equality policies From the 1970s, gender equality also came high on the state agenda, with the establishment of a public body to promote gender equality, which evolved into the Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud Civil society organisations also continue to play an important role; women's rights organisations are today organised in the Norwegian Women's Lobby umbrella organisation.\n\n\nForeign relations\nNorway maintains embassies in 82 countries [147] 60 countries maintain an

mobilisation produces approximately 83,000 combatant personnel Norway has conscription (including 6–12 months of training); [150] in 2013, the country became the first in Europe and NATO to draft women as well as men However, due to less need for conscripts after the Cold War, few people have to serve if they are not motivated [151] The Armed Forces are subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Defence The Commander-in-Chief is King Harald V The military of Norway is divided into the Norwegian Army, the Royal Norwegian Navy, the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the Norwegian Cyber Defence Force

in recent years implemented rail, road, and air transport through numerous subsidiaries to develop the country's infrastructure [185] Under discussion is development of a new high-speed rail system between the nation's largest cities [186] [187]\n\n\nResearch\nInternationally recognised Norwegian scientists include the mathematicians Niels Henrik Abel and Sophus Lie Caspar Wessel was the first to describe vectors and complex numbers in the complex plane Ernst S Selmer's advanced research lead to the modernisation of crypto-algorithms Thoralf Skolem made revolutionary contributions to mathematical logic Øystein Ore and Ludwig Sylow made important contributions in group theory Atle Selberg was one of the most significant mathematicians of the 20th century, for which he was awarded a Fields Medal, Wolf Prize and Abel Prize.\n\n\nTourism\nIn 2008, Norway ranked 17th in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report [210] Tourism in Norway contributed to 4.2% of the gross domestic product as reported in 2016 [211] Every one in fifteen people throughout the country work in the tourism industry [211] Tourism is seasonal in Norway, with more than half of total tourists visiting between the months of May and August [211]\n\n\nDemographics\nNorway's population was 5,384,576 people in the third quarter of 2020 [212] Norwegians are an ethnic North Germanic people The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2018 was estimated at 1.56 children born per woman, [213] below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 4.69 children born per woman in 1877 [214] In 2018 the median age of the Norwegian population was 39.3 years.\n\n\nPopulation\nNorway's population was 5,384,576 people in the third quarter of 2020 [212] Norwegians

high of 4.69 children born per woman in 1877 [214] In 2018 the median age of the Norwegian population was 39.3 years.\n\n\nMigration\nParticularly in the 19th century, when economic conditions were difficult in Norway, tens of thousands of people migrated to the United States and Canada, where they could work and buy land in frontier areas Many went to the Midwest and Pacific Northwest In 2006, according to the US Census Bureau, almost 4.7 million persons identified as Norwegian Americans, [219] which was larger than the population of ethnic Norwegians in Norway itself [220] In the 2011 Canadian census, 452,705 Canadian citizens identified as having Norwegian ancestry [221]\n\n\nReligion\nSeparation of church and state happened significantly later in Norway than in most of Europe, and remains incomplete In 2012, the Norwegian parliament voted to grant the Church of Norway greater autonomy, [226] a decision which was confirmed in a constitutional amendment on 21 May 2012 [227]\n\n\nChurch of Norway\nSeparation of church and state happened significantly later in Norway than in most of Europe, and remains incomplete In 2012, the Norwegian parliament voted to grant the Church of Norway greater autonomy, [226] a decision which was confirmed in a constitutional amendment on 21 May 2012 [227]\n\n\nReligious affiliation\nOfficial religious affiliation in Norway (31 December 2019): [231] [232] [233]\n\n\nIndigenous religions\nAs in other Scandinavian countries, the ancient Norse followed a form of Germanic paganism known as Norse paganism By the end of the 11th century, when Norway had been Christianised, the indigenous Norse religion and practices were prohibited Remnants of the native religion and beliefs of Norway survive today in the form of names, referential names of cities and locations, the days of the week, and everyday language Modern interest in the old ways has led to a revival of pagan religious practices in the form of Åsatru The Norwegian Åsatrufellesskapet Bifrost formed in 1996; in 2011, the fellowship had about 300 members Foreningen Forn Sed was formed in 1999 and has been recognised by the Norwegian government.\n\n\nHealth\nNorway was awarded first place according to the UN's Human Development Index (HDI) for 2013 [247] From the 1900s, improvements in public health occurred as a result of development in several areas such as social and living conditions, changes in disease and medical outbreaks, establishment of the health care system, and emphasis on public health matters Vaccination and increased treatment opportunities with antibiotics resulted in great improvements within the Norwegian population Improved hygiene and better nutrition were factors that contributed to improved health.\n\n\nEducation\nHigher education in Norway is offered by a range of seven universities, five specialised colleges, 25 university colleges as well as a range of private colleges Education follows the Bologna Process involving Bachelor (3 years), Master (2 years) and PhD (3 years) degrees [250] Acceptance is offered after finishing upper secondary school with general study competence.\n\n\nLanguages\nNorwegian in its two forms, Bokmål and Nynorsk, is the main national official language of all of Norway Sámi, a group which includes three separate languages, is recognised as a minority language on the national level and is a co-official language alongside Norwegian in the Sámi administrative linguistic area (Forvaltningsområdet for samisk språk) in Northern Norway [1] Kven is a minority language and is a co-official language alongside Norwegian in one municipality, also in Northern Norway [256] [257] [258]\n\n\nNorwegian\nNorwegian is a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse It is the main national language of Norway and is spoken throughout the country Norwegian is spoken natively by over 5 million people mainly in Norway, but is generally understood throughout Scandinavia and to a lesser degree other Nordic countries It has two official written forms, Bokmål and Nynorsk Both are used in public administration, schools, churches, and media Bokmål is the written language used by a majority of about 85% Around 95% of the population speak Norwegian as their first or native language, although many speak dialects that may differ significantly from the written languages Norwegian dialects are mutually intelligible, although listeners with limited exposure to dialects other than their own may struggle with certain phrases and pronunciations.\n\n\nSámi and Kven\nSeveral Uralic Sámi languages, which are related but not generally mutually intelligible, are traditionally spoken by the Sámi people primarily in Northern Norway and to much lesser extent in some parts of Central Norway Around 15,000 people have officially registered as Sámi in the Sámi census (Samemanntallet), but the number of people of recent Sámi heritage is often estimated at 50,000 people The number of people who have some knowledge of Northern Sámi, including as a second language, is estimated at 25,000 people, but only a minority are native speakers The other Sámi languages are heavily endangered and spoken by at most a few hundred people Most people of Sámi heritage are today native speakers of Norwegian as a result of past assimilation policies [260]\n\n\nOther languages\nSome supporters have also advocated making Norwegian Sign Language an official language [266] [267]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Norwegian farm culture continues to play a role in contemporary Norwegian culture In the 19th century, it inspired a strong romantic nationalistic movement, which is still visible in the Norwegian language and media Norwegian culture expanded with nationalist efforts to achieve an independent identity in the areas of literature, art and music This continues today in the performing arts and as a result of government support for exhibitions, cultural projects and artwork [269]\n\n\nCinema\nNorwegian cinema has received international recognition The documentary film Kon-Tiki (1950) won an Academy Award Another notable film is The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix, an animated feature film directed by Ivo Caprino The film was released in 1975 and is the most widely seen Norwegian film of all time [citation needed] Nils Gaup's Pathfinder (1987), the story of the Sámi, was nominated for an Oscar Berit Nesheim's The Other Side of Sunday was nominated for an Oscar in 1997.\n\n\nMusic\nThe classical music of the romantic composers Edvard Grieg, Rikard Nordraak and Johan Svendsen is internationally known, as is the modern music of Arne Nordheim Norway's classical performers include Leif Ove Andsnes, a pianist; Truls Mørk, an outstanding cellist; and the Wagnerian soprano Kirsten Flagstad.\n\n\nLiterature\nThe history of Norwegian literature starts with the pagan Eddaic poems and skaldic verse of the ninth and tenth centuries, with poets such as Bragi Boddason and Eyvindr skáldaspillir The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European medieval learning, hagiography and history writing Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence, this influenced the literature written in the late 12th and early 13th centuries Major works of that period include Historia Norwegiæ, Þiðrekssaga and Konungs skuggsjá.\n\n\nArchitecture\nWith expansive forests, Norway has long had a tradition of building in wood Many of today's most interesting new buildings are made of wood, reflecting the strong appeal that this material continues to hold for Norwegian designers and builders [278]\n\n\nArt\nFor an extended period, the Norwegian art scene was dominated by artwork from Germany and Holland as well as by the influence of Copenhagen It was in the 19th century that a truly Norwegian era began, first with portraits, later with impressive landscapes Johan Christian Dahl, originally from the Dresden school, eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.\" [280]\n\n\nCuisine\nNorway's culinary traditions show the influence of long seafaring and farming traditions, with salmon (fresh and cured), herring (pickled or marinated), trout, codfish, and other seafood, balanced by cheeses (such as brunost, Jarlsberg cheese, and gamalost), dairy products, and breads (predominantly dark/darker).\n\n\nSports\nSports are a central part of Norwegian culture, and popular sports include cross-country skiing, ski jumping, mountaineering, hiking, association football, handball, biathlon, speed skating, and, to a lesser degree, ice hockey.\n\n\nSee also\n61°N 8°E﻿ / ﻿61°N 8°E﻿ / 61; 8\n\nNotes\n61°N

eliminated in the group stage of the 1974 World Cup, and failed to qualify to Argentina 1978 It wasn't until the late 1970s that Uruguayan football began to see hope as their under-20 team won four

largely dominated by Argentina by winning their eighth South American championship in 1942 As the World Cup was not being played, this championship became the priority.\n\n\n1970s–1980s\nIn 1970, Uruguay established themselves again as one of the world's best teams when they advanced to their fourth World Cup semi-final in Mexico 1970, losing to eventual winners Brazil After that came the biggest downturn in the country's footballing history as they were eliminated in the group stage of the 1974 World Cup, and failed to qualify to Argentina 1978 It wasn't until the late 1970s that Uruguayan football began to see hope as their under-20 team won four consecutive South American titles from 1975 to 1981, as well as reaching the U20 World Cup semi-final in 1979.\n\n\n1990s–2000s\nIn the 1990 World Cup in Italy, Uruguay were eliminated in the Round of 16 against hosts Italy 2–0 in Rome Afterwards, Uruguay would fail to qualify for 1994 after losing 2–0 to Brazil in decisive match at Maracanã Stadium La Celeste would win their next big encounter against the Brazilians when they beat the reigning world champions to win the 1995 Copa America in Montevideo Later, Uruguay were eliminated from the 1998 World Cup as they finished in seventh place in the first time qualifying had been done in one group.\n\n\n2010s–2022\nIn 2010, a new generation of footballers, led by Luis Suárez, Diego Forlán and Edinson Cavani, formed a team that finishing fourth in the 2010 World Cup Uruguay opened the tournament with a goalless draw against France, followed by wins against South Africa (3–0) and Mexico (1–0) respectively, finishing at the top of their group with seven points In the second round, they played South Korea, defeating them 2–1 with star striker Luis Suárez scoring a brace and earning Uruguay a spot in the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970 Against Ghana, the match finished 1–1, forcing the game into extra-time Both sides had their chances at extra time but Suárez blocked the ball with his hand in the penalty area, earning Suárez a red card and earning Uruguay universal scorn Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan missed the subsequent penalty, forcing the game to go into penalties where Uruguay would win 4–2, sending them into the last four They played the Netherlands in the semi-finals but were beaten 3–2 For the third-place match, they played Germany, again losing 3–2 This placed Uruguay in fourth place for the tournament, their best result in 40 years Forlán was awarded the Player of The Tournament.\n\n\nTeam image\nBetween 1901 and 1910,

his father bought him a pink Fender bass guitar, [3] the same as that used by McVie's major early musical influence Jet Harris, the Shadows' bass player.\n\n\nCareer\nMcVie's first experience making

Strangers performing Shadows covers.\n\n\nJohn Mayall and the Bluesbreakers\nAround the time of McVie's tenure as a tax inspector, John Mayall began forming a Chicago-style blues band, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers Initially Mayall wanted to recruit bass player Cliff Barton of the Cyril Davies All Stars for the rhythm section of his new band Barton declined, however, but gave him McVie's phone number, urging Mayall to give the talented young bass player a chance in the Bluesbreakers [5] Mayall contacted McVie, and asked him to audition for his band Soon thereafter, McVie got an offer to play bass in the Bluesbreakers McVie accepted while still holding down his daytime job for a further nine months before becoming a musician full-time [7] Under Mayall's tutelage, McVie, not having had any formal training in music, learned to play the blues mainly by listening to B.B King and Willie Dixon records given to him by Mayall McVie was the band's bassist for four and a half years During

Hard Road, drummer Aynsley Dunbar was replaced by Mick Fleetwood Green, McVie, and Fleetwood quickly forged a strong personal relationship, and when John Mayall gave Green some free studio time for his birthday, Green asked McVie and Fleetwood to join him for a recording session Produced by Mike Vernon, they recorded three tracks together, \"Curly\", \"Rubber Duck\", and an instrumental called \"Fleetwood Mac\" [8] Later the same year, after having been replaced by Mick Taylor in the Bluesbreakers, Green opted to form his own band, which he called \"Fleetwood Mac\" after his preferred

Keen-Minshull has also been involved in various public controversies, including a high-profile debate over the inclusion of a trans athlete in the NCAA Division I Women's Swimming Championship.\n\n**Biography**\n\nKeen-Minshull's activism has been centered around the idea that sex and gender are distinct concepts, and that sex is a biological fact that cannot be changed. She has argued that policies and laws that allow transgender individuals to change their legal sex are a threat to women's rights and safety. In 2018, Keen-Minshull began promoting the term \"adult human female\" to define a woman, which she believes is a more accurate and inclusive term than the term \"woman\" itself.\n\n**Keen-Minshull's Activism**\n\nKeen-Minshull's activism has included opposition to various policies and laws that allow transgender individuals to be legally recognized as their gender. She has opposed the UK Gender Recognition Act, which allows individuals to change their legal sex through a process of self-identification. Keen-Minshull has also opposed the use of public bathrooms by transgender individuals according to their gender, arguing that this creates a safety risk for women and girls.

The term has become associated with gender-critical feminism, a movement that argues that sex and gender are distinct concepts and that sex is a biological fact that cannot be changed.

Sussex police reported three arrests at the event.\n\n**United Kingdom & United States**\n\nKeen-Minshull's activism has gained international attention, particularly in the United States.

The protest was met with counter-protesters, and Keen-Minshull appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight to discuss the issue.\n\n**Australia**\n\nIn January 2023, Keen-Minshull announced plans to tour Australia and New Zealand in March 2023. The tour was met with controversy, with the Australian Greens' spokesperson for LGBTQIA+ communities, Stephen Bates, writing to the Immigration Minister to ask him to revoke Keen-Minshull's visa. A petition was also launched on Change.org to oppose the visa, which gathered over 11,000 signatures before being removed due to Australia's defamation laws.\n\n**New Zealand**\n\nFollowing her Melbourne event, Keen-Minshull's permission to enter New Zealand was put under review by Immigration New Zealand. The review was met with public debate, with the center-right National Party's deputy leader, Nicola Willis, arguing that Keen-Minshull should be allowed into the country on free speech grounds. The left-wing Green Party's immigration spokesperson, Ricardo Menéndez March, argued that Keen-Minshull's presence would endanger the LGBT and Muslim communities. The review ultimately decided to allow Keen-Minshull to enter New Zealand, but a coalition of LGBT support groups filed for a judicial review of the decision. The High Court at Wellington ultimately ruled that the decision was lawful.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nIn September 2022, Keen-Minshull announced her plan to run for MP of Sheffield Central, citing her opposition to the Gender Recognition Act and her desire to \"erase the word 'gender'\". During her livestreamed announcement, she also called the hijab \"atrocious\" and a \"tool of oppression\", and referred to Tucker Carlson as \"an intelligent, really lovely, welcoming, warmly

could not hold the position of President of the Russian Federation for more than two consecutive terms, which allowed Vladimir Putin to become president in 2012 for a third term not consecutive with his prior terms [31] The constitutional reform established a hard limit of two terms overall However, terms served before the constitutional revision do not count, which gives Putin eligibility for two more presidential terms until 2036 [32]\n\n\nCandidates\nThe individuals below appeared on the ballot [34]\n\n\nRejected candidates\nIndividuals in this section have had their document submissions accepted by the CEC to register their participation, and later gathered the necessary signatures from voters The deadline to submit documents was 27 December 2023 for independents and 1 January 2024

December 2023, somewhat unconventionally, the party decided that Grigory Yavlinsky would run for president as its nominee if he obtains 10 million signatures from potential voters, [66] which is higher than the total number of votes Yavlinsky obtained during his most successful run for president (5.55 million) [67] Yabloko later stated that it would not be nominating any candidate [68]

Valley indicates that Madhya Pradesh might have been inhabited in the Middle Pleistocene era [16] Painted pottery dated to the later mesolithic period has been found in the Bhimbetka rock shelters [17] Chalcolithic sites belonging to Kayatha culture (2100–1800 BCE) and Malwa culture (1700–1500 BCE) have been discovered in the western part of the state [18] Madhya Pradesh is also the world's

{"title": "Kerala", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe word Kerala is first recorded as Keralaputo ('son of Chera  [s]') in a 3rd-century-BCE rock inscription left by the Maurya emperor Ashoka (274–237 BCE), one of his edicts pertaining to welfare [28] At that time, one of three states in the region was called Cheralam in Classical Tamil: Chera and Kera are variants of the same word [29] The word Cheral refers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings and is derived from the Old Tamil word for 'lake' [30] Keralam may stem from the Classical Tamil cherive-alam 'declivity of a hill or a mountain slope' [31] or chera alam 'land of the Cheras'.\n\n\nMalabar\nKerala was alternatively called Malabar in the foreign trade circles Earlier, the term Malabar had also been used to denote Tulu Nadu and Kanyakumari which lie contiguous to Kerala on the southwestern coast of India, in addition to the modern state of Kerala [38] [39] The people of Malabar were known as Malabars Until the arrival of the East India Company, the term Malabar was used as a general name for Kerala, along with the term Kerala [16] From the time of Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century CE) itself, the Arab sailors used to call Kerala as Male The first element of the name, however, is attested already in the Topography written by Cosmas Indicopleustes This mentions a pepper emporium called Male, which clearly gave its name to Malabar ('the country of Male') The name Male is thought to come from the Dravidian word Mala ('hill') [40] [41] Al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) is the first known writer to call this country Malabar [16] Authors such as Ibn Khordadbeh and Al-Baladhuri mention Malabar ports in their works [42] The Arab writers had called this place Malibar, Manibar, Mulibar, and Munibar Malabar is reminiscent of the word Malanad which means the land of hills [43] According to William Logan, the word Malabar comes from a combination of the Dravidian word Mala (hill) and the Persian/Arabic word Barr (country/continent) [44]\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to the Sangam classic Purananuru, the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas [45] Lacking worthy enemies, he besieged the sea by throwing his spear into it [45] [46] According to the 17th-century Hindu mythology work Keralolpathi, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parashurama Kshetram 'The Land of Parashurama' in Hindu mythology) [47] Parashurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached According to the legendary account, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari [48] The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parashurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land P T Srinivasa Iyengar theorised, that Senguttuvan may have been inspired by the Parashurama legendary account, which was brought by early Aryan settlers [49]\n\n\nTraditional sources\nAccording to the Sangam classic Purananuru, the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas [45] Lacking worthy enemies, he

protectors and guardians of the land P T Srinivasa Iyengar theorised, that Senguttuvan may have been inspired by the Parashurama legendary account, which was brought by early Aryan settlers [49]\n\n\nCheraman Perumals\nThe legend of Cheraman Perumals is the medieval tradition associated with the Cheraman Perumals (literally the Chera kings) of Kerala [56] The validity of the legend as a source of history once generated much debate among South Indian historians [57] The legend was used by Kerala chiefdoms for the legitimation of their rule (most of the major chiefly houses in medieval Kerala traced its origin back to the legendary allocation by the Perumal) [58] [59] According to the legend, Rayar, the overlord of the Cheraman Perumal in a country east of the Ghats, invaded Kerala during the rule of the last Perumal To drive back the invading forces the Perumal summoned the militia of his chieftains (like Udaya Varman Kolathiri, Manichchan, and Vikkiran of Eranad) The Cheraman Perumal was assured by the Eradis (chief of Eranad) that they would take a fort established by the Rayar [60] The battle lasted for three days and the Rayar eventually evacuated his fort (and it was seized by the Perumal's troops) [60] Then the last Cheraman Perumal divided Kerala or Chera kingdom among his chieftains and disappeared mysteriously The Kerala people never more heard any tidings of him [56] [58] [59] The Eradis of Nediyiruppu, who later came to be known as the Zamorins of Kozhikode, who were left out in cold during allocation of the land, was granted the Cheraman Perumal's sword (with the permission to \"die, and kill, and seize\") [59] [60]\n\n\nPre-history\nA substantial portion of Kerala including the western coastal lowlands and the plains of the midland may have been under the sea in ancient times Marine fossils have been found in an area near Changanassery, thus supporting the hypothesis [61] Pre-historical archaeological findings include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the Marayur area of the Idukki district, which lie on the eastern highland made by Western Ghats They are locally known as \"muniyara\", derived from muni (hermit or sage) and ara (dolmen) [62] Rock engravings in the Edakkal Caves, in Wayanad date back to the Neolithic era around 6000 BCE [63] [64] Archaeological studies have identified Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic sites in Kerala [65] The studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age, through the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic Ages [66] Foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation; [67] historians suggest a possible relationship with Indus Valley civilisation during the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age [68]\n\n\nAncient period\nKerala has been a major spice exporter since 3000 BCE, according to Sumerian records and it is still referred to as the \"Garden of Spices\" or as the \"Spice Garden of India\" [69] [70]: 79  Kerala's spices attracted ancient Arabs, Babylonians, Assyrians and Egyptians to the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE Phoenicians established trade with Kerala during this period [71] Arabs and Phoenicians were the first to enter Malabar Coast to trade Spices [71] The Arabs on the coasts of Yemen, Oman, and the Persian Gulf, must have made the first long voyage to Kerala and other eastern countries [71] They must have brought the Cinnamon of Kerala to the Middle East [71] The Greek historian Herodotus (5th century BCE) records that in his time the cinnamon spice industry was monopolized by the Egyptians and the Phoenicians [71]\n\n\nEarly medieval period\nA second Chera Kingdom (c 800–1102), also known as Kulasekhara dynasty of Mahodayapuram (present-day Kodungallur), was established by Kulasekhara Varman, [88] which ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu During the early part of the Kulasekara period, the southern region from Nagercoil to Thiruvalla was ruled by Ay kings, who lost their power in the 10th century, making the region a part of the Kulasekara empire [89] [90] Under Kulasekhara rule, Kerala witnessed a developing period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism [91] A Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils, became linguistically separate during this period around the seventh century [92] The origin of Malayalam calendar dates back to year 825 CE [93] [94] [95] For local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Naduvazhis, with each province comprising a number of Desams under the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis [91] Mamankam festival, which was the largest native festival, was held at Tirunavaya near Kuttippuram, on the bank of river Bharathappuzha [43] [16] Athavanad, the headquarters of Azhvanchery Thamprakkal, who were also considered as the supreme religious chief of the Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala, is also located near Tirunavaya [43] [16]\n\n\nThe rise of Kozhikode\nAfter his death, in the absence of a strong central power, the state was divided into 30 small warring principalities; the most powerful of them were the kingdom of Zamorin of Kozhikode in the north, Kollam in the far-south, Kochi in the south, and Kannur in the far north The port at Kozhikode held the superior economic and political position in Kerala, while Kollam (Quilon), Kochi, and Kannur (Cannanore) were commercially confined to secondary roles [102] The Zamorin of Calicut was originally the ruler of Eranad, which was a minor principality located in the northern parts of present-day Malappuram district [16] [103] The Zamorin allied with Arab and Chinese merchants and used most of the wealth from Kozhikode to develop his military power Kozhikode became the most powerful kingdom in the Malayalam speaking region during the Middle Ages [104] [103]\n\n\nVijayanagara Conquests\nThe king Deva Raya II (1424–1446) of the Vijayanagara Empire conquered the entirety of present-day state of Kerala in the 15th century [103] He defeated the Zamorin of Kozhikode, as well as the ruler of Kollam around 1443 [103] Fernão Nunes says that the Zamorin had to pay tribute to the king of Vijayanagara Empire [103] Later Kozhikode and Venad seem to have rebelled against their Vijayanagara overlords, but Deva Raya II quelled the rebellion [103] As the Vijayanagara power diminished over the next fifty years, the Zamorin of Kozhikode again rose to prominence in Kerala [103] He built a fort at Ponnani in 1498 [103]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nThe maritime spice trade monopoly in the Arabian Sea stayed with the Arabs during the High and Late Middle Ages However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery After Vasco Da Gama's arrival in Kappad, Kozhikode in 1498, the Portuguese began to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular [a] [110] [111] [112] Following the discovery of sea route from Europe to Malabar in 1498, the Portuguese began to expand their territories and ruled the seas between Ormus and the Malabar Coast and south to Ceylon [113] [114] They established a trading centre at Tangasseri in Quilon during 1502 as per the invitation of the then Queen of Quilon to start spices trade from there [115]\n\n\nThe Kingdoms of Travancore and Cochin, and British influences\nThe Dutch in turn were weakened by constant battles with Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Royal Family, and were defeated at the Battle of Colachel in 1741 [124] An agreement, known as \"Treaty of Mavelikkara\", was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvement in the region [125] [126] [127] In the 18th Century, Travancore King Sree Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma annexed all the kingdoms up to Cochin through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to pre-eminence in Kerala [128] The Kochi ruler sued for peace with Anizham Thirunal and the northern and north-central parts of Kerala (Malabar District), along with Fort Kochi, Tangasseri, and Anchuthengu in southern Kerala, came under direct British rule until India became independent [129] [130] Travancore became the dominant state in Kerala by defeating the powerful Zamorin of Kozhikode in the battle of Purakkad in 1755 [131]\n\n\nAs a state of the Republic of India\nAfter India was partitioned in 1947 into India and Pakistan, Travancore and Kochi, part of the Union of India were merged on 1 July 1949 to form Travancore-Cochin [144] On 1 November 1956, the taluk of Kasargod in the South Kanara district of Madras, the Malabar district of Madras (excluding the islands of Lakshadweep), and Travancore-Cochin, without four southern taluks and Sengottai taluk (which joined Tamil Nadu), merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act [17] [145] [146] A Communist-led government under E M S Namboodiripad resulted from the first elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957 [146] It was one of the earliest elected Communist governments anywhere [147] [148] [149] His government implemented land and educational reforms which in turn, reduced income inequality in the state [150]\n\n\nGeography\nThe state is wedged between the Lakshadweep Sea and the Western Ghats Lying between northern latitudes 8°18' and 12°48' and eastern longitudes 74°52' and 77°22', [151] Kerala experiences humid tropical rainforest climate with some cyclones The state has a coast of 590 km (370 mi) [152] and the width of the state varies between 11 and 121 kilometres (7 and 75 mi) [153] Geographically, Kerala can be divided into three climatically distinct regions: the eastern highlands; rugged and cool mountainous terrain, the central mid-lands; rolling hills, and the western lowlands; coastal plains [70]: 110  Pre-Cambrian and Pleistocene geological formations compose the bulk of Kerala's terrain [154] [155] A catastrophic flood in Kerala in 1341 CE drastically modified its terrain and consequently affected its history; it also created a natural harbour for spice transport [156]\nThe eastern region of Kerala consists of high mountains, gorges and deep-cut valleys immediately west of the Western Ghats' rain shadow [70]: 110  41 of Kerala's west-flowing rivers, [157] and 3 of its east-flowing ones originate in this region [158] [159] The Western Ghats form a wall of mountains interrupted only near Palakkad; hence also known Palghat, where the Palakkad Gap breaks [160] The Western Ghats rise on average to 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) above sea level, [161] while the highest peaks reach around 2,500 metres (8,200 feet) [162] Anamudi in the Idukki district is the highest peak in south India, is at an elevation of 2,695 m (8,842 ft) [163] The Western Ghats mountain chain is recognised as one of the world's eight \"hottest hotspots\" of biological diversity and is listed among UNESCO World Heritage Sites [164] The chain's forests are considered to be older than the Himalaya mountains [164] The Athirappilly Falls, which is situated on the background of Western Ghat mountain ranges, is also known as The Niagara of India [165] It is located in the Chalakudy River and is the largest waterfall in the state [165] Wayanad is the sole Plateau in Kerala [166] The eastern regions in the districts of Wayanad, Malappuram (Chaliyar valley at Nilambur), and Palakkad (Attappadi Valley), which together form parts of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and a continuation of the Mysore Plateau, are known for natural Gold fields, along with the adjoining districts of Karnataka [167] Minerals including Ilmenite, Monazite, Thorium, and Titanium, are found in the coastal belt of Kerala [168] Kerala's coastal belt of Karunagappally is known for high background radiation from thorium-containing monazite sand In some coastal panchayats, median outdoor radiation levels are more than 4 mGy/yr and, in certain locations on the coast, it is as high as 70 mGy/yr [169]\n\n\nClimate\nWith around 120–140 rainy days per year, [181]: 80  Kerala has a wet and maritime tropical climate influenced by the seasonal heavy rains of the southwest summer monsoon and northeast winter monsoon [182] Around 65% of the rainfall occurs from June to August corresponding to the Southwest monsoon, and the rest from September to December corresponding to Northeast monsoon [182] The moisture-laden winds of the Southwest monsoon, on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula, because of its topography, divides into two branches; the \"Arabian Sea Branch\" and the \"Bay of Bengal Branch\" [183] The \"Arabian Sea Branch\" of the Southwest monsoon first hits the Western Ghats, [184] making Kerala the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest monsoon [185] [186] The distribution of pressure patterns is reversed in the Northeast monsoon, during this season the cold winds from North India pick up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and precipitate it on the east coast of peninsular India [187] [188] In Kerala, the influence of the Northeast monsoon is seen in southern districts only [189] Kerala's rainfall averages 2,923 mm (115 in) annually [190] Some of Kerala's drier lowland regions average only 1,250 mm (49 in); the mountains of the eastern Idukki district receive more than 5,000 mm (197 in) of orographic precipitation: the highest in the state In eastern Kerala, a drier tropical wet and dry climate prevails During the summer, the state is prone to gale-force winds, storm surges, cyclone-related torrential downpours, occasional droughts, and rises in sea level [191]: 26, 46, 52  The mean daily temperature ranges from 19.8 °C to 36.7 °C [192] Mean annual temperatures range from 25.0 to 27.5 °C in the coastal lowlands to 20.0–22.5 °C in the eastern highlands [191]: 65 \n\n\nFlora and fauna\nMost of the biodiversity is concentrated and protected in the Western Ghats Three-quarters of the land area of Kerala was under thick forest up to the 18th century [193] As of 2004 [update], over 25% of India's 15,000 plant species are in Kerala Out of the 4,000 flowering plant species; 1,272 of which are endemic to Kerala, 900 are medicinal, and 159 are threatened [194]: 11  Its 9,400 km2 of forests include tropical wet evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (lower and middle elevations—3,470 km2), tropical moist and dry deciduous forests (mid-elevations—4,100 km2 and 100 km2, respectively), and montane subtropical and temperate (shola) forests (highest elevations—100 km2) Altogether, 24% of Kerala is forested [194]: 12  Four of the world's Ramsar Convention listed wetlands—Lake Sasthamkotta, Ashtamudi Lake, Thrissur-Ponnani Kole Wetlands, and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands—are in Kerala, [195] as well as 1455.4 km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and 1828 km2 of the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve [196] Subjected to extensive clearing for cultivation in the 20th century, [197]: 6–7  much of the remaining forest cover is now protected from clearfelling [198] Eastern Kerala's windward mountains shelter tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests, which are common in the Western Ghats [199] [200] The world's oldest teak plantation 'Conolly's Plot' is in Nilambur [201]\n\n\nDivisions, districts and cities\nThe state's 14 districts are distributed among six regions: North Malabar (far-north Kerala), South Malabar (north-central Kerala), Kochi (central Kerala), Northern Travancore (south-central Kerala), Central Travancore (southern Kerala) and Southern Travancore (far-south Kerala) The districts which serve as administrative regions for taxation purposes are further subdivided into 27 revenue subdivisions and 77 taluks, which have fiscal and administrative powers over settlements within their borders, including maintenance of local land records Kerala's taluks are further sub-divided into 1,674 revenue villages [206] [207]\nSince the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution of India, the local government institutions function as the third tier of government, which constitutes 14 District Panchayats, 152 Block panchayats, 941 Grama Panchayats, 87 Municipalities, six Municipal Corporations and one Township [208]\nMahé, a part of the Indian union territory of Puducherry, [209] though 647 kilometres (402 mi) away from it, [210] is a coastal exclave surrounded by Kerala on all of its landward approaches The Kannur District surrounds Mahé on three sides with the Kozhikode District on the fourth [211]\n\n\nGovernment and administration\nThe state is governed by a parliamentary system of representative democracy Kerala has a unicameral legislature The Kerala Legislative Assembly also known as Niyamasabha, consists of 140 members who are elected for five-year terms [217] The state elects 20 members to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, and 9 members to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house [218]\n\n\nEconomy\nAfter independence, the state was managed as a social democratic welfare economy [237] The \"Kerala phenomenon\" or \"Kerala model of development\" of very high human development and in comparison low economic development has resulted from a strong service sector [191]: 48  [238]: 1  In 2019–20, the tertiary sector contributed around 63% of the state's GSVA, compared to 28% by secondary sector, and 8% by primary sector [26] In the period between 1960 and 2020, Kerala's economy was gradually shifting from an agrarian economy into a service-based one [26]\n\n\nIndustries\nTraditional industries manufacturing items; coir, handlooms, and handicrafts employ around one million people [262] Kerala supplies 60% of the total global produce of white coir fibre India's first coir factory was set up in Alleppey in 1859–60 [263] The Central Coir Research Institute was established there in 1959 As per the 2006–2007 census by SIDBI, there are 1,468,104 micro, small and medium enterprises in Kerala employing 3,031,272 people [264] [265] The KSIDC has promoted more than 650 medium and large manufacturing firms in Kerala, creating employment for 72,500 people [266] A mining sector of 0.3% of GSDP involves extraction of ilmenite, kaolin, bauxite, silica, quartz, rutile, zircon, and sillimanite [267] Other major sectors are tourism, medical sector, educational sector, banking, ship building, oil refinery, infrastructure, manufacturing, home gardens, animal husbandry and business process outsourcing.\n\n\nAgriculture\nThe major change in agriculture in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour [268] Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and a major portion of the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops [269] [270] Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high price of land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings [271] Only 27.3% of the families in Kerala depend upon agriculture for their livelihood, which is also the least curresponding rate in India [272]\n\n\nFisheries\nWith 590 kilometres (370 miles) of coastal belt, [285] 400,000 hectares of inland water resources [286] and approximately 220,000 active fishermen, [287] Kerala is one of the leading producers of fish in India [288] According to 2003–04 reports, about 11 lakh(1.1 million) people earn their livelihood from fishing and allied activities such as drying, processing, packaging, exporting and transporting fisheries The annual yield of the sector was estimated as 6,08,000 tons in 2003–04 [289] This contributes to about 3% of the total economy of the state In 2006, around 22% of the total Indian marine fishery yield was from Kerala [290] During the southwest monsoon, a suspended mud bank develops along the shore, which in turn leads to calm ocean water, peaking the output of the fishing industry This phenomenon is locally called chakara [291] [292] The waters provide a large variety of fish: pelagic species; 59%, demersal species; 23%, crustaceans, molluscs and others for 18% [290] Around 1050,000(1.050 million) fishermen haul an annual catch of 668,000 tonnes as of a 1999–2000 estimate; 222 fishing villages are strung along the 590-kilometre (370-mile) coast Another 113 fishing villages dot the hinterland.\n\n\nTransportation\nKerala has 331,904 kilometres (206,236 mi) of roads, which accounts for 5.6% of India's total [26] [293] This translates to about 9.94 kilometres (6.18 mi) of road per thousand people, compared to an average of 4.87 kilometres (3.03 mi) in the country [26] [293] Roads in Kerala include 1,812 kilometres (1,126 mi) of national highway; 1.6% of the nation's total, 4,342 kilometres (2,698 mi) of state highway; 2.5% of the nation's total, 27,470 kilometres (17,070 mi) of district roads; 4.7% of the nation's total, 33,201 kilometres (20,630 mi) of urban (municipal) roads; 6.3% of the nation's total, and 158,775 kilometres (98,658 mi) of rural roads; 3.8% of the nation's total [294] Kottayam has the maximum length of roads among the districts of Kerala, while Wayanad accounts for minimum [295] Most of Kerala's west coast is accessible through the NH 66 (previously NH 17 and 47); and the eastern side is accessible through state highways [296] New projects for hill and coastal highways were recently announced under KIIFB [297] National Highway 66, with the longest stretch of road (1,622 kilometres (1,008 mi)) connects Kanyakumari to Mumbai; it enters Kerala via Talapady in Kasargod and passes through Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Guruvayur, Kochi, Alappuzha, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram before entering Tamil Nadu [296] Palakkad district is generally referred to as the Gateway of Kerala, due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap in the Western Ghats, through which the northern (Malabar) and southern (Travancore) parts of Kerala are connected to the rest of India via road and rail The state's largest checkpoint, Walayar, is on NH 544, in the border town between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, through which a large amount of public and commercial transportation reaches the northern and central districts of Kerala [298]\n\n\nRoads\nKerala has 331,904 kilometres (206,236 mi) of roads, which accounts for 5.6% of India's total [26] [293] This translates to about 9.94 kilometres (6.18 mi) of road per thousand people, compared to an average of 4.87 kilometres (3.03 mi) in the country [26] [293] Roads in Kerala include 1,812 kilometres (1,126 mi) of national highway; 1.6% of the nation's total, 4,342 kilometres (2,698 mi) of state highway; 2.5% of the nation's total, 27,470 kilometres (17,070 mi) of district roads; 4.7% of the nation's total, 33,201 kilometres (20,630 mi) of urban (municipal) roads; 6.3% of the nation's total, and 158,775 kilometres (98,658 mi) of rural roads; 3.8% of the nation's total [294] Kottayam has the maximum length of roads among the districts of Kerala, while Wayanad accounts for minimum [295] Most of Kerala's west coast is accessible through the NH 66 (previously NH 17 and 47); and the eastern side is accessible through state highways [296] New projects for hill and coastal highways were recently announced under KIIFB [297] National Highway 66, with the longest stretch of road (1,622 kilometres (1,008 mi)) connects Kanyakumari to Mumbai; it enters Kerala via Talapady in Kasargod and passes through Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Guruvayur, Kochi, Alappuzha, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram before entering Tamil Nadu [296] Palakkad district is generally referred to as the Gateway of Kerala, due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap in the Western Ghats, through which the northern (Malabar) and southern (Travancore) parts of Kerala are connected to the rest of India via road and rail The state's largest checkpoint, Walayar, is on NH 544, in the border town between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, through which a large amount of public and commercial transportation reaches the northern and central districts of Kerala [298]\n\n\nKerala State Road Transport Corporation\nKerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is a state-owned road transport corporation It is one of the country's oldest state-run public bus transport services Its origins can be traced back to Travancore State Road Transport Department, when the Travancore government headed by Sri Chithra Thirunnal decided to set up a public road transportation system in 1937.\n\n\nRailways\nSouthern Railway zone of Indian Railways operates all railway lines in the state connecting most major towns and cities except those in the highland districts of Idukki and Wayanad [311] The railway network in the state is controlled by two out of six divisions of the Southern Railway; Thiruvananthapuram Railway division headquartered at Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad Railway Division headquartered at Palakkad [312] Thiruvananthapuram Central (TVC) is the busiest railway station in the state [313] Kerala's major railway stations are:\n\n\nKochi Metro\nKochi Metro is the metro rail system in the city of Kochi It is the only metro rail system in Kerala Construction began in 2012, with the first phase being set up at an estimated cost of ₹51.81 billion (US$620 million) [319] [320] The Kochi Metro uses 65-metre long Metropolis train sets built and designed by Alstom [321] [322] [323] It is the first metro system in India to use a communication-based train control (CBTC) system for signalling and telecommunication [324] In October 2017, Kochi Metro was named the \"Best Urban Mobility Project\" in India by the Urban Development Ministry, as part of the Urban Mobility India (UMI) International Conference hosted by the ministry every year [325]\n\n\nAirports\n\nKerala has four international airports: \n\nWater transport\nKerala has two major ports, four intermediate ports, and 13 minor ports, 4 of which have immigration check point facilities [332] [333] The major port in the state is at Kochi, which has an area of 8.27 km2 [334] The Vizhinjam International Seaport, which is currently classified as an major port, they only completed Phase I others are under construction [334] Other intermediate ports include Beypore, Kollam, and Azheekal [334] The remaining ports are classified as minor which include Manjeshwaram, Kasaragod, Nileshwaram, Kannur, Thalassery, Vadakara, Ponnani, Munambam, Manakodam, Alappuzha, Kayamkulam, Neendakara, and Valiyathura [334] The Kerala Maritime Institute is headquartered at Neendakara, which has an additional subcentre at Kodungallur too [334] The state has numerous backwaters, which are used for commercial inland navigation Transport services are mainly provided by country craft and passenger vessels There are 67 navigable rivers in the state while the total length of inland waterways is 1,687 kilometres (1,048 mi) [335] The main constraints to the expansion of inland navigation are; lack of depth in waterways caused by silting, lack of maintenance of navigation systems and bank protection, accelerated growth of the water hyacinth, lack of modern inland craft terminals, and lack of a cargo handling system.\n\n\nKochi water metro\nKochi Water Metro (KWM) is an integrated ferry transport system serving the Greater Kochi region in Kerala, India It is the first water metro system in India and the first integrated water transport system of this size in Asia, which connects Kochi's 10 island communities with the mainland through a fleet of 78 battery-operated electric hybrid boats plying along 38 terminals and 16 routes spanning 76 kilometres [337] It is integrated with the Kochi Metro and serves as a feeder service to the suburbs along the rivers where transport accessibility is limited [338]\n\n\nDemographics\nKerala is home to 2.8% of India's population; with a density of 859 persons per km2, its land is nearly three times as densely settled as the national average of 370 persons per km2 [340] As of 2011 [update], Thiruvananthapuram is the most populous city in Kerala [341] In the state, the rate of population growth is India's lowest, and the decadal growth of 4.9% in 2011 is less than one third of the all-India average of 17.6% [340] Kerala's population more than doubled between 1951 and 1991 by adding 15.6 million people to reach 29.1 million residents in 1991; the population stood at 33.3 million by 2011 [340] Kerala's coastal regions are the most densely settled with population of 2022 persons per km2, 2.5 times the overall population density of the state, 859 persons per km2, leaving the eastern hills and mountains comparatively sparsely populated [342] Kerala is the second-most urbanised major state in the country with 47.7% urban population according to the 2011 Census of India [23] Around 31.8 million Keralites are predominantly Malayali [340] The state's 321,000 indigenous tribal Adivasis, 1.1% of the population, are concentrated in the east [343]: 10–12 \n\n\n\nGender\nThere is a tradition of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother is the head of the household [344] As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families [345] Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, [346] which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it [347]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nKerala has been at the forefront of LGBT issues in India [351] Kerala is one of the first states in India to form a welfare policy for the transgender community In 2016, the Kerala government introduced free sex reassignment surgery through government hospitals [352] [353] [354] Queerala is one of the major LGBT organisations in Kerala It campaigns for increased awareness of LGBT people and sensitisation concerning healthcare services, workplace policies and educational curriculum [355] Since 2010, Kerala Queer Pride has been held annually across various cities in Kerala [356]\n\n\nHuman Development Index\nUnder a democratic communist local government, Kerala has achieved a record of social development much more advanced than the Indian average [361] As of 2015 [update], Kerala has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.770, which is in the \"high\" category, ranking it first in the country [9] It was 0.790 in 2007–08 [362] and it had a consumption-based HDI of 0.920, which is better than that of many developed countries [362] Comparatively higher spending by the government on primary level education, health care and the elimination of poverty from the 19th century onwards has helped the state maintain an exceptionally high HDI; [363] [364] the report was prepared by the central government's Institute of Applied Manpower Research [365] [366] However, the Human Development Report 2005, prepared by Centre for Development Studies envisages a virtuous phase of inclusive development for the state since the advancement in human development had already started aiding the economic development of the state [363] Kerala is also widely regarded as the cleanest and healthiest state in India [367]\n\n\nHealthcare\nKerala is a pioneer in implementing the universal health care program [392] The sub-replacement fertility level and infant mortality rate are lower compared to those of other states, estimated from 12 [191] [377]: 49  to 14 [393]: 5  deaths per 1,000 live births; as per the National Family Health Survey 2015–16, it has dropped to 6 [394] According to a study commissioned by Lien Foundation, a Singapore-based philanthropic organisation, Kerala is considered to be the best place to die in India based on the state's provision of palliative care for patients with serious illnesses [395] However, Kerala's morbidity rate is higher than that of any other Indian state—118 (rural) and 88 (urban) per 1,000 people The corresponding figures for all India were 55 and 54 per 1,000, respectively as of 2005 [update] [393]: 5  Kerala's 13.3% prevalence of low birth weight is higher than that of many first world nations [377] Outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis, and typhoid among the more than 50% of people who rely on 3 million water wells is an issue worsened by the lack of sewers [396]: 5–7  As of 2017, the state has the highest number of diabetes patients and also the highest prevalence rate of the disease in India [397]\n\n\nLanguage\nLanguages of Kerala (2011) [410]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Kerala (2011) [414]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts, including series expansion for trigonometric functions [454] [455] In the early decades of the 19th century, the modern educational transformation of Kerala was triggered by the efforts of the Church Mission Society missionaries to promote mass education [456] [457] [458] [459] [460] Following the recommendations of the Wood's despatch of 1854, the princely states of Travancore and Cochin launched mass education drives mainly based on castes and communities, and introduced a system of grant-in-aid to attract more private initiatives [461] The efforts by leaders such as Vaikunda Swami, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali, and Kuriakose Elias Chavara in aiding the socially discriminated castes in the state—with the help of community-based organisations like Nair Service Society, SNDP, Muslim Educational Society, Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and congregations of Christian churches—led to the further development of mass education in Kerala [461]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Kerala is composite and cosmopolitan in nature and it is an integral part of Indian culture [34] It is a synthesis of Aryan, Dravidian, Arab, and European cultures, [477] developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad [478] It is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people [479] It was elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures [480] However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions [34] Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year [481] The Malayalam calendar, a solar sidereal calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala, [482] finds common usage in planning agricultural and religious activities [483] Malayalam, one of the classical languages in India, is Kerala's official language [484] Over a dozen other scheduled and unscheduled languages are also spoken [410] Kerala has the greatest consumption of alcohol in India [485]\n\n\nFestivals\nMany of the temples in Kerala hold festivals on specific days of the year [486] A common characteristic of these festivals is the hoisting of a holy flag which is brought down on the final day of the festival after immersing the deity [487] Some festivals include Poorams, the best known of these being the Thrissur Pooram [488] \"Elephants, firework displays and huge crowds\" are the major attractions of Thrissur Pooram [489] Other known festivals are Makaravilakku, [490] Chinakkathoor Pooram, Attukal Pongala and Nenmara Vallangi Vela [491] Other than these, festivals locally known as utsavams are conducted by many temples mostly on annual basis Temples that can afford it will usually involve at least one richly caparisoned elephant as part of the festivities The idol in the temple is taken out on a procession around the countryside atop this elephant When the procession visits homes around the temple, people will usually present rice, coconuts, and other offerings to it [492] Processions often include traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam [493] Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are celebrated by the Muslim community of the state while the festivals like Christmas and Easter are observed by the Christians [16] Onam is a harvest festival celebrated by the people of Kerala and is reminiscent of the state's agrarian past [494] [495] It is a local festival of Kerala [496] consisting of a four-day public holidays; from Onam Eve (Uthradam) to the fourth Onam Day [497] Onam falls in the Malayalam month of Chingam (August–September) [498] and marks the commemoration of the homecoming of King Mahabali [499] The total duration of Onam is 10 days and it is celebrated all across Kerala It is one of the festivals celebrated with cultural elements such as Vallam Kali, [500] Pulikali, [501] Pookkalam, [502] Thumbi Thullal [503] and Onavillu [504]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nKerala is home to a number of performance arts These include five classical dance forms: Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Koodiyattom, Thullal and Krishnanattam, which originated and developed in the temple theatres during the classical period under the patronage of royal houses [505] Kerala natanam, Thirayattam, [506] Kaliyattam, Theyyam, Koothu and Padayani are other dance forms associated with the temple culture of the region [507] Some traditional dance forms such as Oppana and Duffmuttu were popular among the Muslims of the state, [508] while Margamkali and Parichamuttukali are popular among the Syrian Christians and Chavittu nadakom is popular among the Latin Christians [509] [510] The development of classical music in Kerala is attributed to the contributions it received from the traditional performance arts associated with the temple culture of Kerala [511] The development of the indigenous classical music form, Sopana Sangeetham, illustrates the rich contribution that temple culture has made to the arts of Kerala [511] Carnatic music dominates Keralite traditional music This was the result of Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma's popularisation of the genre in the 19th century [480] Raga-based renditions known as sopanam accompany kathakali performances [512] Melam; including the paandi and panchari variants, is a more percussive style of music: [513] it is performed at Kshetram-centered festivals using the chenda Panchavadyam is a form of percussion ensemble, in which artists use five types of percussion instrument [513] Kerala's visual arts range from traditional murals to the works of Raja Ravi Varma, the state's most renowned painter [511] Most of the castes and communities in Kerala have rich collections of folk songs and ballads associated with a variety of themes; Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads), Thekkan pattukal (Southern Ballads), Vanchi pattukal (Boat Songs), Mappila Pattukal (Muslim songs) and Pallipattukal (Church songs) are a few of them [514]\n\n\nCinema\nMalayalam films carved a niche for themselves in the Indian film industry with the presentation of social themes [515] [516] Directors from Kerala, like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mankada Ravi Varma, G Aravindan, Bharathan, P Padmarajan, M.T Vasudevan Nair, K.G George, Priyadarshan, John Abraham, Ramu Karyat, K S Sethumadhavan, A Vincent and Shaji N Karun have made a considerable contribution to the Indian parallel cinema Kerala has also given birth to numerous actors, such as Mohanlal, Mammootty, Satyan, Prem Nazir, Madhu, Sheela, Sharada, Miss Kumari, Jayan, Adoor Bhasi, Seema, Bharath Gopi, Thilakan, Vijaya Raghavan, Kalabhavan Mani, Indrans, Shobana, Nivin Pauly, Sreenivasan, Urvashi, Manju Warrier, Suresh Gopi, Jayaram, Murali, Shankaradi, Kavya Madhavan, Bhavana Menon, Prithviraj, Parvathy (actress), Jayasurya, Dulquer Salmaan, Oduvil Unnikrishnan, Jagathy Sreekumar, Nedumudi Venu, KPAC Lalitha, Innocent and Fahad Fazil Late Malayalam actor Prem Nazir holds the world record for having acted as the protagonist of over 720 movies [517] Since the 1980s, actors Mohanlal and Mammootty have dominated the movie industry; Mohanlal has won five National Film Awards (four for acting), while Mammootty has three National Film Awards for acting [518] Malayalam Cinema has produced a few more notable personalities such as K.J Yesudas, K.S Chitra, M.G Sreekumar, Vayalar Rama Varma, V Madhusoodanan Nair, M.T Vasudevan Nair and O.N.V Kurup, [519] the last two mentioned being recipients of Jnanpith award, the highest literary award in India [520] Resul Pookutty, who is from Kerala, is only the second Indian to win an academy award for sound design, for the breakthrough film Slumdog Millionaire As of 2018, Malayalam cinema has got 14 awards for the best actor, 6 for the best actress, 11 for the best film, and 13 for the best film director in the National Film Awards, India [521]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe Sangam literature can be considered as the ancient predecessor of Malayalam [522] Malayalam literature starts from the Old Malayalam period (9th–13th century CE) and includes such notable writers as the 14th-century Niranam poets (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), [523] [524] and the 16th-century poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, whose works mark the dawn of both the modern Malayalam language and its poetry [525] For the first 600 years of Malayalam calendar, the literature mainly consisted of the oral Ballads such as Vadakkan Pattukal in North Malabar and Thekkan Pattukal in Southern Travancore [526] Designated a \"Classical Language in India\" in 2013, [527] it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poets Cherusseri Namboothiri, [528] [529] Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, [529] and Poonthanam Nambudiri, [529] [530] in the 15th and the 16th centuries of Common Era [529] [531] Unnayi Variyar, [532] a probable poet of the 17th/18th century CE, and Kunchan Nambiar, a poet of the 18th century CE, have also influenced a lot in the growth of modern Malayalam literature in its pre-mature form [529] The Bharathappuzha river, also known as River Ponnani, and its tributaries, have played a major role in the development of modern Malayalam Literature [533]\n\n\nCuisine\nKerala cuisine includes a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine [556] Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day [557] A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, in one form or the other (idli, dosa, puttu, pathiri, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada [558] These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry [276] Porotta and Biryani are also often found in restaurants in Kerala Thalassery biryani is popular as an ethnic brand Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar [559] Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed with a cup of payasam [560] Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, Achappam, Unni appam and kuzhalappam [561] [562] [563] Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes [564] Thalassery Cuisine is varied and is a blend of many influences.\n\n\nElephants\nElephants have been an integral part of the culture of the state Almost all of the local festivals in Kerala include at least one richly caparisoned elephant Kerala is home to the largest domesticated population of elephants in India—about 700 Indian elephants, owned by temples as well as individuals [565] These elephants are mainly employed for the processions and displays associated with festivals celebrated all around the state More than 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state annually and some animal lovers have sometimes raised concerns regarding the overwork of domesticated elephants during them [481] In Malayalam literature, elephants are referred to as the \"sons of the sahya\" [566] The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala [567]\n\n\nMedia\nThe media, telecommunications, broadcasting and cable services are regulated by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) [568] The National Family Health Survey – 4, conducted in 2015–16, ranked Kerala as the state with the highest media exposure in India [569] Dozens of newspapers are published in Kerala, in nine major languages, [570] but principally Malayalam and English [571] Kerala has the highest media exposure in India [572] [573] The most widely circulated Malayalam-language newspapers are Malayala Manorama, Mathrubhumi, Deshabhimani, Madhyamam, Kerala Kaumudi, Mangalam, Chandrika, Deepika, Janayugam, Janmabhumi, Siraj Daily and Suprabhaatham Major Malayalam periodicals include Mathrubhumi Azhchappathippu, Vanitha, India Today Malayalam, Madhyamam Weekly, Grihalakshmi, Dhanam, Chithrabhumi and Bhashaposhini The Hindu is the most read English language newspaper in the state, followed by The New Indian Express [574] Other dailies include Deccan Chronicle, The Times of India, DNA, The Economic Times and The Financial Express.\n\n\nSports\nBy the 21st century, almost all of the native sports and games from Kerala have either disappeared or become just an art form performed during local festivals; including Poorakkali, Padayani, Thalappandukali, Onathallu, Parichamuttukali, Velakali, and Kilithattukali [581] However, Kalaripayattu, regarded as \"the mother of all martial arts in the world\", is an exception and is practised as the indigenous martial sport [582] Another traditional sport of Kerala is the boat race, especially the race of Snake boats [581]\n\n\nTourism\nKerala's culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demographics, have made the state one of the most popular tourist destinations in India In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named Kerala as one of the \"ten paradises of the world\" [602] [603] and \"50 must see destinations of a lifetime\" [604] Travel and Leisure also described Kerala as \"One of the 100 great trips for the 21st century\" [602] [605] In 2012, it overtook the Taj Mahal to be the number one travel destination in Google's search trends for India [606] CNN Travel listed Kerala among its '19 best places to visit in 2019' [607] Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50 extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the World's Greatest Places [608]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Introduction\n\nKerala is a state located in the southwestern region of India. It is the twenty-first largest state in the country by area and is home to about 34 million people, which is about 2.8% of India's population. The state is known for its tropical climate, rich history, and unique cultural practices. Kerala's official language is Malayalam, and the state is also home to several languages including Tamil, Sanskrit, and English. The state has a diverse geography, with the Western Ghats mountain range running along its western edge and the low-lying coastal plains along the eastern edge.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe word \"Kerala\" is first recorded as Keralaputo ('son of Chera') in a 3rd-century-BCE rock inscription left by the Maurya emperor Ashoka. One of the three states in the region was called Cheralam in Classical Tamil: Chera and Kera are variants of the same word. The word Cheral refers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings and is derived from the Old Tamil word for 'lake'. Keralam may stem from the Classical Tamil cherive-alam 'declivity of a hill or a mountain slope' or chera alam 'land of the Cheras'.\n\n# Malabar\n\nKerala was alternatively called Malabar in the foreign trade circles. Earlier, the term Malabar had also been used to denote Tulu Nadu and Kanyakumari which lie contiguous to Kerala on the southwestern coast of India, in addition to the modern state of Kerala. The people of Malabar were known as Malabars. Until the arrival of the East India Company, the term Malabar was used as a general name for Kerala, along with the term Kerala.\n\n# History\n\nAccording to the Sangam classic Purananuru, the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas. Lacking worthy enemies, he besieged the sea by throwing his spear into it. According to the 17th-century Hindu mythology work Keralolpathi, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parashurama Kshetram 'The Land of Parashurama' in Hindu mythology). Parashurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to the legendary account, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari.\n\n# Traditional Sources\n\nAccording to the Sangam classic Purananuru, the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas.

Parashurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to the legendary account, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari.\n\n# Cheraman Perumals\n\nThe legend of Cheraman Perumals is the medieval tradition associated with the Cheraman Perumals (literally the Chera kings) of Kerala. The validity of the legend as a source of history once generated much debate among South Indian historians. The legend was used by Kerala chiefdoms for the legitimation of their rule (most of the major chiefly houses in medieval Kerala traced its origin back to the legendary allocation by the Perumal). According to the legend, Rayar, the overlord of the Cheraman Perumal in a country east of the Ghats, invaded Kerala during the rule of the last Perumal. The Cheraman Perumal was assured by the Eradis (chief of Eranad) that they would take a fort established by the Rayar.\n\n# Pre-History\n\nA substantial portion of Kerala including the western coastal lowlands and the plains of the midland may have been under the sea in ancient times. Marine fossils have been found in an area near Changanassery, thus supporting the hypothesis. Pre-historical archaeological findings include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the Marayur area of the Idukki district, which lie on the eastern highland made by Western Ghats. Rock engravings in the Edakkal Caves, in Wayanad date back to the Neolithic era around 6000 BCE.\n\n# Ancient Period\n\nKerala has been a major spice exporter since 3000 BCE, according to Sumerian records and it is still referred to as the \"Garden of Spices\" or as the \"Spice Garden of India\". The state's spices attracted ancient Arabs, Babylonians, Assyrians and Egyptians to the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE. Phoenicians established trade with Kerala during this period. Arabs and Phoenicians were the first to enter Malabar Coast to trade.\n\n# Early Medieval Period\n\nA second Chera Kingdom (c 800–1102), also known as Kulasekhara dynasty of Mahodayapuram (present-day Kodungallur), was established by Kulasekhara Varman, which ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu. The Kulasekhara period saw the development of art, literature, trade, and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. A Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils, became linguistically separate during this period around the seventh century. The origin of Malayalam calendar dates back to year 825 CE.\n\n# Vijayanagara Conquests\n\nThe king Deva Raya II (1424–1446) of the Vijayanagara Empire conquered the entirety of present-day Kerala in the 15th century. He defeated the Zamorin of Kozhikode, as well as the ruler of Kollam around 1443. Fernão Nunes says that the Zamorin had to pay tribute to the king of Vijayanagara Empire. Later Kozhikode and Venad seem to have rebelled against their Vijayanagara overlords, but Deva Raya II quelled the rebellion. As the Vijayanagara power diminished over the next fifty years, the Zamorin of Kozhikode again rose to prominence in Kerala.\n\n# Early Modern Period\n\nThe maritime spice trade monopoly in the Arabian Sea stayed with the Arabs during the High and Late Middle Ages. However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery. After Vasco Da Gama's arrival in Kappad, Kozhikode in 1498, the Portuguese began to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular. Following the discovery of sea route from Europe to Malabar in 1498, the Portuguese began to expand their territories and ruled the seas between Ormus and the Malabar Coast and south to Ceylon.\n\n# The Kingdoms of Travancore and Cochin, and British Influences\n\nThe Dutch in turn were weakened by constant battles with Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Royal Family, and were defeated at the Battle of Colachel in 1741. An agreement, known as \"Treaty of Mavelikkara\", was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvement in the region. The Travancore King Sree Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma annexed all the kingdoms up to Cochin through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to pre-eminence in Kerala.\n\n# As a State of the Republic of India\n\nAfter India was partitioned in 1947 into India and Pakistan, Travancore and Kochi, part of the Union of India were merged on 1 July 1949 to form Travancore-Cochin. On 1 November 1956, the taluk of Kasargod in the South Kanara district of Madras, the Malabar district of Madras (excluding the islands of Lakshadweep), and Travancore-Cochin, without four southern taluks and Sengottai taluk (which joined Tamil Nadu), merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act.\n\n# Geography\n\nThe state is wedged between the Lakshadweep Sea and the Western Ghats. Lying between northern latitudes 8°18' and 12°48' and eastern longitudes 74°52' and 77°22', Kerala experiences humid tropical rainforest climate with some cyclones. The state has a coast of 590 kilometres (370 mi) and the width of the state varies between 11 and 121 kilometres (7 and 75 mi). Geographically, Kerala can be divided into three climatically distinct regions: the eastern highlands; rugged and cool mountainous terrain, the central mid-lands; rolling hills, and the western lowlands; coastal plains.\n\n# Demographics\n\nKerala is home to 2.8% of India's population; with a density of 859 persons per km2, its land is nearly three times as densely settled as the national average of 370 persons per km2. As of 2011, Thiruvananthapuram is the most populous city in Kerala. In the state, the rate of population growth is India's lowest, and the decadal growth of 4.9% in 2011 is less than one third of the all-India average of 17.6%. Kerala's population more than doubled between 1951 and 1991 by adding 15.6 million people to reach 29.1 million residents in 1991; the population stood at 33.3 million by 2011.\n\n# Human Development Index\n\nUnder a democratic communist local government, Kerala has achieved a record of social development much more advanced than the Indian average. As of 2015, Kerala has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.770, which is in the \"high\" category, ranking it first in the country. It was 0.790 in 2007-08, and it had a consumption-based HDI of 0.920, which is better than that of many developed countries. Comparatively higher spending by the government on primary level education, health care, and the elimination of poverty from the 19th century onwards has helped the state maintain an exceptionally high HDI.\n\n# Healthcare\n\nKerala is a pioneer in implementing the universal health care program. The sub-replacement fertility level and infant mortality rate are lower compared to those of other states, estimated from 12 to 14 deaths per 1,000 live births; as per the National Family Health Survey 2015–16, it has dropped to 6. Kerala's morbidity rate is higher than that of any other Indian state—118 (rural) and 88 (urban) per 1,000 people.\n\n# Education\n\nThe Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts, including series expansion for trigonometric functions. In the early decades of the 19th century, the modern educational transformation of Kerala was triggered by the efforts of the Church Mission Society missionaries to promote mass education.\n\n# Culture\n\nThe culture of Kerala is composite and cosmopolitan in nature and is an integral part of Indian culture. It is a synthesis of Aryan, Dravidian, Arab, and European cultures, developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad. The geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature, and social institutions.\n\n# Festivals\n\nMany of the temples in Kerala hold festivals on specific days of the year. A common characteristic of these festivals is the hoisting of a holy flag which is brought down on the final day of the festival after immersing the deity. Some festivals include Poorams, the best known of these being the Thrissur Pooram. \"Elephants, firework displays, and huge crowds\" are the major attractions of Thrissur Pooram.\n\n# Music and Dance\n\nKerala is home to a number of performance arts. These include five classical dance forms: Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Koodiyattom, Thullal, and Krishnanattam, which originated and developed in the temple theatres during the classical period under the patronage of royal houses. Kerala natanam, Thirayattam, Kaliyattam, Theyyam, Koothu, and Padayani are other dance forms associated with the temple culture of the region.\n\n# Cinema\n\nMalayalam films carved a niche for themselves in the Indian film industry with the presentation of social themes. Directors from Kerala, like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mankada Ravi Varma, G Aravindan, Bharathan, P Padmarajan, M.T Vasudevan Nair, K.G George, Priyadarshan, John Abraham, Ramu Karyat, K S Sethumadhavan, A Vincent, and Shaji N Karun have made a considerable contribution to the Indian parallel cinema.\n\n# Literature\n\nThe Sangam literature can be considered as the ancient predecessor of Malayalam. Malayalam literature starts from the Old Malayalam period (9th–13th century CE) and includes such notable writers as the 14th-century Niranam poets (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar, and Rama Panikkar) and the 16th-century poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, whose works mark the dawn of both the modern Malayalam language and its poetry.\n\n# Cuisine\n\nKerala cuisine includes a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day. A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, in one form or the other (idli, dosa, puttu, pathiri, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada.\n\n# Tourist Attractions\n\nKerala's culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demographics, have made the state one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named Kerala as one of the \"ten paradises of the world\" and \"50 must see destinations of a lifetime\".

with the term Kerala [16] From the time of Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century CE) itself, the Arab sailors used to call Kerala as Male The first element of the name, however, is attested already in the Topography written by Cosmas Indicopleustes This mentions a pepper emporium called Male, which clearly gave its name to Malabar ('the country of Male') The name Male is thought to come from the Dravidian word Mala ('hill') [40] [41] Al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) is the first known writer to call this country Malabar [16] Authors such as Ibn Khordadbeh and Al-Baladhuri mention Malabar ports in their works [42] The Arab writers had called this place Malibar, Manibar, Mulibar, and Munibar Malabar is reminiscent of the word Malanad which means the land of hills [43] According to William Logan, the word Malabar comes from a combination of the Dravidian word Mala (hill) and the Persian/Arabic word Barr (country/continent) [44]\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to the Sangam classic Purananuru, the

The battle lasted for three days and the Rayar eventually evacuated his fort (and it was seized by the Perumal's troops) [60] Then the last Cheraman Perumal divided Kerala or Chera kingdom among his chieftains and disappeared mysteriously The Kerala people never more heard any tidings of him [56] [58] [59] The Eradis of Nediyiruppu, who later came to be known as the Zamorins of Kozhikode, who

Archaeological studies have identified Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic sites in Kerala [65] The studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age, through the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic Ages [66] Foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation; [67] historians suggest a possible relationship with Indus

Yemen, Oman, and the Persian Gulf, must have made the first long voyage to Kerala and other eastern countries [71] They must have brought the Cinnamon of Kerala to the Middle East [71] The Greek

(c 800–1102), also known as Kulasekhara dynasty of Mahodayapuram (present-day Kodungallur), was established by Kulasekhara Varman, [88] which ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu During the early part of the Kulasekara period, the southern region from Nagercoil to Thiruvalla was ruled by Ay kings, who lost their power in the 10th century, making the region a part of the Kulasekara empire [89] [90] Under Kulasekhara rule, Kerala witnessed a developing period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism [91] A Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils, became linguistically separate during this period around the seventh century [92] The origin of Malayalam calendar dates back to year 825 CE [93] [94] [95] For local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Naduvazhis, with each province comprising a number of Desams under the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis [91] Mamankam festival, which was the largest native festival, was held at Tirunavaya near Kuttippuram, on the bank of river Bharathappuzha [43] [16] Athavanad, the headquarters of Azhvanchery Thamprakkal, who were also considered as the supreme religious chief of the Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala, is also located near Tirunavaya [43] [16]\n\n\nThe rise of Kozhikode\nAfter his death, in the absence of a strong central power, the state was divided into 30 small warring principalities; the most powerful of them were the kingdom of Zamorin of Kozhikode in the north, Kollam in the far-south, Kochi in the south, and Kannur in the far north The port at Kozhikode held the superior economic and political position in Kerala, while Kollam (Quilon), Kochi, and Kannur (Cannanore) were commercially confined to secondary roles [102] The Zamorin of Calicut was originally the ruler of Eranad, which was a minor principality located in the northern parts of present-day Malappuram district [16] [103] The Zamorin allied with Arab and Chinese merchants and used most of the wealth from Kozhikode to develop his military power Kozhikode became the most powerful kingdom in the Malayalam speaking region during the Middle Ages [104] [103]\n\n\nVijayanagara Conquests\nThe king Deva Raya II (1424–1446) of the Vijayanagara Empire conquered the entirety of present-day state of Kerala in the 15th century [103] He defeated the Zamorin of Kozhikode, as well as the ruler of Kollam around 1443 [103] Fernão Nunes says that the Zamorin had to pay tribute to the king of Vijayanagara Empire [103] Later Kozhikode and Venad seem to have rebelled against their Vijayanagara overlords, but Deva Raya II quelled the rebellion [103] As the Vijayanagara power diminished over the next fifty years, the Zamorin of Kozhikode again rose to prominence in Kerala [103] He built a fort at Ponnani in 1498 [103]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nThe maritime spice trade monopoly in the Arabian Sea stayed with the Arabs during the High and Late Middle Ages However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery After Vasco Da Gama's arrival in Kappad, Kozhikode in 1498, the Portuguese began to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular [a] [110] [111] [112] Following the discovery of sea route from Europe to Malabar in 1498, the Portuguese began to expand their territories and ruled the seas between Ormus and the Malabar Coast and south to Ceylon [113] [114] They established a trading centre at Tangasseri in Quilon during 1502 as per the invitation of the then Queen of Quilon to start spices trade from there [115]\n\n\nThe Kingdoms of Travancore and Cochin, and British influences\nThe Dutch in turn were weakened by constant battles with Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Royal Family, and were defeated at the Battle of Colachel in 1741 [124] An agreement, known as \"Treaty of Mavelikkara\", was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvement in the region [125] [126] [127] In the 18th Century, Travancore King Sree Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma annexed all the kingdoms up to Cochin through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to pre-eminence in Kerala [128] The Kochi ruler sued for peace with Anizham Thirunal and the northern and north-central parts of Kerala (Malabar District), along with Fort Kochi, Tangasseri, and Anchuthengu in southern Kerala, came under direct British rule until India became independent [129] [130] Travancore became the dominant state in Kerala by defeating the powerful Zamorin of Kozhikode in the battle of Purakkad in 1755 [131]\n\n\nAs a state of the Republic of India\nAfter India was partitioned in 1947 into India and Pakistan, Travancore and Kochi, part of the Union of India were merged on 1 July 1949 to form Travancore-Cochin [144] On 1 November 1956, the taluk of Kasargod in the South Kanara district of Madras, the Malabar district of Madras (excluding the islands of Lakshadweep), and Travancore-Cochin, without four southern taluks and Sengottai taluk (which joined Tamil Nadu), merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act [17] [145] [146] A Communist-led government under E M S Namboodiripad resulted from the first elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957 [146] It was one of the earliest elected Communist governments anywhere [147] [148] [149] His government implemented land and educational reforms which in turn, reduced income inequality in the state [150]\n\n\nGeography\nThe state is wedged between the Lakshadweep Sea and the Western Ghats Lying between northern latitudes 8°18' and 12°48' and eastern longitudes 74°52' and 77°22', [151] Kerala experiences humid tropical rainforest climate with some cyclones The state has a coast of 590 km (370 mi) [152] and the width of the state varies between 11 and 121 kilometres (7 and 75 mi) [153] Geographically, Kerala can be divided into three climatically distinct regions: the eastern highlands; rugged and cool mountainous terrain, the central mid-lands; rolling hills, and the western lowlands; coastal plains [70]: 110  Pre-Cambrian and Pleistocene geological formations compose the bulk of Kerala's terrain [154] [155] A catastrophic flood in Kerala in 1341 CE drastically modified its terrain and consequently affected its history; it also created a natural harbour for spice transport [156]\nThe eastern region of Kerala consists of high mountains, gorges and deep-cut valleys immediately west of the Western Ghats' rain shadow [70]: 110  41 of Kerala's west-flowing rivers, [157] and 3 of its east-flowing ones originate in this region [158] [159] The Western Ghats form a wall of mountains interrupted only near Palakkad; hence also known Palghat, where the Palakkad Gap breaks [160] The Western Ghats rise on average to 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) above sea level, [161] while the highest peaks reach around 2,500 metres (8,200 feet) [162] Anamudi in the Idukki district is the highest peak in south India, is at an elevation of 2,695 m (8,842 ft) [163] The Western Ghats mountain chain is recognised as one of the world's eight \"hottest hotspots\" of biological diversity and is listed among UNESCO World Heritage Sites [164] The chain's forests are considered to be older than the Himalaya mountains [164] The Athirappilly Falls, which is situated on the background of Western Ghat mountain ranges, is also known as The Niagara of India [165] It is located in the Chalakudy River and is the largest waterfall in the state [165] Wayanad is the sole Plateau in Kerala [166] The eastern regions in the districts of Wayanad, Malappuram (Chaliyar valley at Nilambur), and Palakkad (Attappadi Valley), which together form parts of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and a continuation of the Mysore Plateau, are known for natural Gold fields, along with the adjoining districts of Karnataka [167] Minerals including Ilmenite, Monazite, Thorium, and Titanium, are found in the coastal belt of Kerala [168] Kerala's coastal belt of Karunagappally is known for high background radiation from thorium-containing monazite sand In some coastal panchayats, median outdoor radiation levels are more than 4 mGy/yr and, in certain locations on the coast, it is as high as 70 mGy/yr [169]\n\n\nClimate\nWith around 120–140 rainy days per year, [181]: 80  Kerala has a wet and maritime tropical climate influenced by the seasonal heavy rains of the southwest summer monsoon and northeast winter monsoon [182] Around 65% of the rainfall occurs from June to August corresponding to the Southwest monsoon, and the rest from September to December corresponding to Northeast monsoon [182] The moisture-laden winds of the Southwest monsoon, on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula, because of its topography, divides into two branches; the \"Arabian Sea Branch\" and the \"Bay of Bengal Branch\" [183] The \"Arabian Sea Branch\" of the Southwest monsoon first hits the Western Ghats, [184] making Kerala the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest monsoon [185] [186] The distribution of pressure patterns is reversed in the Northeast monsoon, during this season the cold winds from North India pick up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and precipitate it on the east coast of peninsular India [187] [188] In Kerala, the influence of the Northeast monsoon is seen in southern districts only [189] Kerala's rainfall averages 2,923 mm (115 in) annually [190] Some of Kerala's drier lowland regions average only 1,250 mm (49 in); the mountains of the eastern Idukki district receive more than 5,000 mm (197 in) of orographic precipitation: the highest in the state In eastern Kerala, a drier tropical wet and dry climate prevails During the summer, the state is prone to gale-force winds, storm surges, cyclone-related torrential downpours, occasional droughts, and rises in sea level [191]: 26, 46, 52  The mean daily temperature ranges from 19.8 °C to 36.7 °C [192] Mean annual temperatures range from 25.0 to 27.5 °C in the coastal lowlands to 20.0–22.5 °C in the eastern highlands [191]: 65 \n\n\nFlora and fauna\nMost of the biodiversity is concentrated and protected in the Western Ghats Three-quarters of the land area of Kerala was under thick forest up to the 18th century [193] As of 2004 [update], over 25% of India's 15,000 plant species are in Kerala Out of the 4,000 flowering plant species; 1,272 of which are endemic to Kerala, 900 are medicinal, and 159 are threatened [194]: 11  Its 9,400 km2 of forests include tropical wet evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (lower and middle elevations—3,470 km2), tropical moist and dry deciduous forests (mid-elevations—4,100 km2 and 100 km2, respectively), and montane subtropical and temperate (shola) forests (highest elevations—100 km2) Altogether, 24% of Kerala is forested [194]: 12  Four of the world's Ramsar Convention listed wetlands—Lake Sasthamkotta, Ashtamudi Lake, Thrissur-Ponnani Kole Wetlands, and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands—are in Kerala, [195] as well as 1455.4 km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and 1828 km2 of the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve [196] Subjected to extensive clearing for cultivation in the 20th century, [197]: 6–7  much of the remaining forest cover is now protected from clearfelling [198] Eastern Kerala's windward mountains shelter tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests, which are common in the Western Ghats [199] [200] The world's oldest teak plantation 'Conolly's Plot' is in Nilambur [201]\n\n\nDivisions, districts and cities\nThe state's 14 districts are distributed among six regions: North Malabar (far-north Kerala), South Malabar (north-central Kerala), Kochi (central Kerala), Northern Travancore (south-central Kerala), Central Travancore (southern Kerala) and Southern Travancore (far-south Kerala) The districts which serve as administrative regions for taxation purposes are further subdivided into 27 revenue subdivisions and 77 taluks, which have fiscal and administrative powers over settlements within their borders, including maintenance of local land records Kerala's taluks are further sub-divided into 1,674 revenue villages [206] [207]\nSince the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution of India, the local government institutions function as the third tier of government, which constitutes 14 District Panchayats, 152 Block panchayats, 941 Grama Panchayats, 87 Municipalities, six Municipal Corporations and one Township [208]\nMahé, a part of the Indian union territory of Puducherry, [209] though 647 kilometres (402 mi) away from it, [210] is a coastal exclave surrounded by Kerala on all of its landward approaches The Kannur District surrounds Mahé on three sides with the Kozhikode District on the fourth [211]\n\n\nGovernment and administration\nThe state is governed by a parliamentary system of representative democracy Kerala has a unicameral legislature The Kerala Legislative Assembly also known as Niyamasabha, consists of 140 members who are elected for five-year terms [217] The state elects 20 members to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, and 9 members to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house [218]\n\n\nEconomy\nAfter independence, the state was managed as a social democratic welfare economy [237] The \"Kerala phenomenon\" or \"Kerala model of development\" of very high human development and in comparison low economic development has resulted from a strong service sector [191]: 48  [238]: 1  In 2019–20, the tertiary sector contributed around 63% of the state's GSVA, compared to 28% by secondary sector, and 8% by primary sector [26] In the period between 1960 and 2020, Kerala's economy was gradually shifting from an agrarian economy into a service-based one [26]\n\n\nIndustries\nTraditional industries manufacturing items; coir, handlooms, and handicrafts employ around one million people [262] Kerala supplies 60% of the total global produce of white coir fibre India's first coir factory was set up in Alleppey in 1859–60 [263] The Central Coir Research Institute was established there in 1959 As per the 2006–2007 census by SIDBI, there are 1,468,104 micro, small and medium enterprises in Kerala employing 3,031,272 people [264] [265] The KSIDC has promoted more than 650 medium and large manufacturing firms in Kerala, creating employment for 72,500 people [266] A mining sector of 0.3% of GSDP involves extraction of ilmenite, kaolin, bauxite, silica, quartz, rutile, zircon, and sillimanite [267] Other major sectors are tourism, medical sector, educational sector, banking, ship building, oil refinery, infrastructure, manufacturing, home gardens, animal husbandry and business process outsourcing.\n\n\nAgriculture\nThe major change in agriculture in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour [268] Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and a major portion of the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops [269] [270] Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high price of land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings [271] Only 27.3% of the families in Kerala depend upon agriculture for their livelihood, which is also the least curresponding rate in India [272]\n\n\nFisheries\nWith 590 kilometres (370 miles) of coastal belt, [285] 400,000 hectares of inland water resources [286] and approximately 220,000 active fishermen, [287] Kerala is one of the leading producers of fish in India [288] According to 2003–04 reports, about 11 lakh(1.1 million) people earn their livelihood from fishing and allied activities such as drying, processing, packaging, exporting and transporting fisheries The annual yield of the sector was estimated as 6,08,000 tons in 2003–04 [289] This contributes to about 3% of the total economy of the state In 2006, around 22% of the total Indian marine fishery yield was from Kerala [290] During the southwest monsoon, a suspended mud bank develops along the shore, which in turn leads to calm ocean water, peaking the output of the fishing industry This phenomenon is locally called chakara [291] [292] The waters provide a large variety of fish: pelagic species; 59%, demersal species; 23%, crustaceans, molluscs and others for 18% [290] Around 1050,000(1.050 million) fishermen haul an annual catch of 668,000 tonnes as of a 1999–2000 estimate; 222 fishing villages are strung along the 590-kilometre (370-mile) coast Another 113 fishing villages dot the hinterland.\n\n\nTransportation\nKerala has 331,904 kilometres (206,236 mi) of roads, which accounts for 5.6% of India's total [26] [293] This translates to about 9.94 kilometres (6.18 mi) of road per thousand people, compared to an average of 4.87 kilometres (3.03 mi) in the country [26] [293] Roads in Kerala include 1,812 kilometres (1,126 mi) of national highway; 1.6% of the nation's total, 4,342 kilometres (2,698 mi) of state highway; 2.5% of the nation's total, 27,470 kilometres (17,070 mi) of district roads; 4.7% of the nation's total, 33,201 kilometres (20,630 mi) of urban (municipal) roads; 6.3% of the nation's total, and 158,775 kilometres (98,658 mi) of rural roads; 3.8% of the nation's total [294] Kottayam has the maximum length of roads among the districts of Kerala, while Wayanad accounts for minimum [295] Most of Kerala's west coast is accessible through the NH 66 (previously NH 17 and 47); and the eastern side is accessible through state highways [296] New projects for hill and coastal highways were recently announced under KIIFB [297] National Highway 66, with the longest stretch of road (1,622 kilometres (1,008 mi)) connects Kanyakumari to Mumbai; it enters Kerala via Talapady in Kasargod and passes through Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Guruvayur, Kochi, Alappuzha, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram before entering Tamil Nadu [296] Palakkad district is generally referred to as the Gateway of Kerala, due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap in the Western Ghats, through which the northern (Malabar) and southern (Travancore) parts of Kerala are connected to the rest of India via road and rail The state's largest checkpoint, Walayar, is on NH 544, in the border town between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, through which a large amount of public and commercial transportation reaches the northern and central districts of Kerala [298]\n\n\nRoads\nKerala has 331,904 kilometres (206,236 mi) of roads, which accounts for 5.6% of India's total [26] [293] This translates to about 9.94 kilometres (6.18 mi) of road per thousand people, compared to an average of 4.87 kilometres (3.03 mi) in the country [26] [293] Roads in Kerala include 1,812 kilometres (1,126 mi) of national highway; 1.6% of the nation's total, 4,342 kilometres (2,698 mi) of state highway; 2.5% of the nation's total, 27,470 kilometres (17,070 mi) of district roads; 4.7% of the nation's total, 33,201 kilometres (20,630 mi) of urban (municipal) roads; 6.3% of the nation's total, and 158,775 kilometres (98,658 mi) of rural roads; 3.8% of the nation's total [294] Kottayam has the maximum length of roads among the districts of Kerala, while Wayanad accounts for minimum [295] Most of Kerala's west coast is accessible through the NH 66 (previously NH 17 and 47); and the eastern side is accessible through state highways [296] New projects for hill and coastal highways were recently announced under KIIFB [297] National Highway 66, with the longest stretch of road (1,622 kilometres (1,008 mi)) connects Kanyakumari to Mumbai; it enters Kerala via Talapady in Kasargod and passes through Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Guruvayur, Kochi, Alappuzha, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram before entering Tamil Nadu [296] Palakkad district is generally referred to as the Gateway of Kerala, due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap in the Western Ghats, through which the northern (Malabar) and southern (Travancore) parts of Kerala are connected to the rest of India via road and rail The state's largest checkpoint, Walayar, is on NH 544, in the border town between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, through which a large amount of public and commercial transportation reaches the northern and central districts of Kerala [298]\n\n\nKerala State Road Transport Corporation\nKerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is a state-owned road transport corporation It is one of the country's oldest state-run public bus transport services Its origins can be traced back to Travancore State Road Transport Department, when the Travancore government headed by Sri Chithra Thirunnal decided to set up a public road transportation system in 1937.\n\n\nRailways\nSouthern Railway zone of Indian Railways operates all railway lines in the state connecting most major towns and cities except those in the highland districts of Idukki and Wayanad [311] The railway network in the state is controlled by two out of six divisions of the Southern Railway; Thiruvananthapuram Railway division headquartered at Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad Railway Division headquartered at Palakkad [312] Thiruvananthapuram Central (TVC) is the busiest railway station in the state [313] Kerala's major railway stations are:\n\n\nKochi Metro\nKochi Metro is the metro rail system in the city of Kochi It is the only metro rail system in Kerala Construction began in 2012, with the first phase being set up at an estimated cost of ₹51.81 billion (US$620 million) [319] [320] The Kochi Metro uses 65-metre long Metropolis train sets built and designed by Alstom [321] [322] [323] It is the first metro system in India to use a communication-based train control (CBTC) system for signalling and telecommunication [324] In October 2017, Kochi Metro was named the \"Best Urban Mobility Project\" in India by the Urban Development Ministry, as part of the Urban Mobility India (UMI) International Conference hosted by the ministry every year [325]\n\n\nAirports\n\nKerala has four international airports: \n\nWater transport\nKerala has two major ports, four intermediate ports, and 13 minor ports, 4 of which have immigration check point facilities [332] [333] The major port in the state is at Kochi, which has an area of 8.27 km2 [334] The Vizhinjam International Seaport, which is currently classified as an major port, they only completed Phase I others are under construction [334] Other intermediate ports include Beypore, Kollam, and Azheekal [334] The remaining ports are classified as minor which include Manjeshwaram, Kasaragod, Nileshwaram, Kannur, Thalassery, Vadakara, Ponnani, Munambam, Manakodam, Alappuzha, Kayamkulam, Neendakara, and Valiyathura [334] The Kerala Maritime Institute is headquartered at Neendakara, which has an additional subcentre at Kodungallur too [334] The state has numerous backwaters, which are used for commercial inland navigation Transport services are mainly provided by country craft and passenger vessels There are 67 navigable rivers in the state while the total length of inland waterways is 1,687 kilometres (1,048 mi) [335] The main constraints to the expansion of inland navigation are; lack of depth in waterways caused by silting, lack of maintenance of navigation systems and bank protection, accelerated growth of the water hyacinth, lack of modern inland craft terminals, and lack of a cargo handling system.\n\n\nKochi water metro\nKochi Water Metro (KWM) is an integrated ferry transport system serving the Greater Kochi region in Kerala, India It is the first water metro system in India and the first integrated water transport system of this size in Asia, which connects Kochi's 10 island communities with the mainland through a fleet of 78 battery-operated electric hybrid boats plying along 38 terminals and 16 routes spanning 76 kilometres [337] It is integrated with the Kochi Metro and serves as a feeder service to the suburbs along the rivers where transport accessibility is limited [338]\n\n\nDemographics\nKerala is home to 2.8% of India's population; with a density of 859 persons per km2, its land is nearly three times as densely settled as the national average of 370 persons per km2 [340] As of 2011 [update], Thiruvananthapuram is the most populous city in Kerala [341] In the state, the rate of population growth is India's lowest, and the decadal growth of 4.9% in 2011 is less than one third of the all-India average of 17.6% [340] Kerala's population more than doubled between 1951 and 1991 by adding 15.6 million people to reach 29.1 million residents in 1991; the population stood at 33.3 million by 2011 [340] Kerala's coastal regions are the most densely settled with population of 2022 persons per km2, 2.5 times the overall population density of the state, 859 persons per km2, leaving the eastern hills and mountains comparatively sparsely populated [342] Kerala is the second-most urbanised major state in the country with 47.7% urban population according to the 2011 Census of India [23] Around 31.8 million Keralites are predominantly Malayali [340] The state's 321,000 indigenous tribal Adivasis, 1.1% of the population, are concentrated in the east [343]: 10–12 \n\n\n\nGender\nThere is a tradition of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother is the head of the household [344] As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families [345] Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, [346] which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it [347]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nKerala has been at the forefront of LGBT issues in India [351] Kerala is one of the first states in India to form a welfare policy for the transgender community In 2016, the Kerala government introduced free sex reassignment surgery through government hospitals [352] [353] [354] Queerala is one of the major LGBT organisations in Kerala It campaigns for increased awareness of LGBT people and sensitisation concerning healthcare services, workplace policies and educational curriculum [355] Since 2010, Kerala Queer Pride has been held annually across various cities in Kerala [356]\n\n\nHuman Development Index\nUnder a democratic communist local government, Kerala has achieved a record of social development much more advanced than the Indian average [361] As of 2015 [update], Kerala has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.770, which is in the \"high\" category, ranking it first in the country [9] It was 0.790 in 2007–08 [362] and it had a consumption-based HDI of 0.920, which is better than that of many developed countries [362] Comparatively higher spending by the government on primary level education, health care and the elimination of poverty from the 19th century onwards has helped the state maintain an exceptionally high HDI; [363] [364] the report was prepared by the central government's Institute of Applied Manpower Research [365] [366] However, the Human Development Report 2005, prepared by Centre for Development Studies envisages a virtuous phase of inclusive development for the state since the advancement in human development had already started aiding the economic development of the state [363] Kerala is also widely regarded as the cleanest and healthiest state in India [367]\n\n\nHealthcare\nKerala is a pioneer in implementing the universal health care program [392] The sub-replacement fertility level and infant mortality rate are lower compared to those of other states, estimated from 12 [191] [377]: 49  to 14 [393]: 5  deaths per 1,000 live births; as per the National Family Health Survey 2015–16, it has dropped to 6 [394] According to a study commissioned by Lien Foundation, a Singapore-based philanthropic organisation, Kerala is considered to be the best place to die in India based on the state's provision of palliative care for patients with serious illnesses [395] However, Kerala's morbidity rate is higher than that of any other Indian state—118 (rural) and 88 (urban) per 1,000 people The corresponding figures for all India were 55 and 54 per 1,000, respectively as of 2005 [update] [393]: 5  Kerala's 13.3% prevalence of low birth weight is higher than that of many first world nations [377] Outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis, and typhoid among the more than 50% of people who rely on 3 million water wells is an issue worsened by the lack of sewers [396]: 5–7  As of 2017, the state has the highest number of diabetes patients and also the highest prevalence rate of the disease in India [397]\n\n\nLanguage\nLanguages of Kerala (2011) [410]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Kerala (2011) [414]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts, including series expansion for trigonometric functions [454] [455] In the early decades of the 19th century, the modern educational transformation of Kerala was triggered by the efforts of the Church Mission Society missionaries to promote mass education [456] [457] [458] [459] [460] Following the recommendations of the Wood's despatch of 1854, the princely states of Travancore and Cochin launched mass education drives mainly based on castes and communities, and introduced a system of grant-in-aid to attract more private initiatives [461] The efforts by leaders such as Vaikunda Swami, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali, and Kuriakose Elias Chavara in aiding the socially discriminated castes in the state—with the help of community-based organisations like Nair Service Society, SNDP, Muslim Educational Society, Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and congregations of Christian churches—led to the further development of mass education in Kerala [461]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Kerala is composite and cosmopolitan in nature and it is an integral part of Indian culture [34] It is a synthesis of Aryan, Dravidian, Arab, and European cultures, [477] developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad [478] It is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people [479] It was elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures [480] However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions [34] Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year [481] The Malayalam calendar, a solar sidereal calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala, [482] finds common usage in planning agricultural and religious activities [483] Malayalam, one of the classical languages in India, is Kerala's official language [484] Over a dozen other scheduled and unscheduled languages are also spoken [410] Kerala has the greatest consumption of alcohol in India [485]\n\n\nFestivals\nMany of the temples in Kerala hold festivals on specific days of the year [486] A common characteristic of these festivals is the hoisting of a holy flag which is brought down on the final day of the festival after immersing the deity [487] Some festivals include Poorams, the best known of these being the Thrissur Pooram [488] \"Elephants, firework displays and huge crowds\" are the major attractions of Thrissur Pooram [489] Other known festivals are Makaravilakku, [490] Chinakkathoor Pooram, Attukal Pongala and Nenmara Vallangi Vela [491] Other than these, festivals locally known as utsavams are conducted by many temples mostly on annual basis Temples that can afford it will usually involve at least one richly caparisoned elephant as part of the festivities The idol in the temple is taken out on a procession around the countryside atop this elephant When the procession visits homes around the temple, people will usually present rice, coconuts, and other offerings to it [492] Processions often include traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam [493] Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are celebrated by the Muslim community of the state while the festivals like Christmas and Easter are observed by the Christians [16] Onam is a harvest festival celebrated by the people of Kerala and is reminiscent of the state's agrarian past [494] [495] It is a local festival of Kerala [496] consisting of a four-day public holidays; from Onam Eve (Uthradam) to the fourth Onam Day [497] Onam falls in the Malayalam month of Chingam (August–September) [498] and marks the commemoration of the homecoming of King Mahabali [499] The total duration of Onam is 10 days and it is celebrated all across Kerala It is one of the festivals celebrated with cultural elements such as Vallam Kali, [500] Pulikali, [501] Pookkalam, [502] Thumbi Thullal [503] and Onavillu [504]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nKerala is home to a number of performance arts These include five classical dance forms: Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Koodiyattom, Thullal and Krishnanattam, which originated and developed in the temple theatres during the classical period under the patronage of royal houses [505] Kerala natanam, Thirayattam, [506] Kaliyattam, Theyyam, Koothu and Padayani are other dance forms associated with the temple culture of the region [507] Some traditional dance forms such as Oppana and Duffmuttu were popular among the Muslims of the state, [508] while Margamkali and Parichamuttukali are popular among the Syrian Christians and Chavittu nadakom is popular among the Latin Christians [509] [510] The development of classical music in Kerala is attributed to the contributions it received from the traditional performance arts associated with the temple culture of Kerala [511] The development of the indigenous classical music form, Sopana Sangeetham, illustrates the rich contribution that temple culture has made to the arts of Kerala [511] Carnatic music dominates Keralite traditional music This was the result of Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma's popularisation of the genre in the 19th century [480] Raga-based renditions known as sopanam accompany kathakali performances [512] Melam; including the paandi and panchari variants, is a more percussive style of music: [513] it is performed at Kshetram-centered festivals using the chenda Panchavadyam is a form of percussion ensemble, in which artists use five types of percussion instrument [513] Kerala's visual arts range from traditional murals to the works of Raja Ravi Varma, the state's most renowned painter [511] Most of the castes and communities in Kerala have rich collections of folk songs and ballads associated with a variety of themes; Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads), Thekkan pattukal (Southern Ballads), Vanchi pattukal (Boat Songs), Mappila Pattukal (Muslim songs) and Pallipattukal (Church songs) are a few of them [514]\n\n\nCinema\nMalayalam films carved a niche for themselves in the Indian film industry with the presentation of social themes [515] [516] Directors from Kerala, like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mankada Ravi Varma, G Aravindan, Bharathan, P Padmarajan, M.T Vasudevan Nair, K.G George, Priyadarshan, John Abraham, Ramu Karyat, K S Sethumadhavan, A Vincent and Shaji N Karun have made a considerable contribution to the Indian parallel cinema Kerala has also given birth to numerous actors, such as Mohanlal, Mammootty, Satyan, Prem Nazir, Madhu, Sheela, Sharada, Miss Kumari, Jayan, Adoor Bhasi, Seema, Bharath Gopi, Thilakan, Vijaya Raghavan, Kalabhavan Mani, Indrans, Shobana, Nivin Pauly, Sreenivasan, Urvashi, Manju Warrier, Suresh Gopi, Jayaram, Murali, Shankaradi, Kavya Madhavan, Bhavana Menon, Prithviraj, Parvathy (actress), Jayasurya, Dulquer Salmaan, Oduvil Unnikrishnan, Jagathy Sreekumar, Nedumudi Venu, KPAC Lalitha, Innocent and Fahad Fazil Late Malayalam actor Prem Nazir holds the world record for having acted as the protagonist of over 720 movies [517] Since the 1980s, actors Mohanlal and Mammootty have dominated the movie industry; Mohanlal has won five National Film Awards (four for acting), while Mammootty has three National Film Awards for acting [518] Malayalam Cinema has produced a few more notable personalities such as K.J Yesudas, K.S Chitra, M.G Sreekumar, Vayalar Rama Varma, V Madhusoodanan Nair, M.T Vasudevan Nair and O.N.V Kurup, [519] the last two mentioned being recipients of Jnanpith award, the highest literary award in India [520] Resul Pookutty, who is from Kerala, is only the second Indian to win an academy award for sound design, for the breakthrough film Slumdog Millionaire As of 2018, Malayalam cinema has got 14 awards for the best actor, 6 for the best actress, 11 for the best film, and 13 for the best film director in the National Film Awards, India [521]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe Sangam literature can be considered as the ancient predecessor of Malayalam [522] Malayalam literature starts from the Old Malayalam period (9th–13th century CE) and includes such notable writers as the 14th-century Niranam poets (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), [523] [524] and the 16th-century poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, whose works mark the dawn of both the modern Malayalam language and its poetry [525] For the first 600 years of Malayalam calendar, the literature mainly consisted of the oral Ballads such as Vadakkan Pattukal in North Malabar and Thekkan Pattukal in Southern Travancore [526] Designated a \"Classical Language in India\" in 2013, [527] it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poets Cherusseri Namboothiri, [528] [529] Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, [529] and Poonthanam Nambudiri, [529] [530] in the 15th and the 16th centuries of Common Era [529] [531] Unnayi Variyar, [532] a probable poet of the 17th/18th century CE, and Kunchan Nambiar, a poet of the 18th century CE, have also influenced a lot in the growth of modern Malayalam literature in its pre-mature form [529] The Bharathappuzha river, also known as River Ponnani, and its tributaries, have played a major role in the development of modern Malayalam Literature [533]\n\n\nCuisine\nKerala cuisine includes a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine [556] Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day [557] A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, in one form or the other (idli, dosa, puttu, pathiri, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada [558] These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry [276] Porotta and Biryani are also often found in restaurants in Kerala Thalassery biryani is popular as an ethnic brand Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar [559] Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed with a cup of payasam [560] Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, Achappam, Unni appam and kuzhalappam [561] [562] [563] Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes [564] Thalassery Cuisine is varied and is a blend of many influences.\n\n\nElephants\nElephants have been an integral part of the culture of the state Almost all of the local festivals in Kerala include at least one richly caparisoned elephant Kerala is home to the largest domesticated population of elephants in India—about 700 Indian elephants, owned by temples as well as individuals [565] These elephants are mainly employed for the processions and displays associated with festivals celebrated all around the state More than 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state annually and some animal lovers have sometimes raised concerns regarding the overwork of domesticated elephants during them [481] In Malayalam literature, elephants are referred to as the \"sons of the sahya\" [566] The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala [567]\n\n\nMedia\nThe media, telecommunications, broadcasting and cable services are regulated by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) [568] The National Family Health Survey – 4, conducted in 2015–16, ranked Kerala as the state with the highest media exposure in India [569] Dozens of newspapers are published in Kerala, in nine major languages, [570] but principally Malayalam and English [571] Kerala has the highest media exposure in India [572] [573] The most widely circulated Malayalam-language newspapers are Malayala Manorama, Mathrubhumi, Deshabhimani, Madhyamam, Kerala Kaumudi, Mangalam, Chandrika, Deepika, Janayugam, Janmabhumi, Siraj Daily and Suprabhaatham Major Malayalam periodicals include Mathrubhumi Azhchappathippu, Vanitha, India Today Malayalam, Madhyamam Weekly, Grihalakshmi, Dhanam, Chithrabhumi and Bhashaposhini The Hindu is the most read English language newspaper in the state, followed by The New Indian Express [574] Other dailies include Deccan Chronicle, The Times of India, DNA, The Economic Times and The Financial Express.\n\n\nSports\nBy the 21st century, almost all of the native sports and games from Kerala have either disappeared or become just an art form performed during local festivals; including Poorakkali, Padayani, Thalappandukali, Onathallu, Parichamuttukali, Velakali, and Kilithattukali [581] However, Kalaripayattu, regarded as \"the mother of all martial arts in the world\", is an exception and is practised as the indigenous martial sport [582] Another traditional sport of Kerala is the boat race, especially the race of Snake boats [581]\n\n\nTourism\nKerala's culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demographics, have made the state one of the most popular tourist destinations in India In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named Kerala as one of the \"ten paradises of the world\" [602] [603] and \"50 must see destinations of a lifetime\" [604] Travel and Leisure also described Kerala as \"One of the 100 great trips for the 21st century\" [602] [605] In 2012, it overtook the Taj Mahal to be the number one travel destination in Google's search trends for India [606] CNN Travel listed Kerala among its '19 best places to visit in 2019' [607] Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50 extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the World's Greatest Places [608]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

in a specific text, along with their locators (page numbers, section numbers, etc.) that allow readers to quickly find the relevant information. Indexes have been an essential component of written works for centuries, providing a roadmap to the content of a publication.\n\nEarliest examples in English\n\nThe use of indexes in the English language dates back to at least 1593, as evident from Christopher Marlowe's poem Hero and Leander of that year. Marlowe's work included an index of key terms and phrases, demonstrating the importance of indexes in facilitating access to information.\n\nEtymology and plural\n\nThe word \"index\" is derived from the Latin word \"indicare,\" meaning \"to point out.\" In the context of publishing, an index serves as a pointer to specific information within a text. The plural form of the word is \"indices,\" although both \"index\" and \"indices\" are commonly used.\n\nIndexing process\n\nThe indexing process involves several stages:\n\n## Creating index headings\n\nThe indexer reads through the text, identifying indexable concepts (those for which the text provides useful information and which will be of relevance for the text's readership). Index headings are created to represent these concepts, phrased such that they can be found when in alphabetical order (e.g., \"indexing process\" rather than \"how to create an index\").\n\n## Associating locators\n\nThe indexer enters the index headings and their associated locators (indicators to position in the text) into specialist indexing software, which handles the formatting of the index and facilitates the editing phase.\n\n## Editing the index\n\nThe index is edited to impose consistency throughout the index, ensuring that the headings and locators are accurate and that the index is easy to use.\n\nConventional indexing\n\nConventional indexing involves creating an index from scratch, using the techniques described above. This approach requires a thorough understanding of the text and its content, as well as the ability to identify indexable concepts and create relevant headings.\n\nIndexing software\n\nSoftware is available to aid indexers in building a book index. There are several dedicated indexing software programs available to assist with the special sorting and copying needs involved in index preparation.\n\nEmbedded indexing\n\nEmbedded indexing involves including the index headings in the midst of the text itself, but surrounded by codes so that they are not normally displayed.

(and, if applicable, the associated license to use, copy, or display the underlying asset) can be traded and sold on digital markets [12] However, the extralegal nature of NFT trading usually results in an informal exchange of ownership over the asset that has no legal basis for enforcement, [13] and so often confers little more than use as a status symbol [14]\n\n\nCopyright\nAn NFT solely represents a proof of ownership of a blockchain record and does not necessarily imply that the owner possesses intellectual property rights to the digital asset the NFT purports to represent [17] [18] [19] Someone may sell an NFT that represents their work, but the buyer will not necessarily receive copyright to that work, and the seller may not be prohibited from creating additional NFT copies of the same work [20] [21] According to legal scholar Rebecca Tushnet, \"In one sense, the purchaser acquires whatever the art world thinks they have acquired They definitely do not own the copyright to the underlying work unless it is explicitly transferred.\" [22]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first known \"NFT\", Quantum, [25] was created by Kevin McCoy and Anil Dash in May 2014 It consists of a video clip made by McCoy's wife, Jennifer McCoy registered the video on the Namecoin blockchain and sold it to Dash for $4, during a live presentation for the Seven on Seven conferences at the New Museum in New York City McCoy and Dash referred to the technology as \"monetized graphics\" [26] This explicitly linked a non-fungible, tradable blockchain marker to a work of art, via on-chain metadata (enabled by Namecoin) [27]\n\n\nEarly projects\nThe first known \"NFT\", Quantum, [25] was created by Kevin McCoy and Anil Dash in May 2014 It consists of a video clip made by McCoy's wife, Jennifer McCoy

the technology as \"monetized graphics\" [26] This explicitly linked a non-fungible, tradable blockchain marker to a work of art, via on-chain metadata (enabled by Namecoin) [27]\n\n\nERC-721: Non-Fungible Token Standard\nWhile experiments around non-fungibility have existed on blockchains since as early as 2012 with Colored Coins on Bitcoin, [35] a community-driven paper called ERC-721: Non-Fungible Token Standard was published in 2018 under the initiative of civic hacker and lead author William Entriken [36] and is recognized as pioneering the foundation for NFTs and enabling the growth of the wider eco-system [37] It introduced the formalization and defining of the term Non-Fungible Token \"NFT\" in blockchain nomenclature by establishing a standard for smart contracts known as \"ERC-721\" whose tokens would have unique attributes and ownership details, ensuring no two tokens are alike [38] The creation of derivative standards followed from its influence on Ethereum (like ERC-1155 enabling semi-fungibility) and other blockchains [39] Its versatility enabled the pioneering of numerous use cases, including digital artwork, deeds to physical items, real estate (including virtual), access passes, and game assets [40] Ultimately, the emergence of ERC-721 is recognized for having fundamentally changed the landscape of digital verification, authentication, and ownership [41]\n\n\nOrigins of the term \"NFT\" and its adoption\nThe term NFT, prior to the blockchain game CryptoKitties' adoption of ERC-721, is not known to have been used for earlier projects [42] Through discussion among stakeholders for the ERC-721 draft, the word deed was given consideration among other alternatives including distinguishable asset, title, token, asset, equity, ticket [43] Ultimately, through Entriken's initiative under the moniker \"Fulldecent,\" a vote was held during the paper's drafting phase to decide which word would be used in the published version and \"NFT\" was chosen by the stakeholders [44]\n\n\nInfluence\nDuring the height of the breakout success of CryptoKitties and the emergence of ERC-721 tokens in 2017, an NFT marketplace called OpenSea emerged to capitalize off of the new non-fungible token standard [47] It positioned itself early in the NFT market landscape and grew to a $1.4 billion market cap in 2021 during the then-ongoing NFT boom [48]\n\n\nGeneral NFT market\nThe NFT market experienced rapid growth during 2020, with its value tripling to US$250 million [51] In the first three months of 2021, more than US$200 million were spent on NFTs [52]\n\n\nUses\nNFTs have been used to exchange digital tokens that link to a digital file asset Ownership of an NFT is often associated with a license to use such a linked digital asset but generally does not confer the copyright to the buyer Some agreements only grant a license for personal, non-commercial use, while other licenses also allow commercial use of the underlying digital asset [55] This kind of decentralized intellectual copyright poses an alternative to established forms of safeguarding copyright controlled by state institutions and middlemen within the respective industry [56]\n\n\nCommonly associated files\nNFTs have been used to exchange digital tokens that link to a digital file asset Ownership of an NFT is often associated with a license to use such a linked digital asset but generally does not confer the copyright to the buyer Some agreements only grant a license for personal, non-commercial use, while other licenses also allow commercial use of the underlying digital asset [55] This kind of decentralized intellectual copyright poses an alternative to established forms of safeguarding copyright controlled by state institutions and middlemen within the respective industry [56]\n\n\nDigital art\nDigital art is a common use case for NFTs [57] High-profile auctions of NFTs linked to digital art have received considerable public attention; the first such major house auction took place at Christie's in 2021 [58] The work entitled Merge by artist Pak was the most expensive NFT, with an auction price of US$91.8 million [59] and Everydays: the First 5000 Days, by artist Mike Winkelmann (known professionally as Beeple) the second most expensive at US$69.3 million in 2021 [12] [60]\n\n\nGames\nNFTs can represent in-game assets Some commentators describe these as being controlled \"by the user\" instead of the game developer [78] if they can be traded on third-party marketplaces without permission from the game developer Their reception from game developers, though, has been generally mixed, with some like Ubisoft embracing the technology but Valve and Microsoft formally prohibiting them [79]\n\n\nMusic and film\nNFTs have been proposed for use within the film-industry as a way to tokenize movie-scenes and sell them as collectibles in the form of NFTs [97] Artists involved in the entertainment-industry can seek royalties through NFTs [98]\nSo far, NFTs have often been used in both the music- as well as the film-industry.\n\n\nOther associated files\nNFTs have been proposed for purposes related to scientific and medical purposes [137] Suggestions include turning patient data into NFTs, [138] tracking supply chains [139] and minting patents as NFTs [140]\n\n\nUse cases of NFTs in science and medicine\nNFTs have been proposed for purposes related to scientific and medical purposes [137] Suggestions include turning patient data into NFTs, [138] tracking supply chains [139] and minting patents as NFTs [140]\n\n\nSpeculation\nNFTs representing digital collectables and artworks are a speculative asset [150] The NFT buying surge was called an economic bubble by experts, who also compared it to the Dot-com bubble [151] [152] In March 2021 Mike Winkelmann called NFTs an \"irrational exuberance bubble\" [153] By mid-April 2021, demand subsided, causing prices to fall significantly [154] Financial theorist William J Bernstein compared the NFT market to 17th-century tulip mania, saying any speculative bubble requires a technological advance for people to \"get excited about\", with part of that enthusiasm coming from the extreme predictions being made about the product [155] For regulatory policymakers, NFTs have exacerbated challenges such as speculation, fraud, and high volatility [156]\n\n\nMoney laundering\nNFTs, as with other blockchain securities and with traditional art sales, can potentially be used for money laundering [157] NFTs can be used for wash trading by creating several wallets for one individual, generating several fictitious sales and consequently selling the respective NFT to a third party [158] According to a report by Chainalysis these types of wash trades are becoming popular among money launderers because of the largely anonymous nature of transactions on NFT marketplaces [159] [160] [161] Looksrare, created in early 2022, came to be known for the large sums generated through the sale of NFTs in its earliest days, amounting to US$400,000,000 a day These large sums were generated in large part through wash trading [161] The Royal United Services Institute said that any risks in relation to money laundering through NFTs could be mitigated through the use of \"KYC best practices, strong cyber security measures and a stolen art registry (...) without restricting the growth of this new market\" [157]\n\n\nOther uses\nSeveral blockchains have added support for NFTs since Ethereum created its ERC-721 standard [171] [172]\n\n\nStandards in blockchains\nSeveral blockchains have added support for NFTs since Ethereum created its ERC-721 standard [171] [172]\n\n\nIssues and criticisms\nBecause the contents of NFTs are publicly accessible, anybody can easily copy a file referenced by an NFT Furthermore, the ownership of an NFT on the blockchain does not inherently convey legally enforceable intellectual property rights to the file.\n\n\nUnenforceability of content ownership\nBecause the contents of NFTs are publicly accessible, anybody can easily copy a file referenced by an NFT Furthermore, the ownership of an NFT on the blockchain does not inherently convey legally enforceable intellectual property rights to the file.\n\n\nStorage off-chain\nNFTs that represent digital art generally do not store the associated artwork file on the blockchain due to the large size of such a file and the limited processing speed of blockchains Such a token functions like a certificate of ownership, with a web address that points to the piece of art in question; this however makes the art itself vulnerable to link rot [26]\n\n\nEnvironmental concerns\nNFT purchases and sales have been enabled by the high energy usage, and consequent greenhouse gas emissions, associated with some kinds of blockchain transactions [175] Though all forms of Ethereum transactions have had an impact on the environment, the direct impact of these transaction has also depended on the size of the transaction [176] The proof-of-work protocol required to regulate and verify blockchain transactions on networks (including Ethereum until 2022) consumes a large amount of electricity [177] [178] To estimate the carbon footprint of a given NFT transaction requires a variety of assumptions or estimations about the manner in which that transaction is set up on the blockchain, the economic behavior of blockchain miners (and the energy demands of their mining equipment), [179] and the amount of renewable energy being used on these networks [180] There are also conceptual questions, such as whether the carbon footprint estimate for an NFT purchase should incorporate some portion of the ongoing energy demand of the underlying network, or just the marginal impact of that particular purchase [181] An analogy might be the carbon footprint associated with an additional passenger on a given airline flight [175]\n\n\nArtist and buyer fees\nSales platforms charge artists and buyers fees for minting, listing, claiming, and secondary sales Analysis of NFT markets in March 2021, in the immediate aftermath of Beeple's \"Everydays: the First 5000 Days\" selling for US$69.3 million, found that most NFT artworks were selling for less than US$200, with a third selling for less than US$100 [187] Those selling NFTs below $100 were paying platform fees between 72.5% and 157.5% of that amount On average the fees make up 100.5% of the price, meaning that such artists were on average paying more money in fees than they were making in sales [187]\n\n\nPlagiarism and fraud\nThere have been cases of artists and creators having their work sold by others as an NFT without permission [188] After the artist Qing Han died in 2020, her identity was assumed by a fraudster and a number of her works became available for purchase as NFTs [189] Similarly, a seller posing as Banksy succeeded in selling an NFT supposedly made by the artist for $336,000 in 2021; the seller refunded the money after the case drew media attention [190] In 2022, it was discovered that as part of their NFT marketing campaign, an NFT company that voice actor Troy Baker announced his partnership with had plagiarized voice lines generated from 15.ai, a free AI text-to-speech project [191] [192] [193]\n\n\nSecurity\nIn January 2022, it was reported that some NFTs were being exploited by sellers to unknowingly gather users' IP addresses The \"exploit\" works via the off-chain nature of NFT, as the user's computer automatically follows a web address in the NFT to display the content The server at the address can then log the IP address and, in some cases, dynamically alter the returned content to show the result OpenSea has a particular vulnerability to this loophole because it allows HTML files to be linked [201]\n\n\nPyramid/Ponzi scheme claims\nCritics compare the structure of the NFT market to a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, in which early adopters profit at the expense of those buying in later [202] In June 2022, Bill Gates stated his belief that NFTs are \"100% based on greater fool theory\" [203]\n\n\n\"Rug pull\" exit scams\nA \"rug pull\" is a scam, similar to an exit scam or a pump and dump scheme, in which the developers of an NFT or other blockchain project hype the value of a project to pump up the price and then suddenly sell all their tokens to lock in massive profits or otherwise abandon the project while removing liquidity, permanently destroying the value of the project [204]\n\n\nSee

concerns\nNFT purchases and sales have been enabled by the high energy usage, and consequent greenhouse gas emissions, associated with some kinds of blockchain transactions [175] Though all forms of Ethereum transactions have had an impact on the environment, the direct impact of these transaction has also depended on the size of the transaction [176] The proof-of-work protocol required to regulate and verify blockchain transactions on networks (including Ethereum until 2022) consumes a large amount of electricity [177] [178] To estimate the carbon footprint of a given NFT transaction requires a variety of assumptions or estimations about the manner in which that transaction is set up on the blockchain, the economic behavior of blockchain miners (and the energy demands of their mining equipment), [179] and the amount of renewable energy being used on these networks [180] There are also conceptual questions, such as whether the carbon footprint estimate for an NFT purchase should incorporate some portion of the ongoing energy demand of the underlying network, or just the marginal impact of that particular purchase [181] An analogy might be the carbon footprint associated with an additional passenger on a given airline flight [175]\n\n\nArtist and buyer fees\nSales platforms charge artists and buyers fees for minting, listing, claiming, and secondary sales Analysis of NFT markets in March 2021, in the immediate aftermath of Beeple's \"Everydays: the First 5000 Days\" selling for US$69.3 million, found that most NFT artworks were selling for less than US$200, with a third selling for less than US$100 [187] Those selling NFTs below $100 were paying platform fees between 72.5% and 157.5% of that amount On average the fees make up 100.5% of the price, meaning that such artists were on average paying more money in fees than they were making in sales [187]\n\n\nPlagiarism and fraud\nThere have been cases of artists and creators having their work sold by others as an NFT without permission [188] After the artist Qing Han died in 2020, her identity was assumed by a fraudster and a number of her works became available for purchase as NFTs [189] Similarly, a seller posing as Banksy succeeded in selling an NFT supposedly made by the artist for $336,000 in 2021; the seller refunded the money after the case drew media attention [190] In 2022, it was discovered that as part of their NFT marketing campaign, an NFT company that voice actor Troy Baker announced his partnership with had plagiarized voice lines generated from 15.ai, a free AI text-to-speech project [191] [192] [193]\n\n\nSecurity\nIn January 2022, it was reported that some NFTs were being exploited by sellers to unknowingly gather users' IP addresses The \"exploit\" works via the off-chain nature of NFT, as the user's computer automatically follows a web address in the NFT to display the content The server at the address can then log the IP address and, in some cases, dynamically alter the returned content to show the result OpenSea has a particular vulnerability to this loophole because it allows HTML files to be linked [201]\n\n\nPyramid/Ponzi scheme claims\nCritics compare the structure of the NFT market to a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, in which early adopters profit at the expense of those buying in later [202] In June 2022, Bill Gates stated his belief that NFTs are \"100% based on greater fool theory\" [203]\n\n\n\"Rug pull\" exit scams\nA \"rug pull\" is a scam, similar to an exit scam or a pump and dump scheme, in which the developers of an NFT or other blockchain project hype the value of a project to pump up the price and then suddenly sell all their tokens to lock in massive profits or otherwise abandon the project while removing liquidity, permanently destroying the value of the project [204]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "History_of_Israel", "content": "\nPrehistory\nThe oldest evidence of early humans in the territory of modern Israel, dating to 1.5 million years ago, was found in Ubeidiya near the Sea of Galilee [12] Flint tool artefacts have been discovered at Yiron, the oldest stone tools found anywhere outside Africa [dubious – discuss] Other groups [clarification needed] include 1.4 million years old Acheulean industry, [dubious – discuss] the Bizat Ruhama group and Gesher Bnot Yaakov [dubious – discuss] [13]\n\n\nPeriodisation\nHere is one of the more common periodisations.\n\n\nBronze Age Canaan\nThe Canaanites are archaeologically attested in the Middle Bronze Age (2100–1550 BCE) [20] There were probably independent or semi-independent city-states Cities were often surrounded by massive earthworks, resulting in the archaeological mounds, or 'tells' common in the region today In the late Middle Bronze Age, the Nile Delta in Egypt was settled by Canaanites who maintained close connections with Canaan During that period, the Hyksos, dynasties of Canaanite/Asiatic origin, ruled much of Lower Egypt before being overthrown in the 16th century BCE [21]\n\n\nAncient Israel and Judah: Iron Age to Babylonian period\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of a people by the name of Israel (as ysrỉꜣr) occurs in the Egyptian Merneptah Stele, erected for Pharaoh Merneptah (son of Ramesses II) c 1209 BCE, which states \"Israel is laid waste and his seed is not.\" [31]\n\nEarly Israelites (Iron Age I)\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of a people by the name of Israel (as ysrỉꜣr) occurs in the Egyptian Merneptah Stele, erected for Pharaoh Merneptah (son of Ramesses II) c 1209 BCE, which states \"Israel is laid waste and his seed is not.\" [31]\n\nIsrael and Judah (Iron Age II)\nIn the 10th century BCE, the Israelite kingdoms of Judah and Israel emerged The Hebrew Bible states that these were preceded by a single kingdom ruled by Saul, David and Solomon, who is said to have built the First Temple Archaeologists have debated whether the united monarchy ever existed, [Notes 1] [44] [45] with those in favor of such a polity existing further divided between maximalists who support the Biblical accounts, [46] and minimalists who argue that any such polity was likely smaller than suggested [47] [48]\n\n\nAssyrian invasions\nTiglath-Pileser III of Assyria invaded Israel in around 732 BCE [63] The Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians following a long siege of the capital Samaria around 720 BCE [64] The records of Sargon II of Assyria indicate that he captured Samaria and deported 27,290 inhabitants to Mesopotamia [65] It is likely that Shalmaneser captured the city since both the Babylonian Chronicles and the Hebrew Bible viewed the fall of Israel as the signature event of his reign [66] The Assyrian deportations became the basis for the Jewish idea of the Ten Lost Tribes Foreign groups were settled by the Assyrians in the territories of the fallen kingdom [67] The Samaritans claim to be descended from Israelites of ancient Samaria who were not expelled by the Assyrians.\n\n\nBabylonian period (587–538 BCE)\nDuring the late 7th century BCE, Judah became a vassal state of the Neo-Babylonian Empire In 601 BCE, Jehoiakim of Judah allied with Babylon's principal rival, Egypt, despite the strong remonstrances of the prophet Jeremiah [76] [77] As a punishment, the Babylonians besieged Jerusalem in 597 BCE, and the city surrendered [76] [78] The defeat was recorded by the Babylonians [79] [80] Nebuchadnezzar pillaged Jerusalem and deported king Jechoiachin (Jeconiah), along with other prominent citizens, to Babylon; Zedekiah, his uncle, was installed as king [76] [81]\n\n\nFirst revolt, 597 defeat\nDuring the late 7th century BCE, Judah became a vassal state of the Neo-Babylonian Empire In 601 BCE, Jehoiakim of Judah allied with Babylon's principal rival, Egypt, despite the strong remonstrances of the prophet Jeremiah [76] [77] As a punishment, the Babylonians besieged Jerusalem in 597 BCE, and the city surrendered [76] [78] The defeat was recorded by the Babylonians [79] [80] Nebuchadnezzar pillaged Jerusalem and deported king Jechoiachin (Jeconiah), along with other prominent citizens, to Babylon; Zedekiah, his uncle, was installed as king [76] [81]\n\n\nSecond revolt, 587/86 defeat\nIn 587 or 586 BCE, King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon conquered Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple and razed the city [76] [82] [83] The Kingdom of Judah was abolished, and many of its citizens were exiled to Babylon The former territory of Judah became a Babylonian province called Yehud with its center in Mizpah, north of the destroyed Jerusalem [82]\n\n\nBabylonian diaspora after 587/86 BCE\nTablets that describe King Jehoiachin's rations were found in the ruins of Babylon He was eventually released by the Babylonians According to both the Bible and the Talmud, the Davidic dynasty continued as head of Babylonian Jewry, called the \"Rosh Galut\" (exilarch or head of exile) Arab and Jewish sources show that the Rosh Galut continued to exist for another 1,500 years in what is now Iraq, ending in the eleventh century [84]\n\n\nSecond Temple period\nIn 538 BCE, Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and took over its empire Cyrus issued a proclamation granting religious freedom to all peoples subjugated by the Babylonians (see the Cyrus Cylinder) According to the Bible, Jewish exiles in Babylon, including 50,000 Judeans led by Zerubabel, returned to Judah to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem The Second Temple was subsequently completed c 515 BCE [85] A second group of 5,000, led by Ezra and Nehemiah, returned to Judah in 456 BCE The first was empowered by the Persian king to enforce religious rules, the second had the status of governor and a royal mission to restore the walls of the city [86] The country remained a province of the Achaemenid empire called Yehud until 332 BCE.\n\n\nPersian period (538–332 BCE)\nIn 538 BCE, Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and took over its empire Cyrus issued a proclamation granting religious freedom to all peoples subjugated by the Babylonians (see the Cyrus Cylinder) According to the Bible, Jewish exiles in Babylon, including 50,000 Judeans led by Zerubabel, returned to Judah to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem The Second Temple was subsequently completed c 515 BCE [85] A second group of 5,000, led by Ezra and Nehemiah, returned to Judah in 456 BCE The first was empowered by the Persian king to enforce religious rules, the second had the status of governor and a royal mission to restore the walls of the city [86] The country remained a province of the Achaemenid empire called Yehud until 332 BCE.\n\n\nHellenistic period (333–64 BCE)\nIn 332 BCE, Alexander the Great of Macedon conquered the region as part of his campaign against the Persian Empire After his death in 322 BCE, his generals divided the empire and Judea became a frontier region between the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt [94] Following a century of Ptolemaic rule, Judea was conquered by the Seleucid Empire in 200 BCE at the battle of Panium Hellenistic rulers generally respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions [95] [96] Judea was ruled by the hereditary office of the High Priest of Israel as a Hellenistic vassal [97] Nevertheless, the region underwent a process of Hellenization, which heightened tensions between Greeks, Hellenized Jews, and observant Jews These tensions escalated into clashes involving a power struggle for the position of high priest and the character of the holy city of Jerusalem [98]\n\n\nEarly Roman period (64 BCE–2nd century CE)\nIn 64 BCE the Roman general Pompey conquered Syria and intervened in the Hasmonean civil war in Jerusalem, restoring Hyrcanus II as High Priest and making Judea a Roman vassal kingdom During the siege of Alexandria in 47 BCE, the lives of Julius Caesar and his protégé Cleopatra were saved by 3,000 Jewish troops sent by Hyrcanus II and commanded by Antipater, whose descendants Caesar made kings of Judea [108] From 37 BCE to 6 CE, the Herodian dynasty, Jewish-Roman client kings of Edomite origin, descended from Antipater, ruled Judea Herod the Great considerably enlarged the temple (see Herod's Temple), making it one of the largest religious structures in the world At this time, Jews formed as much as 10% of the population of the entire Roman Empire, with large communities in North Africa and Arabia [109]\n\n\nJewish–Roman wars\nThe Jewish–Roman wars were a series of large-scale revolts by Jewish subjects against the Roman Empire between 66 and 135 CE [114] The term primarily applies to the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), nationalist rebellions striving to restore an independent Judean state Some sources also include the Diaspora Revolt (115–117 CE), an ethno-religious conflict fought across the Eastern Mediterranean and including the Kitos War in Judaea.\n\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine periods\nAs a result of the disastrous effects of the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled [121]  Over the next centuries, more Jews left to communities in the Diaspora, especially the large, speedily growing Jewish communities in Babylonia and Arabia [122] Others remained in the Land of Israel, where the spiritual and demographic center shifted from the depopulated Judea to Galilee [123] [124] [125] Jewish presence also continued in the southern Hebron Hills, in Ein Gedi, and on the coastal plain [11] [123] The Mishnah and the Jerusalem Talmud, huge compendiums of Rabbinical discussions, were compiled during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem [126]\n\n\nLate Roman period (136–390)\nAs a result of the disastrous effects of the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled [121]  Over the next centuries, more Jews left to communities in the Diaspora, especially the large, speedily growing Jewish communities in Babylonia and Arabia [122] Others remained in the Land of Israel, where the spiritual and demographic center shifted from the depopulated Judea to Galilee [123] [124] [125] Jewish presence also continued in the southern Hebron Hills, in Ein Gedi, and on the coastal plain [11] [123] The Mishnah and the Jerusalem Talmud, huge compendiums of Rabbinical discussions, were compiled during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem [126]\n\n\nByzantine period (390–634)\nThe Roman Empire split in 390 CE and the region became part of the Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire Under Byzantine rule, much of the region and its non-Jewish population were won over by Christianity, which eventually became the dominant religion in the region The presence of holy sites drew Christian pilgrims, some of whom chose to settle, contributing to the rise of a Christian majority Christian authorities encouraged this pilgrimage movement and appropriated lands, constructing magnificent churches at locations linked to biblical narratives [141] Additionally, monks established monasteries near pagan settlements, encouraging the conversion of local pagans [127]\n\n\nEarly Muslim period\nThe Levant was conquered by an Arab army under the command of ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb in 635, and became the province of Bilad al-Sham of the Rashidun Caliphate Two military districts—Jund Filastin and Jund al-Urdunn—were established in Palestine A new city called Ramlah was built as the Muslim capital of Jund Filastin, [151] while Tiberias served as the capital of Jund al-Urdunn The Byzantine ban on Jews living in Jerusalem came to an end.\n\n\nDemographic changes\nAlthough the Arab conquest was relatively peaceful and did not cause widespread destruction, it did alter the country's demographics significantly [154] Over the ensuing several centuries, the region experienced a drastic decline in its population, from an estimated 1 million during Roman and Byzantine times to some 300,000 by the early Ottoman period This demographic collapse was accompanied by a slow process of Islamization, that resulted from the flight of non-Muslim populations, immigration of Muslims, and local conversion The majority of the remaining populace belonged to the lowest classes While the Arab conquerors themselves left the area after the conquest and moved on to other places, the settlement of Arab tribes in the area both before and after the conquest also contributed to the Islamization [155] [156] [154] As a result, the Muslim population steadily grew and the area became gradually dominated by Muslims on a political and social level [123] [157]\n\n\nCrusades and Mongols\nIn 1095, Pope Urban II called upon Christians to wage a holy war and recapture Jerusalem from Muslim rule Responding to this call, Christians launched the First Crusade in the same year, a military campaign aimed at retaking the Holy Land, ultimately resulting in the successful siege and conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 [160] In the same year, the Crusaders conquered Beit She'an and Tiberias, and in the following decade, they captured coastal cities with the support of Italian city-state fleets, establishing these coastal ports as crucial strongholds for Crusader rule in the region [161]\n\n\nMamluk period\nBetween 1258 and 1291, the area was the frontier between Mongol invaders (occasional Crusader allies) and the Mamluks of Egypt The conflict impoverished the country and severely reduced the population \nIn Egypt a caste of warrior slaves, known as the Mamluks, gradually took control of the kingdom The Mamluks were mostly of Turkish origin, and were bought as children and then trained in warfare They were highly prized warriors, who gave rulers independence of the native aristocracy In Egypt they took control of the kingdom following a failed invasion by the Crusaders (Seventh Crusade) The first Mamluk Sultan, Qutuz of Egypt, defeated the Mongols in the Battle of Ain Jalut (\"Goliath's spring\" near Ein Harod), ending the Mongol advances He was assassinated by one of his Generals, Baibars, who went on to eliminate most of the Crusader outposts The Mamluks ruled Palestine until 1516, regarding it as part of Syria In Hebron, Jews were banned from worshipping at the Cave of the Patriarchs (the second-holiest site in Judaism); they were only allowed to enter 7 steps inside the site [166] and the ban remained in place until Israel assumed control of the West Bank in the Six Days War [167] [undue weight? – discuss] The Egyptian Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil conquered the last outpost of Crusader rule in 1291.\n\n\nOttoman period\nUnder the Mamluks, the area was a province of Bilad a-Sham (Syria) It was conquered by Turkish Sultan Selim I in 1516–17, becoming a part of the province of Ottoman Syria for the next four centuries, first as the Damascus Eyalet and later as the Syria Vilayet (following the Tanzimat reorganization of 1864).\n\n\nOld Yishuv\nWith the more favorable conditions that followed the Ottoman conquest, the immigration of Jews fleeing Catholic Europe, which had already begun under Mamluk rule, continued, and soon an influx of exiled Sephardic Jews came to dominate the Jewish community in the area [169]\n\n\nBirth of Zionism\nBetween 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews moved to Palestine, known as the First Aliyah [180] In the Russian Empire, Jews faced growing persecution and legal restrictions Half the world's Jews lived in the Russian Empire, where they were restricted to living in the Pale of Settlement Severe pogroms in the early 1880s and legal repression led to 2 million Jews emigrating from the Russian Empire 1.5 million went to the United States Popular destinations were also Germany, France, England, Holland, Argentina and Palestine [181] [182]\n\n\nWorld War I\nDuring World War I, most Jews supported the Germans because they were fighting the Russians who were regarded as the Jews' main enemy [188] In Britain, the government sought Jewish support for the war effort for a variety of reasons including an antisemitic perception of \"Jewish power\" in the Ottoman Empire's Young Turks movement which was based in Thessaloniki, the most Jewish city in Europe (40% of the 160,000 population were Jewish) [189] The British also hoped to secure American Jewish support for US intervention on Britain's behalf.\n\n\nMandatory Palestine\nThe British Mandate (in effect, British rule) of Palestine, including the Balfour Declaration, was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922 and came into effect in 1923 The territory of Transjordan was also covered by the Mandate but under separate rules that excluded it from the Balfour Declaration Britain signed a treaty with the United States (which did not join the League of Nations) in which the United States endorsed the terms of the Mandate, [195] which was approved unanimously by both the U.S Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n\nFirst years\nThe British Mandate (in effect, British rule) of Palestine, including the Balfour Declaration, was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922 and came into effect in 1923 The territory of Transjordan was also covered by the Mandate but under separate rules that excluded it from the Balfour Declaration Britain signed a treaty with the United States (which did not join the League of Nations) in which the United States endorsed the terms of the Mandate, [195] which was approved unanimously by both the U.S Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n\nIncrease in Jewish immigration\nBetween 1929 and 1938, 250,000 Jews arrived in Palestine (Fifth Aliyah) [211] In 1933, the Jewish Agency and the Nazis negotiated the Ha'avara Agreement (transfer agreement), under which 50,000 German Jews would be transferred to Palestine The Jews' possessions were confiscated and in return the Nazis allowed the Ha'avara organization to purchase 14 million pounds worth of German goods for export to Palestine and use it to compensate the immigrants Although many Jews wanted to leave Nazi Germany, the Nazis prevented Jews from taking any money and restricted them to two suitcases so few could pay the British entry tax and many were afraid to leave [citation needed] The agreement was controversial and the Labour Zionist leader who negotiated the agreement, Haim Arlosoroff, was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1933 The assassination was used by the British to create tension between the Zionist left and the Zionist right [citation needed] Arlosoroff had been the boyfriend of Magda Ritschel some years before she married Joseph Goebbels [212] There has been speculation that he was assassinated by the Nazis to hide the connection but there is no evidence for it [213]\n\n\nArab revolt and the White Paper\nJewish immigration and Nazi propaganda contributed to the large-scale 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, a largely nationalist uprising directed at ending British rule The head of the Jewish Agency, Ben-Gurion, responded to the Arab Revolt with a policy of \"Havlagah\"—self-restraint and a refusal to be provoked by Arab attacks in order to prevent polarization The Etzel group broke off from the Haganah in opposition to this policy [215]\n\n\nWorld War II and the Holocaust\nDuring the Second World War, the Jewish Agency worked to establish a Jewish army that would fight alongside the British forces Churchill supported the plan but British Military and government opposition led to its rejection The British demanded that the number of Jewish recruits match the number of Arab recruits [227]\n\n\nIllegal Jewish immigration and insurgency\nThe British Empire was severely weakened by the war In the Middle East, the war had made Britain conscious of its dependence on Arab oil British firms controlled Iraqi oil and Britain ruled Kuwait, Bahrain and the Emirates Shortly after VE Day, the Labour Party won the general election in Britain Although Labour Party conferences had for years called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, the Labour government now decided to maintain the 1939 White Paper policies [243]\n\n\nUnited Nations Partition Plan\nOn 2 April 1947, the United Kingdom requested that the question of Palestine be handled by the General Assembly [256] The General Assembly created a committee, United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), to report on \"the question of Palestine\" [257]  In July 1947 the UNSCOP visited Palestine and met with Jewish and Zionist delegations The Arab Higher Committee boycotted the meetings During the visit the British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin ordered that passengers from an Aliyah Bet ship, SS Exodus 1947, to be sent back to Europe The Holocaust surviving migrants on the ship were forcibly removed by British troops at Hamburg, Germany [258] [259] [260]\n\n\nCivil War\nThe General Assembly's vote caused joy in the Jewish community and anger in the Arab community Violence broke out between the sides, escalating into civil war From January 1948, operations became increasingly militarized, with the intervention of a number of Arab Liberation Army regiments inside Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns They consolidated their presence in Galilee and Samaria [268] Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni came from Egypt with several hundred men of the Army of the Holy War Having recruited a few thousand volunteers, he organized the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem [269] The Yishuv tried to supply the city using convoys of up to 100 armoured vehicles, but largely failed By March, almost all Haganah's armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed [270]\n\n\nState of Israel\nImmediately following the declaration of the new state, both superpower leaders, US President Harry S Truman and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, recognized the new state [275]\n\n\nArab–Israeli War\nImmediately following the declaration of the new state, both superpower leaders, US President Harry S Truman and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, recognized the new state [275]\n\n\nArmistice Agreements\nIsrael signed armistices with Egypt (24 February), Lebanon (23 March), Jordan (3 April) and Syria (20 July) No actual peace agreements were signed With permanent ceasefire coming into effect, Israel's new borders, later known as the Green Line, were established These borders were not recognized by the Arab states as international boundaries Israel was in control of the Galilee, Jezreel Valley, West Jerusalem, the coastal plain and the Negev The Syrians remained in control of a strip of territory along the Sea of Galilee originally allocated to the Jewish state, the Lebanese occupied a tiny area at Rosh Hanikra, and the Egyptians retained the Gaza strip and still had some forces surrounded inside Israeli territory Jordanian forces remained in the West Bank, where the British had stationed them before the war Jordan annexed the areas it occupied while Egypt kept Gaza as an occupied zone [283] [284] [285] [286] [287]\n\n\n1948–1955: Ben-Gurion I; Sharett\nA 120-seat parliament, the Knesset, met first in Tel Aviv then moved to Jerusalem after the 1949 ceasefire In January 1949, Israel held its first elections The Socialist-Zionist parties Mapai and Mapam won the most seats (46 and 19 respectively) Mapai's leader, David Ben-Gurion, was appointed Prime Minister, he formed a coalition which did not include Mapam who were Stalinist and loyal to the USSR (another Stalinist party, non-Zionist Maki won 4 seats) This was a significant decision, as it signaled that Israel would not be in the Soviet bloc The Knesset elected Chaim Weizmann as the first (largely ceremonial) President of Israel Hebrew and Arabic were made the official languages of the new state All governments have been coalitions—no party has ever won a majority in the Knesset From 1948 until 1977 all governments were led by Mapai and the Alignment, predecessors of the Labour Party In those years Labour Zionists, initially led by David Ben-Gurion, dominated Israeli politics and the economy was run on primarily socialist lines.\n\n\n1955–1963: Ben-Gurion II\nIn 1955 Egypt concluded a massive arms deal with Czechoslovakia, upsetting the balance of power in the Middle East [313] In 1956, the increasingly pro-Soviet President Nasser of Egypt, announced the nationalization of the (French and British owned) Suez Canal, which was Egypt's main source of foreign currency Egypt also blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba preventing Israeli access to the Red Sea Israel made a secret agreement with the French at Sèvres to co-ordinate military operations against Egypt Britain and France had already begun secret preparations for military action It has been alleged that the French also agreed to build a nuclear plant for the Israelis and that by 1968 this was able to produce nuclear weapons Britain and France arranged for Israel to give them a pretext for seizing the Suez Canal Israel was to attack Egypt, and Britain and France would then call on both sides to withdraw When, as expected, the Egyptians refused, Anglo-French forces would invade to take control of the Canal.\n\n\n1963–1969: Eshkol\nIn 1963 Yigael Yadin began excavating Masada In 1964, Egypt, Jordan and Syria developed a unified military command Israel completed work on a national water carrier, a huge engineering project designed to transfer Israel's allocation of the Jordan river's waters towards the south of the country in realization of Ben-Gurion's dream of mass Jewish settlement of the Negev desert The Arabs responded by trying to divert the headwaters of the Jordan, leading to growing conflict between Israel and Syria [317]\n\n\n1969–1974: Meir\nIn early 1969, Levi Eshkol died in office of a heart attack and Golda Meir became Prime Minister with the largest percentage of the vote ever won by an Israeli party, winning 56 of the 120 seats after the 1969 election Meir was the first female prime minister of Israel and the first woman to have headed a Middle Eastern state in modern times [331] Gahal retained its 26 seats, and was the second largest party.\n\n\n1974–1977: Rabin I\nFollowing Meir's resignation, Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister Religious Zionist followers of the teachings of Abraham Isaac Kook, formed the Gush Emunim movement, and began an organized drive to settle the West Bank and Gaza Strip [335] In November 1975, the United Nations General Assembly, under the guidance of Austrian Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, adopted Resolution 3379, which asserted Zionism to be a form of racism The General Assembly rescinded this resolution in December 1991 with Resolution 46/86 [336] In March 1976, there was a massive strike by Israeli-Arabs in protest at a government plan to expropriate land in the Galilee [337]\n\n\n1977–1983: Begin\nIn a surprise result, the Likud led by Menachem Begin won 43 seats in the 1977 elections This was the first time in Israeli history that the government was not led by the left In November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat visited Jerusalem and spoke at the Knesset at the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin Sadat recognized Israel's right to exist and established the basis for direct negotiations between Egypt and Israel Following Sadat's visit, 350 Yom Kippur War veterans organized the Peace Now movement to encourage Israeli governments to make peace with the Arabs.\n\n\n1983–1992: Shamir I; Peres I; Shamir II\nIn September 1983, Begin resigned and was succeeded by Yitzhak Shamir as prime minister The 1984 election was inconclusive, and led to a power sharing agreement between Shimon Peres of the Alignment and Shamir of Likud Peres was prime minister from 1984 to 1986 and Shamir from 1986 to 1988 In 1984, continual discrimination against Sephardi Ultra-Orthodox Jews by the Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox establishment led political activist Aryeh Deri to leave the Agudat Israel party and join former chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef in forming Shas, a new party aimed at the non-Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox vote.\n\n\n1992–1996: Rabin II; Peres II\nIn the 1992 elections, the Labour Party, led by Yitzhak Rabin, won a significant victory (44 seats) promising to pursue peace while promoting Rabin as a \"tough general\" and pledging not to deal with the PLO in any way The left Zionist party Meretz won 12 seats, and the Arab and communist parties a further 5, meaning that parties supporting a peace treaty had a full (albeit small) majority in the Knesset.\n\n\n1996–2001: Netanyahu I; Barak\nThe May 1996 elections were the first featuring direct election of the prime minister and resulted in a narrow election victory for Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu A spate of suicide bombings reinforced the Likud position for security Hamas claimed responsibility for most of the bombings Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, Prime Minister Netanyahu continued their implementation, but his prime ministership saw a marked slow-down in the Peace Process Netanyahu also pledged to gradually reduce US aid to Israel [354] [better source needed]\n\n\n2001–2006: Sharon\nThe failure of the peace process, increased Palestinian terror and occasional attacks by Hezbollah from Lebanon, led much of the Israeli public and political leadership to lose confidence in the Palestinian Authority as a peace partner Most felt that many Palestinians viewed the peace treaty with Israel as a temporary measure only [366] Many Israelis were thus anxious to disengage from the Palestinians In response to a wave of suicide bomb attacks, culminating in the Passover massacre (see List of Israeli civilian casualties in the Second Intifada), Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield in March 2002, and Sharon began the construction of a barrier around the West Bank Around the same time, the Israeli town of Sderot and other Israeli communities near Gaza became subject to constant shelling and mortar bomb attacks from Gaza.\n\n\n2006–2009: Olmert\nEhud Olmert was elected Prime Minister after his party, Kadima, won the most seats (29) in the 2006 Israeli legislative election In 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was officially elected president of Iran; since then, Iranian policy towards Israel has grown more confrontational.\n\n\n2009–2021: Netanyahu II\nIn the 2009 legislative election Likud won 27 seats and Kadima 28; however, the right-wing camp won a majority of seats, and President Shimon Peres called on Netanyahu to form the government Russian immigrant-dominated Yisrael Beiteinu came third with 15 seats, and Labour was reduced to fourth place with 13 seats In 2009, Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva announced the discovery of huge natural gas reserves off the coast of Israel [375]\n\n\n2021–present: Bennett; Lapid; Netanyahu III\nFollowing the March 2021 election, Naftali Bennett signed a coalition agreement with Yair Lapid and different parties opposed to Netanyahu on the right, center and left whereby Bennett would serve as Prime Minister until September 2023 and then Lapid would assume the role until November 2025 [406] An Israeli Arab party, Ra'am, was included in the government coalition for the first time in decades [407] In June 2022, following several legislative defeats for the governing coalition, Bennett announced the introduction of a bill to dissolve the Knesset and call for new elections to be held in November [408] Yair Lapid became the new interim Prime Minister [409] After the 2022 elections, Netanyahu was able to return as Prime Minister under a coalition that included Likud, Shas, United Torah Judaism, Religious Zionist Party, Otzma Yehudit and Noam, in what was described as the most right-wing government in the country's history [410] The government has overseen an uptick in violence in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, driven by military actions such as the July 2023 Jenin incursion as well as Palestinian political violence, producing a death toll in 2023 that is the highest in the conflict since 2005 [411] In October 2023, the 2023 Israel–Hamas war started [412]\n\n\nDemographics\nZionism (history, timeline), Aliyah, Balfour Declaration, Mandate document, Mandatory Palestine\n\n\nSee also\nZionism (history, timeline),

"**History of Israel**\n\nThe history of Israel is a complex and multifaceted one, spanning thousands of years. From the earliest archaeological evidence of human presence in the region to the modern-day state of Israel, the history of this land has been shaped by various cultures, empires, and ideologies.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe oldest evidence of early humans in the territory of modern Israel, dating to 1.5 million years ago, was found in Ubeidiya near the Sea of Galilee. Flint tool artefacts have been discovered at Yiron, the oldest stone tools found anywhere outside Africa. Other groups, including the Acheulean industry, the Bizat Ruhama group, and Gesher Bnot Yaakov, have also been identified in the region.\n\n**Bronze Age Canaan**\n\nThe Canaanites are archaeologically attested in the Middle Bronze Age (2100–1550 BCE). They were likely independent or semi-independent city-states, each with its own unique culture and traditions. The Canaanites were skilled craftsmen, traders, and warriors, and their cities were often surrounded by massive earthworks, resulting in the archaeological mounds, or 'tells', common in the region today. In the late Middle Bronze Age, the Nile Delta in Egypt was settled by Canaanites who maintained close connections with Canaan. The Hyksos, dynasties of Canaanite/Asiatic origin, ruled much of Lower Egypt before being overthrown in the 16th century BCE.\n\n**Ancient Israel and Judah: Iron Age to Babylonian period**\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of a people by the name of Israel (as ysrỉꜣr) occurs in the Egyptian Merneptah Stele, erected for Pharaoh Merneptah (son of Ramesses II) c 1209 BCE, which states \"Israel is laid waste and his seed is not.\" The Israelites emerged as a distinct people in the Iron Age, around the 12th century BCE. They were initially a collection of tribes, each with its own leader and customs, but eventually coalesced into two main kingdoms: Israel and Judah. The Hebrew Bible states that these were preceded by a single kingdom ruled by Saul, David, and Solomon, who is said to have built the First Temple. Archaeologists have debated whether the united monarchy ever existed, with those in favor of such a polity existing further divided between maximalists who support the Biblical accounts, and minimalists who argue that any such polity was likely smaller than suggested.\n\n**Assyrian invasions**\n\nTiglath-Pileser III of Assyria invaded Israel in around 732 BCE. The Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians following a long siege of the capital Samaria around 720 BCE. The records of Sargon II of Assyria indicate that he captured Samaria and deported 27,290 inhabitants to Mesopotamia. It is likely that Shalmaneser captured the city since both the Babylonian Chronicles and the Hebrew Bible viewed the fall of Israel as the signature event of his reign. The Assyrian deportations became the basis for the Jewish idea of the Ten Lost Tribes. Foreign groups were settled by the Assyrians in the territories of the fallen kingdom. The Samaritans claim to be descended from Israelites of ancient Samaria who were not expelled by the Assyrians.\n\n**Babylonian period (587–538 BCE)**\n\nDuring the late 7th century BCE, Judah became a vassal state of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. In 601 BCE, Jehoiakim of Judah allied with Babylon's principal rival, Egypt, despite the strong remonstrances of the prophet Jeremiah. As a punishment, the Babylonians besieged Jerusalem in 597 BCE, and the city surrendered. The defeat was recorded by the Babylonians. Nebuchadnezzar pillaged Jerusalem and deported king Jechoiachin (Jeconiah), along with other prominent citizens, to Babylon; Zedekiah, his uncle, was installed as king. In 587 or 586 BCE, King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon conquered Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and razed the city. The Kingdom of Judah was abolished, and many of its citizens were exiled to Babylon. The former territory of Judah became a Babylonian province called Yehud with its center in Mizpah, north of the destroyed Jerusalem.\n\n**Second Temple period**\n\nIn 538 BCE, Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and took over its empire. Cyrus issued a proclamation granting religious freedom to all peoples subjugated by the Babylonians. According to the Bible, Jewish exiles in Babylon, including 50,000 Judeans led by Zerubabel, returned to Judah to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. The Second Temple was subsequently completed c 515 BCE. A second group of 5,000, led by Ezra and Nehemiah, returned to Judah in 456 BCE. The first was empowered by the Persian king to enforce religious rules, the second had the status of governor and a royal mission to restore the walls of the city.\n\n**Hellenistic period (333–64 BCE)**\n\nIn 332 BCE, Alexander the Great of Macedon conquered the region as part of his campaign against the Persian Empire. After his death in 322 BCE, his generals divided the empire, and Judea became a frontier region between the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. Following a century of Ptolemaic rule, Judea was conquered by the Seleucid Empire in 200 BCE at the battle of Panium. Hellenistic rulers generally respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. Judea was ruled by the hereditary office of the High Priest of Israel as a Hellenistic vassal. Nevertheless, the region underwent a process of Hellenization, which heightened tensions between Greeks, Hellenized Jews, and observant Jews. These tensions escalated into clashes involving a power struggle for the position of high priest and the character of the holy city of Jerusalem.\n\n**Early Roman period (64 BCE–2nd century CE)**\n\nIn 64 BCE, the Roman general Pompey conquered Syria and intervened in the Hasmonean civil war in Jerusalem, restoring Hyrcanus II as High Priest and making Judea a Roman vassal kingdom. During the siege of Alexandria in 47 BCE, the lives of Julius Caesar and his protégé Cleopatra were saved by 3,000 Jewish troops sent by Hyrcanus II and commanded by Antipater, whose descendants Caesar made kings of Judea. Herod the Great considerably enlarged the temple, making it one of the largest religious structures in the world. At this time, Jews formed as much as 10% of the population of the entire Roman Empire, with large communities in North Africa and Arabia.\n\n**Jewish–Roman wars**\n\nThe Jewish–Roman wars were a series of large-scale revolts by Jewish subjects against the Roman Empire between 66 and 135 CE. The term primarily applies to the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), nationalist rebellions striving to restore an independent Judean state. Some sources also include the Diaspora Revolt (115–117 CE), an ethno-religious conflict fought across the Eastern Mediterranean and including the Kitos War in Judaea.\n\n**Late Roman and Byzantine periods**\n\nAs a result of the disastrous effects of the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled. Over the next centuries, more Jews left to communities in the Diaspora, especially the large, speedily growing Jewish communities in Babylonia and Arabia. Others remained in the Land of Israel, where the spiritual and demographic center shifted from the depopulated Judea to Galilee. Jewish presence also continued in the southern Hebron Hills, in Ein Gedi, and on the coastal plain. The Mishnah and the Jerusalem Talmud, huge compendiums of Rabbinical discussions, were compiled during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem.\n\n**Byzantine period (390–634 CE)**\n\nThe Roman Empire split in 390 CE, and the region became part of the Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire. Under Byzantine rule, much of the region and its non-Jewish population were won over by Christianity, which eventually became the dominant religion in the region. The presence of holy sites drew Christian pilgrims, some of whom chose to settle, contributing to the rise of a Christian majority. Christian authorities encouraged this pilgrimage movement and appropriated lands, constructing magnificent churches at locations linked to biblical narratives. Additionally, monks established monasteries near pagan settlements, encouraging the conversion of local pagans.\n\n**Early Muslim period**\n\nThe Levant was conquered by an Arab army under the command of ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb in 635 CE. The Arabs established the province of Bilad al-Sham of the Rashidun Caliphate. Two military districts—Jund Filastin and Jund al-Urdunn—were established in Palestine. A new city called Ramlah was built as the Muslim capital of Jund Filastin, while Tiberias served as the capital of Jund al-Urdunn. The Byzantine ban on Jews living in Jerusalem came to an end.\n\n**Demographic changes**\n\nAlthough the Arab conquest was relatively peaceful and did not cause widespread destruction, it did alter the country's demographics significantly. Over the ensuing several centuries, the region experienced a drastic decline in its population, from an estimated 1 million during Roman and Byzantine times to some 300,000 by the early Ottoman period. This demographic collapse was accompanied by a slow process of Islamization, resulting from the flight of non-Muslim populations, immigration of Muslims, and local conversion. The majority of the remaining populace belonged to the lowest classes.\n\n**Ottoman period**\n\nUnder the Mamluks, the area was a province of Bilad a-Sham (Syria). It was conquered by Turkish Sultan Selim I in 1516–17, becoming a part of the province of Ottoman Syria for the next four centuries, first as the Damascus Eyalet and later as the Syria Vilayet (following the Tanzimat reorganization of 1864).\n\n**Old Yishuv**\n\nWith the more favorable conditions that followed the Ottoman conquest, the immigration of Jews fleeing Catholic Europe, which had already begun under Mamluk rule, continued. Soon an influx of exiled Sephardic Jews came to dominate the Jewish community in the area.\n\n**Birth of Zionism**\n\nBetween 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews moved to Palestine, known as the First Aliyah. In the Russian Empire, Jews faced growing persecution and legal restrictions. Half the world's Jews lived in the Russian Empire, where they were restricted to living in the Pale of Settlement. Severe pogroms in the early 1880s and legal repression led to 2 million Jews emigrating from the Russian Empire. 1.5 million went to the United States, and other destinations include Germany, France, England, Holland, Argentina, and Palestine.\n\n**World War I**\n\nDuring World War I, most Jews supported the Germans because they were fighting the Russians, who were regarded as the Jews' main enemy. In Britain, the government sought Jewish support for the war effort for a variety of reasons, including an antisemitic perception of \"Jewish power\" in the Ottoman Empire's Young Turks movement, which was based in Thessaloniki, the most Jewish city in Europe (40% of the 160,000 population were Jewish). The British also hoped to secure American Jewish support for US intervention on Britain's behalf.\n\n**Mandatory Palestine**\n\nThe British Mandate (in effect, British rule) of Palestine, including the Balfour Declaration, was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922 and came into effect in 1923. The territory of Transjordan was also covered by the Mandate but under separate rules that excluded it from the Balfour Declaration. Britain signed a treaty with the United States (which did not join the League of Nations) in which the United States endorsed the terms of the Mandate, which was approved unanimously by both the U.S Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n**First years**\n\nThe British Mandate (in effect, British rule) of Palestine, including the Balfour Declaration, was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922 and came into effect in 1923. The territory of Transjordan was also covered by the Mandate but under separate rules that excluded it from the Balfour Declaration. Britain signed a treaty with the United States (which did not join the League of Nations) in which the United States endorsed the terms of the Mandate, which was approved unanimously by both the U.S Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n**Increase in Jewish immigration**\n\nBetween 1929 and 1938, 250,000 Jews arrived in Palestine (Fifth Aliyah). In 1933, the Jewish Agency and the Nazis negotiated the Ha'avara Agreement (transfer agreement), under which 50,000 German Jews would be transferred to Palestine. The Jews' possessions were confiscated, and in return, the Nazis allowed the Ha'avara organization to purchase 14 million pounds worth of German goods for export to Palestine and use it to compensate the immigrants. Although many Jews wanted to leave Nazi Germany, the Nazis prevented Jews from taking any money, and restricted them to two suitcases, so few could pay the British entry tax, and many were afraid to leave. The agreement was controversial, and the Labour Zionist leader who negotiated the agreement, Haim Arlosoroff, was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1933. The assassination was used by the British to create tension between the Zionist left and the Zionist right. Arlosoroff had been the boyfriend of Magda Ritschel some years before she married Joseph Goebbels.\n\n**Arab revolt and the White Paper**\n\nJewish immigration and Nazi propaganda contributed to the large-scale 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, a largely nationalist uprising directed at ending British rule. The head of the Jewish Agency, Ben-Gurion, responded to the Arab Revolt with a policy of \"Havlagah\"—self-restraint and a refusal to be provoked by Arab attacks in order to prevent polarization. The Etzel group broke off from the Haganah in opposition to this policy.\n\n**World War II and the Holocaust**\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Jewish Agency worked to establish a Jewish army that would fight alongside the British forces. Churchill supported the plan but British Military and government opposition led to its rejection. The British demanded that the number of Jewish recruits match the number of Arab recruits.\n\n**Illegal Jewish immigration and insurgency**\n\nThe British Empire was severely weakened by the war. In the Middle East, the war had made Britain conscious of its dependence on Arab oil. British firms controlled Iraqi oil, and Britain ruled Kuwait, Bahrain, and the Emirates. Shortly after VE Day, the Labour Party won the general election in Britain. Although Labour Party conferences had for years called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, the Labour government now decided to maintain the 1939 White Paper policies.\n\n**United Nations Partition Plan**\n\nOn 2 April 1947, the United Kingdom requested that the question of Palestine be handled by the General Assembly. The General Assembly created a committee, United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), to report on \"the question of Palestine.\" In July 1947, the UNSCOP visited Palestine and met with Jewish and Zionist delegations. The Arab Higher Committee boycotted the meetings. During the visit, the British Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, ordered that passengers from an Aliyah Bet ship, SS Exodus 1947, be sent back to Europe. The Holocaust survivors on the ship were forcibly removed by British troops at Hamburg, Germany.\n\n**Civil War**\n\nThe General Assembly's vote caused joy in the Jewish community and anger in the Arab community. Violence broke out between the sides, escalating into civil war. From January 1948, operations became increasingly militarized, with the intervention of a number of Arab Liberation Army regiments inside Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns. They consolidated their presence in Galilee and Samaria. Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni came from Egypt with several hundred men of the Army of the Holy War. He organized the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem. The Yishuv tried to supply the city using convoys of up to 100 armored vehicles, but largely failed. By March, almost all Haganah's armored vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed.\n\n**State of Israel**\n\nImmediately following the declaration of the new state, both superpower leaders, US President Harry S Truman and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, recognized the new state.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"History_of_Israel\" following this outline:\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe oldest evidence of early humans in the territory of

The defeat was recorded by the Babylonians [79] [80] Nebuchadnezzar pillaged Jerusalem and deported king Jechoiachin (Jeconiah), along with other prominent citizens, to Babylon; Zedekiah, his uncle, was installed as king [76] [81]\n\n\nSecond revolt, 587/86 defeat\nIn 587 or 586 BCE, King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon conquered Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple and razed the city [76] [82] [83] The Kingdom of Judah was abolished, and many of its citizens were exiled to Babylon The former territory of Judah became a Babylonian province called Yehud with its center in Mizpah, north of the destroyed Jerusalem [82]\n\n\nBabylonian diaspora after 587/86 BCE\nTablets that describe King Jehoiachin's rations were found in the ruins of Babylon He was eventually released by the Babylonians According to both the Bible and the Talmud, the Davidic dynasty continued as head of Babylonian Jewry, called the \"Rosh Galut\" (exilarch or head of exile) Arab and Jewish sources show that the Rosh Galut continued to exist for another 1,500 years in what is now Iraq, ending in the eleventh century [84]\n\n\nSecond Temple period\nIn 538 BCE, Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and took over its empire Cyrus issued a proclamation granting religious freedom to all peoples subjugated by the Babylonians (see the Cyrus Cylinder) According to the Bible, Jewish exiles in Babylon, including 50,000 Judeans led by Zerubabel, returned to Judah to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem The Second Temple was subsequently completed c 515 BCE [85] A second group of 5,000, led by Ezra and Nehemiah, returned to Judah in 456 BCE The first was empowered by the Persian king to enforce religious rules, the second had the status of governor and a royal mission to restore the walls of the city [86] The country remained a province of the Achaemenid empire called Yehud until 332 BCE.\n\n\nPersian period (538–332 BCE)\nIn 538 BCE, Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and took over its empire Cyrus issued a proclamation granting religious freedom to all peoples subjugated by the Babylonians (see the Cyrus Cylinder) According to the Bible, Jewish exiles in Babylon, including 50,000 Judeans led by Zerubabel, returned to Judah to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem The Second Temple was subsequently completed c 515 BCE [85] A second group of 5,000, led by Ezra and Nehemiah, returned to Judah in 456 BCE The first was empowered by the Persian king to enforce religious rules, the second had the status of governor and a royal mission to restore the walls of the city [86] The country remained a province of the Achaemenid empire called Yehud until 332 BCE.\n\n\nHellenistic period (333–64 BCE)\nIn 332 BCE, Alexander the Great of Macedon conquered the region as part of his campaign against the Persian Empire After his death in 322 BCE, his generals divided the empire and Judea became a frontier region between the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt [94] Following a century of Ptolemaic rule, Judea was conquered by the Seleucid Empire in 200 BCE at the battle of Panium Hellenistic rulers generally respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions [95] [96] Judea was ruled by the hereditary office of the High Priest of Israel as a Hellenistic vassal [97] Nevertheless, the region underwent a process of Hellenization, which heightened tensions between Greeks, Hellenized Jews, and observant Jews These tensions escalated into clashes involving a power struggle for the position of high priest and the character of the holy city of Jerusalem [98]\n\n\nEarly Roman period (64 BCE–2nd century CE)\nIn 64 BCE the Roman general Pompey conquered Syria and intervened in the Hasmonean civil war in Jerusalem, restoring Hyrcanus II as High Priest and making Judea a Roman vassal kingdom During the siege of Alexandria in 47 BCE, the lives of Julius Caesar and his protégé Cleopatra were saved by 3,000 Jewish troops sent by Hyrcanus II and commanded by Antipater, whose descendants Caesar made kings of Judea [108] From 37 BCE to 6 CE, the Herodian dynasty, Jewish-Roman client kings of Edomite origin, descended from Antipater, ruled Judea Herod the Great considerably enlarged the temple (see Herod's Temple), making it one of the largest religious structures in the world At this time, Jews formed as much as 10% of the population of the entire Roman Empire, with large communities in North Africa and Arabia [109]\n\n\nJewish–Roman wars\nThe Jewish–Roman wars were a series of large-scale revolts by Jewish subjects against the Roman Empire between 66 and 135 CE [114] The term primarily applies to the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), nationalist rebellions striving to restore an independent Judean state Some sources also include the Diaspora Revolt (115–117 CE), an ethno-religious conflict fought across the Eastern Mediterranean and including the Kitos War in Judaea.\n\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine periods\nAs a result of the disastrous effects of the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled [121]  Over the next centuries, more Jews left to communities in the Diaspora, especially the large, speedily growing Jewish communities in Babylonia and Arabia [122] Others remained in the Land of Israel, where the spiritual and demographic center shifted from the depopulated Judea to Galilee [123] [124] [125] Jewish presence also continued in the southern Hebron Hills, in Ein Gedi, and on the coastal plain [11] [123] The Mishnah and the Jerusalem Talmud, huge compendiums of Rabbinical discussions, were compiled during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem [126]\n\n\nLate Roman period (136–390)\nAs a result of the disastrous effects of the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled [121]  Over the next centuries, more Jews left to communities in the Diaspora, especially the large, speedily growing Jewish communities in Babylonia and Arabia [122] Others remained in the Land of Israel, where the spiritual and demographic center shifted from the depopulated Judea to Galilee [123] [124] [125] Jewish presence also continued in the southern Hebron Hills, in Ein Gedi, and on the coastal plain [11] [123] The Mishnah and the Jerusalem Talmud, huge compendiums of Rabbinical discussions, were compiled during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem [126]\n\n\nByzantine period (390–634)\nThe Roman Empire split in 390 CE and the region became part of the Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire Under Byzantine rule, much of the region and its non-Jewish population were won over by Christianity, which eventually became the dominant religion in the region The presence of holy sites drew Christian pilgrims, some of whom chose to settle, contributing to the rise of a Christian majority Christian authorities encouraged this pilgrimage movement and appropriated lands, constructing magnificent churches at locations linked to biblical narratives [141] Additionally, monks established monasteries near pagan settlements, encouraging the conversion of local pagans [127]\n\n\nEarly Muslim period\nThe Levant was conquered by an Arab army under the command of ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb in 635, and became the province of Bilad al-Sham of the Rashidun Caliphate Two military districts—Jund Filastin and Jund al-Urdunn—were established in Palestine A new city called Ramlah was built as the Muslim capital of Jund Filastin, [151] while Tiberias served as the capital of Jund al-Urdunn The Byzantine ban on Jews living in Jerusalem came to an end.\n\n\nDemographic changes\nAlthough the Arab conquest was relatively peaceful and did not cause widespread destruction, it did alter the country's demographics significantly [154] Over the ensuing several centuries, the region experienced a drastic decline in its population, from an estimated 1 million during Roman and Byzantine times to some 300,000 by the early Ottoman period This demographic collapse was accompanied by a slow process of Islamization, that resulted from the flight of non-Muslim populations, immigration of Muslims, and local conversion The majority of the remaining populace belonged to the lowest classes While the Arab conquerors themselves left the area after the conquest and moved on to other places, the settlement of Arab tribes in the area both before and after the conquest also contributed to the Islamization [155] [156] [154] As a result, the Muslim population steadily grew and the area became gradually dominated by Muslims on a political and social level [123] [157]\n\n\nCrusades and Mongols\nIn 1095, Pope Urban II called upon Christians to wage a holy war and recapture Jerusalem from Muslim rule Responding to this call, Christians launched the First Crusade in the same year, a military campaign aimed at retaking the Holy Land, ultimately resulting in the successful siege and conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 [160] In the same year, the Crusaders conquered Beit She'an and Tiberias, and in the following decade, they captured coastal cities with the support of Italian city-state fleets, establishing these coastal ports as crucial strongholds for Crusader rule in the region [161]\n\n\nMamluk period\nBetween 1258 and 1291, the area was the frontier between Mongol invaders (occasional Crusader allies) and the Mamluks of Egypt The conflict impoverished the country and severely reduced the population \nIn Egypt a caste of warrior slaves, known as the Mamluks, gradually took control of the kingdom The Mamluks were mostly of Turkish origin, and were bought as children and then trained in warfare They were highly prized warriors, who gave rulers independence of the native aristocracy In Egypt they took control of the kingdom following a failed invasion by the Crusaders (Seventh Crusade) The first Mamluk Sultan, Qutuz of Egypt, defeated the Mongols in the Battle of Ain Jalut (\"Goliath's spring\" near Ein Harod), ending the Mongol advances He was assassinated by one of his Generals, Baibars, who went on to eliminate most of the Crusader outposts The Mamluks ruled Palestine until 1516, regarding it as part of Syria In Hebron, Jews were banned from worshipping at the Cave of the Patriarchs (the second-holiest site in Judaism); they were only allowed to enter 7 steps inside the site [166] and the ban remained in place until Israel assumed control of the West Bank in the Six Days War [167] [undue weight? – discuss] The Egyptian Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil conquered the last outpost of Crusader rule in 1291.\n\n\nOttoman period\nUnder the Mamluks, the area was a province of Bilad a-Sham (Syria) It was conquered by Turkish Sultan Selim I in 1516–17, becoming a part of the province of Ottoman Syria for the next four centuries, first as the Damascus Eyalet and later as the Syria Vilayet (following the Tanzimat reorganization of 1864).\n\n\nOld Yishuv\nWith the more favorable conditions that followed the Ottoman conquest, the immigration of Jews fleeing Catholic Europe, which had already begun under Mamluk rule, continued, and soon an influx of exiled Sephardic Jews came to dominate the Jewish community in the area [169]\n\n\nBirth of Zionism\nBetween 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews moved to Palestine, known as the First Aliyah [180] In the Russian Empire, Jews faced growing persecution and legal restrictions Half the world's Jews lived in the Russian Empire, where they were restricted to living in the Pale of Settlement Severe pogroms in the early 1880s and legal repression led to 2 million Jews emigrating from the Russian Empire 1.5 million went to the United States Popular destinations were also Germany, France, England, Holland, Argentina and Palestine [181] [182]\n\n\nWorld War I\nDuring World War I, most Jews supported the Germans because they were fighting the Russians who were regarded as the Jews' main enemy [188] In Britain, the government sought Jewish support for the war effort for a variety of reasons including an antisemitic perception of \"Jewish power\" in the Ottoman Empire's Young Turks movement which was based in Thessaloniki, the most Jewish city in Europe (40% of the 160,000 population were Jewish) [189] The British also hoped to secure American Jewish support for US intervention on Britain's behalf.\n\n\nMandatory Palestine\nThe British Mandate (in effect, British rule) of Palestine, including the Balfour Declaration, was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922 and came into effect in 1923 The territory of Transjordan was also covered by the Mandate but under separate rules that excluded it from the Balfour Declaration Britain signed a treaty with the United States (which did not join the League of Nations) in which the United States endorsed the terms of the Mandate, [195] which was approved unanimously by both the U.S Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n\nFirst years\nThe British Mandate (in effect, British rule) of Palestine, including the Balfour Declaration, was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922 and came into effect in 1923 The territory of Transjordan was also covered by the Mandate but under separate rules that excluded it from the Balfour Declaration Britain signed a treaty with the United States (which did not join the League of Nations) in which the United States endorsed the terms of the Mandate, [195] which was approved unanimously by both the U.S Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n\nIncrease in Jewish immigration\nBetween 1929 and 1938, 250,000 Jews arrived in Palestine (Fifth Aliyah) [211] In 1933, the Jewish Agency and the Nazis negotiated the Ha'avara Agreement (transfer agreement), under which 50,000 German Jews would be transferred to Palestine The Jews' possessions were confiscated and in return the Nazis allowed the Ha'avara organization to purchase 14 million pounds worth of German goods for export to Palestine and use it to compensate the immigrants Although many Jews wanted to leave Nazi Germany, the Nazis prevented Jews from taking any money and restricted them to two suitcases so few could pay the British entry tax and many were afraid to leave [citation needed] The agreement was controversial and the Labour Zionist leader who negotiated the agreement, Haim Arlosoroff, was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1933 The assassination was used by the British to create tension between the Zionist left and the Zionist right [citation needed] Arlosoroff had been the boyfriend of Magda Ritschel some years before she married Joseph Goebbels [212] There has been speculation that he was assassinated by the Nazis to hide the connection but there is no evidence for it [213]\n\n\nArab revolt and the White Paper\nJewish immigration and Nazi propaganda contributed to the large-scale 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, a largely nationalist uprising directed at ending British rule The head of the Jewish Agency, Ben-Gurion, responded to the Arab Revolt with a policy of \"Havlagah\"—self-restraint and a refusal to be provoked by Arab attacks in order to prevent polarization The Etzel group broke off from the Haganah in opposition to this policy [215]\n\n\nWorld War II and the Holocaust\nDuring the Second World War, the Jewish Agency worked to establish a Jewish army that would fight alongside the British forces Churchill supported the plan but British Military and government opposition led to its rejection The British demanded that the number of Jewish recruits match the number of Arab recruits [227]\n\n\nIllegal Jewish immigration and insurgency\nThe British Empire was severely weakened by the war In the Middle East, the war had made Britain conscious of its dependence on Arab oil British firms controlled Iraqi oil and Britain ruled Kuwait, Bahrain and the Emirates Shortly after VE Day, the Labour Party won the general election in Britain Although Labour Party conferences had for years called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, the Labour government now decided to maintain the 1939 White Paper policies [243]\n\n\nUnited Nations Partition Plan\nOn 2 April 1947, the United Kingdom requested that the question of Palestine be handled by the General Assembly [256] The General Assembly created a committee, United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), to report on \"the question of Palestine\" [257]  In July 1947 the UNSCOP visited Palestine and met with Jewish and Zionist delegations The Arab Higher Committee boycotted the meetings During the visit the British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin ordered that passengers from an Aliyah Bet ship, SS Exodus 1947, to be sent back to Europe The Holocaust surviving migrants on the ship were forcibly removed by British troops at Hamburg, Germany [258] [259] [260]\n\n\nCivil War\nThe General Assembly's vote caused joy in the Jewish community and anger in the Arab community Violence broke out between the sides, escalating into civil war From January 1948, operations became increasingly militarized, with the intervention of a number of Arab Liberation Army regiments inside Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns They consolidated their presence in Galilee and Samaria [268] Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni came from Egypt with several hundred men of the Army of the Holy War Having recruited a few thousand volunteers, he organized the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem [269] The Yishuv tried to supply the city using convoys of up to 100 armoured vehicles, but largely failed By March, almost all Haganah's armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed [270]\n\n\nState of Israel\nImmediately following the declaration of the new state, both superpower leaders, US President Harry S Truman and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, recognized the new state [275]\n\n\nArab–Israeli War\nImmediately following the declaration of the new state, both superpower leaders, US President Harry S Truman and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, recognized the new state [275]\n\n\nArmistice Agreements\nIsrael signed armistices with Egypt (24 February), Lebanon (23 March), Jordan (3 April) and Syria (20 July) No actual peace agreements were signed With permanent ceasefire coming into effect, Israel's new borders, later known as the Green Line, were established These borders were not recognized by the Arab states as international boundaries Israel was in control of the Galilee, Jezreel Valley, West Jerusalem, the coastal plain and the Negev The Syrians remained in control of a strip of territory along the Sea of Galilee originally allocated to the Jewish state, the Lebanese occupied a tiny area at Rosh Hanikra, and the Egyptians retained the Gaza strip and still had some forces surrounded inside Israeli territory Jordanian forces remained in the West Bank, where the British had stationed them before the war Jordan annexed the areas it occupied while Egypt kept Gaza as an occupied zone [283] [284] [285] [286] [287]\n\n\n1948–1955: Ben-Gurion I; Sharett\nA 120-seat parliament, the Knesset, met first in Tel Aviv then moved to Jerusalem after the 1949 ceasefire In January 1949, Israel held its first elections The Socialist-Zionist parties Mapai and Mapam won the most seats (46 and 19 respectively) Mapai's leader, David Ben-Gurion, was appointed Prime Minister, he formed a coalition which did not include Mapam who were Stalinist and loyal to the USSR (another Stalinist party, non-Zionist Maki won 4 seats) This was a significant decision, as it signaled that Israel would not be in the Soviet bloc The Knesset elected Chaim Weizmann as the first (largely ceremonial) President of Israel Hebrew and Arabic were made the official languages of the new state All governments have been coalitions—no party has ever won a majority in the Knesset From 1948 until 1977 all governments were led by Mapai and the Alignment, predecessors of the Labour Party In those years Labour Zionists, initially led by David Ben-Gurion, dominated Israeli politics and the economy was run on primarily socialist lines.\n\n\n1955–1963: Ben-Gurion II\nIn 1955 Egypt concluded a massive arms deal with Czechoslovakia, upsetting the balance of power in the Middle East [313] In 1956, the increasingly pro-Soviet President Nasser of Egypt, announced the nationalization of the (French and British owned) Suez Canal, which was Egypt's main source of foreign currency Egypt also blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba preventing Israeli access to the Red Sea Israel made a secret agreement with the French at Sèvres to co-ordinate military operations against Egypt Britain and France had already begun secret preparations for military action It has been alleged that the French also agreed to build a nuclear plant for the Israelis and that by 1968 this was able to produce nuclear weapons Britain and France arranged for Israel to give them a pretext for seizing the Suez Canal Israel was to attack Egypt, and Britain and France would then call on both sides to withdraw When, as expected, the Egyptians refused, Anglo-French forces would invade to take control of the Canal.\n\n\n1963–1969: Eshkol\nIn 1963 Yigael Yadin began excavating Masada In 1964, Egypt, Jordan and Syria developed a unified military command Israel completed work on a national water carrier, a huge engineering project designed to transfer Israel's allocation of the Jordan river's waters towards the south of the country in realization of Ben-Gurion's dream of mass Jewish settlement of the Negev desert The Arabs responded by trying to divert the headwaters of the Jordan, leading to growing conflict between Israel and Syria [317]\n\n\n1969–1974: Meir\nIn early 1969, Levi Eshkol died in office of a heart attack and Golda Meir became Prime Minister with the largest percentage of the vote ever won by an Israeli party, winning 56 of the 120 seats after the 1969 election Meir was the first female prime minister of Israel and the first woman to have headed a Middle Eastern state in modern times [331] Gahal retained its 26 seats, and was the second largest party.\n\n\n1974–1977: Rabin I\nFollowing Meir's resignation, Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister Religious Zionist followers of the teachings of Abraham Isaac Kook, formed the Gush Emunim movement, and began an organized drive to settle the West Bank and Gaza Strip [335] In November 1975, the United Nations General Assembly, under the guidance of Austrian Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, adopted Resolution 3379, which asserted Zionism to be a form of racism The General Assembly rescinded this resolution in December 1991 with Resolution 46/86 [336] In March 1976, there was a massive strike by Israeli-Arabs in protest at a government plan to expropriate land in the Galilee [337]\n\n\n1977–1983: Begin\nIn a surprise result, the Likud led by Menachem Begin won 43 seats in the 1977 elections This was the first time in Israeli history that the government was not led by the left In November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat visited Jerusalem and spoke at the Knesset at the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin Sadat recognized Israel's right to exist and established the basis for direct negotiations between Egypt and Israel Following Sadat's visit, 350 Yom Kippur War veterans organized the Peace Now movement to encourage Israeli governments to make peace with the Arabs.\n\n\n1983–1992: Shamir I; Peres I; Shamir II\nIn September 1983, Begin resigned and was succeeded by Yitzhak Shamir as prime minister The 1984 election was inconclusive, and led to a power sharing agreement between Shimon Peres of the Alignment and Shamir of Likud Peres was prime minister from 1984 to 1986 and Shamir from 1986 to 1988 In 1984, continual discrimination against Sephardi Ultra-Orthodox Jews by the Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox establishment led political activist Aryeh Deri to leave the Agudat Israel party and join former chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef in forming Shas, a new party aimed at the non-Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox vote.\n\n\n1992–1996: Rabin II; Peres II\nIn the 1992 elections, the Labour Party, led by Yitzhak Rabin, won a significant victory (44 seats) promising to pursue peace while promoting Rabin as a \"tough general\" and pledging not to deal with the PLO in any way The left Zionist party Meretz won 12 seats, and the Arab and communist parties a further 5, meaning that parties supporting a peace treaty had a full (albeit small) majority in the Knesset.\n\n\n1996–2001: Netanyahu I; Barak\nThe May 1996 elections were the first featuring direct election of the prime minister and resulted in a narrow election victory for Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu A spate of suicide bombings reinforced the Likud position for security Hamas claimed responsibility for most of the bombings Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, Prime Minister Netanyahu continued their implementation, but his prime ministership saw a marked slow-down in the Peace Process Netanyahu also pledged to gradually reduce US aid to Israel [354] [better source needed]\n\n\n2001–2006: Sharon\nThe failure of the peace process, increased Palestinian terror and occasional attacks by Hezbollah from Lebanon, led much of the Israeli public and political leadership to lose confidence in the Palestinian Authority as a peace partner Most felt that many Palestinians viewed the peace treaty with Israel as a temporary measure only [366] Many Israelis were thus anxious to disengage from the Palestinians In response to a wave of suicide bomb attacks, culminating in the Passover massacre (see List of Israeli civilian casualties in the Second Intifada), Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield in March 2002, and Sharon began the construction of a barrier around the West Bank Around the same time, the Israeli town of Sderot and other Israeli communities near Gaza became subject to constant shelling and mortar bomb attacks from Gaza.\n\n\n2006–2009: Olmert\nEhud Olmert was elected Prime Minister after his party, Kadima, won the most seats (29) in the 2006 Israeli legislative election In 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was officially elected president of Iran; since then, Iranian policy towards Israel has grown more confrontational.\n\n\n2009–2021: Netanyahu II\nIn the 2009 legislative election Likud won 27 seats and Kadima 28; however, the right-wing camp won a majority of seats, and President Shimon Peres called on Netanyahu to form the government Russian immigrant-dominated Yisrael Beiteinu came third with 15 seats, and Labour was reduced to fourth place with 13 seats In 2009, Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva announced the discovery of huge natural gas reserves off the coast of Israel [375]\n\n\n2021–present: Bennett; Lapid; Netanyahu III\nFollowing the March 2021 election, Naftali Bennett signed a coalition agreement with Yair Lapid and different parties opposed to Netanyahu on the right, center and left whereby Bennett would serve as Prime Minister until September 2023 and then Lapid would assume the role until November 2025 [406] An Israeli Arab party, Ra'am, was included in the government coalition for the first time in decades [407] In June 2022, following several legislative defeats for the governing coalition, Bennett announced the introduction of a bill to dissolve the Knesset and call for new elections to be held in November [408] Yair Lapid became the new interim Prime Minister [409] After the 2022 elections, Netanyahu was able to return as Prime Minister under a coalition that included Likud, Shas, United Torah Judaism, Religious Zionist Party, Otzma Yehudit and Noam, in what was described as the most right-wing government in the country's history [410] The government has overseen an uptick in violence in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, driven by military actions such as the July 2023 Jenin incursion as well as Palestinian political violence, producing a death toll in 2023 that is the highest in the conflict since 2005 [411] In October 2023, the 2023 Israel–Hamas war started [412]\n\n\nDemographics\nZionism (history, timeline), Aliyah, Balfour Declaration, Mandate document, Mandatory

(one of the books withdrawn from circulation by the Seuss estate in 2021 [5]) about Peter T Hooper, a boy who collects eggs from a number of exotic birds to make scrambled eggs One of these exotic birds is the \"Beagle-Beaked-Bald-Headed Grinch\" who shares the later Grinch's cantankerous attitude.\n\n\nVoice actors and portrayals\nIn many different movies, specials, and television series, the Grinch has been voiced and played by many different characters throughout many films In Chuck Jones' 1966 television special, the Grinch was voiced by Boris Karloff before he died three years later in 1969 [18] Hans Conried voiced the character in Halloween Is Grinch Night while Bob Holt voiced the character in The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat, a crossover with one of Dr Seuss' characters The Cat in the Hat.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Grinch has become an anti-icon of Christmas and the winter holidays, as a symbol of those who despise the holiday, much in the same nature as the earlier character of Ebenezer Scrooge Over the years, the Grinch has appeared on various forms of memorabilia such as Christmas ornaments, plush dolls, and various clothing items [12] The grumpy, anti-holiday spirit of the character has led to the everyday term \"Grinch\" [27] [28] coming to refer to a person opposed to Christmas time celebrations [29] [30] or to someone with a coarse, greedy attitude [28] In 2002, TV Guide ranked The Grinch number 5 on its \"50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\" list [27]\n\n\nIn politics\nMultiple politicians in the United Kingdom and United States have been compared to the Grinch, often due to accusations that they will 'steal' Christmas.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**The Grinch**\n\nThe Grinch is a fictional character created by American author and illustrator Dr. Seuss.

In full-color adaptations, he is typically colored green. He has a distinctive appearance that has been consistent across various adaptations and interpretations. The Grinch's physical appearance is often used to convey his grumpy and disagreeable personality.\n\nIn addition to his physical appearance, the Grinch is also characterized by his cynical and irritable personality. He is often shown to be opposed to the joy and festivities of the holiday season, and is known to try and disrupt the celebrations of the Whos, the inhabitants of Whoville.\n\n**History**\n\nThe first use of the word 'Grinch' in a work by Dr. Seuss appears in the 1953 book Scrambled Eggs Super! This book is one of the few works by Dr. Seuss that has been withdrawn from circulation by the Seuss estate. The book tells the story of Peter T. Hooper, a boy who collects eggs from a number of exotic birds to make scrambled eggs. One of these exotic birds is the \"Beagle-Beaked-Bald-Headed Grinch\", who shares the later Grinch's cantankerous attitude.\n\nThe Grinch gained popularity with the publication of Dr. Seuss's 1957 book How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, which tells the story of the Grinch's attempts to ruin Christmas for the Whos. The book has become a classic of children's literature and has been adapted into numerous films, television specials, and stage productions.\n\n**Voice Actors and Portrayals**\n\nThe Grinch has been voiced and played by many different actors throughout the years. One of the earliest and most famous portrayals of the Grinch was by Boris Karloff in the 1966 animated television special. Karloff's iconic voice and performance helped to establish the Grinch as a beloved and recognizable character.\n\nOther notable voice actors and portrayals of the Grinch include Hans Conried, who voiced the character in the 1977 television special Halloween Is Grinch Night, and Bob Holt, who voiced the character in the 1982 animated television special The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat, a crossover with Dr. Seuss's character the Cat in the Hat.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThe Grinch has become an anti-icon of Christmas and the winter holidays, representing those who despise the holiday and its associated festivities. In this sense, the Grinch is similar to the earlier character of Ebenezer Scrooge from Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol.\n\nThe Grinch's grumpy and anti-holiday spirit has also led to the everyday term \"Grinch\" being used to refer to a person who is opposed to Christmas time celebrations or has a coarse and greedy attitude. In 2002, TV Guide ranked the Grinch number 5 on its list of the \"50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\".\n\n**In Politics**\n\nThe Grinch's reputation as a naysayer and a disruptor has led to him being compared to various politicians in the United Kingdom and the United States. In these comparisons, the Grinch is often seen as a symbol of a politician who will \"steal\" Christmas by opposing or trying to ruin the holiday season.\n\nThe Grinch's ability to evoke strong emotions and reactions has made him a popular cultural icon, and his association with the holiday season has cemented his place in the pantheon of Christmas characters.\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the original request.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Dr. Seuss's official website\n* The Grinch's Wikipedia page\n* How the Grinch Stole Christmas! on IMDb\n* The Grinch on Amazon", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Grinch\" following this outline:\n\n\nCharacter description\nThe Grinch is depicted as a green, furry, pot-bellied, pear-shaped, snub-nosed humanoid creature with a cat-like face and cynical personality In full-color adaptations, he is typically colored green He has spent the past 53 years living in seclusion on a cliff overlooking the town of Whoville.\n\n\nHistory\nThe first use of the word 'Grinch' in a work by Dr Seuss appears in the 1953 book Scrambled Eggs Super!

{"title": "Argentina–Brazil_football_rivalry", "content": "\nHistory\nThe origins of the football rivalry between Argentina and Brazil can be traced to a time before football became popular in both countries [29] Their rivalry is found in almost all sports, but a men's football match between Argentina and Brazil is particularly important Since their first match in 1914, the men's national teams have played more than 100 matches including friendlies, FIFA World Cup matches, and other official competitions (excluding matches between youth sides) The rivalry began with Argentina's 3-0 victory in 1914 but the early period of the rivalry was marked by periods of non-engagement due to violent incidents Notably, after a violent Copa América final in 1925, both teams refrained from competing in tournaments where the other was present (Brazil withdrawing from the Copa America until a single appearance in 1937), and a similar decade long hiatus followed a 1946 match with Argentina not playing at any World Cups until 1958.\n\n\nIncidents and historical matches\nFor the 1925 Copa América, Argentina and Brazil played the final match at Sportivo Barracas Stadium on Christmas Day, drawing a crowd of more than 30,000 people After 27 minutes Lagarto intercepted a back pass by Ludovico Bidoglio and passed the ball to Arthur Friedenreich, who beat Américo Tesoriere with a strong shot, making it 1-0 to Brazil Three minutes later, Nilo scored the second for the canarinha The crowd was astonished, because if the Brazilian lead was maintained, a new match would have to be played to determine the champion.\n\n\n1925 Copa América\nFor the 1925 Copa América, Argentina and Brazil played the final match at Sportivo Barracas Stadium on Christmas Day, drawing a crowd of more than 30,000 people After 27 minutes Lagarto intercepted a back pass by Ludovico Bidoglio and passed the ball to Arthur Friedenreich, who beat Américo Tesoriere with a strong shot, making it 1-0 to Brazil Three minutes later, Nilo scored the second for the canarinha The crowd was astonished, because if the Brazilian lead was maintained, a new match would have to be played to determine the champion.\n\n\n1937 Copa América final\nIn the 1937 South American Championship (currently Copa América), the rivalry between both teams was already something of national pride There were verbal confrontations between both parties, and Argentine fans often taunted the Brazilians by calling them macaquitos and making monkey sounds [31] The final match, held in Buenos Aires, was played between the two sides and was goalless after 90 minutes In extra time, Argentina scored two goals Questioning one of the goals and fearful for their own safety, the Brazilian players decided to leave the stadium before the match was officially finished The Brazilian press has since called this match \"jogo da vergonha\" (\"the shame game\") [32] Argentina won, 2–0, and was South American champion again.\n\n\n1939 Copa Roca\nThe 1939 edition of the Roca Cup was the longest in history, having been defined after four matches The first two games were held in Estádio São Januário in Rio de Janeiro The first one, held in January, ended 5–1 to Argentina [33]\n\n\n1945–1946 incidents\nIn the 1945 Copa Roca match that Brazil won 6–2, young Brazilian Ademir de Menezes fractured Argentine José Battagliero's leg [34] Though it seemed to be only an unfortunate accident, the game was played roughly and sometimes violent.\n\n\n1974 World Cup\nIt would be the first-ever meeting between Brazil and Argentina in the FIFA World Cup Defending champions Brazil faced Argentina in West Germany's Niedersachsenstadion in Hanover in the second round as both were placed in Group A Brazil won it by 2–1 via goals from Rivellino and Jairzinho whereas Brindisi scored the only goal for Argentina [36]\n\n\n1978 World Cup\nThe Group B of the second round was essentially a battle between Argentina and Brazil, and it was resolved in controversial circumstances In the first round of group games, Brazil beat Peru 3–0 while Argentina saw off Poland 2–0 Brazil and Argentina then played out a tense and violent goalless draw – also known as \"A Batalha de Rosário\" (\"The Battle of Rosario\"), so both teams went into the last round of matches with three points Argentina had an advantage that their match against Peru kicked off several hours after Brazil's match with Poland.\n\n\n1982 World Cup\nBrazil and Argentina were grouped together (along with Italy) in the second group stage in Group C, which was dubbed as the \"group of death\" In the opener, Italy prevailed 2–1 over Argentina Argentina now needed a win over Brazil on the second day, but they were no match, as the Brazilians' attacking game, characterised by nimble, one-touch passing on-the-run, eclipsed the reigning world champions The final score of 3–1 – Argentina only scoring in the last minute – could have been much higher had Brazil centre-forward Serginho not wasted a series of near-certain scoring opportunities Frustrated because of the poor refereeing and the imminent loss, Diego Maradona kicked Brazilian player Batista and received a straight red card Brazil lost their next game to Italy and thus exited the World Cup along with Argentina.\n\n\n1990 World Cup (The \"holy water\" scandal)\nThe teams met in the World Cup Round of 16 at the 1990 World Cup Argentina defeated Brazil 1–0 with a goal from Claudio Caniggia after a pass from Diego Maradona The end of the match was controversial, however, with Brazilian player Branco accusing the Argentina training staff of giving him a bottle of water laced with tranquillizers while they were tending to an injured player Years later, Maradona admitted the truth on an Argentine television show, saying that Branco had been given \"holy water\" The Argentine Football Association and the team coach of the time, Carlos Bilardo, denied that the \"holy water\" incident ever took place, [37] [38] though prior to the previous denial Bilardo said of Branco's allegation: \"I'm not saying it didn't happen.\" [39]\n\n\n1991 Copa América match\nArgentina defeated Brazil 3–2 in Santiago in the first match of the final pool Five players were sent off: Claudio Caniggia and Mazinho after tangling in the 31st minute; Carlos Enrique and Márcio Santos for another fight in the 61st minute, with one player leaving on a stretcher; and Careca Bianchezi in the 80th minute, two minutes after coming on as a substitute [40]\n\n\n1993 Copa América match\nArgentina and Brazil finished 1–1 in the quarterfinal match, played in Guayaquil Brazil took the lead, but Leonardo Rodríguez drew with the head after a corner kick in the second half In penalties, Los Gauchos defeated Brazil 5–4 and advanced to the semi-finals Argentina won the Copa América title after defeating Mexico in the final.\n\n\n1995 Copa América match\nHeld in Uruguay, the two nations met at the quarter-finals stage on 17 July 1995 The Brazilian Túlio became famous for scoring a late equalizer five minutes from time after controlling the ball with his left arm Despite the obvious foul, the referee, Alberto Tejada Noriega of Peru, claimed he did not see the incident and the goal therefore stood The game finished with a 2–2 draw and Brazil went on to win on penalties The Argentine media labeled the incident as the \"hand of the devil\", [41] a reference to the controversial goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup against England.\n\n\n2004 Copa América final\nArgentina was winning 2–1, but in a spectacular turn of events, Adriano scored a goal in the last minute of the match, taking the match to penalties, where Brazil won with Júlio César stopping a shot from Andrés D'Alessandro Brazil were playing with its second-string team.\n\n\n2005 Confederations Cup final\nIn 2005, Brazil and Argentina participated in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil entered the competition as the reigning World Cup champion at the time Since Brazil had also won the Copa América the previous year, however, Copa runners-up Argentina was allowed to participate in the tournament to take up the vacated berth In the semi-finals, Brazil eliminated host nation Germany, while Argentina eliminated Mexico This competition was the first time the two rivals would meet in a final game of a tournament sponsored by FIFA In a surprising turn of events, the Brazilian team won the game easily, thrashing the Argentines 4–1 Adriano scored twice for Brazil, along with Kaká and Ronaldinho, while Pablo Aimar scored Argentina's only goal.\n\n\n2007 Copa América final\nBrazil defeated Argentina 3–0 in Maracaibo, Venezuela, in the final The goals scored were by Júlio Baptista, an own goal by Roberto Ayala, and Dani Alves.\n\n\n2008 Summer Olympics\nDefending champions Argentina and Brazil met on 19 August in the semi-final of the Summer Olympics The game was billed as a tête-à-tête between Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho, two Barcelona teammates It was a hard-fought clash between two historic rivals, marred by numerous fouls and two red cards for Brazil Argentina convincingly won with a score of 3–0, and went on to beat Nigeria 1–0 in the final, being the first to obtain two consecutive gold medals in football in 40 years, and the third overall after the Olympic teams of the United Kingdom and Uruguay Brazil eventually won the gold medal at the Olympics themselves playing at home in 2016.\n\n\n2019 Copa América\nBrazil and Argentina met at the semifinal of the 2019 Copa América, which was hosted in Brazil Brazil defeated Argentina 2–0 with goals by Gabriel Jesus and Firmino Argentina eventually placed third and Brazil went on to win their 9th Copa América title [42]\n\n\n2021 Copa América final\nThe 2021 Copa América was originally scheduled to be jointly held in Colombia and Argentina in 2020, but it was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic Colombia and Argentina

Ángel Di María at the Maracanã Stadium to win their 15th Copa América title, their first in 28 years [43]\n\n\n2026 World Cup qualifier\nOn 22 November 2023, Argentina defeated Brazil 1–0 again at the Maracanã in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier that was delayed due to crowd violence It was the first time in history that Brazil were defeated at home in a FIFA World Cup qualification match after a run of 51 wins and 13 draws [44]\n\n\nPelé–Maradona rivalry\nAmong the elite group of players, football fans consider as contenders for the title, of the best player of all time, Brazil's Pelé and Argentina's Diego Maradona are amongst the most famous [45] [46] Some of their countrymen also feature regularly in such debates The next most notable pair are perhaps Garrincha (Brazil) [47] Lionel Messi (Argentina) and Alfredo Di Stéfano (Argentina) [48] The most dominant figures from the two countries in the modern game are Neymar (Brazilian) and Messi, who both played for Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain Both Pelé and Maradona have declared Neymar and Messi their respective \"successors\" [49] [50]\n\n\nStatistics\nComplete list of matches between both sides:\n\n\nMajor official titles

However, the same Argentine club team, Boca Juniors, has celebrated three of its six titles on Brazilian soil, defeating Palmeiras in 2000, Santos in 2003 and Grêmio in 2007 The two greatest Argentine and Brazilian players that have ever played this sport had at one point played in these same two clubs: Pelé for Santos while Diego Maradona had done the same for Boca Juniors It has been reported that in all three of Boca Juniors' victories on Brazilian soil, Boca's players were not allowed to properly sleep in their hotel rooms the night before their final matches because of the chaos and noise created by Brazilian fans outside the hotel rooms, who attempted to disrupt the Argentine players from performing to their best of their abilities the following day.\n\n\nWomen's football\n\nThe Brazil women's team had little opportunity before 1980 to progress their skills From 1940 to 1980, Women's football had been prohibited by law in Brazil, this did not stop the women from playing [291] It was believed that too much physical education in women could cause \"masculinization\" [292] These women faced significant challenges in defying this ban on women in sports, women faced hostility and a lack of opportunity [292]\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Argentina–Brazil football rivalry\n\nThe Argentina–Brazil football rivalry

In 1963, Brazilian side Santos defeated the most popular Argentine club, Boca Juniors, and in 2017, when Grêmio defeated Club Atlético Lanús.

From 1940 to 1980, Women's football had been prohibited by law in Brazil, this did not stop the women from playing. It was believed that too much physical education in women could cause \"masculinization\". These women faced significant challenges in defying this ban on women in sports, women faced hostility and a lack of opportunity.\n\nReferences:\n\nExternal links:", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Argentina–Brazil_football_rivalry\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe origins of the football rivalry between Argentina and Brazil can be traced to a time before football became popular in both countries [29] Their rivalry is found in almost all sports, but a men's football match between Argentina and Brazil is particularly important Since their first match in 1914, the men's national teams have played more than 100 matches including friendlies, FIFA World Cup matches, and other official competitions (excluding matches between youth sides) The rivalry began with Argentina's 3-0 victory in 1914 but the early period of the rivalry was marked by periods of non-engagement due to violent incidents Notably, after a violent Copa América final in 1925, both teams refrained from competing in tournaments where the other was present (Brazil withdrawing from the Copa America until a single appearance in 1937), and a similar decade long hiatus followed a 1946 match with Argentina not playing at any World Cups until 1958.\n\n\nIncidents and historical matches\nFor the 1925 Copa América, Argentina and Brazil played the final match at Sportivo Barracas Stadium on Christmas Day, drawing a crowd of more than 30,000 people After 27 minutes Lagarto intercepted a back pass by Ludovico Bidoglio and passed the ball to Arthur Friedenreich, who beat Américo Tesoriere with a strong shot, making it 1-0 to Brazil Three minutes later, Nilo scored the second for the canarinha The crowd was astonished, because if the Brazilian lead was maintained, a new match would have to be played to determine the champion.\n\n\n1925 Copa América\nFor the 1925 Copa América, Argentina and Brazil played the final match at Sportivo Barracas Stadium on Christmas Day, drawing a crowd of more than 30,000 people After 27 minutes Lagarto intercepted a back pass by Ludovico Bidoglio and passed the ball to Arthur Friedenreich, who beat Américo Tesoriere with a strong shot, making it 1-0 to Brazil Three minutes later, Nilo scored the second for the canarinha The crowd was astonished, because if the Brazilian lead was maintained, a new match would have to be played to determine the champion.\n\n\n1937 Copa América final\nIn the 1937 South American Championship (currently Copa América), the rivalry between both teams was already something of national pride There were verbal confrontations between both parties, and Argentine fans often taunted the Brazilians by calling them macaquitos and making monkey sounds [31] The final match, held in Buenos Aires, was played between the two sides and was goalless after 90 minutes In extra time, Argentina scored two goals Questioning one of the goals and fearful for their own safety, the Brazilian players decided to leave the stadium before the match was officially finished The Brazilian press has since called this match \"jogo da vergonha\" (\"the shame game\") [32] Argentina won, 2–0, and was South American champion again.\n\n\n1939 Copa Roca\nThe 1939 edition of the Roca Cup was the longest in history, having been defined after four matches The first two games were held in Estádio São Januário in Rio de Janeiro The first one, held in January, ended 5–1 to Argentina [33]\n\n\n1945–1946 incidents\nIn the 1945 Copa Roca match that Brazil won 6–2, young Brazilian Ademir de Menezes fractured Argentine José Battagliero's leg [34] Though it seemed to be only an unfortunate accident, the game was played roughly and sometimes violent.\n\n\n1974 World Cup\nIt would be the first-ever meeting between Brazil and Argentina in the FIFA World Cup Defending champions Brazil faced Argentina in West Germany's Niedersachsenstadion in Hanover in the second round as both were placed in Group A Brazil won it by 2–1 via goals from Rivellino and Jairzinho whereas Brindisi scored the only goal for Argentina [36]\n\n\n1978 World Cup\nThe Group B of the second round was essentially a battle between Argentina and Brazil, and it was resolved in controversial circumstances In the first round of group games, Brazil beat Peru 3–0 while Argentina saw off Poland 2–0 Brazil and Argentina then played out a tense and violent goalless draw – also known as \"A Batalha de Rosário\" (\"The Battle of Rosario\"), so both teams went into the last round of matches with three points Argentina had an advantage that their match against Peru kicked off several hours after Brazil's match with Poland.\n\n\n1982 World Cup\nBrazil and Argentina were grouped together (along with Italy) in the second group stage in Group C, which was dubbed as the \"group of death\" In the opener, Italy prevailed 2–1 over Argentina Argentina now needed a win over Brazil on the second day, but they were no match, as the Brazilians' attacking game, characterised by nimble, one-touch passing on-the-run, eclipsed the reigning world champions The final score of 3–1 – Argentina only scoring in the last minute – could have been much higher had Brazil centre-forward Serginho not wasted a series of near-certain scoring opportunities Frustrated because of the poor refereeing and the imminent loss, Diego Maradona kicked Brazilian player Batista and received a straight red card Brazil lost their next game to Italy and thus exited the World Cup along with Argentina.\n\n\n1990 World Cup (The \"holy water\" scandal)\nThe teams met in the World Cup Round of 16 at the 1990 World Cup Argentina defeated Brazil 1–0 with a goal from Claudio Caniggia after a pass from Diego Maradona The end of the match was controversial, however, with Brazilian player Branco accusing the Argentina training staff of giving him a bottle of water laced with tranquillizers while they were tending to an injured player Years later, Maradona admitted the truth on an Argentine television show, saying that Branco had been given \"holy water\" The Argentine Football Association and the team coach of the time, Carlos Bilardo, denied that the \"holy water\" incident ever took place, [37] [38] though prior to the previous denial Bilardo said of Branco's allegation: \"I'm not saying it didn't happen.\" [39]\n\n\n1991 Copa América match\nArgentina defeated Brazil 3–2 in Santiago in the first match of the final pool Five players were sent off: Claudio Caniggia and Mazinho after tangling in the 31st minute; Carlos Enrique and Márcio Santos for another fight in the 61st minute, with one player leaving on a stretcher; and Careca Bianchezi in the 80th minute, two minutes after coming on as a substitute [40]\n\n\n1993 Copa

the two nations met at the quarter-finals stage on 17 July 1995 The Brazilian Túlio became famous for scoring a late equalizer five minutes from time after controlling the ball with his left arm Despite the obvious foul, the referee, Alberto Tejada Noriega of Peru, claimed he did not see the incident and the goal therefore stood The game finished with a 2–2 draw and Brazil went on to win on penalties The Argentine media labeled the incident as the \"hand of the devil\", [41] a reference to the controversial goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup against England.\n\n\n2004 Copa América final\nArgentina was winning 2–1, but in a spectacular turn of events, Adriano scored a goal in the last minute of the match, taking the match to penalties, where Brazil won with Júlio César stopping a shot from Andrés D'Alessandro Brazil were playing with its second-string team.\n\n\n2005 Confederations Cup final\nIn 2005, Brazil and Argentina participated in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil entered the competition as the reigning World Cup champion at the time Since Brazil had also won the Copa América the previous year, however, Copa runners-up Argentina was allowed to participate in the tournament to take up the vacated berth In the semi-finals, Brazil eliminated host nation Germany, while Argentina eliminated Mexico This competition was the first time the two rivals would meet in a final game of a tournament sponsored by FIFA In a surprising turn of events, the Brazilian team won the game easily, thrashing the Argentines 4–1 Adriano scored twice for Brazil, along with Kaká and Ronaldinho, while Pablo Aimar scored Argentina's only goal.\n\n\n2007 Copa América final\nBrazil defeated Argentina 3–0 in Maracaibo, Venezuela, in the final The goals scored were by Júlio Baptista, an own goal by Roberto Ayala, and Dani Alves.\n\n\n2008 Summer Olympics\nDefending champions Argentina and Brazil met on 19 August in the semi-final of the Summer Olympics The game was billed as a tête-à-tête between Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho, two Barcelona teammates It was a hard-fought clash between two historic rivals, marred by numerous fouls and two red cards for Brazil Argentina convincingly won with a score of 3–0, and went on to beat Nigeria 1–0 in the final, being the first to obtain two consecutive gold medals in football in 40 years, and the third overall after the Olympic teams of the United Kingdom and Uruguay Brazil eventually won the gold medal at the Olympics themselves playing at home in 2016.\n\n\n2019 Copa América\nBrazil and Argentina met at the semifinal of the 2019 Copa América, which was hosted in Brazil Brazil defeated Argentina 2–0 with goals by Gabriel Jesus and Firmino Argentina eventually placed third and Brazil went on to win their 9th Copa América title [42]\n\n\n2021 Copa América final\nThe 2021 Copa América was originally scheduled to be jointly held in Colombia and Argentina in 2020, but it was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic Colombia and Argentina were removed as hosts due to social unrest in Colombia and the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina Brazil was chosen to host the tournament In the final, Argentina defeated Brazil 1–0 with the only goal by Ángel Di María at the Maracanã Stadium to win their 15th Copa América title, their first in 28 years [43]\n\n\n2026 World Cup qualifier\nOn 22 November 2023, Argentina defeated Brazil 1–0 again at the Maracanã in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier that was delayed due to crowd violence It was the first time in history that Brazil were defeated at home in a FIFA World Cup qualification match after a run of 51 wins and 13 draws [44]\n\n\nPelé–Maradona rivalry\nAmong the elite group of players, football fans consider as contenders for the title, of the best player of all time, Brazil's Pelé and Argentina's Diego Maradona are amongst the most famous [45] [46] Some of their countrymen also feature regularly in such debates The next most notable pair are perhaps Garrincha (Brazil) [47] Lionel Messi (Argentina) and Alfredo Di Stéfano (Argentina) [48] The most dominant figures from the two countries in the modern game are Neymar (Brazilian) and Messi, who both played for Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain Both Pelé and Maradona have declared Neymar and Messi their respective \"successors\" [49]

canceled into and out of Haiti by U.S airlines [32] [33] The government backed down on the tax increases, and the President accepted the resignation of the inexperienced Jack Guy Lafontant as prime

broke out again in February 2019 following a report from the court investigating the Petrocaribe Senate probe [40] [41] [42] Economic problems and the increased cost of living helped fuel the protests [42]\n\n\nFebruary\nOn 7 February 2021, supporters of the opposition against incumbent President Moïse allegedly attempted a coup d'état, claiming he should have stepped down five years after the end of Michel Martelly's administration on 7 Feb 2016, despite the year-long delay before he was sworn in in 2017 [80] [81] [82] Moïse stated he had been the target of an assassination attempt and ordered the arrest of 23 people, including three Supreme Court judges [83] Throughout February, clashes with protesters and security forces occurred in Port-au-Prince, [84] [85] and Jacmel [86] On 25

of four police officers in a village in Port-au-Prince, corruption, and armed gangs controlling cities [93] On 17 March, the Fantom 509 militia staged a jailbreak to free four arrested police officers

massacre in La Saline, a neighborhood in Port-au-Prince [54] [55] Lyonel Trouillot wrote in L'Humanité that \" [w]ithout dipping into conspiracy theory, there is something worrying about the

(2018-Present)**\n\nThe Haitian crisis is a series of ongoing protests, demonstrations, and violent clashes that began in 2018 and continue to escalate in 2024. The crisis is rooted in a combination of factors, including a significant corruption scandal, economic problems, and a power vacuum created by the departure of the United Nations force in 2017.\n\n**Background and Origins**\n\nIn 2017, a Senate probe revealed significant corruption had been funded with Venezuelan loans through the Petrocaribe program, which had been used to finance various projects, including fuel subsidies. The probe also implicated former President Michel Martelly, who had been accused of fostering, financing, and even creating gangs that controlled parts of the country. Martelly was known for his music album, \"Bandi légal,\" and his ties to right-wing elements in the police.\n\n**History**\n\nWhen Venezuela stopped shipping oil to Haiti in March 2018, fuel shortages became a major problem. The removal of government subsidies in July led to steep hikes in fuel prices, including a 50% increase in kerosene prices. The resulting protests brought Haitians into the streets, and flights were canceled by U.S. airlines. The government backed down on the tax increases, and President Jovenel Moïse accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant, who was replaced by Jean-Henry Céant one month later.\n\n**2018 Protests**\n\nThe protests in 2018 were sparked by the removal of government subsidies and the resulting fuel shortages. The protests were marked by clashes between protesters and security forces, and several people were killed or injured. The government backed down on the tax increases, and Moïse accepted the resignation of Lafontant.\n\n**2019 Protests**\n\nSignificant protests broke out again in February 2019 following a report from the court investigating the Petrocaribe Senate probe. The protests were fueled by economic problems and the increased cost of living. In April, protesters circled the Presidential palace seven times, drawing Vodou images in chalk on the ground to symbolically free themselves from the scourge of gang kidnappings.\n\n**Moïse Government**\n\nPresident Jovenel Moïse called for his opposition to participate in peaceful dialogue, saying that the country's problems were not solely political but also social and economic. The national police stated that there were \"malicious individuals\" who had interrupted peaceful protests in the country.\n\n**Opposition**\n\nThe opposition was led by Jean-Charles Moïse, who declined offers for dialogue and demanded President Moïse's resignation. The opposition organized a nationwide general strike to attempt to force Moïse to resign from office. Alongside opposition lawmakers, Moïse called for a transitional government to replace Moïse.\n\n**Arrest of Foreign Mercenaries**\n\nThe Port-au-Prince newspaper Le Nouvelliste reported that a Haitian citizen and seven non-Haitians were arrested in the city, carrying rifles, pistols, drones, and satellite phones in their vehicle.

political class called for him to step down at the end of Jovenel Moïse's term (7 February 2022), Ariel Henry rejected these demands, along with the results of the Montana Accord election, as a \"distraction\", saying that organizing the next elections was part of his mandate [106]\n\n\nMontana Accord\nOn 30 January, the Transition Council defined by the August 2021 Montana Accord (named for

leader of the 5 Segond gang, which the U.S Treasury Department identified as being responsible for over 1,000 cases of sexual violence in 2022 [109] Rape—which only became a criminal offense in Haiti in 2005—is being used by gangs as a means of humiliating those living in rival gang neighborhoods Abortion is illegal in Haiti, so rape victims are legally required to carry any resulting pregnancy to term [110] in a country with one of the highest mortality rates for mothers outside of war zones in Sudan and Yemen [111]\n\n\nFuel protests\nIn September 2022, protests erupted, sparked by a

council to create its own council, slated to include Guy Philippe, [165] who had called for amnesty for some in the gangs whose actions brought down the Henry government [166] One week later, after encouragement from \"a big country\", Moïse reversed course and decided to name Emmanuel Vertilaire, on advice from the National Network of Farmers [167]  It was reported that Philippe had lost significant support in Haïti by early April [168] On 24 March, Dominique Dupuy, who had replaced the only other woman on the council (Marie Ghislaine Mompremier) four days earlier, [167] resigned

Matisse angrily dismissed the work as a hoax [40] Picasso did not exhibit Les Demoiselles publicly until 1916.\n\n\nSynthetic cubism: 1912–1919\nSynthetic cubism (1912–1919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments – often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages – were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of collage in fine art [citation needed]\n\n\nNeoclassicism and surrealism: 1919–1929\nIn February 1917, Picasso made his first trip to Italy [55] In the period following the upheaval of World War I, Picasso produced work in a neoclassical style This \"return to order\" is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s, including André Derain, Giorgio de Chirico, Gino Severini, Jean Metzinger, the artists of the New Objectivity movement and of the Novecento Italiano movement Picasso's paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work of Raphael and Ingres [56]\n\n\nThe Great Depression, Guernica, and the MoMA exhibition: 1930–1939\nDuring the 1930s, the minotaur replaced the harlequin as a common motif in his work His use of the minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol, and it appears in Picasso's Guernica The minotaur and Picasso's mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter are heavily featured in his celebrated Vollard Suite of etchings [58]\n\n\nWorld War II and late 1940s: 1939–1949\nDuring World War II, Picasso remained in Paris while the Germans occupied the city Picasso's artistic style did not fit the Nazi ideal of art, so he did not exhibit during this time He was often harassed by the Gestapo During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of the painting Guernica \"Did you do that?\" the German asked Picasso \"No,\" he replied, \"You did.\" [68]\n\n\nLater works to final years: 1949–1973\nPicasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in mid-1949 In the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters He made a series of works based on Velázquez's painting of Las Meninas He also based paintings on works by Goya, Poussin, Manet, Courbet and Delacroix [citation needed]\n\n\nDeath\nPablo Picasso died on 8 April 1973 in Mougins, France, from pulmonary edema and a heart attack, the morning after he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner He was interred at the Château of Vauvenargues near Aix-en-Provence, a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with Jacqueline between 1959 and 1962 Jacqueline prevented his children Claude and Paloma from attending the funeral [80] Devastated and lonely after the death of Picasso, Jacqueline killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when she was 59 years old [81]\n\n\nPolitical views\nPicasso remained aloof from the Catalan independence movement during his youth, despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within it [82] He did not join the armed forces for any side or country during World War I, the Spanish Civil War, or World War II As a Spanish citizen living in France, Picasso was under no compulsion to fight against the invading Germans in either world war In 1940, he applied for French citizenship, but it was refused on the grounds of his \"extremist ideas evolving towards communism\" This information was not revealed until 2003 [83]\n\n\nStyle and technique\nPicasso was exceptionally prolific throughout his long lifetime At his death there were more than 45,000 unsold works in his estate, comprising 1,885 paintings, 1,228 sculptures, 3,222 ceramics, 7,089 drawings, 150 sketchbooks, many thousands of prints, and numerous tapestries and rugs [102] The most complete – but not exhaustive – catalogue of his works, the catalogue raisonné compiled by Christian Zervos, lists more than 16,000 paintings and drawings [103] Picasso's output was several times more prolific than most artists of his era; by at least one account, American artist Bob Ross is the only one to rival Picasso's volume, and Ross's artwork was designed specifically to be easily mass-produced quickly [104]\n\n\nArtistic legacy\nPicasso's influence was and remains immense and widely acknowledged by his admirers and detractors alike On the occasion of his 1939 retrospective at MoMA, Life magazine wrote: \"During the 25 years he has dominated modern European art, his enemies say he has been a corrupting influence With equal violence, his friends say he is the greatest artist alive.\" [113] Picasso was the first artist to receive a special honour exhibition at the Grand Gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris in celebration of his 90 years [114] In 1998, Robert Hughes wrote of him: \"To say that Pablo Picasso dominated Western art in the 20th century is, by now, the merest commonplace .. No painter or sculptor, not even Michelangelo, had been as famous as this in his own lifetime .. Though Marcel Duchamp, that cunning old fox of conceptual irony, has certainly had more influence on nominally vanguard art over the past 30 years than Picasso, the Spaniard was the last great beneficiary of the belief that the language of painting and sculpture really mattered to people other than their devotees.\" [115]\n\n\nThe Basel vote\nIn the 1940s, a Swiss insurance company based in Basel had bought two paintings by Picasso to diversify its investments and serve as a guarantee for the insured risks Following an air disaster in 1967, the company had to pay out heavy reimbursements The company decided to part with the two paintings, which were deposited in the Kunstmuseum Basel In 1968, a large number of Basel citizens called for a local referendum on the purchase of the Picassos by the Canton of Basel-Stadt, which was successful, making it the first time in democratic history that the population of a city voted on the purchase of works of art for a public art museum [126] The paintings therefore remained in the museum in Basel Informed of this, Picasso donated three paintings and a sketch to the city and its museum and was later made an honorary citizen by the city [127]\n\n\nAuction history\nSeveral paintings by Picasso rank among the most expensive paintings in the world Garçon à la pipe sold for US$104 million at Sotheby's on 4 May 2004 Dora Maar au Chat sold for US$95.2 million at Sotheby's on 3 May 2006 [128] On 4 May 2010, Nude, Green Leaves and Bust was sold at Christie's for US$106.5 million The 1932 work, which depicts Picasso's mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter reclining and as a bust, was in the personal collection of Los Angeles philanthropist Frances Lasker Brody, who died in November 2009 [129] On 11 May 2015 his painting Women of Algiers set the record for the highest price ever paid for a painting when it sold for US$179.3 million at Christie's in New York [130]\n\n\nPersonal life\nFrom early adolescence, Picasso maintained both superficial and intense amatory and sexual relationships Biographer John Richardson stated that 'work, sex and tobacco' were his addictions [135] Picasso was married twice and had four children by three women:\n\n\nCatalogue raisonné\nPicasso entrusted Christian Zervos to constitute the catalogue raisonné of his work (painted and drawn) The first volume of the catalogue, Works from 1895 to 1906, published in 1932, entailed the financial ruin of Zervos, self-publishing under the name Cahiers d'art, forcing him to sell part of his art collection at auction to avoid bankruptcy [143] [144]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Pablo Picasso was a Spanish artist, widely regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Born on 25 October 1881 in Málaga, Spain, Picasso is known for his diverse and prolific output, which spanned over seven decades.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPicasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga, Andalusia, in southern Spain. He was the first child of Don José Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López. Picasso's family was of middle-class background, and his father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum.\n\n**Career**\n\nPicasso's training under his father began before 1890. His progress can be traced in the collection of early works now held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive extant records of any major artist's beginnings. During 1893, the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894, his career as a painter can be said to have begun. The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in The First Communion (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola.\n\nIn the same year, at the age of 14, he painted Portrait of Aunt Pepa, a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called \"without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting.\" During the early years of his career, Picasso's work was characterized by its technical skill and attention to detail. He was heavily influenced by the art of his father and other Spanish artists of the time.\n\n**Blue Period: 1901–1904**\n\nPicasso's Blue Period (1901–1904), characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green, only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the year. Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during which Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris. In his austere use of colour and sometimes doleful subject matter – prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects – Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carles Casagemas.\n\nStarting in autumn of 1901, he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting La Vie (1903), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art. The Blue Period marked a significant turning point in Picasso's career, as he began to develop his unique style and explore new themes.\n\n**Rose Period: 1904–1906**\n\nThe Rose Period (1904–1906) is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colours and featuring many circus people, acrobats, and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso. Picasso met Fernande Olivier, a bohemian artist who became his mistress, in Paris in 1904.\n\nOlivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings, many of which are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French painting. The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899–1901 period (i.e., just prior to the Blue Period), and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.\n\n**African Art and Primitivism: 1907–1909**\n\nPicasso's African-influenced Period (1907–1909) begins with his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. The three figures on the left were inspired by Iberian sculpture, but he repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadéro. When he displayed the painting to acquaintances in his studio later that year, the nearly universal reaction was shock and revulsion; Matisse angrily dismissed the work as a hoax.\n\nPicasso did not exhibit Les Demoiselles publicly until 1916. The African-influenced Period marked a significant departure from Picasso's earlier work, as he began to incorporate new and exotic influences into his art.\n\n**Synthetic Cubism: 1912–1919**\n\nSynthetic cubism (1912–1919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments – often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages – were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of collage in fine art.\n\n**Neoclassicism and Surrealism: 1919–1929**\n\nIn February 1917, Picasso made his first trip to Italy. In the period following the upheaval of World War I, Picasso produced work in a neoclassical style. This \"return to order\" is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s, including André Derain, Giorgio de Chirico, Gino Severini, Jean Metzinger, the artists of the New Objectivity movement, and of the Novecento Italiano movement.\n\nPicasso's paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work of Raphael and Ingres. The neoclassical period marked a significant shift in Picasso's style, as he began to incorporate classical influences into his work.\n\n**The Great Depression, Guernica, and the MoMA Exhibition: 1930–1939**\n\nDuring the 1930s, the minotaur replaced the harlequin as a common motif in his work. His use of the minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol. The minotaur and Picasso's mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter are heavily featured in his celebrated Vollard Suite of etchings.\n\n**World War II and Late 1940s: 1939–1949**\n\nDuring World War II, Picasso remained in Paris while the Germans occupied the city. Picasso's artistic style did not fit the Nazi ideal of art, so he did not exhibit during this time. He was often harassed by the Gestapo. During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of the painting Guernica.\n\n\"Did you do that?\" the German asked Picasso. \"No,\" he replied, \"You did.\" The war period marked a significant turning point in Picasso's career, as he began to explore new themes and styles.\n\n**Later Works to Final Years: 1949–1973**\n\nPicasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in mid-1949. In the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. He made a series of works based on Velázquez's painting of Las Meninas. He also based paintings on works by Goya, Poussin, Manet, Courbet, and Delacroix.\n\n**Death**\n\nPablo Picasso died on 8 April 1973, in Mougins, France, from pulmonary edema and a heart attack, the morning after he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner. He was interred at the Château of Vauvenargues near Aix-en-Provence, a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with Jacqueline between 1959 and 1962.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Pablo_Picasso\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nPicasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga, Andalusia, in southern Spain [2] He was the first child of Don José Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López [14] Picasso's family was of middle-class background His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum [1]\n\n\nCareer\nPicasso's training under his father began before 1890 His progress can be traced in the collection of early works now held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive extant records of any major artist's beginnings [25] During 1893 the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894 his career as a painter can be said to have begun [26] The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in The First Communion (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola In the same year, at the age of 14, he painted Portrait of Aunt Pepa, a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called \"without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting.\" [27]\n\n\nBefore 1900\nPicasso's training under his father began before 1890 His progress can be traced in the collection of early works now held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive extant records of any major artist's beginnings [25] During 1893 the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894 his career as a painter can be said to have begun [26] The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in The First Communion (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola In the same year, at the age of 14, he painted Portrait of Aunt Pepa, a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called \"without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting.\" [27]\n\n\nBlue Period: 1901–1904\nPicasso's Blue Period (1901–1904), characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the year [31] Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during which Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris In his austere use of colour and sometimes doleful subject matter—prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects—Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carles Casagemas Starting in autumn of 1901, he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting La Vie (1903), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art [32]\n\n\nRose Period: 1904–1906\nThe Rose Period (1904–1906) [34] is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colours and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso Picasso met Fernande Olivier, a bohemian artist who became his mistress, in Paris in 1904 [21] Olivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings, many of which are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French painting The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899–1901 period (i.e., just prior to the Blue Period), and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.\n\n\nAfrican art and primitivism: 1907–1909\nPicasso's African-influenced Period (1907–1909) begins with his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon The three figures on the left were inspired by Iberian sculpture, but he repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadéro [39] When he displayed the painting to acquaintances in his studio later that year, the nearly universal reaction was shock and revulsion; Matisse angrily dismissed the work as a hoax [40] Picasso did not exhibit Les Demoiselles publicly until 1916.\n\n\nSynthetic cubism: 1912–1919\nSynthetic cubism (1912–1919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments – often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages – were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of collage in fine art [citation needed]\n\n\nNeoclassicism and surrealism: 1919–1929\nIn February 1917, Picasso made his first trip to Italy [55] In the period following the upheaval of World War I, Picasso produced work in a neoclassical style This \"return to order\" is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s, including André Derain, Giorgio de Chirico, Gino Severini, Jean Metzinger, the artists of the New Objectivity movement and of the Novecento Italiano movement Picasso's paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work of Raphael and Ingres [56]\n\n\nThe Great Depression, Guernica, and the MoMA exhibition: 1930–1939\nDuring the 1930s, the minotaur replaced the harlequin as a common motif in his work His use of the minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol, and it appears in Picasso's Guernica The minotaur and Picasso's mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter are heavily featured in his celebrated Vollard Suite of etchings [58]\n\n\nWorld War II and late 1940s: 1939–1949\nDuring World War II, Picasso remained in Paris while the Germans occupied the city Picasso's artistic style did not fit the Nazi ideal of art, so he did not exhibit during this time He was often harassed by the Gestapo During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of the painting Guernica \"Did you do that?\" the German asked Picasso \"No,\" he replied, \"You did.\" [68]\n\n\nLater works to final years: 1949–1973\nPicasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in mid-1949 In the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters He made a series of works based on Velázquez's painting of Las Meninas He also based paintings on works by Goya, Poussin, Manet, Courbet and Delacroix [citation needed]\n\n\nDeath\nPablo Picasso died on 8 April 1973 in Mougins, France, from pulmonary edema and a heart attack, the morning after he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner He was interred at the Château of Vauvenargues near Aix-en-Provence, a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with Jacqueline between 1959 and 1962 Jacqueline prevented his children Claude and Paloma from attending the funeral [80] Devastated and lonely after the death of Picasso, Jacqueline killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when she was 59 years old [81]\n\n\nPolitical views\nPicasso remained aloof from the Catalan independence movement during his youth, despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within it [82] He did not join the armed forces for any side or country during World War I, the Spanish Civil War, or World War II As a Spanish citizen living in France, Picasso was under no compulsion to fight against the invading Germans in either world war In 1940, he applied for French citizenship, but it was refused on the grounds of his \"extremist ideas evolving towards communism\" This information was not revealed until 2003 [83]\n\n\nStyle and technique\nPicasso was exceptionally prolific throughout his long lifetime At his death there were more than 45,000 unsold works in his estate, comprising 1,885 paintings, 1,228 sculptures, 3,222 ceramics, 7,089 drawings, 150 sketchbooks, many thousands of prints, and numerous tapestries and rugs [102] The most complete – but not exhaustive – catalogue of his works, the catalogue raisonné compiled by Christian Zervos, lists more than 16,000 paintings and drawings [103] Picasso's output was several times more prolific than most artists of his era; by at least one account, American artist Bob Ross is the only one to rival Picasso's volume, and Ross's artwork was designed specifically to be easily mass-produced quickly [104]\n\n\nArtistic legacy\nPicasso's influence was and remains immense and widely acknowledged by his admirers and detractors alike On the occasion of his 1939 retrospective at MoMA, Life magazine wrote: \"During the 25 years he has dominated modern European art, his enemies say he has been a corrupting influence With equal violence, his friends say he is the greatest artist alive.\" [113] Picasso was the first artist to receive a special honour exhibition at the Grand Gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris in celebration of his 90 years [114] In 1998, Robert Hughes wrote of him: \"To say that Pablo Picasso dominated Western art in the 20th century is, by now, the merest commonplace .. No painter or sculptor, not even Michelangelo, had been as famous as this in his own lifetime .. Though Marcel Duchamp, that cunning old fox of conceptual irony, has certainly had more influence on nominally vanguard art over the past 30 years than Picasso, the Spaniard was the last great beneficiary of the belief that the language of painting and sculpture really mattered to people other than their devotees.\" [115]\n\n\nThe Basel vote\nIn the 1940s, a Swiss insurance company based in Basel had bought two paintings by Picasso to diversify its investments and serve as a guarantee for the insured risks Following an air disaster in 1967, the company had to pay out heavy reimbursements The company decided to part with the two paintings, which were deposited in the Kunstmuseum Basel In 1968, a large number of Basel citizens called for a local referendum on the purchase of the Picassos by the Canton of Basel-Stadt, which was successful, making it the first time in democratic history that the population of a city voted on the purchase of works of art for a public art museum [126] The paintings therefore remained in the museum in Basel Informed of this, Picasso donated three paintings and a sketch to the city and its museum and was later made an honorary citizen by the city [127]\n\n\nAuction history\nSeveral paintings by Picasso rank among the most expensive paintings in the world Garçon à la pipe sold for US$104 million at Sotheby's on 4 May 2004 Dora Maar au Chat sold for US$95.2 million at Sotheby's on 3 May 2006 [128] On 4 May 2010, Nude, Green Leaves and Bust was sold at Christie's for US$106.5 million The 1932 work, which depicts Picasso's mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter reclining and as a bust, was in the personal collection of Los Angeles philanthropist Frances Lasker Brody, who died in November 2009 [129] On 11 May 2015 his painting Women of Algiers set the record for the highest price ever paid for a painting when it sold for US$179.3 million at Christie's in New York [130]\n\n\nPersonal life\nFrom early adolescence, Picasso maintained both superficial and intense amatory and sexual relationships Biographer John Richardson stated that 'work, sex and tobacco' were his addictions [135] Picasso was married twice and had four children by three women:\n\n\nCatalogue raisonné\nPicasso entrusted Christian Zervos to constitute the catalogue raisonné of his work (painted and drawn) The first volume of the catalogue, Works from 1895 to 1906, published in 1932, entailed the financial ruin of Zervos, self-publishing under the name Cahiers d'art, forcing him to sell part of his art collection at auction to avoid bankruptcy [143] [144]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Suez_Canal", "content": "\nPrecursors\n\nAncient west–east canals were built to facilitate travel from the Nile to the Red Sea [11] [12] [13] One smaller canal is believed to have been constructed under the auspices of Senusret II [14] or Ramesses II [11] [12] [13] Another canal, probably incorporating a portion of the first, [11] [12] was constructed under the reign of Necho II (610–595 BCE), but the only fully functional canal was engineered and completed by Darius I (522–486 BCE) [11] [12] [13]\n\nSecond millennium BCE\nJames Henry Breasted attributes the earliest-known attempt to construct a canal to the first cataract, near Aswan, to the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt and its completion to Senusret III (1878–1839 BCE) of the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt [15]\n\n\nCanals dug by Necho, Darius I and Ptolemy\nRemnants of an ancient west–east canal through the ancient Egyptian cities of Bubastis, Pi-Ramesses, and Pithom were discovered by Napoleon Bonaparte and his engineers and cartographers in 1799 [12] [26] [27] [28] [29]\n\n\nReceding Red Sea and the dwindling Nile\nThe Red Sea is believed by some historians to have gradually receded over the centuries, its coastline slowly moving southward away from Lake Timsah [17] [18] and the Great Bitter Lake [11] [12] Coupled with persistent accumulations of Nile silt, maintenance and repair of Ptolemy's canal became increasingly cumbersome over each passing century.\n\n\nCairo to the Red Sea\nThe ancient canal was re-excavated by Roman emperor Trajan in the first century AD, who named it Amnis Traianus after himself He reportedly moved its mouth on the Nile further south, at the site of what is now Old Cairo [43] By the time of the Arab conquest in 641 AD, this canal had fallen out of use [44] The commander of the Muslim force, Amr ibn al-As, ordered that it be restored so as to improve connections between Egypt and Medina, the Muslim capital at the time The Muslim canal was excavated further north from Trajan's canal, joining the Nile close to what is now the Sayyida Zaynab neighbourhood of Cairo [44] This canal reportedly ended near modern Suez [11] [45] The site of the former Roman channel near the Nile was absorbed into the new city of Fustat [44] [43]\n\n\nConception by Venice\nThe successful 1488 navigation of southern Africa by Bartolomeu Dias opened a direct maritime trading route to India and the Spice Islands, and forever changed the balance of Mediterranean trade One of the most prominent losers in the new order, as former middlemen, was the former spice trading center of Venice.\n\n\nOttoman attempts\nDuring the 16th century, the Ottoman Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha attempted to construct a canal connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean This was motivated by a desire to connect Constantinople to the pilgrimage and trade routes of the Indian Ocean, as well as by strategic concerns—as the European presence in the Indian Ocean was growing, Ottoman mercantile and strategic interests were increasingly challenged, and the Sublime Porte was increasingly pressed to assert its position A navigable canal would allow the Ottoman Navy to connect its Red Sea, Black Sea, and Mediterranean fleets However, this project was deemed too expensive, and was never completed [49] [50]\n\n\nNapoleon's discovery of an ancient canal\nDuring the French campaign in Egypt and Syria in late 1798, Napoleon expressed interest in finding the remnants of an ancient waterway passage This culminated in a cadre of archaeologists, scientists, cartographers and engineers scouring northern Egypt [51] [52] Their findings, recorded in the Description de l'Égypte, include detailed maps that depict the discovery of an ancient canal extending northward from the Red Sea and then westward toward the Nile [51] [53]\n\n\nHistory of the Suez Canal\nDespite the construction challenges that could have been the result of the alleged difference in sea levels, the idea of finding a shorter route to the east remained alive In 1830, General Francis Chesney submitted a report to the British government that stated that there was no difference in elevation and that the Suez Canal was feasible, but his report received no further attention Lieutenant Waghorn established his \"Overland Route\", which transported post and passengers to India via Egypt [55] [56]\n\n\nInterim period\nDespite the construction challenges that could have been the result of the alleged difference in sea levels, the idea of finding a shorter route to the east remained alive In 1830, General Francis Chesney submitted a report to the British government that stated that there was no difference in elevation and that the Suez Canal was feasible, but his report received no further attention Lieutenant Waghorn established his \"Overland Route\", which transported post and passengers to India via Egypt [55] [56]\n\n\nConstruction by the Suez Canal Company\nIn 1854 and 1856, Ferdinand de Lesseps obtained a concession from Sa'id Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan, to create a company to construct a canal open to ships of all nations The company was to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening De Lesseps had used his friendly relationship with Sa'id, which he had developed while he was a French diplomat in the 1830s As stipulated in the concessions, de Lesseps convened the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez (Commission Internationale pour le percement de l'isthme de Suez) consisting of 13 experts from seven countries, among them John Robinson McClean, later President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in London, and again Negrelli, to examine the plans developed by Linant de Bellefonds, and to advise on the feasibility of and the best route for the canal After surveys and analyses in Egypt and discussions in Paris on various aspects of the canal, where many of Negrelli's ideas prevailed, the commission produced a unanimous report in December 1856 containing a detailed description of the canal complete with plans and profiles [57] The Suez Canal Company (Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez) came into being on 15 December 1858.\n\n\nPreparations (1854–1858)\nIn 1854 and 1856, Ferdinand de Lesseps obtained a concession from Sa'id Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan, to create a company to construct a canal open to ships of all nations The company was to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening De Lesseps had used his friendly relationship with Sa'id, which he had developed while he was a French diplomat in the 1830s As stipulated in the concessions, de Lesseps convened the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez (Commission Internationale pour le percement de l'isthme de Suez) consisting of 13 experts from seven countries, among them John Robinson McClean, later President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in London, and again Negrelli, to examine the plans developed by Linant de Bellefonds, and to advise on the feasibility of and the best route for the canal After surveys and analyses in Egypt and discussions in Paris on various aspects of the canal, where many of Negrelli's ideas prevailed, the commission produced a unanimous report in December 1856 containing a detailed description of the canal complete with plans and profiles [57] The Suez Canal Company (Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez) came into being on 15 December 1858.\n\n\nConstruction (1859–1869)\nWork started on the shore of the future Port Said on 25 April 1859.\n\n\nCompany towns\nFrom its inauguration, till 1925, the Suez Canal Company built a series of company towns along the canal to serve its operation They included ports and their facilities as well as housing for employees segregated by race or nationality [64] These were Port Said (1869) and Port Fuad (1925) at the canal's northern entrance by the Mediterranenan, Ismailia (1862) near the middle and north of Lake Timsah, and Port Twefik (1867) at the canal's southern entrance on the Red Sea [65]\n\n\nInauguration (17 November 1869)\nThe canal opened under French control in November 1869 The opening ceremonies began at Port Said on the evening of 15 November, with illuminations, fireworks, and a banquet on the yacht of the Khedive Isma'il Pasha of Egypt and Sudan The royal guests arrived the following morning: the Emperor Franz Joseph I, the French Empress Eugenie in the Imperial yacht L'Aigle, the Crown Prince of Prussia, and Prince Louis of Hesse [66] Other international guests included the American natural historian H W Harkness [67] In the afternoon there were blessings of the canal with both Muslim and Christian ceremonies, a temporary mosque and church having been built side by side on the beach In the evening there were more illuminations and fireworks [66]\n\n\nInitial difficulties (1869–1871)\nAlthough numerous technical, political, and financial problems had been overcome, the final cost was more than double the original estimate.\n\n\nGrowth and reorganisation\nThe canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on world trade Combined with the American transcontinental railroad completed six months earlier, it allowed the world to be circled in record time It played an important role in increasing European colonization of Africa The construction of the canal was one of the reasons for the Panic of 1873 in Great Britain, because goods from the Far East had, until then, been carried in sailing vessels around the Cape of Good Hope and stored in British warehouses An inability to pay his bank debts led Said Pasha's successor, Isma'il Pasha, in 1875 to sell his 44% share in the canal for £4,000,000 ($19.2 million), equivalent to £432 million to £456 million ($540 million to $570 million) in 2019, to the government of the United Kingdom [78] French shareholders still held the majority [79] Local unrest caused the British to invade in 1882 and take full control, although nominally Egypt remained part of the Ottoman Empire The British representative from 1883 to 1907 was Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, who reorganized and modernized the government and suppressed rebellions and corruption, thereby facilitating increased traffic on the canal [80]\n\n\nSuez Crisis\nIn 1951 Egypt repudiated the 1936 treaty with Great Britain In October 1954 the UK tentatively agreed to remove its troops from the Canal Zone Because of Egyptian overtures towards the Soviet Union, both the United Kingdom and the United States withdrew their pledge to financially support construction of the Aswan Dam Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser responded by nationalising the canal on 26 July 1956 [90] and transferring it to the Suez Canal Authority, intending to finance the dam project using revenue from the canal On the same day that the canal was nationalised Nasser also closed the Straits of Tiran to all Israeli ships [91] This led to the Suez Crisis in which the UK, France, and Israel invaded Egypt According to the pre-agreed war plans under the Protocol of Sèvres, Israel invaded the Sinai Peninsula on 29 October, forcing Egypt to engage them militarily, and allowing the Anglo-French partnership to declare the resultant fighting a threat to stability in the Middle East and enter the war – officially to separate the two forces but in reality to regain the Canal and bring down the Nasser government [92] [93] [94]\n\n\nArab–Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt closed the Canal to Israeli shipping, despite UN Security Council resolutions from 1949 and 1951 urging it not to, on the grounds that hostilities had ended with the 1949 armistice agreement.\n\n\nMine clearing operations (1974–75)\nAfter the Yom Kippur War, the United States initiated Operation Nimbus Moon The amphibious assault ship USS Inchon (LPH-12) was sent to the Canal, carrying 12 RH-53D minesweeping helicopters of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 12 These partly cleared the canal between May and December 1974 It was relieved by the LST USS Barnstable County (LST1197) The British Royal Navy initiated Operation Rheostat and Task Group 65.2 provided for Operation Rheostat One [103] (six months in 1974), the minehunters HMS Maxton, HMS Bossington, and HMS Wilton, the Fleet Clearance Diving Team (FCDT) [104] and HMS Abdiel, a practice minelayer/MCMV support ship; and for Operation Rheostat Two [105] (six months in 1975) the minehunters HMS Hubberston and HMS Sheraton, and HMS Abdiel When the Canal Clearance Operations were completed, the canal and its lakes were considered 99% clear of mines The canal was then reopened by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat aboard an Egyptian destroyer, which led the first convoy northbound to Port Said in 1975, [106] at his side stood the Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi [107]\n\n\nUN presence\nThe UNEF mandate expired in 1979 Despite the efforts of the United States, Israel, Egypt, and others to obtain an extension of the UN role in observing the peace between Israel and Egypt, as called for under the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979, the mandate could not be extended because of the veto by the Soviet Union in the UN Security Council, at the request of Syria Accordingly, negotiations for a new observer force in the Sinai produced the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), stationed in Sinai in 1981 in coordination with a phased Israeli withdrawal The MFO remains active under agreements between the United States, Israel, Egypt, and other nations [108]\n\n\nBypass expansion\nIn 2014, months after taking office as President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered the expansion of the Ballah Bypass from 61 metres (200 ft) wide to 312 metres (1,024 ft) wide for 35 kilometres (22 mi) The project was called the New Suez Canal, as it allows ships to transit the canal in both directions simultaneously [109] [110] The project cost more than LE 59.4 billion (US$9 billion) and was completed within a year Sisi declared the expanded channel open to business in a ceremony on 6 August 2015 [5]\n\n\nIncidents\nIn 2004, the canal was closed for three days when the oil tanker Tropic Brilliance became stuck [111] [112]\n\n\n2021 obstruction\nOn 23 March 2021, at around 05:40 UTC (07:40 local time), [115] the Suez Canal was blocked in both directions by ultra-large Evergreen G-class container ship Ever Given [116] The ship, operated by Evergreen Marine, was en route from Malaysia to the Netherlands when it ran aground after strong winds allegedly blew the ship off course [115] Upon running aground, Ever Given turned sideways, completely blocking the canal [117] [115] Although part of the length of the canal is paralleled by an older narrower channel which can be used to bypass obstructions, this incident occurred to the south, in a section of the canal where there is only one channel [118]\n\n\n2023 grounding\nOn 25 May 2023, a Hong Kong-flagged cargo ship, MV Xin Hai Tong 23, was grounded near the southern end of the canal, but it was refloated by tugboats in less than a day [132]\n\n\nLayout and operation\nWhen built, the canal was 164 km (102 mi) long and 8 m (26 ft) deep After several enlargements, it is 193.30 km (120+1⁄8 mi) long, 24 m (79 ft) deep and 205 m (673 ft) wide [134] It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km (14 mi), the canal itself of 162.25 km (100+7⁄8 mi) and the southern access channel of 9 km (5+1⁄2 mi) [135]\n\n\nCapacity\nThe canal allows passage of ships up to 20 m (66 ft) draft or 240,000 deadweight tons and up to a height of 68 m (223 ft) above water level and a maximum beam of 77.5 m (254 ft) under certain conditions [138] [134] The canal can handle more traffic and larger ships than the Panama Canal, as Suezmax dimensions are greater than both Panamax and New Panamax Some supertankers are too large to traverse the canal Others can offload part of their cargo onto a canal-owned ship to reduce their draft, transit, and reload at the other end of the canal On 15 April 2021 Egyptian authorities announced that they would widen the southern section of the Suez Canal to improve the efficiency of the canal The plan mainly covers about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Suez to the Great Bitter Lake It will be widened by 40 metres (130 ft) and the maximum depth will be increased from about 20 metres (66 ft) to about 22 metres (72 ft) [139]\n\n\nNavigation\nShips approaching the canal from the sea are expected to radio the harbour when they are within 15 nautical miles (28 kilometres) of the Fairway Buoy near Port Said [140] The canal has no locks because of the flat terrain, and the minor sea level difference between each end is inconsequential for shipping As the canal has no sea surge gates, the ports at the ends would be subject to the sudden impact of tsunamis from the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea, according to a 2012 article in the Journal of Coastal Research [141]\n\n\nOperation\nBefore August 2015, the canal was too narrow for free two-way traffic, so ships had to pass in convoys and use bypasses The bypasses were 78 km (48 mi) out of 193 km (120 mi) (40%) From north to south, they are Port Said bypass (entrances) 36.5 km (23 mi), Ballah bypass & anchorage 9 km (6 mi), Timsah bypass 5 km (3 mi), and the Deversoir bypass (northern end of the Great Bitter Lake) 27.5 kilometres (17 mi) The bypasses were completed in 1980.\n\n\nConvoy sailing\nSince the canal does not cater to unregulated two-way traffic, all ships transit in convoys on regular times, scheduled on a 24-hour basis Each day, a single northbound convoy starts at 04:00 EET from Suez At dual lane sections, the convoy uses the eastern route Synchronised with this convoy's passage is the southbound convoy It starts at 03:30 EET from Port Said and so passes the Northbound convoy in the two-lane section [148] [149]\n\n\nCanal crossings\nFrom north to south, the crossings are:\n\n\nEconomic impact\nEconomically, after its completion, the Suez Canal benefited primarily the sea trading powers of the Mediterranean countries, which now had much faster connections to the Near and Far East than the North and West European sea trading nations such as Great Britain or Germany [81] [156] The main Habsburg trading port of Trieste with its direct connections to Central Europe experienced a meteoric rise at that time [157] [158]\n\n\nAlternative routes\nBefore the canal's opening in 1869, goods were sometimes offloaded from ships and carried overland between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea [167]\n\n\nCape Agulhas\nThe main alternative is around Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa, commonly referred to as the Cape of Good Hope route This was the only sea route before the canal was constructed, and when the canal was closed It is still the only route for ships that are too large for the canal In the early 21st century, the Suez Canal has suffered from diminished traffic due to piracy in Somalia, with many shipping companies choosing to take the long route instead [168] [169] Between 2008 and 2010, it is estimated that the canal lost 10% of traffic due to the threat of piracy, and another 10% due to the financial crisis An oil tanker going from Saudi Arabia to the United States has 4,345 km (2,700 mi) farther to go when taking the route south of Africa rather than the canal [170]\n\n\nNorthern Sea Route\nIn recent years, the shrinking Arctic sea ice has made the Northern Sea Route feasible for commercial cargo ships between Europe and East Asia during a six-to-eight-week window in the summer months, shortening the voyage by thousands of kilometres compared to that through the Suez Canal According to polar climate researchers, as the extent of the Arctic summer ice pack recedes the route will become passable without the help of icebreakers for a greater period each summer [171] [172]\n\n\nCape Horn\nSailing ships, such as the windjammers in the heyday of the Great Grain Race between Australia and Europe during the 1930s, often preferred the Cape Horn route when going to Europe, due to prevalent wind directions, even though it is slightly longer from Sydney to Europe this way than past Cape Agulhas.\n\n\nNegev desert railway\nIn February 2012, Israel announced its intention to construct a railway between the Mediterranean and Eilat through the Negev desert to compete with the canal [174] By 2019, the project had been put on indefinite hold [175]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nThe opening of the canal created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea Although the Red Sea is about 1.2 m (4 ft) higher than the eastern Mediterranean, [176] the current between the Mediterranean and the middle of the canal at the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer The current south of the Bitter Lakes is tidal, varying with the tide at Suez [4] The Bitter Lakes, which were hypersaline natural lakes, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the eastern Mediterranean [177]\n\n\nSuez Canal Economic Zone\nThe Suez Canal Economic Zone, sometimes shortened to SCZONE, describes the set of locations neighbouring the canal where customs rates have been reduced to zero in order to attract investment The zone comprises over 461 km2 (178 sq mi) within the governorates of Port Said, Ismailia and Suez Projects in the zone are collectively described as the Suez Canal Area Development Project (SCADP) [181] [182]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nHistoriography and memory\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Suez Canal**\n\nThe Suez Canal is a vital waterway that connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through Egypt. It is one of the most important artificial waterways in the world, playing a significant role in international trade and commerce. The canal has a long and complex history, with various civilizations contributing to its development over the centuries.\n\n**Precursors**\n\nAncient west–east canals were built to facilitate travel from the Nile to the Red Sea. One smaller canal is believed to have been constructed under the auspices of Senusret II or Ramesses II. Another canal, probably incorporating a portion of the first, was constructed under the reign of Necho II (610–595 BCE), but the only fully functional canal was engineered and completed by Darius I (522–486 BCE).\n\n**Second millennium BCE**\n\nJames Henry Breasted attributes the earliest-known attempt to construct a canal to the first cataract, near Aswan, to the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt and its completion to Senusret III (1878–1839 BCE) of the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt.\n\n**Canals dug by Necho, Darius I and Ptolemy**\n\nRemnants of an ancient west–east canal through the ancient Egyptian cities of Bubastis, Pi-Ramesses, and Pithom were discovered by Napoleon Bonaparte and his engineers and cartographers in 1799.\n\n**Receding Red Sea and the dwindling Nile**\n\nThe Red Sea is believed by some historians to have gradually receded over the centuries, its coastline slowly moving southward away from Lake Timsah and the Great Bitter Lake. Coupled with persistent accumulations of Nile silt, maintenance and repair of Ptolemy's canal became increasingly cumbersome over each passing century.\n\n**Cairo to the Red Sea**\n\nThe ancient canal was re-excavated by Roman emperor Trajan in the first century AD, who named it Amnis Traianus after himself. He reportedly moved its mouth on the Nile further south, at the site of what is now Old Cairo. By the time of the Arab conquest in 641 AD, this canal had fallen out of use.\n\n**Ottoman attempts**\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Ottoman Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha attempted to construct a canal connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. This was motivated by a desire to connect Constantinople to the pilgrimage and trade routes of the Indian Ocean, as well as by strategic concerns.\n\n**Napoleon's discovery of an ancient canal**\n\nDuring the French campaign in Egypt and Syria in late 1798, Napoleon expressed interest in finding the remnants of an ancient waterway passage. This culminated in a cadre of archaeologists, scientists, cartographers, and engineers scouring northern Egypt.\n\n**History of the Suez Canal**\n\nDespite the construction challenges that could have been the result of the alleged difference in sea levels, the idea of finding a shorter route to the east remained alive. In 1830, General Francis Chesney submitted a report to the British government that stated that there was no difference in elevation and that the Suez Canal was feasible, but his report received no further attention.\n\n**Construction by the Suez Canal Company**\n\nIn 1854 and 1856, Ferdinand de Lesseps obtained a concession from Sa'id Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan, to create a company to construct a canal open to ships of all nations. The company was to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening.\n\n**Construction**\n\nWork started on the shore of the future Port Said on 25 April 1859. Company towns were built along the canal, including Port Said, Port Fuad, Ismailia, and Port Tewfik. The canal was opened under French control in November 1869.\n\n**Initial difficulties**\n\nAlthough numerous technical, political, and financial problems had been overcome, the final cost was more than double the original estimate.\n\n**Growth and reorganisation**\n\nThe canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on world trade. Combined with the American transcontinental railroad completed six months earlier, it allowed the world to be circled in record time. It played an important role in increasing European colonization of Africa.\n\n**Suez Crisis**\n\nIn 1951 Egypt repudiated the 1936 treaty with Great Britain. In October 1954 the UK tentatively agreed to remove its troops from the Canal Zone. Because of Egyptian overtures towards the Soviet Union, both the United Kingdom and the United States withdrew their pledge to financially support construction of the Aswan Dam.\n\n**Arab-Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973**\n\nAfter the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Egypt closed the Canal to Israeli shipping, despite UN Security Council resolutions from 1949 and 1951 urging it not to.\n\n**Mine clearing operations**\n\nAfter the Yom Kippur War, the United States initiated Operation Nimbus Moon. The minehunters HMS Maxton, HMS Bossington, and HMS Wilton, the Fleet Clearance Diving Team (FCDT), and HMS Abdiel, a practice minelayer/MCMV support ship, were sent to the Canal.\n\n**UN presence**\n\nThe UNEF mandate expired in 1979. Despite the efforts of the United States, Israel, Egypt, and others to obtain an extension of the UN role in observing the peace between Israel and Egypt, as called for under the Egypt-Israel peace treaty of 1979, the mandate could not be extended.\n\n**Bypass expansion**\n\nIn 2014, months after taking office as President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered the expansion of the Ballah Bypass from 61 meters wide to 312 meters wide for 35 kilometers.\n\n**Incidents**\n\nIn 2004, the canal was closed for three days when the oil tanker Tropic Brilliance became stuck. On 23 March 2021, the Suez Canal was blocked in both directions by the ultra-large container ship Ever Given.\n\n**Layout and operation**\n\nWhen built, the canal was 164 kilometers long and 8 meters deep. After several enlargements, it is 193.30 kilometers long, 24 meters deep, and 205 meters wide. It consists of the northern access channel of 22 kilometers, the canal itself of 162.25 kilometers, and the southern access channel of 9 kilometers.\n\n**Capacity**\n\nThe canal allows passage of ships up to 20 meters draft or 240,000 deadweight tons and up to a height of 68 meters above water level and a maximum beam of 77.5 meters under certain conditions.\n\n**Navigation**\n\nShips approaching the canal from the sea are expected to radio the harbor when they are within 15 nautical miles of the Fairway Buoy near Port Said.\n\n**Operation**\n\nBefore August 2015, the canal was too narrow for free two-way traffic, so ships had to pass in convoys and use bypasses.\n\n**Convoy sailing**\n\nSince the canal does not cater to unregulated two-way traffic, all ships transit in convoys on regular times, scheduled on a 24-hour basis.\n\n**Canal crossings**\n\nFrom north to south, the crossings are the Ezbet el-Borg passing at kilometer 42, the Timsah passes at kilometer 122, the Deversoir passes at kilometer 155, the El-Qantara East crossing at kilometer 175, the El-Qantara West crossing at kilometer 174, and the Suez passage at kilometer 162.\n\n**Economic impact**\n\nEconomically, after its completion, the Suez Canal benefited primarily the sea trading powers of the Mediterranean countries, which now had much faster connections to the Near and Far East than the North and West European sea trading nations.\n\n**Alternative routes**\n\nBefore the canal's opening in 1869, goods were sometimes offloaded from ships and carried overland between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The main alternative is around Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa, commonly referred to as the Cape of Good Hope route.\n\n**Northern Sea Route**\n\nIn recent years, the shrinking Arctic sea ice has made the Northern Sea Route feasible for commercial cargo ships between Europe and East Asia during a six-to-eight-week window in the summer months.\n\n**Environmental impact**\n\nThe opening of the canal created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. The current between the Mediterranean and the middle of the canal at the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer.\n\n**Suez Canal Economic Zone**\n\nThe Suez Canal Economic Zone, sometimes shortened to SCZONE, describes the set of locations neighbouring the canal where customs rates have been reduced to zero in order to attract investment.\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of the

Ptolemy\nRemnants of an ancient west–east canal through the ancient Egyptian cities of Bubastis, Pi-Ramesses, and Pithom were discovered by Napoleon Bonaparte and his engineers and cartographers in 1799 [12] [26] [27] [28] [29]\n\n\nReceding Red Sea and the dwindling Nile\nThe Red Sea is believed by some historians to have gradually receded over the centuries, its coastline slowly moving

reportedly moved its mouth on the Nile further south, at the site of what is now Old Cairo [43] By the time of the Arab conquest in 641 AD, this canal had fallen out of use [44] The commander of the Muslim force, Amr ibn al-As, ordered that it be restored so as to improve connections between Egypt and Medina, the Muslim capital at the time The Muslim canal was excavated further north from Trajan's canal, joining the Nile close to what is now the Sayyida Zaynab neighbourhood of Cairo [44] This canal reportedly ended near modern Suez [11] [45] The site of the former Roman channel near the Nile was absorbed into the new city of Fustat [44] [43]\n\n\nConception by Venice\nThe successful 1488 navigation of southern Africa by Bartolomeu Dias opened a direct maritime trading route to India and the Spice Islands, and forever changed the balance of Mediterranean trade One of the most prominent losers in the new order, as former middlemen, was the former spice trading center of Venice.\n\n\nOttoman attempts\nDuring the 16th century, the Ottoman Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha attempted to construct a canal connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean This was motivated by a desire to connect Constantinople to the pilgrimage and trade routes of the Indian Ocean, as well as by strategic concerns—as the European presence in the Indian Ocean was growing, Ottoman mercantile and strategic interests were increasingly challenged, and the Sublime Porte was increasingly pressed to assert its position A navigable canal would allow the Ottoman Navy to connect its Red Sea, Black Sea, and Mediterranean fleets However, this project was deemed too expensive, and was never completed [49] [50]\n\n\nNapoleon's discovery of an ancient canal\nDuring the French campaign in Egypt and Syria in late 1798, Napoleon expressed interest in finding the remnants of an ancient waterway passage This culminated in a cadre of archaeologists, scientists, cartographers and engineers scouring northern Egypt [51] [52] Their findings, recorded in the Description de l'Égypte, include detailed maps that depict the discovery of an ancient canal extending northward from the Red Sea and then westward toward the Nile [51] [53]\n\n\nHistory of the Suez Canal\nDespite the construction challenges that could have been the result of the alleged difference in sea levels, the idea of finding a shorter route to the east remained alive In 1830, General Francis Chesney submitted a report to the British government that stated that there was no difference in elevation and that the Suez Canal was feasible, but his report received no further attention Lieutenant Waghorn established his \"Overland Route\", which transported post and passengers to India via Egypt [55] [56]\n\n\nInterim period\nDespite the construction challenges that could have been the result of the alleged difference in sea levels, the idea of finding a shorter route to the east remained alive In 1830, General

Lieutenant Waghorn established his \"Overland Route\", which transported post and passengers to India via Egypt [55] [56]\n\n\nConstruction by the Suez Canal Company\nIn 1854 and 1856, Ferdinand de Lesseps obtained a concession from Sa'id Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan, to create a company to construct a canal open to ships of all nations The company was to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening De Lesseps had used his friendly relationship with Sa'id, which he had developed while he was a French diplomat in the 1830s As stipulated in the concessions, de Lesseps convened the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez (Commission Internationale pour le percement de l'isthme de Suez) consisting of 13 experts from seven countries, among them John Robinson McClean, later President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in London, and again Negrelli, to examine the plans developed by Linant de Bellefonds, and to advise on the feasibility of and the best route for the canal After surveys and analyses in Egypt and discussions in Paris on various aspects of the canal, where many of Negrelli's ideas prevailed, the commission produced a unanimous report in December 1856 containing a detailed description of the canal complete with plans and profiles [57] The Suez Canal Company (Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez) came into being on 15 December 1858.\n\n\nPreparations (1854–1858)\nIn 1854 and 1856, Ferdinand de Lesseps obtained a concession from Sa'id Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan, to create a company to construct a canal

Suez Canal Company (Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez) came into being on 15 December 1858.\n\n\nConstruction (1859–1869)\nWork started on the shore of the future Port Said on 25 April 1859.\n\n\nCompany towns\nFrom its inauguration, till 1925, the Suez Canal Company built a series of company towns along the canal to serve its operation They included ports and their facilities as well as housing for employees segregated by race or nationality [64] These were Port Said (1869) and Port Fuad (1925) at the canal's northern entrance by the Mediterranenan, Ismailia (1862) near the middle and north of Lake Timsah, and Port Twefik (1867) at the canal's southern entrance on the Red Sea [65]\n\n\nInauguration (17 November 1869)\nThe canal opened under French control in November 1869 The opening ceremonies began at Port Said on the evening of 15 November, with illuminations, fireworks, and a banquet on the yacht of the Khedive Isma'il Pasha of Egypt and Sudan The royal guests arrived the following morning: the Emperor Franz Joseph I, the French Empress Eugenie in the Imperial yacht L'Aigle, the Crown Prince of Prussia, and Prince Louis of Hesse [66] Other international guests included the American natural historian H W Harkness [67] In the afternoon there were blessings of the canal with both Muslim and Christian ceremonies, a temporary mosque and church having been built side by side on the beach In the evening there were more illuminations and fireworks [66]\n\n\nInitial difficulties (1869–1871)\nAlthough numerous technical, political, and financial problems had been overcome, the final cost was more than double the original estimate.\n\n\nGrowth and reorganisation\nThe canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on world trade Combined with the American transcontinental railroad completed six months earlier, it allowed the world to be circled in record time It played an important role in increasing European colonization of Africa The construction of the canal was one of the reasons for the Panic of 1873 in Great Britain, because goods from the Far East had, until then, been carried in sailing vessels around the Cape of Good Hope and stored in British warehouses An inability to pay his bank debts led Said Pasha's successor, Isma'il Pasha, in 1875 to sell his 44% share in the canal for £4,000,000 ($19.2 million), equivalent to £432 million to £456 million ($540 million to $570 million) in 2019, to the government of the United Kingdom [78] French shareholders still held the majority [79] Local unrest caused the British to invade in 1882 and take full control, although nominally Egypt remained part of the Ottoman Empire The British representative from 1883 to 1907 was Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, who reorganized and modernized the government and suppressed rebellions and corruption, thereby facilitating increased traffic on the canal [80]\n\n\nSuez Crisis\nIn 1951 Egypt repudiated the 1936 treaty with Great Britain In October 1954 the UK tentatively agreed to remove its troops from the Canal Zone Because of Egyptian overtures towards the Soviet Union, both the United Kingdom and the United States withdrew their pledge to financially support construction of the Aswan Dam Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser responded by nationalising the canal on 26 July 1956 [90] and transferring it to the Suez Canal Authority, intending to finance the dam project using revenue from the canal On the same day that the canal was nationalised Nasser also closed the Straits of Tiran to all Israeli ships [91] This led to the Suez Crisis in which the UK, France, and Israel invaded Egypt According to the pre-agreed war plans under the Protocol of Sèvres, Israel invaded the Sinai Peninsula on 29 October, forcing Egypt to engage them militarily, and allowing the Anglo-French partnership to declare the resultant fighting a threat to stability in the Middle East and enter the war – officially to separate the two forces but in reality to regain the Canal and bring down the Nasser government [92] [93] [94]\n\n\nArab–Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt closed the Canal to Israeli shipping, despite UN Security Council resolutions from 1949 and 1951 urging it not to, on the grounds that hostilities had ended with the 1949 armistice agreement.\n\n\nMine clearing operations (1974–75)\nAfter the Yom Kippur War, the United States initiated Operation Nimbus Moon The amphibious assault ship USS Inchon (LPH-12) was sent to the Canal, carrying 12 RH-53D minesweeping helicopters of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 12 These partly cleared the canal between May and December 1974 It was relieved by the LST USS Barnstable County (LST1197) The British Royal Navy initiated Operation Rheostat and Task Group 65.2 provided for Operation Rheostat One [103] (six months in 1974), the minehunters HMS Maxton, HMS Bossington, and HMS Wilton, the Fleet Clearance Diving Team (FCDT) [104] and HMS Abdiel, a practice minelayer/MCMV support ship; and for Operation Rheostat Two [105] (six months in 1975) the minehunters HMS Hubberston and HMS Sheraton, and HMS Abdiel When the Canal Clearance Operations were completed, the canal and its lakes were considered 99% clear of mines The canal was then reopened by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat aboard an Egyptian destroyer, which led the first convoy northbound to Port Said in 1975, [106] at his side stood the Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi [107]\n\n\nUN presence\nThe UNEF mandate expired in 1979 Despite the efforts of the United States, Israel, Egypt, and others to obtain an extension of the UN role in observing the peace between Israel and Egypt, as called for under the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979, the mandate could not be extended because of the veto by the Soviet Union in the UN Security Council, at the request of Syria Accordingly, negotiations for a new observer force in the Sinai produced the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), stationed in Sinai in 1981 in coordination with a phased Israeli withdrawal The MFO remains active under agreements between the United States, Israel, Egypt, and other nations [108]\n\n\nBypass expansion\nIn 2014, months after taking office as President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered the expansion of the Ballah Bypass from 61 metres (200 ft) wide to 312 metres (1,024 ft) wide for 35 kilometres (22 mi) The project was called the New Suez Canal, as it allows ships to transit the canal in both directions simultaneously [109] [110] The project cost more than LE 59.4 billion (US$9 billion) and was completed within a year Sisi declared the expanded channel open to business in a ceremony on 6 August 2015 [5]\n\n\nIncidents\nIn 2004, the canal was closed for three days when the oil tanker Tropic Brilliance became stuck [111] [112]\n\n\n2021 obstruction\nOn 23 March 2021, at around 05:40 UTC (07:40 local time), [115] the Suez Canal was blocked in both directions by ultra-large Evergreen G-class container ship Ever Given [116] The ship, operated by Evergreen Marine, was en route from Malaysia to the Netherlands when it ran aground after strong winds allegedly blew the ship off course [115] Upon running aground, Ever Given turned sideways, completely blocking the canal [117] [115] Although part of the length of the canal is paralleled by an older narrower channel which can be used to bypass obstructions, this incident occurred to the south, in a section of the canal where there is only one channel [118]\n\n\n2023 grounding\nOn 25 May 2023, a Hong Kong-flagged cargo ship, MV Xin Hai Tong 23, was grounded near the southern end of the canal, but it was refloated by tugboats in less than a day [132]\n\n\nLayout and operation\nWhen built, the canal was 164 km (102 mi) long and 8 m (26 ft) deep After several enlargements, it is 193.30 km (120+1⁄8 mi) long, 24 m (79 ft) deep and 205 m (673 ft) wide [134] It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km (14 mi), the canal itself of 162.25 km (100+7⁄8 mi) and the southern access channel of 9 km (5+1⁄2 mi) [135]\n\n\nCapacity\nThe canal allows passage of ships up to 20 m (66 ft) draft or 240,000 deadweight tons and up to a height of 68 m (223 ft) above water level and a maximum beam of 77.5 m (254 ft) under certain conditions [138] [134] The canal can handle more traffic and larger ships than the Panama Canal, as Suezmax dimensions are greater than both Panamax and New Panamax Some supertankers are too large to traverse the canal Others can offload part of their cargo onto a canal-owned ship to reduce their draft, transit, and reload at the other end of the canal On 15 April 2021 Egyptian authorities announced that they would widen the southern section of the Suez Canal to improve the efficiency of the canal The plan mainly covers about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Suez to the Great Bitter Lake It will be widened by 40 metres (130 ft) and the maximum depth will be increased from about 20 metres (66 ft) to about 22 metres (72 ft) [139]\n\n\nNavigation\nShips approaching the canal from the sea are expected to radio the harbour when they are within 15 nautical miles (28 kilometres) of the Fairway Buoy near Port Said [140] The canal has no locks because of the flat terrain, and the minor sea level difference between each end is inconsequential for shipping As the canal has no sea surge gates, the ports at the ends would be subject to the sudden impact of tsunamis from the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea, according to a 2012 article in the Journal of Coastal Research [141]\n\n\nOperation\nBefore August 2015, the canal was too narrow for free two-way traffic, so ships had to pass in convoys and use bypasses The bypasses were 78 km (48 mi) out of 193 km (120 mi) (40%) From north to south, they are Port Said bypass (entrances) 36.5 km (23 mi), Ballah bypass & anchorage 9 km (6 mi), Timsah bypass 5 km (3 mi), and the Deversoir bypass (northern end of the Great Bitter Lake) 27.5 kilometres (17 mi) The bypasses were completed in 1980.\n\n\nConvoy sailing\nSince the canal does not cater to unregulated two-way traffic, all ships transit in convoys on regular times, scheduled on a 24-hour basis Each day, a single northbound convoy starts at 04:00 EET from Suez At dual lane sections, the convoy uses the eastern route Synchronised with this convoy's passage is the southbound convoy It starts at 03:30 EET from Port Said and so passes the Northbound convoy in the two-lane section [148] [149]\n\n\nCanal crossings\nFrom north to south, the crossings are:\n\n\nEconomic impact\nEconomically, after its completion, the Suez Canal benefited primarily the sea trading powers of the Mediterranean countries, which now had much faster connections to the Near and Far East than the North and West European sea trading nations such as Great Britain or Germany [81] [156] The main Habsburg trading port of Trieste with its direct connections to Central Europe experienced a meteoric rise at that time [157] [158]\n\n\nAlternative routes\nBefore the canal's opening in 1869, goods were sometimes offloaded from ships and carried overland between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea [167]\n\n\nCape Agulhas\nThe main alternative is around Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa, commonly referred to as the Cape of Good Hope route This was the only sea route before the canal was constructed, and when the canal was closed It is still the only route for ships that are too large for the canal In the early 21st century, the Suez Canal has suffered from diminished traffic due to piracy in Somalia, with many shipping companies choosing to take the long route instead [168] [169] Between 2008 and 2010, it is estimated that the canal lost 10% of traffic due to the threat of piracy, and another 10% due to the financial crisis An oil tanker going from Saudi Arabia to the United States has 4,345 km (2,700 mi) farther to go when taking the route south of Africa rather than the canal [170]\n\n\nNorthern Sea Route\nIn recent years, the shrinking Arctic sea ice has made the Northern Sea Route feasible for commercial cargo ships between Europe and East Asia during a six-to-eight-week window in the summer months, shortening the voyage by thousands of kilometres compared to that through the Suez Canal According to polar climate researchers, as the extent of the Arctic summer ice pack recedes the route will become passable without the help of icebreakers for a greater period each summer [171] [172]\n\n\nCape Horn\nSailing ships, such as the windjammers in the heyday of the Great Grain Race between Australia and Europe during the 1930s, often preferred the Cape Horn route when going to Europe, due to prevalent wind directions, even though it is slightly longer from Sydney to Europe this way than past Cape Agulhas.\n\n\nNegev desert railway\nIn February 2012, Israel announced its intention to construct a railway between the Mediterranean and Eilat through the Negev desert to compete with the canal [174] By 2019, the project had been put on indefinite hold [175]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nThe opening of the canal created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea Although the Red Sea is about 1.2 m (4 ft) higher than the eastern Mediterranean, [176] the current between the Mediterranean and the middle of the canal at the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer The current south of the Bitter Lakes is tidal, varying with the tide at Suez [4] The Bitter Lakes, which were hypersaline natural lakes, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the eastern Mediterranean [177]\n\n\nSuez Canal Economic Zone\nThe Suez Canal Economic Zone, sometimes shortened to SCZONE, describes the set of locations neighbouring the canal where customs rates have been reduced to zero in order to attract investment The zone comprises over 461 km2 (178 sq mi) within the governorates of Port Said, Ismailia and Suez Projects in the zone are collectively described as the Suez Canal Area Development Project (SCADP) [181] [182]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nHistoriography and memory\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
