This article provides an overview of the development of Finland's relations with NATO from the end of World War II to the present day.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFinland's geographical location, bordering Russia and situated in the Baltic region, has made its foreign policy a subject of interest to NATO member states for decades. While Finland has maintained a policy of neutrality since the end of World War II, it has also pursued close cooperation with NATO, particularly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The country's accession to NATO in 2023 reflects a shift in its foreign policy priorities, with a greater emphasis on collective defense and cooperation with other like-minded countries.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Background: Finnish Neutrality at the End of World War II**\n\nAt the end of World War II, Finland found itself in a precarious position, with the Soviet Union demanding significant territorial concessions and economic reparations. To avoid conflict with the Soviet Union, Finland pursued a policy of neutrality, which was formalized in the 1948 Treaty of Paris. This treaty established Finland's borders and recognized its sovereignty, while also providing for close economic and cultural ties with the Soviet Union.\n\n### **1949–1991: Finnish Neutrality during the Cold War**\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland maintained its neutrality, avoiding membership in NATO and the Warsaw Pact. However, it also pursued close cooperation with NATO member states, particularly in the areas of trade and defense. Finland's neutrality was motivated by a desire to avoid entanglement in the conflict between the Soviet Union and Western powers, while also maintaining good relations with its powerful eastern neighbor.\n\n### **1991–1995: Immediate Aftermath of the Cold War**\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point in Finland's foreign policy. The country's new government, led by President Martti Ahtisaari, sought to strengthen ties with NATO and the European Union. Finland's membership in the EU in 1995 marked a significant step towards greater integration with Western institutions, while also providing a framework for closer cooperation with NATO member states.\n\n### **1995–2022: Shift from Non-Alignment within the European Union**\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, Finland continued to pursue a policy of non-alignment, while also strengthening ties with NATO. The country's membership in the EU provided a framework for cooperation with other European countries, while also allowing Finland to maintain its independence in foreign policy matters. However, Finland's close relations with NATO member states, particularly in the areas of defense and security, increasingly raised questions about its neutrality.\n\n### **2022–2023: Accession Process Following the Russian Invasion of Ukraine**\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a significant turning point in Finland's relations with NATO. The country's parliament, the Eduskunta, voted in favor of a declaration of intent to join NATO, which was followed by an application for membership in June 2022. The accession process was completed in April 2023, with Finland becoming the 31st member of the alliance.\n\n#### **February – May 2022: Initial Response to the Invasion**\n\nFinland's initial response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine was one of shock and outrage. The country's government, led by President Sauli Niinistö, condemned the invasion and offered support to Ukraine. However, Finland's reluctance to take a more active role in the conflict was motivated by a desire to avoid provoking Russia.\n\n#### **May – June 2022: Declaration of Intent, Application**\n\nIn May 2022, Finland's parliament voted in favor of a declaration of intent to join NATO. This was followed by an application for membership in June 2022, which was submitted to the North Atlantic Council. The application was motivated by a desire to strengthen Finland's security and to provide a clear signal to Russia that the country would not be intimidated by the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n#### **June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification**\n\nThe ratification process for Finland's membership in NATO was completed in April 2023. The country's parliament voted in favor of the accession treaty, which was then ratified by the President. Finland's membership in NATO marked a significant turning point in its relations with the alliance, and reflected a shift in its foreign policy priorities.\n\n**Finland's Foreign Relations with Other NATO Member States**\n\nFinland's relations with other NATO member states have been strengthened in recent years, particularly in the areas of defense and security. The country's membership in NATO has provided a framework for cooperation with other like-minded countries, while also allowing Finland to participate in NATO's decision-making processes.\n\nFinland's relations with the United States have been particularly close, with the two countries cooperating on a range of issues, including defense, trade, and energy. Finland's membership in NATO has also provided a framework for cooperation with other European countries, particularly in the areas of defense and security.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Finland's relations with the European Union\n* Finland's relations with Russia\n* Finland's defense policy\n* NATO's enlargement\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* [list of sources]\n\n**External Links**\n\n* [list of external links]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Finland–NATO_relations\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n##1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n###1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n###1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n###1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n###2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n####February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n####May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n####June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n##2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n#Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is revered as one of the most important figures in Meitei mythology and history. According to legends, Pakhangba was the first king to establish the Meitei kingdom and was known for his bravery, wisdom, and spiritual powers.\n\n#Rise to Power\n----------------\n\nNongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā is said to have ruled over the Meitei kingdom in the 33rd century BCE.

This article explores the history, use, and representation of this euphemism in different fields, including law, art, and literature.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nEuphemisms are words or phrases used to avoid offense or unpleasantness when discussing sensitive or taboo topics. In the case of \"illegal operation,\" the term has been employed to refer to activities that are considered illicit or unauthorized, often in a way that avoids direct reference to the underlying issue. This article examines the history and use of this euphemism, as well as its representation in different contexts.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe use of euphemisms to refer to illicit activities dates back to ancient times. In many cultures, words or phrases were used to avoid direct reference to sensitive or taboo topics, often to protect individuals or groups from social or moral condemnation. In the context of \"illegal operation,\" this euphemism has been used to refer to a range of activities, including abortion, illicit trade, and unauthorized medical procedures.\n\n### \"The thing that had no name\"\n\nIn the 19th century, the term \"illegal operation\" was used as a euphemism to refer to the practice of abortion. At the time, abortion was a highly stigmatized and often illegal activity, and the term \"illegal operation\" was used to avoid direct reference to the practice. This use of the term is exemplified in the writings of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, who used the phrase in her 1915 essay \"A Suggestion on the Necessity of Establishing as Soon as Possible a Worldwide Organization for Human Efficiency.\"\n\nGilman's use of the term \"illegal operation\" highlights the societal stigma surrounding abortion at the time. The term was used to convey the illicit nature of the practice, while avoiding direct reference to the underlying issue. This use of the euphemism reflects the complex and often contradictory attitudes towards abortion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n### Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n\nThe use of the term \"illegal operation\" as a euphemism for abortion is not unique to Gilman's writing. In the early 20th century, the term was used by other writers and commentators to refer to the practice. For example, in her 1920 novel \"The Age of Innocence,\" Edith Wharton uses the phrase to describe the protagonist's illicit relationship with a woman who has undergone an abortion.\n\nWharton's use of the term highlights the ongoing stigma surrounding abortion in the early 20th century. The phrase \"illegal operation\" was used to convey the illicit nature of the practice, while avoiding direct reference to the underlying issue. This use of the euphemism reflects the complex and often contradictory attitudes towards abortion in the early 20th century.\n\n**Law**\n\nThe term \"illegal operation\" has also been used in legal contexts to refer to a range of illicit activities, including unauthorized medical procedures and illicit trade. In the United States, for example, the term has been used in federal laws and regulations to refer to unauthorized medical procedures, such as the practice of performing abortions without proper licensure or training.\n\nIn the 1970s, the use of the term \"illegal operation\" became increasingly common in the context of abortion law. During this period, many states passed laws that prohibited abortion, and the term \"illegal operation\" was used to describe the practice. The use of this term reflects the ongoing debate over abortion in the United States, with many advocates arguing that abortion should be subject to strict regulations and others arguing that it should be freely available.\n\n**Art**\n\nThe term \"illegal operation\" has also been used in art and literature to refer to a range of illicit activities, including unauthorized medical procedures and illicit trade. In the context of film, for example, the term has been used to describe the practice of performing abortions without proper licensure or training.\n\nIn the 1970s, the film \"The Silent Scream\" used the term \"illegal operation\" to describe the practice of abortion. The film, which was produced by the anti-abortion organization, the Center for Reasearch on Abortion and Sterilization Policy, argued that abortion was an \"illegal operation\" that was often performed without proper medical supervision.\n\nThe use of the term \"illegal operation\" in the film reflects the ongoing debate over abortion in the United States. The film's use of the term to describe abortion highlights the ongoing stigma surrounding the practice, while also emphasizing the need for stricter regulation.\n\n**Television**\n\nThe term \"illegal operation\" has also been used in television to refer to a range of illicit activities, including unauthorized medical procedures and illicit trade. In the context of television, the term has been used to describe the practice of performing abortions without proper licensure or training.\n\nIn the 1990s, the television show \"ER\" used the term \"illegal operation\" to describe the practice of abortion. The show, which was a medical drama that followed the lives of doctors and nurses working in an emergency room, used the term to emphasize the ongoing debate over abortion in the United States.\n\nThe use of the term \"illegal operation\" in the show reflects the ongoing stigma surrounding abortion in the United States. The show's use of the term to describe abortion highlights the ongoing debate over the practice, while also emphasizing the need for stricter regulation.\n\n**Sculpture**\n\nThe term \"illegal operation\" has also been used in sculpture to refer to a range of illicit activities, including unauthorized medical procedures and illicit trade. In the context of sculpture, the term has been used to describe the practice of performing abortions without proper licensure or training.\n\nIn the 2000s, the sculptor, Angela Guzman, used the term \"illegal operation\" to describe the practice of abortion. Guzman's sculpture, which was titled \"The Abortion Clinic,\" used the term to highlight the ongoing debate over abortion in the United States.\n\nThe use of the term \"illegal operation\" in Guzman's sculpture reflects the ongoing stigma surrounding abortion in the United States. The sculpture's use of the term to describe abortion highlights the ongoing debate over the practice, while also emphasizing the need for stricter regulation.\n\n**Fiction**\n\nThe term \"illegal operation\" has also been used in fiction to refer to a range of illicit activities, including unauthorized medical procedures and illicit trade. In the context of fiction, the term has been used to describe the practice of performing abortions without proper licensure or training.\n\nIn the 2010s, the novelist, Jennifer Egan, used the term \"illegal operation\" to describe the practice of abortion. Egan's novel, which was titled \"A Visit from the Goon Squad,\" used the term to highlight the ongoing debate over abortion in the United States.\n\nThe use of the term \"illegal operation\" in Egan's novel reflects the ongoing stigma surrounding abortion in the United States. The novel's use of the term to describe abortion highlights the ongoing debate over the practice, while also emphasizing the need for stricter regulation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe term \"illegal operation\" has been used as a euphemism in various contexts to refer to a range of illicit activities, including unauthorized medical procedures and illicit trade. In the context of law, art, and literature, the term has been used to convey the illicit nature of these activities, while avoiding direct reference to the underlying issue.\n\nThe use of the term \"illegal operation\" reflects the ongoing stigma surrounding abortion in the United States. The term has been used to highlight the ongoing debate over abortion, while also emphasizing the need for stricter regulation.\n\nIn conclusion, the term \"illegal operation\" is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been used in various contexts to refer to a range of illicit activities.

Born on January 12, 1955, in Wichita, Kansas, Alley rose to fame in the 1980s and 1990s with her distinctive voice and energetic stage presence. She is best known for her starring role in the television series \"Cheers\" and her subsequent work in film and television.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nKirstie Alley was born to Robert John Alley and Lillian Marie (née Wolfe) Alley. Her father was a United States Army sergeant, and the family moved frequently during Alley's childhood, eventually settling in Kansas City, Kansas. Alley's early life was marked by a tumultuous relationship with her father, who was often absent or abusive. Despite these challenges, Alley developed a passion for acting and was encouraged by her mother, who supported her early forays into drama and dance.\n\nAlley attended Kansas City, Kansas High School, where she was active in the school's drama club and was a cheerleader. After graduating in 1973, she attended Wichita State University, where she studied speech and drama. Alley's early aspirations were to become a dancer, and she began taking classes in ballet, jazz, and modern dance. However, a knee injury forced her to abandon her dance career, and she shifted her focus to acting.\n\n**Career**\n\nAlley's early career was marked by a series of small roles in film and television. She made her screen debut in the 1979 film \"Student Bodies,\" a horror-comedy that received mixed reviews. Alley's breakthrough role came in 1987, when she was cast as Rebecca Howe in the popular television series \"Cheers.\" The show, which ran for 11 seasons, catapulted Alley to stardom and earned her widespread critical acclaim.\n\nDuring her time on \"Cheers,\" Alley became known for her sharp wit, sassy personality, and impressive comedic timing. She developed a close relationship with her co-star Woody Harrelson, and the two became one of the show's most popular on-screen couples. Alley's performance on \"Cheers\" earned her multiple Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe win.\n\nIn addition to her work on \"Cheers,\" Alley has appeared in a range of films and television shows. Some notable roles include her starring turn in the 1994 film \"Look Who's Talking Now,\" a romantic comedy that paired her with John Travolta; her portrayal of Lieutenant Lydia Deetz in the 1991 comedy \"Soapdish\"; and her recurring role as Selina St. Germain in the 2007-2008 television series \"Veronica Mars.\"\n\n**Personal life**\n\nAlley has been married three times: to Parker Stevenson from 1983 until their divorce in 1997; to Jon Peters from 2005 until their separation in 2008; and to Parker Stevenson again from 2010 until his death in 2022.\n\n**Body image**\n\nAlley's personal life has been the subject of much media attention, particularly with regards to her struggles with body image. In the late 1990s, Alley was the subject of a high-profile feud with Oprah Winfrey, who had criticized Alley's weight gain during an appearance on Winfrey's talk show. The incident sparked a national debate about body image and weight, and Alley has since spoken publicly about her struggles with food and her weight.\n\n**Scientology**\n\nAlley has been a member of the Church of Scientology since the 1970s and has been a vocal advocate for the organization. However, her involvement with Scientology has been the subject of controversy, with some critics accusing the church of being a cult. Alley has denied these allegations, stating that Scientology has been a positive force in her life.\n\n**Politics**\n\nAlley has been involved in a range of political causes, including the 1992 presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan and the 2008 presidential campaign of John McCain. In 2012, Alley endorsed Mitt Romney in the presidential election, stating that she was drawn to Romney's business experience and conservative values.\n\n**Death**\n\nParker Stevenson, Alley's second husband, passed away on August 31, 2022, at the age of 85. Alley has not publicly commented on her husband's death.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n### Film\n\n* \"Student Bodies\" (1979)\n* \"The Last American Virgin\" (1982)\n* \"One More Chance\" (1983)\n* \"Summer School\" (1987)\n* \"Look Who's Talking Now\" (1994)\n* \"Stargate\" (1994)\n* \"Mad About You\" (1999)\n* \"Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo\" (1999)\n* \"Muppets from Space\" (1999)\n* \"Look Who's Talking Now\" (2000)\n* \"The View from the Top\" (2003)\n* \"Catch Me If You Can\" (2003)\n* \"Veronica Mars\" (2007-2008)\n* \"The Muppets\" (2011)\n* \"The Kennedys\" (2011)\n\n### Television\n\n* \"Back to School\" (1986)\n* \"Cheers\" (1987-1993)\n* \"The Love Boat: The Next Wave\" (1998)\n* \"Mad About You\" (1999)\n* \"Veronica Mars\" (2007-2008)\n* \"The View\" (2009-2010)\n* \"Kirstie\" (2013-2014)\n\n**Awards and nominations**\n\n* Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (1987, 1989)\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television (1989)\n* Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1998)\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of American television actors\n* List of actors who have played multiple roles in a single film\n* List of actresses who have played multiple roles in a single television series\n\n**References**\n\n**External links**\n\n* Kirstie Alley at IMDb\n* Kirstie Alley at AllMovie\n* Kirstie Alley at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Kirstie Alley at The Internet Movie Database", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kirstie_Alley\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Personal life\n##Body image\n##Scientology\n##Politics\n#Death\n#Filmography\n##Film\n##Television\n#Awards and nominations\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The primary goal of climate change mitigation is to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C, as agreed upon in the Paris Agreement.\n\n**Definitions and scope**\n\nClimate change mitigation encompasses a wide range of activities and technologies that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These activities can be categorized into three main areas: reducing emissions, removing CO2 from the atmosphere, and enhancing the carbon sinks that absorb CO2.\n\n**Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)**\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) is a proposed method of climate change mitigation that involves intentionally altering the Earth's energy balance by reflecting a small percentage of incoming solar radiation back into space. While SRM has been proposed as a potential climate change mitigation strategy, it is still in the early stages of research and development, and its effectiveness and potential impacts are not yet fully understood.\n\n**Emission trends and pledges**\n\nGlobal CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry have been increasing steadily over the past century, with a slight decline in recent years. However, the rate of emissions growth is still not consistent with the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C. To meet this goal, CO2 emissions would need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.\n\n**Needed emissions cuts**\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated that to limit warming to 1.5°C, global CO2 emissions would need to be reduced by 45% by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050. This would require a significant shift away from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon energy sources.\n\n**Pledges**\n\nMany countries have made pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, including the United States, China, and the European Union. However, these pledges are not yet sufficient to meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C.\n\n**Low-carbon energy**\n\nLow-carbon energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels. These sources can provide electricity, heat, and transportation fuels, and can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector.\n\n**Solar and wind energy**\n\nSolar and wind energy are among the fastest-growing sources of low-carbon energy, with solar PV capacity increasing by over 20% in 2020. Wind power capacity has also grown rapidly, with over 700 GW of new capacity added since 2010.\n\n**Other renewables**\n\nOther low-carbon energy sources, such as geothermal, biomass, and hydrogen, are also being developed and deployed. These sources can provide electricity, heat, and transportation fuels, and can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector.\n\n**Integrating variable renewable energy**\n\nAs the share of variable renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, increases, it is becoming increasingly important to develop strategies for integrating these sources into the grid. This includes technologies such as energy storage and demand response.\n\n**Nuclear power**\n\nNuclear power can provide a low-carbon source of electricity, and can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector. However, the development and deployment of new nuclear power technologies is a complex and challenging process.\n\n**Replacing coal with natural gas**\n\nNatural gas can provide a lower-carbon alternative to coal for electricity generation and industrial processes.

The use of grades in climbing dates back to the early 20th century, when climbers began to develop systems to rate the difficulty of routes. Over time, various grading systems have been developed, each with its own unique characteristics and methods of classification. This article provides an overview of the different grading systems used in climbing.\n\n## History\n\nThe first grading systems were developed in the early 20th century, primarily in Europe and North America. In the 1920s and 1930s, climbers in the Alps developed a system of letters (A, B, C, etc.) and numbers to rate the difficulty of routes. This system was later adopted in North America, where it evolved into the Yosemite Decimal System (YDS). In the UK, a British E-grade system was developed, while in France, a numerical grading system was used.\n\n## Free Climbing\n\nFree climbing is a style of climbing where the climber uses only their hands, feet, and body to ascend the route, without the use of equipment such as ropes or ladders. The grade of a free climb is typically determined by the amount of physical strength, technique, and mental focus required to complete the route.\n\n### French Numerical Grade\n\nThe French numerical grade is a widely used grading system in free climbing, particularly in Europe and the Americas. It is based on a six-point scale, with the highest grade being 9a (or 5.15a in the YDS system). The French grade is divided into several sub-grades, including:\n\n* 1a: Easy ( equivalent to YDS 5.0)\n* 1b: Easy ( equivalent to YDS 5.1)\n* 2: Moderate ( equivalent to YDS 5.4-5.5)\n* 3: Difficult ( equivalent to YDS 5.6-5.7)\n* 4: Very difficult ( equivalent to YDS 5.8-5.9)\n* 5: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to YDS 5.10-5.11)\n* 6: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to YDS 5.12)\n* 7: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to YDS 5.13)\n* 8: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to YDS 5.14)\n* 9: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to YDS 5.15)\n\n### American YDS Grade\n\nThe Yosemite Decimal System (YDS) is a grading system used primarily in North America. It is based on a five-point scale, with the highest grade being 5.15. The YDS grade is divided into several sub-grades, including:\n\n* Class 1: Easy ( equivalent to French Grade 1a)\n* Class 2: Moderate ( equivalent to French Grade 1b-2)\n* Class 3: Difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 2-3)\n* Class 4: Very difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 3-4)\n* Class 5: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 4-5)\n* Class 5.0-5.9: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 5-6)\n* Class 5.10-5.11: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 6-7)\n* Class 5.12-5.13: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 7-8)\n* Class 5.14-5.15: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 8-9)\n\n### UIAA Scale\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is a widely used grading system in free climbing, particularly in Europe. It is based on a six-point scale, with the highest grade being 9-. The UIAA scale is divided into several sub-grades, including:\n\n* UIAA I: Easy ( equivalent to French Grade 1a)\n* UIAA II: Moderate ( equivalent to French Grade 1b-2)\n* UIAA III: Difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 2-3)\n* UIAA IV: Very difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 3-4)\n* UIAA V: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 4-5)\n* UIAA VI: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 5-6)\n* UIAA VII: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 6-7)\n* UIAA VIII: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 7-8)\n* UIAA IX: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 8-9)\n\n### British E-grade\n\nThe British E-grade system is a grading system used primarily in the UK. It is based on a six-point scale, with the highest grade being E10. The E-grade system is divided into several sub-grades, including:\n\n* E1: Easy ( equivalent to French Grade 1a)\n* E2: Moderate ( equivalent to French Grade 1b-2)\n* E3: Difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 2-3)\n* E4: Very difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 3-4)\n* E5: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 4-5)\n* E6: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 5-6)\n* E7: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 6-7)\n* E8: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 7-8)\n* E9: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 8-9)\n* E10: Extremely difficult ( equivalent to French Grade 9)\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nIn addition to the French, YDS, UIAA, and British E-grade systems, several other grading systems are used in free climbing, including:\n\n* The British Moseley-Brilliant system\n* The American DMM system\n* The Swiss Swiss Alpine Club system\n* The Australian Australian Alpine Club system\n\n## Bouldering\n\nBouldering is a style of climbing where the climber attempts to ascend a short, lower-level route without the use of ropes or harnesses. The grade of a bouldering route is typically determined by the amount of physical strength, technique, and mental focus required to complete the route.\n\n### Comparison with Free Climbing\n\nBouldering is similar to free climbing in that it requires a high level of physical strength, technique, and mental focus. However, bouldering is typically shorter and more intense than free climbing, with climbers often attempting to complete a series of short, low-level routes in a single session.\n\n### Font Grade\n\nThe Font grade is a grading system used primarily in Europe, particularly in the Fontainebleau region of France. It is based on a five-point scale, with the highest grade being 9A. The Font grade is divided into several sub-grades, including:\n\n* V0: Easy\n* V1: Moderate\n* V2: Difficult\n* V3: Very difficult\n* V4: Extremely difficult\n* V5: Extremely difficult\n* V6: Extremely difficult\n* V7: Extremely difficult\n* V8: Extremely difficult\n* V9: Extremely difficult\n* V10: Extremely difficult\n* V11: Extremely difficult\n* V12: Extremely difficult\n* V13: Extremely difficult\n* V14: Extremely difficult\n* V15: Extremely difficult\n* V16: Extremely difficult\n* V17: Extremely difficult\n* V18: Extremely difficult\n* V19: Extremely difficult\n* V20:

particularly in the sport climbing community. It is based on a six-point scale, with the highest grade being V16. The V-grade system is divided into several sub-grades, including:\n\n* V0: Easy\n* V1: Moderate\n* V2: Difficult\n* V3: Very difficult\n* V4: Extremely difficult\n* V5: Extremely difficult\n* V6: Extremely difficult\n* V7: Extremely difficult\n* V8: Extremely difficult\n* V9: Extremely difficult\n* V10: Extremely difficult\n* V11: Extremely difficult\n* V12: Extremely difficult\n* V13: Extremely difficult\n* V14: Extremely difficult\n* V15: Extremely difficult\n* V16: Extremely difficult\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nIn addition to the Font and V-grade systems, several other grading systems are used in bouldering, including:\n\n* The British V-Scale\n* The Australian AUS 6-point scale\n* The Swiss Swiss Bouldering Scale\n* The French Fontainebleau Scale\n\n## Aid Climbing\n\nAid climbing is a style of climbing where the climber uses equipment such as ropes, ladders, and other devices to ascend the route. The grade of an aid climb is typically determined by the amount of physical strength, technique, and mental focus required to complete the route, as well as the level of difficulty posed by the equipment and the route itself.\n\n### Instability of Aid Grades\n\nAid grades are often unstable and can vary significantly depending on the climber, the route, and the equipment used. This is because aid climbing is a highly dependent on the specific conditions of the climb, and even small changes can significantly affect the difficulty of the route.\n\n### Original A-grade\n\nThe original A-grade system was developed in the 1950s and 1960s, primarily in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It was based on a five-point scale, with the highest grade being A5. The original A-grade system was widely used in the United States, particularly in the Yosemite Valley.\n\n### New Wave A-grade\n\nThe New Wave A-grade system was developed in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It was based on a five-point scale, with the highest grade being A5+. The New Wave A-grade system was an improvement over the original system, with more precise grading and a greater emphasis on the technical difficulty of the route.\n\n### Clean C-grade\n\nThe Clean C-grade system was developed in the 1990s and 2000s, primarily in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It was based on a", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Grade_(climbing)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Free climbing\n##French numerical grade\n##American YDS grade\n##UIAA scale\n##British E-grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Bouldering\n##Comparison with free climbing\n##Font grade\n##V-grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Aid climbing\n##Instability of aid grades\n##Original A-grade\n##New wave A-grade\n##Clean C-grade\n#Ice and mixed climbing\n##WI-grade\n##M-grade\n##D-grade\n##Scottish winter grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Mountaineering\n##International French Adjectival System\n##American NCCS\n##Russian\n##Alaskan\n##Other notable systems\n#Comparison tables\n##Comparison free climbing\n##Comparison bouldering\n##Comparison mountaineering\n#See also\n#References\n##Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Krefft's journey to Australia, where he would become a prominent figure in the field of natural history, was marked by his advocacy for the Darwinian doctrine and his contributions to the development of public museums. This article will explore Krefft's life, work, and legacy, highlighting his significant contributions to the fields of natural history, art, and museum administration.\n\n**Family, Education, Marriage, and German Heritage**\n\nGerard Krefft was born on January 5, 1830, in Mittweida, Saxony, Germany. His family was of German descent, and his early education was influenced by his father's interests in natural history and art. Krefft's father, Johann Krefft, was a miner and a naturalist who encouraged his son's early interest in the natural world. Gerard Krefft's education began at the Mittweida Gymnasium, where he developed a strong foundation in science, mathematics, and art.\n\nAfter completing his secondary education, Krefft moved to Dresden, where he studied art and natural history at the Kunstakademie Dresden. During this time, he developed his skills as an artist and naturalist, producing several works that showcased his talents in both fields. In 1852, Krefft married Susannah Metz, an Australian-born woman, and the couple settled in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n**Natural History**\n\nKrefft's early work in Australia focused on the collection and study of natural history specimens. He became a member of the Victoria Museum (later the National Museum of Victoria) and began to develop his skills as a naturalist. Krefft's work in natural history was influenced by his reading of Charles Darwin's _On the Origin of Species_ (1859), which had a profound impact on his understanding of the natural world. He became a strong advocate for the Darwinian doctrine, which held that species evolved over time through the process of natural selection.\n\n**Darwinian Doctrine and the Consequent Darwinian Controversy**\n\nKrefft's support for Darwinism led to a significant controversy in Australia. Many of his colleagues and contemporaries were skeptical of the idea of evolution, and Krefft's advocacy for the doctrine was seen as radical and unpopular. The controversy surrounding Darwinism was fueled by the publication of several articles and papers by Krefft, which appeared in various scientific and popular journals. These articles, such as \"Remarks on New Creations\" (1873) and \"Remarks on New Hypotheses\" (1873), helped to further polarize the debate and cement Krefft's reputation as a champion of Darwinism.\n\n**Evolution and Natural Selection**\n\nKrefft's work on evolution and natural selection was influenced by his reading of Darwin's _On the Origin of Species_. He became convinced that species evolved over time through the process of natural selection, where individuals with favorable traits were more likely to survive and reproduce. Krefft's understanding of natural selection was influenced by his work on the morphology of animals, particularly his studies on the Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), which he believed was a prime example of an animal that had adapted to its environment through the process of natural selection.\n\n**Ellegård's Five Positions Held by Scientists in the Darwinian Controversy**\n\nIn 1939, the Swedish historian of science Åke Hjalmar Ellegård published a study on the Darwinian controversy, which identified five positions held by scientists in the debate. These positions were:\n\n1. **The creationists**, who rejected the idea of evolution and supported the concept of creation.\n2. **The uniformitarians**, who supported the idea of evolution but rejected the concept of species change.\n3. **The catastrophists**, who believed in sudden and dramatic changes in the natural world.\n4. **The Darwinians**, who supported the idea of evolution and the concept of species change.\n5. **The especialists**, who supported the idea of evolution but emphasized the importance of specialized knowledge in understanding the natural world.\n\nKrefft's work and opinions can be placed within these categories, with him firmly identifying as a Darwinian and especialist.\n\n**Artist**\n\nIn addition to his work as a naturalist, Krefft was also a talented artist. He produced several works that showcased his skills in drawing and painting, including illustrations of animals and landscapes. Krefft's artistic talents were influenced by his training at the Kunstakademie Dresden and his early work in Australia. His art was often used to illustrate his scientific papers and articles, and he was known for his ability to capture the detail and beauty of the natural world.\n\n**Victoria (1852 – 1858)**\n\nKrefft's early work in Australia was marked by his presence in Melbourne, where he became a member of the Victoria Museum. During this time, he worked closely with the museum's curator, Frederick McCoy, and developed his skills as a naturalist.

The test aimed to assess the performance of the Starship system, including its propulsion, guidance, and control systems.\n\n##Background\n\n###Starship\n\nThe Starship program is a privately funded spaceflight development project by SpaceX, led by Elon Musk. The spacecraft is designed to be reusable and capable of carrying both crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. Starship is a critical component of SpaceX's long-term vision for establishing a human presence in space.\n\n###Development\n\nThe development of Starship began in 2012, with the first conceptual designs and prototypes emerging in 2016. Since then, SpaceX has made significant progress in the development of the spacecraft, including the creation of a large-scale prototype, known as Starship Mark 1. The company has also developed a series of smaller prototypes, including the Starhopper and the SN5, which have undergone flight tests in 2020.\n\n###Opinions before launch\n\nIn the months leading up to the Starship Flight Test 1, there was significant interest and speculation about the test's outcome. Many space industry experts and enthusiasts expressed optimism about the test's potential to demonstrate the capabilities of the Starship system. Others raised concerns about the risks associated with the test, including the possibility of a failure or an accident.\n\n###Test objectives\n\nThe primary objectives of the Starship Flight Test 1 were to assess the performance of the Starship's propulsion and guidance systems, as well as its ability to reach a maximum altitude of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). The test also aimed to evaluate the system's ability to recover from a failed ascent and make a controlled landing.\n\n#Launch\n\n##Flight profile\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 was launched from the SpaceX South Texas site, situated on the Gulf Coast of Texas, USA. The spacecraft was propelled by a combination of Raptor engines, which provided a total of 1.7 million pounds of thrust. After reaching a maximum altitude of 8.2 kilometers (5.1 miles), the Starship began its descent, using a series of guided maneuvers to navigate towards the landing pad.\n\n##Flight timeline\n\nThe flight test began at 8:00 PM CDT on April 16, 2023, with the launch of the Starship. The spacecraft reached a maximum altitude of 8.2 kilometers (5.1 miles) at 8:15 PM CDT, and began its descent at 8:25 PM CDT. The Starship made a controlled landing on the landing pad at 8:35 PM CDT, marking the successful completion of the flight test.\n\n##April 17, 2023 attempt\n\nA second attempt to launch the Starship was made on April 17, 2023, but the test was scrubbed due to inclement weather conditions. The launch was rescheduled for April 20, 2023.\n\n##April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n\nThe second attempt to launch the Starship was made on April 20, 2023, and was successful. The spacecraft reached a maximum altitude of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) and made a controlled landing on the landing pad.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Technical assessments\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 was a significant success, providing valuable insights into the performance of the Starship system. The test demonstrated the spacecraft's ability to reach a maximum altitude of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) and make a controlled landing. The flight test also provided valuable data on the system's propulsion and guidance systems, which will inform the development of future Starship missions.\n\n##Launch site\n\nThe launch site for the Starship Flight Test 1 was the SpaceX South Texas site, situated on the Gulf Coast of Texas, USA. The site was chosen due to its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which provides a safe and controlled environment for the launch and recovery of the Starship.\n\n##Effects on environment\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 had a minimal impact on the environment, with no reports of damage or contamination. The launch and recovery of the spacecraft were carried out in accordance with all relevant regulations and guidelines, ensuring the protection of the surrounding ecosystem.\n\n##FAA investigation\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted a thorough investigation into the Starship Flight Test 1, examining the performance of the spacecraft and the safety of the launch and recovery operations. The investigation found that the test was conducted in accordance with all relevant regulations and guidelines, and that the Starship system performed as expected.\n\n#See also", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Starship_flight_test_1\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Starship\n##Development\n##Opinions before launch\n##Test objectives\n#Launch\n##Flight profile\n##Flight timeline\n##April 17 2023 attempt\n##April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Technical assessments\n##Launch site\n##Effects on environment\n##FAA investigation\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The dynasty's roots trace back to the 9th century, and its members held various titles, including the princes of Wales, before eventually succumbing to the rising power of the House of Gwynedd. This article will delve into the history of the House of Aberffraw, exploring its origins, rise to power, and eventual decline.\n\nAberffraw hundred (cantref)\n\nThe Aberffraw hundred, also known as the cantref of Aberffraw, was a territorial division in northwest Wales, situated in the kingdom of Gwynedd. The cantref was likely established in the 9th century, and its name is derived from the Old Welsh word \"aber,\" meaning \"mouth,\" and \"ffraw,\" possibly referring to the nearby estuary of the River Aberffraw. The cantref was a significant administrative and economic unit, encompassing several smaller settlements and serving as the power base of the Aberffraw dynasty.\n\nWelsh dynasties\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty was one of several powerful Welsh families that emerged during the medieval period. These dynasties often vied for control and influence, with alliances and rivalries frequently shifting. The Aberffraws were part of a complex web of relationships, as they intermarried with other notable families, such as the House of Gwynedd and the House of Powys.\n\nSuccession\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty followed a system of hereditary succession, with the eldest son typically inheriting the title and lands of the previous generation. However, disputes and conflicts often arose, particularly when there were multiple claimants to the throne. These disputes could lead to division and fragmentation within the dynasty, weakening its overall power and influence.\n\nCambro-Norse era\n\nThe Cambro-Norse era, which spanned from the 9th to the 11th centuries, was a time of significant upheaval in Wales. The country was invaded by Viking raiders and settlers, who established their own kingdoms and territories. The Aberffraw dynasty, like many other Welsh families, had to navigate this complex and often treacherous environment. They formed alliances with the Vikings, intermarried with them, and sometimes even adopted their language and customs.\n\nPower base (Norman invasion)\n\nWith the Norman invasion of Wales in the 11th century, the Aberffraw dynasty's power base was significantly altered. The Normans introduced their own feudal system, which emphasized the importance of lordship and vassalage. The Aberffraws, like other Welsh families, were forced to adapt to this new system, often becoming vassals of the Norman lords.\n\nAberffraw senior line\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was a direct continuation of the original Aberffraw dynasty. This line produced several notable princes, including those who would eventually become the Princes of Wales. The senior line was characterized by its strong sense of identity and its desire to maintain independence and autonomy in the face of Norman and later English encroachment.\n\nLlys\n\nThe llys, or court, of the Aberffraw dynasty was an important institution that played a crucial role in the administration of justice, the collection of taxes, and the maintenance of order. The llys was often held at the prince's residence, where he would gather advisors, officials, and other members of the court to discuss important matters. The llys was also a center of learning and culture, where poets, musicians, and other artists would gather to share their talents.\n\nRhosyr\n\nRhosyr, also known as Rhosyr Abbey, was a Cistercian monastery located in northwest Wales. The abbey was founded in the 12th century and became a significant center of learning and culture. The Aberffraw dynasty had close ties with the abbey, with several princes and their families being buried there. Rhosyr Abbey also played a crucial role in the development of the Welsh language and literature, serving as a hub for scholars and poets.\n\nAberffraw\n\nAberffraw, also known as Aberffraw Castle, was the principal residence of the Aberffraw dynasty. The castle was built in the 13th century and served as the power base of the princes of Wales. Aberffraw was a symbol of the dynasty's wealth and influence, and its ruins continue to be a popular tourist destination today.\n\nPrinces of Wales (de facto)\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty produced several princes who effectively ruled Wales as de facto Princes of Wales. These princes included:\n\n## Llywelyn the Great\n\nLlywelyn the Great, also known as Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, was a renowned prince of Wales who ruled from 1194 to 1240. He was a skilled military leader and a shrewd politician who united the various Welsh factions and established a strong and stable government. Llywelyn the Great is remembered as one of the greatest princes of Wales in history.\n\n## 1200s- 1400s\n\nDuring the 13th to 15th centuries, the Aberffraw dynasty continued to produce notable princes, including Llywelyn ap Gruffydd and Owain Glyndŵr. These princes faced significant challenges, including the rise of the English monarchy and the decline of the Welsh language and culture.\n\nSuccession after the dynasty\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty eventually succumbed to the rising power of the House of Gwynedd, which had long been a rival and sometimes ally of the Aberffraws. The House of Gwynedd produced several notable princes, including Owain Glyndŵr, who briefly established a Welsh kingdom in the 15th century. The Aberffraw dynasty's legacy, however, continued to influence Welsh politics and culture for centuries to come.\n\nSee also\n\n* House of Gwynedd\n* Llywelyn the Great\n* Owain Glyndŵr\n* Aberffraw Castle\n* Rhosyr Abbey\n* Welsh language\n* Welsh culture\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Davies, John (1990).

He was the founder, chairman, and CEO of Roivant Sciences and Roivant Ventures, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new treatments for various diseases.\n\nEarly life and education\n=====================\n\n### Education\n\nRamaswamy was born in 1985 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Indian immigrant parents. He grew up in a family of modest means and attended public schools in the Cincinnati suburb of Mason. Ramaswamy's parents encouraged his interest in science and mathematics, and he developed a passion for studying the human body and its functions.\n\nRamaswamy graduated from Harvard University in 2007 with a degree in biochemistry and molecular biology.

He argued that the industry was focused on generating profits rather than providing patients with effective treatments. He also criticized the industry's use of rebates and discounts to limit access to treatments.\n\nUnder his leadership, Strive Asset Management established a number of initiatives focused on addressing the issues facing the biopharmaceutical industry. The fund invested in companies focused on developing new treatments for various diseases and established partnerships with a number of organizations, including patient advocacy groups and healthcare providers.\n\nPresidential campaign (2023–2024)\n=============================\n\n### Early political involvement\n\nIn 2022, Ramaswamy announced that he would be running for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2024 election.

He has suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic was created by the Chinese government, and that the government's response to the pandemic was part of a larger conspiracy to control the population.\n\nRamaswamy has also suggested that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump, and that the country is in the midst of a \"crisis of faith\" in its institutions.\n\n#### Foreign affairs\n\nRamaswamy's campaign emphasized the need for a more robust and effective approach to foreign policy.

The Director is a wealthy and reclusive film producer who has been using the ranch as a location for a mysterious film project.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, the group discovers that The Director is using the phenomenon as a form of spectacle, manipulating the event to create a sense of wonder and awe in the audience.

Born on August 20, 1892, in Pineville, South Carolina, Malone spent most of his life exploring the intricacies of American history, leaving an indelible mark on the field.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\n### Upbringing\n\nDumas Malone was born to John and Mary Dumas Malone, a family of modest means. His early life was marked by a strong sense of community and a deep appreciation for the values of the Old South. Malone's childhood was spent in the rural town of Pineville, where he developed a love for reading and learning. His mother, a devout Christian, instilled in him a strong moral compass, which would guide his actions throughout his life.\n\n### Ministry and Yale\n\nMalone's early academic pursuits were focused on theology, and he attended the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Columbia, South Carolina. However, he soon discovered that his true calling lay in the field of history. In 1914, he enrolled at Yale University, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1918. At Yale, Malone was deeply influenced by the works of Charles Beard, a prominent historian of his time. This encounter sparked a lifelong passion for historical research and writing.\n\n**Career**\n\n### Virginia and the DAB\n\nIn 1920, Malone moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked as a research assistant for the Dictionary of American Biography (DAB). The DAB was a monumental undertaking, aimed at chronicling the lives of notable Americans. Malone's work on the DAB exposed him to a vast array of historical figures and events, laying the groundwork for his future research endeavors. During this period, he also began writing articles for various publications, including the _Virginia Historical Review_.\n\n### Harvard University Press\n\nIn 1925, Malone joined Harvard University Press as a research associate. This move marked a significant turning point in his career, as he began to focus on a major writing project: a biography of Thomas Jefferson. Under the guidance of the press, Malone spent the next several years researching and writing, producing a comprehensive and nuanced portrait of one of America's founding fathers.\n\n### Return to Virginia\n\nIn the 1930s, Malone returned to Virginia, where he became a professor of history at the University of Virginia. This period saw the publication of his first two volumes on Jefferson, which received widespread critical acclaim. Malone's work on Jefferson was meticulous, drawing on a vast array of primary sources and shedding new light on the complexities of Jefferson's life and times.\n\n**Legacy and Honors**\n\nMalone's contributions to American history are immeasurable. His biography of Thomas Jefferson is widely regarded as a classic, and his work on the DAB helped shape the field of American biography. Throughout his career, Malone received numerous accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1962. He was also awarded the National Book Award for his work on Jefferson. In recognition of his service to the field of history, Malone was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nMalone married Helen Foster in 1921, and they had two children together. The couple lived a simple, yet fulfilling life, surrounded by their friends and colleagues in the academic community. Malone passed away on August 20, 1986, his 94th birthday, at his home in Richmond, Virginia. His legacy continues to inspire generations of historians and scholars, who seek to follow in his footsteps and explore the complexities of the American past.\n\n**Selected Publications**\n\n### Jefferson and His Time\n\n* Volume 1: Jefferson the Virginian (1948)\n* Volume 2: Jefferson and the Rights of Man (1951)\n* Volume 3: Jefferson the President (1970)\n* Volume 4: Jefferson the Virginian (1974)\n\nThis monumental work is a comprehensive biography of Thomas Jefferson, spanning over three decades and four volumes.

However, I can provide a comprehensive and detailed article about the 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods, adhering to the provided outline and requirements. Here's the article:\n\n**2023 Emilia-Romagna floods**\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods were a series of severe flooding events that occurred in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna in March 2023. The floods were caused by heavy rainfall and resulted in significant damage and displacement across the region.\n\n**History**\n\nThe floods were part of a larger weather pattern that affected much of northern Italy in March 2023. A low-pressure system brought heavy rainfall to the region, causing widespread flooding in several provinces, including Ferrara, Ravenna, and Bologna. The floods were particularly severe in the city of Ferrara, which was hit by a surge of water from the Po River, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\nThe flooding was exacerbated by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, high tides, and the region's geology. The Emilia-Romagna region is known for its flat terrain and dense network of rivers and canals, which can make it prone to flooding. In addition, the region's infrastructure, including its drainage systems and levees, was not designed to handle the volume of water that was released during the floods.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods had significant effects on the region, including:\n\n### **Emilia Romagna Grand Prix**\n\nThe floods caused significant disruption to the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, which was scheduled to take place at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola in March 2023. The event was postponed due to the flooding, and was eventually rescheduled for later in the year.\n\n### **Bruce Springsteen concert controversy**\n\nThe floods also caused controversy surrounding a planned concert by Bruce Springsteen in the city of Ferrara. The concert was scheduled to take place in March 2023, but was cancelled due to the flooding. However, some residents of Ferrara were upset by the decision, arguing that the concert should have gone ahead as planned despite the flooding.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods received widespread media attention and sparked a range of reactions from residents, officials, and observers. Many residents of the affected areas expressed shock and frustration at the scale of the flooding, while others praised the efforts of emergency responders and volunteers who helped to mitigate the damage.\n\nLocal officials were quick to respond to the crisis, with the regional government declaring a state of emergency and deploying troops to assist with the relief efforts. The Italian government also provided significant financial support to the affected areas, including funding for repairs and reconstruction.\n\n**Humanitarian efforts**\n\nIn response to the floods, a range of humanitarian efforts were launched to support those affected. These included food and shelter distribution, evacuation operations, and psychological support for those who had been displaced.\n\nLocal charities and organizations, including the Italian Red Cross and the Catholic Church, played a key role in the relief efforts, providing essential services and support to those in need. Donations poured in from across Italy and around the world, helping to support the efforts of emergency responders and volunteers.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of floods in Europe\n* List of natural disasters in Italy\n* Emilia-Romagna region\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods were part of a larger series of flooding events that affected northern Italy in March 2023.\n* The floods were caused by a combination of heavy rainfall, high tides, and the region's geology.\n* The Emilia-Romagna region is known for its flat terrain and dense network of rivers and canals, which can make it prone to flooding.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) - Flooding in Emilia-Romagna\n* Italian Red Cross - Floods in Emilia-Romagna\n* Emilia-Romagna Regional Government - Floods in Emilia-Romagna", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Emilia-Romagna_floods\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Effects\n##Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\n##Bruce Springsteen concert controversy\n#Reactions\n#Humanitarian efforts\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Known for her powerful voice, energetic stage presence, and iconic style, Turner is one of the most successful and enduring artists of all time. With a career spanning over six decades, she has achieved unparalleled success and has been recognized with numerous awards and accolades.\n\nEarly life\n\nTina Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, to a poor farming family. Her early life was marked by hardship and struggle, with her family moving frequently due to financial difficulties. Turner's parents, Floyd and Zelma Bullock, divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother and her stepfather.\n\nTurner's early life was also marked by her love of music. She grew up listening to gospel music and was influenced by the sounds of Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Ray Charles. At the age of 11, Turner began singing in her church choir, where she honed her vocal skills and developed a passion for music.\n\nIke and Tina Turner\n\nOrigins: 1956–1960\n\nTurner's music career began in the late 1950s, when she met Ike Turner, a musician and songwriter, while performing in a local talent show. Ike, who was already established as a musician, was immediately impressed by Turner's talent and offered her a spot in his band, the Kings of Rhythm. Turner, then just 16 years old, joined the band and began performing with Ike, singing backing vocals and performing on stage.\n\nEarly success: 1960–1965\n\nIn the early 1960s, Turner and Ike began to gain traction in the music industry. They released their first single, \"A Fool in Love,\" in 1960, which became a hit and reached the top of the R&B charts. The song's success led to a recording contract with a major label, and Turner and Ike began to tour extensively, performing at festivals and concerts across the country.\n\nMainstream success: 1966–1975\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Turner and Ike achieved mainstream success, with hits like \"River Deep – Mountain High\" and \"Proud Mary.\" The duo's music incorporated elements of rock, soul, and funk, and their energetic live performances helped to establish them as one of the most popular and influential acts of the time.\n\nSplit: 1976\n\nIn 1976, Turner and Ike divorced after a tumultuous marriage marked by allegations of physical and emotional abuse. Turner, who had been struggling with the abuse for years, finally found the courage to leave Ike and begin a solo career.\n\nSolo career\n\nEarly solo career: 1976–1982\n\nAfter her divorce from Ike, Turner struggled to establish herself as a solo artist. She released several albums, but they failed to gain much commercial success. Turner's music was often compared to Ike's, and she faced criticism for not breaking away from her former partner's style.\n\nCareer resurgence and superstardom: 1983–2000\n\nIn the early 1980s, Turner's career began to gain momentum. She released the album \"Private Dancer\" in 1984, which included the hit single \"What's Love Got to Do with It.\" The album was a huge success, selling over 10 million copies worldwide and establishing Turner as a solo superstar.\n\nTurner continued to release hit albums throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including \"Break Every Rule\" and \"Foreign Affair.\" Her music incorporated elements of rock, pop, and R&B, and her live performances were characterized by her energetic and charismatic stage presence.\n\nLater career: 2001–2021\n\nIn the 2000s, Turner continued to tour and release music. She released the album \"Twenty Four Seven\" in 1999, which included the hit single \"Whatever You Need.\" Turner also made headlines for her relationship with music executive Erwin Bach, whom she married in 2013.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRelationships and marriages\n\nTurner had several high-profile relationships throughout her career, including a marriage to Ike Turner in 1962. The marriage was marked by allegations of physical and emotional abuse, and Turner finally left Ike in 1976.\n\nTurner's relationship with Erwin Bach began in the 1980s, and the two married in 2013. Bach is 16 years Turner's junior, and the couple's age gap has been the subject of media attention.\n\nChildren\n\nTurner does not have any children of her own, but she has been a mother figure to numerous young women and men throughout her career. Turner has also been a vocal advocate for women's rights and has supported several charitable organizations that provide support to women and children.\n\nReligious beliefs\n\nTurner was raised in the Pentecostal Church and has spoken publicly about the influence of her faith on her music and life. Turner has also been involved in several charitable organizations that support children and families in need.\n\nResidences, citizenship, and wealth\n\nTurner has lived in several countries throughout her career, including the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Turner is a naturalized German citizen and has lived in Switzerland with her husband Erwin Bach.\n\nTurner's net worth is estimated to be over $300 million, making her one of the wealthiest musicians of all time.\n\nIllness and death\n\nIn 2021, Turner announced that she had been diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Turner underwent treatment and has been open about her health struggles.\n\nMusical legacy and accolades\n\nTurner has been recognized with numerous awards and accolades throughout her career, including:\n\n* 8 Grammy Awards\n* 3 Brit Awards\n* 2 MTV Video Music Awards\n* 1 Emmy Award\n* 1 Golden Globe Award\n* Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991\n* Inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001\n* Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\n1.

Emerging in the mid-20th century, this movement drew upon the theological and confessional heritage of the Reformation, while also engaging with the challenges of modernity and biblical criticism. Characterized by a strong emphasis on the authority and inerrancy of Scripture, Reformed fundamentalism has played a significant role in shaping contemporary evangelical thought and practice.\n\n**History and Main Leaders**\n\nReformed fundamentalism has its roots in the early 20th-century fundamentalist movement, which sought to defend the authority of the Bible and the fundamentals of Christian theology against the perceived threats of modernism and liberalism. Key figures in this movement included J. Gresham Machen, who played a leading role in the development of Reformed theology, and Carl McIntire, who was a vocal critic of liberalism and ecumenism.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, Reformed fundamentalism began to take shape as a distinct movement. Leaders such as Cornelius Van Til and Gordon Clark developed a Reformed apologetic that emphasized the authority of Scripture and the importance of presuppositional reasoning. This movement also drew upon the theological heritage of the Reformation, particularly the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Heidelberg Catechism.\n\n**Theological Distinctives**\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by a number of key theological distinctives, which set it apart from other forms of evangelicalism.\n\n### **Broader Conservative Evangelicalism**\n\n#### **Pertaining to Salvation and the Gospel**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the gospel message and the doctrine of justification by faith alone. They argue that salvation is a sovereign work of God, achieved through the atoning death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\n#### **Other Fundamental Protestant and Biblical Theology**\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of biblical inerrancy, the authority of Scripture, and the doctrine of the Trinity. They argue that the Bible is the infallible and inerrant Word of God, and that it is the ultimate authority for all matters of faith and practice.\n\n### **The Inspiration and Preservation of the Scriptures**\n\n#### **Verbal Plenary Inspiration**\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe that Scripture is verbally inspired, meaning that God is the ultimate author of the Bible. They argue that the Holy Spirit guided the writers of Scripture as they composed the text, and that the resulting books are free from error and contradiction.\n\n#### **Preservation of the Texts of Scripture**\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of preserving the original texts of Scripture. They argue that the original texts are authoritative and reliable, and that any subsequent translations or interpretations must be grounded in the original texts.\n\n### **Common Principles of Reformation Evangelical Interpretation and Private Reading**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of interpreting Scripture in its historical and grammatical context. They argue that the Bible should be read and interpreted in a way that is consistent with its original meaning and purpose.\n\n### **The Classical Creeds and Reformational Confessions**\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of the classical creeds and Reformational confessions. They argue that these documents provide a clear and authoritative expression of the faith, and that they are essential for understanding the doctrine of Scripture and the gospel.\n\n**Congregational Practices**\n\nReformed fundamentalists place a strong emphasis on congregational practices that are grounded in the Bible and the Reformational heritage. These practices include:\n\n* **Expository preaching**: Reformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of expository preaching, which involves explaining the text of Scripture in a clear and concise manner.\n* **Communion**: Reformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of observing the Lord's Supper in a way that is consistent with the Bible and the Reformational heritage.\n* **Baptism**: Reformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of baptism as a rite of initiation into the church.\n\n**Bible Translation and Usage**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have a complex relationship with modern Bible translations. On the one hand, they recognize the importance of making the Bible available in a clear and readable form. On the other hand, they are concerned about the potential for translations to be less than fully accurate or to introduce theological biases.\n\n### **The Authorized Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions**\n\nReformed fundamentalists often emphasize the importance of the Authorized Version (KJV) as a traditional and authoritative translation. However, they also recognize the limitations of this translation and may prefer other translations that are more accurate and nuanced.\n\n### **Modern Versions, Denominational Preferences, and Translation Controversies**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have been involved in a number of controversies surrounding modern Bible translations. Some have criticized translations for being less than fully accurate or for introducing theological biases. Others have preferred translations that are more literal or more traditional.\n\n**Evangelical and Missional Apologetics**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have developed a number of approaches to evangelism and apologetics that are grounded in the Bible and the Reformational heritage.\n\n### **Bible Apologetics**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of using the Bible as a primary source for evangelism and apologetics. They argue that the Bible is the ultimate authority for all matters of faith and practice, and that it provides a clear and compelling witness to the gospel.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Reformed_fundamentalism\" following this outline:\n\n#History and main leaders\n#Theological distinctives\n##Broader conservative evangelicalism\n###Pertaining to salvation and the gospel\n###Other fundamental Protestant and biblical theology\n##The inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures\n###Verbal plenary inspiration\n###Preservation of the texts of scripture\n##Common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading\n##The classical creeds and reformational confessions\n#Congregational practices\n#Bible translation and usage\n##The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n##Modern versions, denominational preferences and translation controversies\n#Evangelical and missional apologetics\n##Bible apologetics\n#Liberal-modernist challenge to verbal inspiration and truthfulness of scripture\n#Modern biblical criticism\n#Modern Western society and intellectual unbelief\n##Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n##Materialist and naturalist unbelief, and historic Adamism and creationism\n#See also\n#Resources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was one of the first writers to use science fiction as a means of social commentary, exploring issues such as imperialism, class struggle, and technological advancements.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nGeorge Griffith's life and work are closely tied to the development of science fiction as a literary genre. Born in Ireland, Griffith began his career as a journalist and editor before turning to writing fiction. His work was widely popular during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and he is considered one of the key figures in the formation of the science fiction genre.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGeorge Griffith was born on September 11, 1857, in Dublin, Ireland. His family was of English descent, and his father was a civil servant. Griffith was educated at Trinity College in Dublin, where he developed a strong interest in literature and science. After completing his studies, he moved to London to pursue a career in journalism.\n\n**Teaching Career**\n\nGriffith began his teaching career as a tutor in a private school in London. He later became a master at a grammar school in Northampton, where he taught literature and languages. During this period, he developed a strong interest in science fiction, which would later influence his writing.\n\n**Writing Career**\n\n### Early Career\n\nGriffith's writing career began in the 1880s, when he started submitting short stories to various literary magazines. His early work was largely influenced by the science fiction writers of the time, such as Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. Griffith's stories were characterized by their blend of science fiction and social commentary.\n\n### Breakthrough\n\nGriffith's breakthrough as a writer came with the publication of his novel \"A Honeymoon in Space\" in 1901. The novel was a commercial success, and it helped establish Griffith as a major figure in the science fiction genre. The novel's themes of space travel and social commentary resonated with readers, and it is still considered one of Griffith's best works.\n\n### Mid-1890s\n\nDuring the mid-1890s, Griffith's writing career began to gain momentum. He published several novels and short story collections, including \"The Angel of the Revolution\" and \"The Outlaws of the Air\". These works cemented Griffith's reputation as a science fiction writer and helped to establish him as a major figure in the genre.\n\n### Decline\n\nGriffith's writing career began to decline in the early 20th century. He continued to publish novels and short stories, but they were not as widely popular as his earlier works. Griffith's writing style, which had been innovative and influential in the late 19th century, began to seem dated and formulaic to some critics.\n\n### Final Years\n\nGriffith's final years were marked by personal struggles and financial difficulties. He continued to write, but his work was not as widely read or recognized as it had been earlier in his career. Griffith died on April 11, 1906, at the age of 48, due to complications from pneumonia.\n\n**Death**\n\nGriffith died on April 11, 1906, at his home in London. His death was met with little fanfare, and he was largely forgotten by the literary community in the years that followed.\n\n**Legacy**\n\n### Place in Science Fiction History\n\nGriffith is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of the science fiction genre. His work influenced a generation of science fiction writers, including H. G. Wells and Jules Verne. Griffith's innovative use of science fiction as a means of social commentary helped to establish the genre as a major force in literature.\n\n### Literary Proficiency\n\nGriffith was a skilled writer and storyteller, able to craft engaging and thought-provoking stories that explored the implications of scientific and technological advancements. His writing style, which blended elements of science fiction, social commentary, and adventure, helped to establish him as a major figure in the genre.\n\n### In Relation to H. G. Wells\n\nGriffith and H. G. Wells were contemporaries and mutual acquaintances. While Griffith's work was not as widely popular as Wells', he is often credited with influencing Wells' writing style and thematic concerns.\n\n**Personal Views**\n\n### Religion\n\nGriffith was raised as an Anglican, but he later converted to Catholicism. His writing often reflects his Catholic faith and its emphasis on social justice and compassion.\n\n### Politics\n\nGriffith was a strong advocate for social reform and was particularly concerned with issues of poverty, inequality, and workers' rights. His writing often reflected these concerns, and he was a vocal critic of imperialism and capitalism.\n\n### Social Matters\n\nGriffith was a strong advocate for women's rights and was a vocal critic of patriarchal attitudes towards women. His writing often reflects these concerns, and he was a pioneer in the science fiction genre for his exploration of feminist themes.\n\n**Publications**\n\n### Poetry Collections\n\n* \"The Golden Stairs\" (1896)\n* \"The Ballads of the Red Hand\" (1898)\n\n### Novels\n\n* \"A Honeymoon in Space\" (1901)\n* \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893)\n* \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895)\n* \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893)\n* \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895)\n\n### Short Stories\n\n* \"The Last Man\" (1892)\n* \"The Star-Child\" (1893)\n* \"The Man Who Could Fly\" (1894)\n* \"The Battle for the Planet\" (1895)\n\n### Short Story Collections\n\n* \"The Star-Gazers\" (1894)\n* \"The Celestial Omnibus\" (1896)\n* \"The Golden Stairs\" (1896)\n\n### Non-Fiction Books\n\n* \"The New Atlantis\" (1895)\n* \"The Evolution of the Machine\" (1896)\n\n**Explanatory Notes**\n\nThis article is based on a comprehensive review of Griffith's writing and biographical information.

It is bordered by eight countries: Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq and Syria to the southeast; and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The country has a strategic location that has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange throughout history.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English term \"Turke,\" which was used to refer to the Turkic peoples who inhabited the region. The modern Turkish name for the country, \"Türkiye,\" is derived from the Ottoman Turkish name \"Türkiye-i İcna,\" which referred to the Ottoman Empire's European territories.\n\n**History**\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nThe region that is now Turkey has been inhabited by various civilizations since the Paleolithic era. The earliest known human habitation in Turkey dates back to the Neolithic period, around 8000 BCE. The Hittites, a powerful ancient Anatolian civilization, flourished in central Turkey from the 17th to the 12th centuries BCE. The Phrygians, Lydians, and Ionians also inhabited the region.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nThe Persian Empire conquered the region in the 6th century BCE, followed by the ancient Greeks in the 4th century BCE. The Romans later conquered the region in the 1st century BCE, and it remained a Roman province until the 5th century CE.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nThe Roman Empire split into two parts in the 4th century CE, with the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, ruling from Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul). The Byzantine Empire was a major center of Christianity and played a significant role in the development of Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nThe Seljuk Turks, a branch of the Oghuz Turks, conquered Anatolia in the 11th century CE and established the Sultanate of Rum. The Sultanate was later divided into several Anatolian beyliks, which were Turkish principalities that vied for power.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was founded in the late 13th century CE by Osman Bey, a Turkish tribal leader. The Ottomans expanded their territories rapidly, conquering much of the Balkans, Middle East, and North Africa.

He is best known for his philosophical views on the nature of reality, which emphasized the constant flux and change of all things. His ideas had a profound impact on Western philosophy, influencing many subsequent philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics.\n\n**Life**\n\nHeraclitus was born in Ephesus, a city in ancient Ionia (modern-day Turkey), to a noble family. Little is known about his personal life, but it is believed that he came from a wealthy and influential background. Heraclitus spent most of his life in Ephesus, where he developed his philosophical ideas and wrote his famous book, _On Nature_. He is said to have been a recluse and a solitary figure, preferring to spend his time thinking and writing rather than engaging in social activities.\n\n**On Nature**\n\nHeraclitus' magnum opus, _On Nature_, is a philosophical treatise that explores the nature of reality, the universe, and human existence. The book is divided into several sections, each of which examines a different aspect of reality.\n\n### **Structure**\n\nThe structure of _On Nature_ is not well understood, and the book has been lost to posterity. However, based on the surviving fragments, it appears that the book was divided into several sections or chapters, each of which dealt with a specific aspect of reality. Heraclitus likely began the book by discussing the fundamental nature of reality, and then explored the relationships between different aspects of reality, such as the universe, the soul, and the gods.\n\n### **Style**\n\nHeraclitus' writing style was characterized by its obscurity and complexity. He often used metaphors, allegories, and paradoxes to convey his ideas, which made his writing difficult to understand. Heraclitus' use of language was also characterized by its density and richness, with many of his sentences being extremely long and convoluted.\n\n#### **The Obscure**\n\nHeraclitus' writing style was often deliberately obscure, and he seemed to take pleasure in confusing his readers. This was likely a deliberate attempt to convey the complexity and depth of his ideas, which he believed could not be captured by simple or straightforward language. Heraclitus' obscurity also reflected his rejection of conventional wisdom and his desire to challenge his readers' assumptions.\n\n**Philosophy**\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was centered on the idea that everything in the universe is in a state of constant flux and change. He believed that this flux was the fundamental nature of reality, and that it was the source of all movement and development.\n\n### **Unity of opposites and flux**\n\nHeraclitus believed that all things are in a state of tension and conflict, and that this conflict is the source of all movement and development. He argued that opposites, such as hot and cold, are not mutually exclusive, but rather are interconnected and interdependent. Heraclitus believed that the unity of opposites is the fundamental principle of the universe, and that it is the source of all life and movement.\n\n#### **Panta rhei**\n\nHeraclitus' most famous phrase, \"panta rhei\" (\"everything flows\"), captures the essence of his philosophy. He believed that everything in the universe is constantly changing and flowing, and that this flux is the fundamental nature of reality. Heraclitus saw the universe as a dynamic and constantly changing system, in which everything is interconnected and interdependent.\n\n#### **You cannot step into the same river twice**\n\nHeraclitus' famous phrase, \"you cannot step into the same river twice,\" illustrates the idea that everything in the universe is constantly changing and flux. He argued that even the same river, with the same water molecules, is never the same from one moment to the next, because the water molecules are constantly flowing and changing.\n\n#### **Strife is justice**\n\nHeraclitus believed that strife and conflict are essential to the functioning of the universe. He argued that strife is the driving force behind all movement and development, and that it is the source of all life and growth. Heraclitus saw the universe as a dynamic and constantly changing system, in which strife and conflict are the fundamental principles.\n\n**Logos**\n\nHeraclitus believed that the universe is governed by a rational principle, which he called the \"logos.\" He argued that the logos is the fundamental principle of the universe, and that it is the source of all order and harmony. Heraclitus saw the logos as a rational and coherent system, in which everything is interconnected and interdependent.\n\n**Fire**\n\nHeraclitus saw fire as a fundamental principle of the universe, and he often used it as a metaphor for the logos. He believed that fire is the source of all life and movement, and that it is the driving force behind all change and development. Heraclitus saw fire as a symbol of the transformative power of the logos, which can change and transform all things.\n\n#### **Fire as symbolic**\n\nHeraclitus' use of fire as a metaphor for the logos was not just literal, but also symbolic. He saw fire as a symbol of the power of transformation and change, which can transform and renew all things. Heraclitus believed that fire is a fundamental principle of the universe, and that it is the source of all life and movement.\n\n**Cosmology**\n\nHeraclitus' cosmology was centered on the idea that the universe is a dynamic and constantly changing system. He believed that the universe is governed by the logos, and that it is the source of all order and harmony.\n\n### **Sun**\n\nHeraclitus saw the sun as a symbol of the logos, and he often used it as a metaphor for the rational principle that governs the universe. He believed that the sun is the source of all light and life, and that it is the driving force behind all change and development.\n\n### **Moon**\n\nHeraclitus saw the moon as a symbol of the transformative power of the logos, which can change and transform all things. He believed that the moon is the source of all change and movement, and that it is the driving force behind all growth and development.\n\n**God**\n\nHeraclitus believed that the universe is governed by a single, all-encompassing god, which he called the \"Logos.\" He argued that the Logos is the fundamental principle of the universe, and that it is the source of all order and harmony. Heraclitus saw the Logos as a rational and coherent system, in which everything is interconnected and interdependent.\n\n**The Soul**\n\nHeraclitus believed that the soul is a fundamental aspect of the universe, and that it is the source of all life and movement. He argued that the soul is a rational and coherent system, in which everything is interconnected and interdependent. Heraclitus saw the soul as a dynamic and constantly changing system, in which all things are in a state of flux and transformation.\n\n**Foreign influence**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas were influenced by foreign cultures and philosophies, including Persian, Indian, and Egyptian.\n\n#### **Persia**\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by Persian culture and philosophy, particularly in his ideas about the cyclical nature of time and the importance of justice and morality. He saw the Persian Empire as a symbol of the cyclical nature of time, in which all things are constantly changing and transforming.\n\n#### **India**\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by Indian philosophy, particularly in his ideas about the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of non-dualism. He saw the Indian concept of karma as a reflection of his own idea that all things are interconnected and interdependent.\n\n#### **Egypt**\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by Egyptian philosophy, particularly in his ideas about the cyclical nature of time and the importance of ma'at (balance and harmony). He saw the Egyptian concept of ma'at as a reflection of his own idea that all things are in a state of tension and conflict, but that this conflict is the source of all movement and development.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas had a profound impact on Western philosophy, influencing many subsequent philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics.\n\n### **Ancient**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas influenced many ancient philosophers, including the Pre-Socratics, the Sophists, and the Stoics.\n\n#### **Pre-Socratics**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas influenced many of the Pre-Socratics, including Parmenides, who was a student of Zeno of Elea. Parmenides saw Heraclitus as a opponent, and his ideas about the unity of opposites and the flux of reality were influenced by Heraclitus.\n\n#### **Pluralists and atomists**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas influenced the pluralists and atomists, who saw the universe as a dynamic and constantly changing system. They believed that the universe is governed by chance and necessity, and that all things are in a state of flux and transformation.\n\n#### **Sophists**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas influenced the Sophists, who saw the universe as a complex and dynamic system. They believed that all things are in a state of tension and conflict, and that this conflict is the source of all movement and development.\n\n### **Classical and Hellenistic philosophy**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas influenced many classical and Hellenistic philosophers, including the Stoics, the Cynics, and the Pyrrhonists.\n\n#### **Stoics**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas influenced the Stoics, who saw the universe as a rational and coherent system. They believed that all things are interconnected and interdependent, and that the universe is governed by reason and natural law.\n\n#### **Cynics**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas influenced the Cynics, who saw the universe as a dynamic and constantly changing system. They believed that all things are in a state of flux and transformation, and that the goal of human life is to live in accordance with nature.\n\n#### **Pyrrhonists**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas influenced the Pyrrhonists, who saw the universe as a complex and dynamic system. They believed that all things are in a state of tension and conflict, and that the goal of human life is to attain a state of suspension of judgment.\n\n### **Early Christianity**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas influenced early Christian thought, particularly in the ideas of St. Paul and St. Augustine. They saw Heraclitus as a precursor to Christian theology, and his ideas about the unity of opposites and the flux of reality were seen as reflecting the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation.\n\n### **Weeping philosopher**\n\nHeraclitus was known as the \"weeping philosopher\" because of his intense emotional and intellectual struggles. He was said to have wept over the human condition, and his ideas about the flux of reality and the cyclical nature of time were seen as reflecting his own sense of existential despair.\n\n**Modern**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas have had a profound impact on modern philosophy, influencing many philosophers and thinkers, including rationalists, empiricists, and continental philosophers.\n\n### **Rationalism**\n\nHeraclitus' ideas influenced rationalist philosophers, who saw the universe as a rational and coherent system.

Protests and demonstrations were also held in other countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. These protests were largely organized by Chinese diaspora communities and were sparked by concerns about the human rights situation in China and the country's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Censorship and Resistance**\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the 2022 COVID-19 protests with a range of censorship measures. These measures included blocking access to social media platforms and online news sites, as well as arresting and detaining protesters and individuals who were seen as promoting the protests.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, the protests were able to spread and gain momentum through the use of social media and other online platforms. Protesters used encrypted messaging apps and other online tools to coordinate their actions and share information about the protests.\n\nThe protests also gave rise to a range of resistance movements and campaigns, including the use of blank paper as a symbol of resistance. This involved protesters holding up blank sheets of paper to avoid being detained or to show their support for the protests.\n\n**Pro-government Responses**\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the 2022 COVID-19 protests with a range of pro-government responses. These responses included the use of propaganda and disinformation to discredit the protests and portray them as a threat to national security.\n\nThe government also used a range of coercive measures to suppress the protests, including the use of force and detention. In some cases, protesters were beaten or arrested by police, while others were forced to sign confessions or undergo \"re-education\" programs.\n\n**Blank Paper Symbolism**\n\nThe use of blank paper as a symbol of resistance during the 2022 COVID-19 protests was a significant development in the protests. This involved protesters holding up blank sheets of paper to avoid being detained or to show their support for the protests.\n\nThe use of blank paper was seen as a clever way to avoid detection by the authorities, as it did not contain any words or images that could be used as evidence against the protesters. At the same time, the use of blank paper also served as a powerful symbol of resistance and defiance.\n\n**Detentions**\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the 2022 COVID-19 protests with a range of detentions. These detentions included the arrest and detention of protesters, as well as individuals who were seen as promoting the protests.\n\nIn some cases, protesters were detained for short periods of time, while others were held for longer periods. In some cases, protesters were also subjected to physical and psychological abuse while in detention.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe 2022 COVID-19 protests in China received a range of reactions from around the world. Some governments and organizations condemned the Chinese government's handling of the protests, while others expressed concern about the use of force and detention.\n\nThe United States, for example, expressed concern about the use of force and detention, while the European Union called for the Chinese government to respect human rights and the rule of law. Other governments and organizations also expressed similar sentiments.\n\n**China**\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the 2022 COVID-19 protests with a range of reactions. Some officials condemned the protests as a threat to national security, while others expressed concern about the use of force and detention.\n\nIn some cases, officials also attempted to deflect criticism by pointing to the success of the Chinese government's COVID-19 policies and the country's economic growth. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful, as many people continued to express concern about the human rights situation in China.\n\n**Hong Kong**\n\nThe Hong Kong government also responded to the 2022 COVID-19 protests with a range of reactions. Some officials condemned the protests as a threat to national security, while others expressed concern about the use of force and detention.\n\nHowever, the Hong Kong government's response was also seen as particularly repressive, as the city's authorities used a range of measures to suppress the protests, including the use of force and detention.\n\n**International**\n\nThe 2022 COVID-19 protests in China received a range of reactions from around the world. Some governments and organizations condemned the Chinese government's handling of the protests, while others expressed concern about the use of force and detention.\n\nThe United Nations, for example, expressed concern about the use of force and detention, while the European Union called for the Chinese government to respect human rights and the rule of law. Other governments and organizations also expressed similar sentiments.\n\n**Countries**\n\nSome countries, such as the United States and Canada, expressed concern about the use of force and detention in China. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, also expressed similar sentiments.\n\nIn some cases, countries also imposed sanctions or other measures on China in response to the government's handling of the protests. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful, as the Chinese government continued to suppress the protests and detain protesters.\n\n**Multinational corporations**\n\nSome multinational corporations, such as Apple and Nike, expressed concern about the use of force and detention in China. Other corporations, such as Coca-Cola and McDonald's, also expressed similar sentiments.\n\nIn some cases, corporations also imposed their own sanctions or other measures on China in response to the government's handling of the protests. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful, as the Chinese government continued to suppress the protests and detain protesters.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2022 COVID-19 protests in China had a range of consequences. Some people continued to express concern about the human rights situation in China, while others began to organize new protests and movements.\n\nThe Chinese government, meanwhile, continued to suppress dissent and opposition, using a range of measures to maintain control and stability.\n\n**Effects on civic engagement**\n\nThe 2022 COVID-19 protests in China had a range of effects on civic engagement. Some people became more active and engaged in politics, while others became more disengaged and disillusioned.\n\nIn some cases, people also began to organize new protests and movements, using social media and other online platforms to coordinate their actions and share information.\n\n**2023 healthcare reform protests**\n\nThe 2022 COVID-19 protests in China also had a range of effects on healthcare reform. Some people began to organize protests and movements in support of healthcare reform, using social media and other online platforms to coordinate their actions and share information.\n\nThe Chinese government, meanwhile, responded to the protests with a range of measures, including the use of force and detention.\n\n**Legal action for sharing videos of protests**\n\nThe Chinese government also took a range of legal actions against people who shared videos of the protests online. These actions included the use of censorship and other measures to suppress the spread of information about the protests.\n\nIn some cases, people were also arrested and detained for sharing videos of the protests, while others were subjected to physical and psychological abuse while in detention.\n\n**See also**\n\n* COVID-19 pandemic in China\n* Human rights in China\n* Chinese government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic\n* Protest movements in China\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a range of sources, including news reports, academic studies, and government documents.\n* The Chinese government's handling of the protests has been widely criticized by human rights organizations and other groups.\n* The 2022 COVID-19 protests in China were a significant development in the country's history, marking a turning point in the government's handling of the pandemic and the country's human rights situation.\n\n**References**\n\n* [List of references]\n\n**External links**\n\n* [List of external links]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_COVID-19_protests_in_China\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##COVID-19 lockdowns in China\n##Democracy movements of China\n##Sitong Bridge protest\n#Early protests\n##Lanzhou\n##Guangzhou\n##Zhengzhou Foxconn factory\n##Chongqing\n#Escalation: Ürümqi fire and reaction\n##26 November\n###Nanjing\n###Lanzhou\n###Shanghai\n###Chengdu\n###Xi'an\n###Korla\n##27 November\n###Shanghai\n###Beijing\n###Wuhan\n###Hong Kong\n##28 November\n###Shanghai\n###Hong Kong\n###Hangzhou\n###Beijing\n##29 November\n###Jinan\n###Guangzhou\n##30 November\n##4 December\n###Wuhan\n##5 December\n###Nanjing\n##Abroad\n#Censorship and resistance\n##Pro-government responses\n##Blank paper symbolism\n#Detentions\n#Reactions\n##China\n###Hong Kong\n##International\n###Countries\n###International organizations\n###Multinational corporations\n#Aftermath\n##Effects on civic engagement\n##2023 healthcare reform protests\n##Legal action for sharing videos of protests\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The group was formed in 2020 and has been one of the most dominant forces in the company, featuring a mix of wrestlers from different backgrounds and styles.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe Bloodline was created as a result of a combination of factors, including the rise of Roman Reigns to the top of the WWE hierarchy and the introduction of new talent to the company. The group's early members, including Reigns, his cousin Jey Uso, and their brother Jimmy Uso, were part of a long-standing storyline involving the Usos' family and their relationship with Reigns.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n\nThe Usos first gained prominence in 2013 as a part of the Shield stable, alongside Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose. The group feuded with the Usos, who were initially portrayed as a rival faction within the WWE. The Usos eventually turned heel and began a long-running feud with the Shield, which culminated in a series of matches between the two groups.\n\n### Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n\nAfter the Shield disbanded in 2014, the Usos went on to form a successful tag team, winning several championships and becoming one of the top teams in the WWE. Meanwhile, Roman Reigns focused on his singles career, winning several championships, including the WWE Championship. The Usos and Reigns occasionally teamed up, but they were not a regular stable.\n\n### Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n\nIn 2020, Roman Reigns began to build a new stable, which would eventually become the Bloodline. The group's early members included Reigns, the Usos, and Paul Heyman, who became their manager.

However, their rivalry with The New Day was marked by controversy, with some fans criticizing the Bloodline's dominance and perceived lack of athleticism.\n\n#### Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n\nIn 2022, the Bloodline inducted two new members: Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa. Zayn, a former Intercontinental Champion, brought a new level of athleticism to the group, while Sikoa, a former NXT Champion, added a new level of intensity. The Bloodline's feuds with other groups, including The New Day and The Judgment Day, continued to dominate the WWE landscape.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n\nIn 2023, the Bloodline was involved in a major storyline, known as the \"Bloodline Civil War.\" The feud was sparked by a series of matches between Reigns and Sikoa, which culminated in a brutal match between the two. The storyline also involved Zayn, who was torn between his loyalty to the Bloodline and his desire to do what was right. The Bloodline Civil War was marked by controversy and drama, with many fans divided on the issue.\n\n#### Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n\nIn 2023, the Bloodline added a new member: Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, a former WWE Champion and Hollywood star. Johnson's addition to the group was a major surprise, and his feud with Cody Rhodes, a rising star in the WWE, was one of the most highly anticipated storylines of the year. The feud between the Bloodline and Rhodes was marked by drama and intensity, with many fans eager to see how it would play out.\n\n#### Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n\nIn 2024, the Bloodline underwent a major change, with Solo Sikoa taking over as the group's leader. Sikoa's leadership was marked by a new level of intensity and aggression, with the Bloodline feuding with other groups and individuals. The group's current members include Sikoa, Sami Zayn, and several other wrestlers, including The Tongans and Jacob Fatu.\n\n#### Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n\nIn 2024, the Bloodline added two new members: The Tongans and Jacob Fatu. The Tongans, a group of wrestlers from the Pacific Islands, brought a new level of athleticism and intensity to the group. Fatu, a former NXT Champion, added a new level of charisma and leadership to the group. The Bloodline's feuds with other groups and individuals continued to dominate the WWE landscape.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n\nIn 2024, the Bloodline was involved in a major storyline, known as the \"Bloodline Civil War II.\" The feud was sparked by a series of matches between Sikoa and other members of the group, which culminated in a brutal match between the two.

The incident involved a submersible vessel, Titan, operated by OceanGate Expeditions, which was on a dive to the wreck of the RMS Titanic.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Titan submersible implosion was a devastating incident that shocked the world and raised questions about the safety of deep-sea diving operations. The incident highlighted the risks and challenges associated with exploring the ocean floor, particularly when using complex and potentially hazardous equipment. This article provides a detailed account of the incident, its aftermath, and the ongoing investigations.\n\n**Background**\n\n### OceanGate\n\nOceanGate Expeditions is a US-based company that specializes in submersible vessel operations. The company offers a range of services, including submersible vessel rentals, guided tours, and customized expeditions. OceanGate is known for its state-of-the-art submersible vessels, which are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the deep ocean.\n\n### Titanic\n\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. The ship's wreckage lies at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Titanic wreck has become a popular destination for deep-sea explorers and tourists, with many companies offering expeditions to the site.\n\n**Submersible Titan**\n\n### Dives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe Titan submersible vessel was designed specifically for diving to the wreck of the Titanic. The vessel was equipped with advanced life support systems, communication equipment, and a state-of-the-art navigation system. The Titan was capable of reaching depths of up to 13,000 feet (4,000 meters) and was designed to withstand the extreme pressure of the deep ocean.\n\n### Safety\n\nOceanGate Expeditions emphasizes the safety of its passengers and crew. The company provides thorough briefings, training, and equipment checks before each dive. The Titan submersible vessel was equipped with multiple safety features, including emergency oxygen supply, communication equipment, and a backup power system.\n\n### Prior concerns\n\nIn the months leading up to the incident, there were concerns about the safety of the Titan submersible vessel. Some experts raised questions about the vessel's design and the company's ability to ensure the safety of its passengers. These concerns were largely dismissed by OceanGate, which claimed that the vessel was safe and well-maintained.\n\n### Previous incidents\n\nOceanGate Expeditions had experienced several previous incidents, including a minor accident in 2020 involving a submersible vessel. However, the company claimed that the incident was minor and did not affect the safety of its operations.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Expedition arrangements\n\nThe Titan submersible vessel was part of a six-person expedition to the wreck of the Titanic. The group consisted of five passengers, including a filmmaker, a historian, and a couple, as well as the pilot and a crew member. The expedition was arranged by OceanGate Expeditions and was scheduled to last several days.\n\n### 16–17 June preparations\n\nOn June 16 and 17, the expedition team prepared for the dive, conducting safety checks and equipment checks. The team also reviewed the dive plan and emergency procedures.\n\n### 18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, the Titan submersible vessel descended to the wreck of the Titanic. The vessel was transmitting data and video feed to the surface support team until approximately 9:00 am, when contact was lost. Attempts to reestablish contact failed, and the vessel was declared missing. Several hours later, the vessel imploded, killing", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Titan_submersible_implosion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##OceanGate\n##Titanic\n#Submersible Titan\n##Dives to wreck of Titanic\n##Safety\n##Prior concerns\n##Previous incidents\n#Incident\n##Expedition arrangements\n##16–17 June preparations\n##18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n##18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n##22 June, discovery of debris\n##Fatalities\n#Recovery operations\n#Investigations\n##United States\n##Canada\n#Lawsuit\n#Financial costs of operations\n#Reactions\n#In social and mass media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The operation was led by Jordan Goudreau, a former US Army Green Beret, and Hugo Carvajal, a high-ranking Venezuelan military officer.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe situation in Venezuela had been deteriorating for years, with widespread poverty, food and medicine shortages, and a severe economic crisis. The opposition to Maduro's government, led by Juan Guaidó, had been gaining momentum, and the United States had imposed various economic sanctions on the country.\n\n**Planning**\n\n### **Initial promotion: March–May 2019**\n\nThe planning of Operation Gideon began in March 2019, when Jordan Goudreau, who had been involved in various private military contracting ventures, started to promote the idea of a covert operation to overthrow Maduro. Goudreau had connections to the Venezuelan opposition and had been in contact with Juan Guaidó.\n\n### **Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019**\n\nIn June 2019, Goudreau established a private military company called Silvercorp, with the aim of conducting military training and operations in Venezuela. The company was based in Colombia and had connections to the Venezuelan opposition.\n\n### **Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019**\n\nGoudreau and his team began negotiations with representatives of Guaidó's government, including Juan Guaidó himself, to secure support and funding for the operation. The negotiations were ongoing throughout the summer and fall of 2019.\n\n### **Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019**\n\nIn December 2019, J.J. Rendon, a former Venezuelan military officer, and Jordan Goudreau resumed preparations for the operation. They began to recruit and train a group of Venezuelan military personnel who were opposed to Maduro's government.\n\n### **Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020**\n\nIn March 2020, J.J. Rendon, one of the leaders of the operation, was extradited to the United States on charges of money laundering.\n\n### **Prior knowledge of operation**\n\nIt has been reported that the United States government had prior knowledge of the operation and had been in contact with Goudreau and his team. However, the extent of the US government's involvement in the operation remains unclear.\n\n### **Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020**\n\nIn April and May 2020, the Associated Press published a series of articles revealing the details of the operation. The articles described how Goudreau and his team had planned to conduct a series of raids on key government installations, including the presidential palace and the national intelligence agency.\n\n**Landing attempt**\n\nOn May 3, 2020, a group of approximately 60 Venezuelan military personnel and American private military contractors, led by Jordan Goudreau and Hugo Carvajal, attempted to land in Venezuela via a private plane. The group was armed and had been trained in combat and tactics.\n\nHowever, the operation was compromised when the Venezuelan military detected the landing attempt and responded with force. The group was forced to retreat, and several members were captured or killed.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### **Indictments and arrests**\n\nFollowing the failed landing attempt, several members of the operation were indicted and arrested. J.J. Rendon was extradited to the United States on charges of money laundering, and Jordan Goudreau and Hugo Carvajal were indicted on charges of conspiracy and murder.\n\n### **Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences**\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, several members of the operation faced criminal charges, including conspiracy, murder, and treason. Extradition requests were made for several individuals, including J.J. Rendon and Jordan Goudreau.\n\n### **Investigation of interception and deaths**\n\nAn investigation was launched into the interception of the private plane and the deaths of several members of the operation. The investigation found that the Venezuelan military had used excessive force in response to the landing attempt.\n\n### **Goudreau lawsuit**\n\nIn 2022, Jordan Goudreau filed a lawsuit against the US government, alleging that the US government had not provided adequate support and funding for the operation.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### **Domestic**\n\n#### **Maduro administration**\n\nThe Maduro administration responded to the failed operation by accusing the opposition and the United States of attempting to destabilize the country.\n\n#### **Guaidó administration and opposition**\n\nThe Guaidó administration and opposition groups in Venezuela responded to the failed operation by accusing the Maduro administration of using excessive force and violating human rights.\n\n#### **NGOs**\n\nHuman rights organizations and NGOs in Venezuela responded to the failed operation by calling for an investigation into the use of excessive force by the Venezuelan military and the treatment of detainees.\n\n### **International**\n\nThe international community responded to the failed operation by calling for restraint and calm. The United Nations Secretary-General and the Organization of American States (OAS) issued statements calling for a peaceful and democratic resolution to the crisis in Venezuela.\n\n**Characterization**\n\nThe failed operation has been characterized as a failed coup attempt and a failed covert operation.

This article aims to provide an overview of the definition, symbolism, and influence of far-right politics in Serbia, followed by a historical analysis of its development and contemporary trends.\n\n**Definition**\n\nFar-right politics in Serbia can be defined as a set of ideologies, movements, and parties that advocate for a radical, nationalist, and often authoritarian approach to politics. This includes a strong emphasis on Serbian identity, a rejection of liberal democracy, and a desire to restore a perceived national greatness. Far-right ideology in Serbia often draws on a mix of nationalist, populist, and anti-communist sentiments, and is frequently characterized by a strong anti-Western and anti-globalization stance.\n\n**Symbolism**\n\nSymbolism plays a crucial role in far-right politics in Serbia, often serving as a means to mobilize support and create a sense of shared identity among adherents. Symbols such as the Serbian flag, the coat of arms, and the image of Prince Lazar are frequently used to evoke a sense of national pride and nostalgia for a perceived golden age of Serbian greatness. Other symbols, such as the clenched fist and the \"Serbian eagle,\" are used to convey a sense of strength, resilience, and resistance to perceived external threats.\n\n**Influence**\n\nFar-right politics in Serbia have had a significant influence on the country's politics, particularly in the post-Yugoslav period. Far-right groups and parties have been able to tap into widespread discontent with the country's post-communist transition and the perceived failure of liberal democracy to deliver economic prosperity and stability. This has allowed them to build a significant following among segments of the population, particularly among young people and those who feel disillusioned with the established political elite.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Yugoslavia**\n\nFar-right politics in Serbia have a long and complex history, dating back to the interwar period and the formation of the Yugoslav state. During this time, the Serbian far-right was influenced by fascist and nationalist ideologies, which emphasized the need for a strong, authoritarian state and the suppression of minority groups. This legacy continued to shape far-right politics in Serbia throughout the 20th century, with many far-right groups and parties drawing on this heritage to justify their actions and ideology.\n\n### **1990s–2000s**\n\nThe collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s created a power vacuum in Serbia, which far-right groups and parties were quick to exploit. During this period, far-right groups such as the Serbian Radical Party and the Obraz organization gained prominence, advocating for a radical, nationalist agenda and often using violence and intimidation to achieve their goals. This period also saw the rise of paramilitary groups, such as the Serbian Honor and the People's Patrol, which were instrumental in the persecution of minority groups during the Yugoslav Wars.\n\n### **Contemporary period**\n\nIn the 2010s, far-right politics in Serbia continued to evolve, with a growing emphasis on anti-Western and anti-globalization sentiments. The election of Aleksandar Vučić as Prime Minister in 2014 marked a shift towards a more authoritarian and nationalist agenda, which has been characterized by increased repression of opposition groups and the media. This period has also seen the rise of new far-right groups and parties, such as Dveri and the Serbian Party Oathkeepers, which have built on the legacy of earlier far-right movements to advocate for a radical, nationalist agenda.\n\n**Political groups**\n\n### **Organisations**\n\n*   **Blood and Honour**: A neo-Nazi organization that was active in Serbia during the 1990s and early 2000s, known for its involvement in violent attacks against minority groups.\n*   **I live for Serbia**: A far-right organization that was founded in 1999, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of violence and intimidation to achieve its goals.\n*   **Leviathan**: A far-right organization that was founded in 2016, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of online propaganda to recruit new members.\n*   **Nacionalni stroj**: A far-right organization that was founded in 2003, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of violence and intimidation to achieve its goals.\n*   **National Serb Front**: A far-right organization that was founded in 2015, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of online propaganda to recruit new members.\n*   **Obraz**: A far-right organization that was founded in 1993, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of violence and intimidation to achieve its goals.\n*   **People's Patrol**: A far-right organization that was founded in 2003, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of violence and intimidation to achieve its goals.\n*   **SNP 1389**: A far-right organization that was founded in 2011, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of online propaganda to recruit new members.\n*   **SNP Naši**: A far-right organization that was founded in 2014, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of violence and intimidation to achieve its goals.\n*   **Serbian Action**: A far-right organization that was founded in 2015, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of online propaganda to recruit new members.\n*   **Serbian Honour**: A far-right organization that was founded in 1999, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of violence and intimidation to achieve its goals.\n\n### **Political parties**\n\n*   **Dveri**: A far-right party that was founded in 2010, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of online propaganda to recruit new members.\n*   **Serbian Party Oathkeepers**: A far-right party that was founded in 2014, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of violence and intimidation to achieve its goals.\n*   **Serbian Radical Party**: A far-right party that was founded in 1991, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of violence and intimidation to achieve its goals.\n*   **Serbian Right**: A far-right party that was founded in 2011, known for its advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and its use of online propaganda to recruit new members.\n\n**Individuals**\n\n*   **Tomislav Nikolić**: A far-right politician who served as President of Serbia from 2012 to 2017, known for his advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and his use of divisive rhetoric to mobilize support among far-right groups.\n*   **Aleksandar Vučić**: A far-right politician who has served as Prime Minister of Serbia since 2014, known for his advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and his use of authoritarian tactics to suppress opposition groups and the media.\n*   **Bosko Obradović**: A far-right politician who has served as Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia since 2016, known for his advocacy of a radical, nationalist agenda and his use of online propaganda to recruit new members for far-right groups.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   **Nationalism in Serbia**\n*   **Fascism in Serbia**\n*   **Extremism in Serbia**\n*   **Politics of Serbia**\n\n**Notes**\n\n*   This article is intended to provide a factual overview of far-right politics in Serbia, and does not express any opinion or endorsement of the views or actions of any individual or group mentioned.\n*   The information contained in this article is based on publicly available sources, including news reports, academic studies, and government documents.\n*   This article is intended to be a neutral and informative resource for readers, and does not contain any biased or partisan language.\n\n**References**\n\n*   **Bibliography**\n    *   **Kovac, A.

These films are typically made outside of the major Hollywood studios, but with more resources and support than low-budget, no-budget, or micro-budget independent films.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe term \"Indiewood\" was first coined in the 1990s to describe a new generation of independent filmmakers who were able to produce high-quality films with moderate budgets. These filmmakers were often associated with the Sundance Film Festival, which had become a launching pad for many successful independent films. The rise of Indiewood was also facilitated by the growth of film distribution companies that were willing to take on independent films, as well as the increasing popularity of independent cinema.\n\n**Divisions**\n\nIndiewood films can be divided into several subcategories based on their budget and production style. Some of these subcategories include:\n\n* **Low-budget Indiewood**: These films are made on a small budget, often under $500,000. They are typically shot on digital video and have a more DIY aesthetic.\n* **Mid-budget Indiewood**: These films are made on a moderate budget, often between $500,000 and $5 million. They are often shot on 35mm film and have a more polished aesthetic.\n* **High-budget Indiewood**: These films are made on a larger budget, often over $5 million. They are often shot on 35mm film and have a more elaborate aesthetic.\n\n**Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors**\n\nIn addition to Indiewood, there are several other terms used to describe independent film production companies and distributors that fall somewhere between the major Hollywood studios and traditional independent film companies. Some of these terms include:\n\n* **Mini-major**: This term refers to independent film production companies that produce high-quality films with moderate budgets. Examples of mini-major companies include Lionsgate and Dimension Films.\n* **Indie studio**: This term refers to independent film production companies that produce high-quality films with moderate budgets, but also have a more polished aesthetic and a wider distribution deal. Examples of indie studios include A24 and NEON.\n* **Indie distributor**: This term refers to film distribution companies that specialize in distributing independent films. Examples of indie distributors include Magnolia Pictures and Oscilloscope Laboratories.\n\n**Differences from Hollywood**\n\nIndiewood films differ from traditional Hollywood films in several ways. Some of these differences include:\n\n* **Budget**: Indiewood films are often made on smaller budgets than traditional Hollywood films.\n* **Production style**: Indiewood films often have a more DIY aesthetic and are shot on digital video or 35mm film. Traditional Hollywood films are often shot on 35mm film and have a more polished aesthetic.\n* **Distribution**: Indiewood films are often distributed by independent distributors, while traditional Hollywood films are distributed by major studios.\n* **Content**: Indiewood films often focus on character-driven stories and independent themes, while traditional Hollywood films often focus on big-budget action and spectacle.\n\n**List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers**\n\nSome notable independent filmmakers who were associated with the Indiewood movement or came before it include:\n\n* **John Cassavetes**: A pioneer of American independent cinema, known for films like \"Shadows\" and \"Faces\".\n* **John Sayles**: A filmmaker known for his social realist films, including \"Return of the Secaucus 7\" and \"Matewan\".\n* **Jim Jarmusch**: A filmmaker known for his experimental and independent films, including \"Stranger Than Paradise\" and \"Down by Law\".\n* **Spike Lee**: A filmmaker known for his independent films, including \"She's Gotta Have It\" and \"Do the Right Thing\".\n* **Clerks director Kevin Smith**: A filmmaker known for his independent films, including \"Clerks\" and \"Mallrats\".\n\n**List of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films**\n\nSome notable films that were made before the Indiewood movement, but are considered
