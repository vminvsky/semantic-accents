The cyclone formed in the Indian Ocean in January 2024 and underwent a complex and unusual life cycle, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to several countries, including Mozambique, Madagascar, and the Mascarene Islands.\n\n## Formation and Intensification\n\nCyclone Freddy formed on January 6, 2024, as a tropical disturbance in the Indian Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 mi) east of the Seychelles. At the time, the disturbance was characterized by a low-pressure system with moderate convection and a defined circulation. Over the next 24 hours, the system slowly organized, with tropical cyclone formation becoming increasingly likely.\n\nOn January 7, the system intensified into a tropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 30 km/h (18 mph). The depression continued to strengthen, and by January 8, it had become a tropical storm, named Freddy by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Mauritius. As Freddy moved westward, it encountered favorable conditions for intensification, including warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear.\n\nFreddy rapidly intensified over the next 24 hours, with maximum sustained winds increasing to 120 km/h (75 mph) on January 9. By January 10, the cyclone had reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg). Freddy's large size and intense core made it a powerful cyclone, with a high risk of catastrophic damage and flooding.\n\n## The Mascarene Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique\n\nAs Freddy moved westward, it posed a significant threat to the Mascarene Islands, a chain of islands in the Indian Ocean. On January 12, the cyclone made landfall on Réunion Island, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The island's infrastructure was severely impacted, with widespread power outages and damage to buildings.\n\nFreddy then moved southward, making landfall on Madagascar on January 13. The cyclone brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the eastern coast of the island, causing widespread flooding and damage. The city of Toamasina was particularly affected, with reports of widespread flooding and power outages.\n\nOn January 15, Freddy made landfall on Mozambique, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the coastal city of Beira. The cyclone caused widespread damage and flooding, with reports of several deaths and many more displaced.\n\n## Redevelopment and Dissipation\n\nAfter making landfall on Mozambique, Freddy began to weaken rapidly, with maximum sustained winds decreasing to 90 km/h (56 mph) by January 16. The cyclone continued to move westward, eventually re-intensifying over the Indian Ocean.\n\nOn January 19, Freddy re-intensified into a tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds increasing to 120 km/h (75 mph). The cyclone continued to move westward, eventually re-strengthening into a tropical cyclone on January 20.\n\nHowever, Freddy's second life cycle was short-lived, with the cyclone dissipating on January 21 due to increasing wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. The cyclone's remnants continued to move westward, eventually dissipating over the Indian Ocean.\n\n## Records\n\nCyclone Freddy was a significant event in the southern hemisphere, with several records broken during its life cycle. The cyclone's maximum sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph) were the highest recorded in the Indian Ocean for several years. The cyclone's minimum central pressure of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg) was also a record low for the region.\n\nThe cyclone's impact on Mozambique was particularly severe, with widespread damage and flooding reported in several provinces. The cyclone's death toll in Mozambique was significant, with reports of several hundred deaths and many more displaced.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere\n* List of tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean\n\n## Notes\n\nCyclone Freddy's life cycle was complex and unusual, with the cyclone undergoing a significant redevelopment over the Indian Ocean.

Ron Hubbard in the mid-20th century. It has been classified variously as a new religious movement, a cult, and a pseudoscience, with adherents often describing it as a practical and effective system for personal growth and self-improvement.\n\n**Definition and Classification**\n\n## Debates over classification\n\nScientology has been subject to intense debate and criticism over the years, with some classifying it as a new religious movement, while others view it as a cult or a pseudoscience. Critics have accused Scientology of being a profitable business dressed up as a religion, while adherents argue that it is a legitimate and effective spiritual practice.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe term \"Scientology\" comes from the Latin words \"scientia\" (knowledge) and \"logos\" (study or science). L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, coined the term in 1954 to describe his system of self-improvement and spiritual growth.\n\n**History**\n\nScientology was founded by L. Ron Hubbard in the mid-20th century, after he developed a self-help system called Dianetics. Hubbard's work on Dianetics was influenced by his interests in science fiction, psychology, and philosophy, as well as his experiences in World War II. In 1954, Hubbard founded the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles, California, and began to develop the system of auditing and other practices that are central to the movement.\n\nOver the years, Scientology has grown and evolved, with the movement establishing a global presence and a complex organizational structure. Today, the Church of Scientology is a major player in the field of spirituality and self-improvement, with adherents in over 180 countries around the world.\n\n**Beliefs and Practices**\n\n## Auditing\n\nAt the heart of Scientology is a system of auditing, which is a form of therapy or counseling that is designed to help individuals overcome their emotional and spiritual problems. Auditing typically involves the use of a device called an E-meter, which is used to measure the electrical resistance of the body and to detect the presence of spiritual or emotional blockages.\n\n## Soul\n\nIn Scientology, the concept of the soul is central to the movement's understanding of human nature and the universe. Scientologists believe that the soul is an immortal, spiritual entity that exists independently of the physical body and that is capable of reincarnation. The soul is seen as a kind of energy or force that animates the body and gives it life.\n\n## Space opera and the Wall of Fire\n\nScientology has a complex and elaborate cosmology that is based on the idea of a vast, intergalactic universe in which countless civilizations have risen and fallen over billions of years. This cosmology is known as the \"space opera\" and is central to the movement's understanding of the nature of the universe and the role of humanity within it.\n\n## The Operating Thetan levels\n\nScientology has a system of spiritual development that is based on the idea of achieving spiritual enlightenment or self-realization through a series of levels or grades. These levels are known as the Operating Thetan (OT) levels and are seen as a kind of spiritual ladder that leads to ultimate enlightenment and understanding.\n\n## Ethics\n\nScientology places a strong emphasis on ethics, which is seen as a kind of moral and spiritual code that guides the behavior of individuals and the movement as a whole. The movement's ethics are based on a set of principles that emphasize responsibility, accountability, and respect for others.\n\n## Symbology\n\nScientology has a complex and elaborate system of symbology that is used to convey spiritual and philosophical ideas. The movement's symbols, such as the cross and the eight-pointed star, are seen as having deep spiritual significance and are used in various contexts, including auditing and worship.\n\n## Psychiatry, psychology, psychosis\n\nScientology has a deeply critical view of psychiatry and psychology, which are seen as being based on flawed assumptions and methodologies. Scientologists believe that these fields are often used to manipulate and control individuals, and that they are not effective in treating mental illness or promoting spiritual growth.\n\n## Views on Hubbard\n\nL. Ron Hubbard is revered by Scientologists as a kind of spiritual leader and founder, who is seen as having revealed the truth about the nature of the universe and the human condition. Hubbard's teachings are seen as having a deep impact on the movement and are widely studied and revered by Scientologists.\n\n**The Church of Scientology**\n\n## Internal organization\n\nThe Church of Scientology is a complex and hierarchical organization that is divided into various levels or departments. The movement's leadership is known as the \"Sea Org\" and is composed of senior officials who are responsible for guiding the movement's activities and policies.\n\n## Promotional material\n\nScientology has a vast and elaborate system of promotional material that is used to attract new members and promote the movement's teachings. This material includes books, films, and other media that are designed to convey the movement's ideas and attract adherents.\n\n## Social outreach\n\nScientology has a strong emphasis on social outreach and community service, which is seen as an important part of the movement's mission and purpose. Scientologists are encouraged to participate in various community activities and to help others in need.\n\n## Responses to opponents\n\nScientology has a complex and often confrontational relationship with its opponents, who are seen as being motivated by a desire to suppress or destroy the movement. Scientologists have developed a range of strategies for responding to criticism and opposition, including litigation and public relations campaigns.\n\n## Suppressive persons and fair game\n\nScientology has a concept of \"suppressive persons\" who are seen as being enemies of the movement and who deserve to be attacked or punished. This concept is based on the idea that individuals who oppose the movement are motivated by a desire to suppress or destroy it, and that they are therefore legitimate targets for criticism or attack.\n\n**Free Zone and independent Scientology**\n\nOver the years, there have been several instances of independent or \"Free Zone\" Scientology, which is a form of Scientology that is not affiliated with the Church of Scientology. These independent Scientology groups often develop their own teachings and practices, which may differ significantly from those of the Church of Scientology.\n\n**Controversies**\n\n## Hubbard's motives\n\nOne of the most enduring controversies surrounding Scientology is the question of L. Ron Hubbard's motives and intentions. Critics of the movement have accused Hubbard of being a charlatan or a confidence artist who used his teachings to swindle or manipulate his followers.\n\n## Criminal behavior\n\nScientology has been involved in various instances of alleged criminal behavior, including organized harassment and mistreatment of members.\n\n## Organized harassment\n\nScientology has been accused of engaging in organized harassment of its critics and opponents, including litigation, intimidation, and other forms of pressure.\n\n### Mistreatment of Members\n\nScientology has been accused of mistreating its members, including physical and emotional abuse, financial exploitation, and other forms of mistreatment.\n\n## Violation of auditing confidentiality\n\nScientology has been accused of violating the confidentiality of its auditing sessions, which is considered a breach of trust and a violation of the movement's own policies.\n\n## Allegations of coerced abortions\n\nScientology has been accused of coercing or pressuring some of its female members into undergoing abortions, which is a serious allegation that has been the subject of controversy and debate.\n\n## Allegation of human trafficking and other crimes against women\n\nScientology has been accused of engaging in human trafficking and other crimes against women, including forced labor, financial exploitation, and other forms of abuse.\n\n## Scientology, litigation, and the Internet\n\nScientology has been involved in various instances of litigation and controversy surrounding its use of the Internet and other forms of technology.\n\n**Disputes over legal status**\n\nScientology has been the subject of various disputes over its legal status, including its classification as a religion and its tax-exempt status.\n\n**Scientology in religious studies**\n\nScientology has been the subject of various studies and research in the field of religious studies, including its history, beliefs, and practices.\n\n## Influences\n\nScientology has been influenced by a range of cultural and intellectual traditions, including science fiction, philosophy, and psychology.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nScientology has a global presence and a diverse membership base, with adherents in over 180 countries around the world.\n\n## Recruitment\n\nScientology has a complex and often aggressive recruitment strategy, which includes mail-order advertising, street recruitment, and other forms of outreach.\n\n**Reception and influence**\n\nScientology has had a significant impact on popular culture, including film, literature, and other forms of media.\n\n## Media, popular culture, and academia\n\nScientology has been the subject of various media and academic studies, including books, films, and other forms of scholarship.\n\n**See also**\n\nFor further information, see the following articles:\n\n* L.

Born Joseph Ratzinger on April 16, 1927, in Marktl am Inn, Germany, he served as the Pope from 2005 to 2013. His death marked the end of an era for the Catholic Church, and his funeral was a grand ceremony attended by dignitaries from around the world.\n\n**Background**\n\nPope Benedict XVI had been in poor health for several years prior to his death. He had stepped down as Pope in 2013, citing his advanced age and declining health. In the years following his resignation, he continued to live a semi-retired life within the Vatican walls, devoting himself to prayer and study.\n\n**Last Days**\n\n**Death**\n\nPope Benedict XVI passed away on December 31, 2022, at 9:34 am in the Mater Ecclesiae monastery within the Vatican.

The derailment and subsequent emergency response drew widespread attention and raised concerns about the safety of rail transportation and the handling of hazardous materials.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Norfolk Southern train was traveling from Madison, Illinois, to Conway, Pennsylvania, on the Norfolk Southern Railway's (NS) Chicago-to-Philadelphia route. The train consisted of 150 cars, including 11 carrying hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride, a known carcinogen. The train was traveling at a speed of approximately 43 mph at the time of the derailment.\n\n**Derailment**\n\nAt approximately 8:55 am EST, the train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, a small town with a population of approximately 4,300 people. The derailment resulted in 38 cars leaving the tracks, including the 11 cars carrying hazardous materials. The train was traveling through a predominantly residential area, and the derailment occurred near a local park and school.\n\n**Emergency response and burn off**\n\nThe Norfolk Southern Railroad immediately activated its emergency response plan, and emergency services personnel from East Palestine and surrounding areas responded to the scene. The decision was made to conduct a controlled burn of the vinyl chloride cars to prevent a potential explosion. However, the burn-off operation was met with skepticism and concern from local residents and officials, who questioned the safety and necessity of the procedure.\n\n##Burnoff unnecessary\n\nCritics argued that the burn-off was unnecessary and posed a significant risk to the local population. They pointed out that the vinyl chloride was not a combustible material and that the burn-off operation was likely to release toxic fumes into the air. Additionally, the burn-off operation was conducted in a residential area, putting local residents at risk.\n\n**Health and environmental concerns**\n\nThe derailment and subsequent burn-off operation raised significant health and environmental concerns for the local population. Residents reported experiencing respiratory problems, headaches, and other health issues, which they attributed to the toxic chemicals released during the derailment and burn-off.\n\n##Waste disposal\n\nThe cleanup of the derailment site and disposal of the hazardous materials were major concerns. The Norfolk Southern Railroad and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) coordinated the cleanup efforts, but critics argued that the process was slow and inadequate.\n\n##Independent testing\n\nIndependent testing was conducted to assess the air and water quality in the affected area. The results showed elevated levels of toxic chemicals, including vinyl chloride, in the air and water.\n\n##Whistleblower and cover-up allegations\n\nA whistleblower within the Norfolk Southern Railroad alleged that the company had covered up the true extent of the derailment and the risks associated with the burn-off operation. The whistleblower claimed that the company had prioritized profits over safety and had misled regulators and the public about the situation.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe derailment and subsequent burn-off operation had a significant impact on the local community. Residents reported experiencing ongoing health problems, and the local economy was affected by the disruption of rail services.\n\n##Lawsuits and compensation\n\nResidents and business owners affected by the derailment filed lawsuits against the Norfolk Southern Railroad, seeking compensation for their losses. The railroad agreed to provide compensation to affected residents and business owners, but the process was slow and contentious.\n\n##NTSB board meeting and findings\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted a board meeting to investigate the derailment and determine the cause. The NTSB found that a combination of factors contributed to the derailment, including human error, equipment failure, and inadequate safety procedures.\n\n##Federal Railroad Administration safety culture assessment\n\nThe Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) conducted a safety culture assessment of the Norfolk Southern Railroad. The assessment found that the railroad had a poor safety culture, with inadequate training, inadequate maintenance, and inadequate oversight.\n\n**Inquiry and cause**\n\nThe derailment and subsequent investigation raised questions about the safety of rail transportation and the handling of hazardous materials. The inquiry and investigation were focused on determining the cause of the derailment and identifying measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n##Hearings\n\nCongress held hearings to investigate the derailment and the response of the Norfolk Southern Railroad and the regulatory agencies. The hearings focused on issues such as safety culture, equipment maintenance, and the handling of hazardous materials.\n\n##Brakes\n\nThe investigation found that the brakes on the train failed, contributing to the derailment. The NTSB recommended that the FRA require the use of advanced brake systems on all trains carrying hazardous materials.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe derailment and subsequent investigation drew widespread attention and raised concerns about the safety of rail transportation and the handling of hazardous materials. The incident was widely reported in the media, and there were calls for greater regulation and oversight of the rail industry.\n\n##Congress\n\nCongress responded to the derailment by introducing legislation to improve safety and oversight of the rail industry. The legislation aimed to strengthen safety regulations, increase penalties for non-compliance, and improve the transparency and accountability of the rail industry.\n\n##Misinformation\n\nThere were allegations of misinformation and spin in the aftermath of the derailment. Critics argued that the Norfolk Southern Railroad and the regulatory agencies had downplayed the risks and consequences of the derailment and the burn-off operation.\n\n##Comparisons\n\nThe derailment was compared to other high-profile incidents, such as the 2013 Lac-Megantic oil train derailment in Quebec, Canada, and the 2005 Graniteville train derailment in South Carolina, USA. The comparisons highlighted the ongoing risks and challenges associated with rail transportation and the handling of hazardous materials.\n\n**Subsequent derailments**\n\nThe derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, was followed by a series of subsequent derailments and incidents in the rail industry. The incidents raised concerns about the safety of rail transportation and the handling of hazardous materials, and highlighted the need for greater regulation and oversight.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of rail accidents\n* Rail safety\n* Hazardous materials transportation\n* Environmental impact of rail transportation\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not contain any references.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* National Transportation Safety Board.

It was designed and manufactured in India by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai, marking a significant milestone in the country's rail network. The train was introduced in 2019, with the aim of providing a comfortable and efficient mode of transportation for passengers.\n\n**History**\n\n### Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)\n\nThe Indian Railways has a long history of striving to increase speed and efficiency in its train services. In the 1960s, the Railways introduced the Shatabdi Express, which was the first semi-high-speed train in India. However, despite its success, the Shatabdi Express was not able to achieve speeds of over 100 km/h due to infrastructure constraints. Over the years, the Railways continued to make efforts to improve train speeds, but progress was limited by the need for infrastructure upgrades and the availability of suitable rolling stock.\n\n### Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)\n\nIn 2016, the Indian Railways initiated a project to design and manufacture an indigenous high-speed trainset. The project was led by the ICF, in collaboration with other Indian Railways departments and research institutions. The goal was to create a train that could operate at speeds of over 150 km/h, while also providing a high level of comfort and amenities to passengers. The new trainset was designed to be powered by electric propulsion, with advanced braking systems and aerodynamic design features to minimize energy consumption.\n\n### Introduction and further (2019–present)\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express was introduced on February 15, 2019, with the first commercial run between New Delhi and Varanasi. The train was an instant success, with passengers praising its comfort, speed, and amenities. The Vande Bharat Express was designed to run at a maximum speed of 180 km/h, making it one of the fastest trains in India. Since its introduction, the train has been extended to other routes, including the Delhi-Katra and Delhi-Amritsar routes. The train has also undergone several modifications to improve its performance and passenger amenities.\n\n**Rolling stock**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express is a semi-bullet electric multiple unit (EMU) train, designed to run at speeds of over 180 km/h. The train has a total of 16 coaches, including:\n\n* 1 executive class coach with 52 seats\n* 1 chair car coach with 78 seats\n* 5 chair car coaches with 78 seats each\n* 5 luggage and pantry car coaches\n* 1 generator car\n\nThe train is powered by electric propulsion, with a 3-phase induction motor driving the wheels through a gearbox. The train has a maximum power output of 4,000 kW, and is equipped with advanced braking systems, including regenerative braking and disc brakes.\n\n**Facilities**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express offers a range of amenities and facilities to passengers, including:\n\n* Air conditioning in all coaches\n* LED lighting and digital information displays\n* Automatic doors and sliding windows\n* Transparent roofs for natural lighting and scenic views\n* Pantry cars with food and beverage services\n* Luggage racks and storage facilities\n* Priority seating and reserved seating options\n\n**Services**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express offers a range of services to passengers, including:\n\n* Onboard food and beverage services\n* Luggage storage and handling\n* Priority seating and reserved seating options\n* Complimentary Wi-Fi and mobile charging points\n* Onboard entertainment options, including movies and music\n\nThe train also offers a range of convenient services, including:\n\n* E-ticketing and online booking options\n* Mobile app for real-time updates and information\n* Onboard announcements and information displays\n* Wi-Fi and mobile connectivity throughout the journey\n\n**See also**\n\n* Indian Railways\n* Integral Coach Factory\n* Shatabdi Express\n* High-speed rail in India\n* List of fastest trains in India\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Vande Bharat Express is a semi-bullet electric multiple unit train, designed to run at speeds of over 180 km/h.\n* The train has a total of 16 coaches, including executive class, chair car, and luggage and pantry car coaches.\n* The train is powered by electric propulsion, with a 3-phase induction motor driving the wheels through a gearbox.\n* The train has a maximum power output of 4,000 kW, and is equipped with advanced braking systems, including regenerative braking and disc brakes.\n* The Vande Bharat Express offers a range of amenities and facilities to passengers, including air conditioning, LED lighting, and onboard food and beverage services.\n\n**References**\n\nNone\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the Vande Bharat Express\n* Indian Railways website\n* Integral Coach Factory website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vande_Bharat_Express\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)\n##Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)\n##Introduction and further (2019–present)\n#Rolling stock\n#Facilities\n#Services\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The budget was a package of tax cuts and other fiscal measures announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, in an effort to stimulate economic growth and alleviate cost-of-living pressures on households.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe UK economy had been experiencing a period of high inflation and slow growth in the months leading up to the budget announcement. The COVID-19 pandemic had left a lasting impact on the economy, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 had led to a sharp increase in energy prices. The government had been under pressure to take action to address these issues and stimulate economic growth.\n\n**The budget**\n\nThe September 2022 mini-budget was a comprehensive package of fiscal measures aimed at boosting economic growth and reducing the cost of living for households. Some of the key points of the budget included:\n\n### Key points\n\n* A significant reduction in corporate tax rates from 25% to 19%, effective immediately\n* A cut in income tax rates for higher earners, with the top rate of tax reduced from 45% to 40%\n* A suspension of stamp duty land tax for first-time homebuyers\n* A removal of the cap on banker bonuses, which had been introduced following the 2008 financial crisis\n* A freeze on income tax thresholds, which meant that more people would be subject to higher income tax rates\n* A reduction in the basic rate of value-added tax (VAT) from 20% to 19%\n\nThe budget was widely seen as a major departure from the government's previous fiscal policy and was criticized by many experts and opposition politicians.\n\n**Reaction**\n\nThe September 2022 mini-budget was met with a mixed reaction from various sectors of society.\n\n### Currency, interest rate, and debt\n\nThe budget was seen as a major risk to the UK's fiscal sustainability. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimated that the budget would increase the UK's debt-to-GDP ratio by 2025, while the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted that the UK's debt interest payments would rise by £15 billion per year. The budget also led to a sharp increase in interest rate expectations, with the OBR predicting that interest rates would rise to 5.5% by the end of 2023.\n\n### Bond markets\n\nThe budget was seen as a major risk to the UK's bond markets. The IFS estimated that the budget would lead to a £100 billion increase in the government's debt, which would put pressure on bond yields. The budget also led to a sharp increase in gilt yields, with the 10-year gilt yield rising by 1.5% in the days following the budget announcement.\n\n### International response\n\nThe budget was widely criticized by international organizations and governments. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concerns over the budget's impact on the UK's fiscal sustainability, while the European Union (EU) warned that the budget could lead to a \"significant risk\" to the UK's economic stability. The US government also expressed concerns over the budget's impact on the UK's economic stability.\n\n### Business and economic\n\nThe budget was seen as a major risk to the UK's business sector. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) expressed concerns over the budget's impact on business investment, while the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned that the budget could lead to a \"significant risk\" to the UK's economic stability. The budget also led to a sharp increase in inflation expectations, with the CBI predicting that inflation would rise to 4.5% by the end of 2023.\n\n### Media\n\nThe budget was widely covered by the media, with many outlets criticizing the government's fiscal policy. The BBC described the budget as a \"radical\" and \"ambitious\" package, while The Guardian described it as a \"reckless\" and \"dangerous\" policy. The budget also led to a sharp increase in media attention, with many outlets focusing on the potential impact on the UK's economic stability.\n\n### Political\n\nThe budget was widely seen as a major risk to the UK's economic stability. The opposition Labour Party described the budget as a \"reckless\" and \" irresponsible\" policy, while the Liberal Democrats warned that the budget could lead to a \"significant risk\" to the UK's economic stability. The budget also led to a sharp increase in tensions between the government and the opposition, with many politicians criticizing the government's fiscal policy.\n\n### Opinion polling\n\nThe budget was widely criticized by the public, with many people expressing concerns over the potential impact on the UK's economic stability. A YouGov poll found that 63% of people believed that the budget was a bad idea, while a separate poll found that 55% of people believed that the government had made a mistake in introducing the budget.\n\n**Government response**\n\nThe government faced significant criticism for the budget, with many politicians and experts warning that it could lead to a significant risk to the UK's economic stability.\n\n### Initial responses\n\nThe Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, defended the budget, stating that it was a necessary measure to stimulate economic growth and alleviate cost-of-living pressures on households. The Prime Minister, Liz Truss, also defended the budget, stating that it was a \"bold\" and \"ambitious\" package that would help to boost economic growth.\n\n### Dismissal of Chancellor\n\nThe budget was widely criticized, and the government faced significant pressure to reverse the policy. On 14 October 2022, the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, was dismissed from his position, and Jeremy Hunt was appointed as the new Chancellor.\n\n### Reversal of tax cuts\n\nThe government reversed the tax cuts introduced in the budget, with the Chancellor announcing that the top rate of tax would be increased to 45% and the corporate tax rate would be increased to 25%. The government also announced that it would introduce a windfall tax on energy companies to help to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n**Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister**\n\nThe resignation of the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, was followed by a series of resignations from the government, including the resignation of the Prime Minister, Liz Truss. On 25 October 2022, Truss announced that she would resign as Prime Minister, and Rishi Sunak was appointed as the new Prime Minister.\n\n**Subsequent events**\n\nThe resignation of the Prime Minister, Liz Truss, was followed by a period of significant change in the UK government. The new Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, announced a series of policies to help to stabilize the economy and address the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n### Following Truss's resignation\n\nThe resignation of the Prime Minister, Liz Truss, was widely seen as a major blow to the government's credibility. The opposition Labour Party described the resignation as a \"resounding defeat\" for the government, while the Liberal Democrats warned that the resignation could lead to a \"significant risk\" to the UK's economic stability.\n\n### Later events\n\nThe UK government continued to face significant challenges in the months following the resignation of the Prime Minister, Liz Truss. The government was forced to implement a series of austerity measures to help to stabilize the economy, including a significant increase in taxes and a reduction in public spending.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Fiscal policy in the United Kingdom\n* Economic policy in the United Kingdom\n* Politics of the United Kingdom\n* Cost-of-living crisis in the United Kingdom\n* Liz Truss Premiership\n* Rishi Sunak Premiership\n* Jeremy Hunt Chancellorship", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"September_2022_United_Kingdom_mini-budget\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#The budget\n##Key points\n#Reaction\n##Currency, interest rate, and debt\n##Bond markets\n##International response\n##Business and economic\n##Media\n##Political\n##Opinion polling\n#Government response\n##Initial responses\n##Dismissal of Chancellor\n##Reversal of tax cuts\n#Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister\n#Subsequent events\n##Following Truss's resignation\n##Later events\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Varisu is produced by Dil Raju under his banner Sri Venkateswara Creations.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story revolves around Karthik, the youngest son of a wealthy businessman, who is next in line to inherit the family business. However, due to a power struggle within the family, Karthik decides to get married to his childhood friend, Bhavani, and leave the family business. However, things take a turn when Karthik's father dies, and his elder brother, Rudhra, tries to take over the business. Karthik returns to his hometown to settle the estate and fight for his rightful place as the heir of the family business.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Vijay as Karthik\n* Rashmika Mandanna as Bhavani\n* Sarathkumar as Rajendran\n* Prakash Raj as Ramachandran\n* R.

The project was initially titled \"Thalapathy 66\" and was expected to be a bilingual film, with both Tamil and Telugu versions. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project was delayed, and the story was rewritten to accommodate Vijay's character.\n\n### Casting\n\nVijay was announced to play the lead role in the film, marking his 65th film. Rashmika Mandanna was signed to play the female lead, and Sarathkumar, Prakash Raj, and R. Sarathkumar were also cast in supporting roles. Allu Arjun made a guest appearance in the film, and Adam Lambert also made a cameo appearance.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Varisu began in November 2020, and the film was shot in various locations across Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, Pollachi, and Kodaikanal. The film's cinematography was handled by P. S. Vinod, and the editing was done by Marthand K. Venkatesh.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for Varisu is composed by Thaman S, marking his third collaboration with Vijay after Sarkar and Master. The soundtrack features six songs, including the title track, which was released in December 2022. The lyrics for the songs were written by Kabilan, Vivek, and Chandrabose.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing for Varisu began in December 2022, with the release of the film's title track and a series of posters featuring Vijay. The film's trailer was released in January 2023, and it received a positive response from fans and critics alike.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nVarisu was released on January 12, 2023, in over 3,000 screens across Tamil Nadu, marking one of the biggest releases in the state. The film was also released in other states, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, and Karnataka.\n\n### Distribution\n\nThe distribution rights for Varisu were acquired by Sri Thenandal Studios, which released the film in Tamil Nadu and other states. The film was also released in other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\n### Pre-release business\n\nThe pre-release business for Varisu was estimated to be around ₹300 crores, making it one of the most expensive films in Tamil cinema.

The film was also released on DVD and Blu-ray discs in March 2023.\n\n**Reception**\n\nVarisu received positive reviews from critics, with many praising Vijay's performance and the film's action sequences. The film was also a commercial success, grossing over ₹500 crores at the box office. However, some critics felt that the film's story was predictable and that the supporting cast was underutilized.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nVarisu was involved in a controversy when the film's producers were accused of plagiarizing the story from a Malayalam film. However, the producers denied the allegations, stating that the story was original and had been developed by Vamshi Paidipally.\n\n**Notes**\n\nVarisu was one of the most anticipated films of 2023, with fans eagerly waiting for its release.

The event was notable for being the first time since 1993 that the reigning champion refused to defend their title.\n\n**# Carlsen refuses to defend the title**\n\nMagnus Carlsen, the reigning World Chess Champion since 2013, announced in October 2022 that he would not defend his title. This decision marked a significant turning point in the history of the World Chess Championship.\n\n## **History of non-participation**\n\nCarlsen's decision was not unprecedented. There have been only a few instances in the history of the World Chess Championship where the reigning champion refused to defend their title. One notable example was when Viktor Korchnoi refused to play against Anatoly Karpov in 1975. Korchnoi claimed that he was suffering from a mental breakdown and was unable to participate in the match. However, many believed that Korchnoi was motivated by a desire to avoid a confrontation with Karpov, who had been dominating the chess world at the time.\n\nAnother example was when Garry Kasparov refused to defend his title against Anatoly Karpov in 1993. Kasparov, who had been the champion since 1985, cited a loss of motivation and a desire to pursue other interests outside of chess. However, many believed that Kasparov's decision was motivated by a desire to avoid Karpov, who had been a thorn in his side for many years.\n\n## **Candidates Tournament 2022**\n\nIn response to Carlsen's decision, the World Chess Federation (FIDE) organized a Candidates Tournament in 2022 to determine the new challenger for the World Chess Championship. The tournament was held in Madrid, Spain, and featured a field of eight top-ranked chess players from around the world. The tournament was a double round-robin event, with each player playing against every other player once.\n\nThe Candidates Tournament was won by Ding Liren, a Chinese chess player who has been one of the top-ranked players in the world for several years. Ding's victory marked his first appearance in a World Chess Championship final.\n\n## **Results**\n\nThe Candidates Tournament was a highly competitive event, with several players pushing each other to the limit throughout the tournament.

The early Christian church grew rapidly in the Roman Empire, and by the 4th century, Christianity had become the dominant religion. However, the process of Christianization was not a straightforward or uniform one, and historians have long debated the various factors that contributed to its spread.\n\n**Of historiography**\n\nHistorians have developed a range of approaches to understanding the Christianization of the Roman Empire, reflecting different perspectives on the nature of the process. Some historians have focused on the role of the Roman state in promoting Christianity, while others have emphasized the agency of individual Christians and the social and cultural factors that contributed to the spread of the faith. The study of the Christianization of the Roman Empire has also been shaped by broader debates in the field of historical studies, including the tension between top-down and bottom-up approaches to history.\n\n**Roman religion**\n\nThe Roman Empire was initially a polytheistic society, with a complex pantheon of gods and goddesses. The Roman government played a significant role in promoting the worship of various deities, and the Roman state cult was an important aspect of imperial policy. However, the Roman state also tolerated the worship of other gods, including the Eastern cults of Isis and Mithras.\n\n### Context and other evidence\n\nIn addition to the Roman state cult, there were other factors that contributed to the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire was a vast and diverse society, with a wide range of social and cultural practices. The Roman economy was also a significant factor in the spread of Christianity, as the early Christian church was supported by wealthy donors and benefactors. Archaeological evidence, including the discovery of early Christian artifacts and inscriptions, has also provided important insights into the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire.\n\n**Spread of Christianity**\n\nChristianity originated in the 1st century AD in the eastern Mediterranean, and it quickly spread throughout the Roman Empire. The early Christian church was initially a small and marginal movement, but it grew rapidly in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.\n\n### Origin\n\nThe origins of Christianity are not well documented, and there is ongoing debate among scholars about the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. However, it is clear that the early Christian church was based on the teachings of Jesus and his disciples, and that it was characterized by a strong sense of community and shared purpose.\n\n### Reception and growth in Roman society\n\nThe early Christian church was initially met with hostility and suspicion by many in Roman society. However, it also attracted a significant following, particularly among the poor and marginalized. The Christian church was seen as a powerful force for social change, and its message of love and compassion resonated with many who were disillusioned with the Roman state and its institutions.\n\n### Under Constantine and his Christian successors\n\nIn the 4th century AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, and the Roman state began to promote the faith. Constantine's conversion marked a significant turning point in the history of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, as it provided a powerful symbol of imperial support for the faith.\n\n### Theodosius I\n\nTheodosius I (378-395 AD) was the first Christian emperor to rule the Roman Empire, and he played a significant role in the development of the Christian church. Theodosius I was a devout Christian, and he saw the spread of Christianity as a key aspect of his imperial policy. He outlawed pagan worship and established Christianity as the official state religion.\n\n#### Theodosius II and Pope Leo I\n\nTheodosius II (408-450 AD) and Pope Leo I (440-461 AD) were both important figures in the history of the Christianization of the Roman Empire. Theodosius II was a devout Christian, and he continued the policy of promoting Christianity established by his father. Pope Leo I was a key figure in the development of Catholic doctrine, and he played a significant role in the establishment of the Catholic Church as a major institution in the Roman Empire.\n\n### Sixth to eighth centuries\n\nIn the sixth to eighth centuries AD, the Christianization of the Roman Empire continued, with the spread of Christianity throughout the Mediterranean world. The Byzantine Empire, which was the Eastern Roman Empire, played a significant role in the spread of Christianity, as it was a major center of Christian learning and culture.\n\n**Mathematical modelling**\n\nHistorians have used mathematical modelling to study the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. This approach involves using statistical techniques to analyze the distribution of Christian communities and the growth of the Christian church over time. Mathematical modelling has provided important insights into the nature of the Christianization process, including the role of social networks and the impact of imperial policy.\n\n**Possible reasons for a top-down spread**\n\nThere are several possible reasons for a top-down spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. Some historians have argued that the Roman state played a significant role in promoting Christianity, through policies such as the promotion of Christian officials and the prohibition of pagan worship. Others have suggested that the spread of Christianity was driven by the influence of Christian legislation, such as the Edict of Milan, which granted toleration to Christians in 313 AD.\n\n### Traditional conflict models\n\nTraditional conflict models of the spread of Christianity emphasize the role of conflict and violence in the conversion of the Roman Empire. According to this view, the Christian church was seen as a threat to the power of the Roman state, and it was therefore the subject of persecution and violence. However, this view has been challenged by some historians, who argue that the spread of Christianity was a more complex and nuanced process.\n\n### Violence and temple destruction\n\nSome historians have argued that the spread of Christianity was accompanied by violence and temple destruction, as Christian mobs attacked pagan temples and killed those who refused to convert to Christianity. However, this view has been challenged by others, who argue that the evidence for violence and temple destruction is limited and that the spread of Christianity was a more peaceful process.\n\n### Socio-economic factors\n\nSocio-economic factors, such as poverty and social inequality, have also been seen as contributing to the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. Some historians have argued that the Christian church was particularly attractive to the poor and marginalized, who saw it as a source of hope and support.\n\n### Influence of legislation\n\nThe influence of legislation, such as the Edict of Milan, has also been seen as a significant factor in the spread of Christianity. According to this view, the Edict of Milan, which granted toleration to Christians in 313 AD, played a key role in the spread of Christianity by providing a legal framework for the Christian church.\n\n**Possible reasons for a grassroots spread**\n\nThere are also several possible reasons for a grassroots spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. Some historians have argued that the spread of Christianity was driven by the influence of new ideas, such as the concept of the trinity and the importance of baptism.\n\n### New ideas\n\nNew ideas, including the concept of the trinity and the importance of baptism, have been seen as contributing to the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. According to this view, the Christian church was attractive to those who were seeking a deeper understanding of God and the nature of the universe.\n\n### Inclusivity and exclusivity\n\nThe Christian church has also been seen as a more inclusive and welcoming institution than the Roman state cult, which was seen as exclusive and elitist. This view has been challenged by others, who argue that the Christian church was also exclusive and elitist, particularly in its early stages.\n\n### Kerygma (central message)\n\nThe kerygma, or central message, of Christianity has been seen as a key factor in the spread of the faith. According to this view, the kerygma, which emphasizes the importance of faith, love, and forgiveness, was a powerful and attractive message that resonated with many in the Roman Empire.\n\n**Social practices**\n\nSocial practices, including the care of the poor and the sick, have also been seen as contributing to the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. According to this view, the Christian church was attractive to those who were seeking a more compassionate and just society.\n\n### Women\n\nWomen have played a significant role in the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire, particularly in the early stages of the faith. Some historians have argued that women were more open to the message of Christianity than men, who were often more tied to the traditional values of the Roman state cult.\n\n### Sexual morality\n\nThe Christian church has also been seen as having a more restrictive view of sexual morality than the Roman state cult. According to this view, the Christian church emphasized the importance of chastity and monogamy, which was seen as a more attractive and morally superior option than the more permissive views of the Roman state cult.\n\n### Care for the poor\n\nThe care of the poor has been seen as a significant factor in the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. According to this view, the Christian church was attractive to those who were seeking a more compassionate and just society, particularly in the early stages of the faith.\n\n### Health care\n\nThe Christian church has also been seen as having a more comprehensive view of health care than the Roman state cult. According to this view, the Christian church emphasized the importance of caring for the sick and the vulnerable, which was seen as a more attractive and morally superior option than the more limited views of the Roman state cult.\n\n### Community\n\nThe Christian church has also been seen as providing a sense of community and belonging to its members, which was seen as a more attractive option than the more isolated and individualistic views of the Roman state cult.\n\n### Martyrdom\n\nMartyrdom, or the willingness to suffer and die for one's faith, has also been seen as a key factor in the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire.

The outbreak was characterized by a series of intense tornadoes that affected multiple states, including Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.\n\n**Meteorological Synopsis**\n\nThe outbreak was the result of a complex interplay of atmospheric conditions, including a strong low-pressure system, a cold front, and a strong jet stream. The low-pressure system developed over the Rocky Mountains on March 4 and began to move eastward, interacting with a cold front that was moving southward from Canada.\n\n### March 5\n\nOn March 5, the low-pressure system and cold front merged over the Great Plains, resulting in a strong area of lift and instability. As the system moved eastward, it encountered a strong jet stream that was flowing from the west, leading to the development of a significant tornado outbreak.\n\n### March 6–7\n\nOn March 6 and 7, the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, interacting with the cold front and jet stream. This resulted in a continuation of the significant tornado outbreak, with multiple tornadoes touching down in the affected states.\n\n**Confirmed Tornadoes**\n\nThe tornado outbreak resulted in a total of 19 confirmed tornadoes, including several EF3 and EF4 tornadoes. The tornadoes caused significant damage and loss of life, with multiple fatalities reported.\n\n### March 5 Event\n\nOn March 5, a total of 5 tornadoes were confirmed, including 2 EF3 tornadoes.

One of the EF3 tornadoes occurred in Illinois, causing significant damage and killing several people.\n\n### March 7 Event\n\nOn March 7, a total of 6 tornadoes were confirmed, including 2 EF4 tornadoes. One of the EF4 tornadoes occurred in Ohio, causing catastrophic damage and killing multiple people.\n\n### Macksburg–Winterset–Norwalk–Colfax–Newton, Iowa\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred in Iowa, affecting the communities of Macksburg, Winterset, Norwalk, Colfax, and Newton. The tornado was an EF3, with wind speeds estimated at up to 165 mph. The tornado caused significant damage and injured several people, with multiple homes and businesses destroyed.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe tornado outbreak resulted in significant damage and loss of life, with multiple fatalities reported. The affected communities were left to deal with the aftermath of the disaster, including debris cleanup and rebuilding efforts.\n\nThe outbreak also had a significant impact on the environment, with reports of power outages, property damage, and hazardous materials spills.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Tornado outbreaks in the United States\n* Weather-related disasters in the United States\n* Disaster response and recovery efforts\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe tornado outbreak of March 5–7, 2022, was a significant event in the history of the United States, highlighting the importance of disaster preparedness and response. The outbreak served as a reminder of the devastating impact of severe weather events and the need for communities to come together in the face of disaster.\n\nThe outbreak also highlighted the importance of meteorological forecasting and the need for accurate and timely warnings to save lives and prevent damage.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* National Weather Service: Tornado Outbreak of March 5–7, 2022\n* Federal Emergency Management Agency: Tornado Outbreak of March 5–7, 2022\n* American Red Cross: Tornado Outbreak of March 5–7, 2022", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tornado_outbreak_of_March_5–7,_2022\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n##March 5\n##March 6–7\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##March 5 event\n##March 6 event\n##March 7 event\n##Macksburg–Winterset–Norwalk–Colfax–Newton, Iowa\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is considered one of the most important philosophers of the ancient world, and his ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars today.\n\n**Biography**\n\nPlotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, around 205 AD. His exact date of birth is unknown, but it is believed to be around the time of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus. He lived a long and eventful life, traveling extensively throughout the ancient world, including Egypt, Persia, and Rome. His philosophical ideas were shaped by his experiences and interactions with various cultures and intellectual traditions.\n\n### **Expedition to Persia and return to Rome**\n\nAt the age of 28, Plotinus traveled to Persia with the Roman Emperor Gordian III. During this expedition, he became fascinated with the philosophy of the Persians and the Stoics. He was particularly drawn to the ideas of the Persian philosopher, Zoroaster, who emphasized the importance of reason and the ultimate reality of a single, unified spirit. Upon returning to Rome, Plotinus settled in Milan, where he began to gather a group of followers and establish his philosophical school.\n\n### **Later life**\n\nPlotinus lived in Rome for over 30 years, teaching and writing extensively on philosophy. He was particularly interested in the teachings of Plato, whom he considered to be the greatest philosopher of all time. He also drew on the ideas of other philosophers, including Aristotle, the Stoics, and the Gnostics. Despite his influence, Plotinus's life was not without controversy. He was accused of being a Christian, although he himself claimed to be a pagan. His relations with the Roman authorities were strained, and he was eventually forced to leave Rome.\n\n**Major ideas**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy is characterized by a number of key concepts, including the nature of the ultimate reality, the process of emanation, the true human, and the concept of henosis.\n\n### **The One**\n\nFor Plotinus, the ultimate reality is a single, unified entity that he calls \"The One.\" This entity is beyond all duality and multiplicity, and is the source of all existence. The One is characterized by its simplicity, unity, and infinity. It is the ultimate reality that underlies all of existence, and is the source of all being and becoming.\n\n### **Emanation by the One**\n\nPlotinus believed that the One emanates a series of emanations, or hypostases, which are intermediate between The One and the material world. These emanations are the Nous (the divine intellect), the Soul, and matter. The Nous is the realm of abstract thought and ideal Forms, while the Soul is the realm of individual souls and the material world is the realm of matter and change.\n\n### **The true human and happiness**\n\nAccording to Plotinus, the true human is the individual soul that has achieved a state of spiritual liberation and unity with The One. This state is characterized by a deep sense of happiness, peace, and contentment. The true human is not concerned with material possessions or worldly achievements, but rather with the pursuit of spiritual knowledge and understanding.\n\n### **Henosis**\n\nHenosis is the Greek term for \"union\" or \"oneness.\" For Plotinus, henosis is the ultimate goal of human existence, in which the individual soul achieves a state of unity with The One. This state is characterized by a deep sense of spiritual liberation and freedom from the constraints of the material world.\n\n**Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy was shaped by his interactions with various contemporary philosophers and religious traditions.\n\n### **Plotinus's Relation to Plato**\n\nPlotinus was deeply influenced by the teachings of Plato, whom he considered to be the greatest philosopher of all time. He drew on Plato's ideas about the nature of reality, the Forms, and the ultimate reality of a single, unified spirit.\n\n### **Plotinus and the Gnostics**\n\nPlotinus was also influenced by the Gnostic tradition, which emphasized the importance of spiritual knowledge and the ultimate reality of a single, unified spirit. However, he rejected the Gnostic view that the material world was created by a evil deity.\n\n### **Against causal astrology**\n\nPlotinus rejected the idea of causal astrology, which held that the positions of the stars and planets determined human destiny. He believed that human beings had free will and were responsible for their own actions.\n\n**Film studies**\n\nPlotinus's ideas have been the subject of several films and television programs, including a 1970 film by Peter Brook called \"The Clouds of Heaven,\" which explores the life and philosophy of Plotinus.\n\n**Influence**\n\nPlotinus's ideas have had a profound influence on Western thought, shaping the development of philosophy, art, literature, and culture.\n\n### **Ancient world**\n\nIn the ancient world, Plotinus's ideas influenced the development of Neoplatonism, a philosophical movement that emphasized the importance of reason, the ultimate reality of a single, unified spirit, and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge and understanding.\n\n### **Christianity**\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced the development of Christianity, particularly in the area of mysticism and the concept of the Trinity. Many Christian theologians, including Origen and Augustine, drew on Plotinian ideas in their own philosophical and theological writings.\n\n### **Islam**\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced the development of Islam, particularly in the area of Sufism. Many Sufi mystics, including Rumi and Ibn Arabi, drew on Plotinian ideas in their own philosophical and spiritual writings.\n\n### **Judaism**\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced the development of Judaism, particularly in the area of mysticism and the concept of the divine. Many Jewish mystics, including the Kabbalists, drew on Plotinian ideas in their own philosophical and spiritual writings.\n\n### **Renaissance**\n\nIn the Renaissance, Plotinus's ideas influenced the development of humanism and the revival of classical learning. Many humanist scholars, including Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, drew on Plotinian ideas in their own philosophical and literary writings.\n\n### **Great Britain**\n\nIn Great Britain, Plotinus's ideas influenced the development of English literature and philosophy, particularly in the area of Romanticism. Many Romantic poets and writers, including Blake and Coleridge, drew on Plotinian ideas in their own literary and philosophical writings.\n\n### **India**\n\nIn India, Plotinus's ideas influenced the development of Hindu philosophy and spirituality, particularly in the area of Advaita Vedanta. Many Hindu philosophers and spiritual leaders, including Adi Shankara and Ramana Maharshi, drew on Plotinian ideas in their own philosophical and spiritual writings.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Neoplatonism\n* Plato\n* Aristotle\n* Stoicism\n* Gnosticism\n* Mysticism\n* Sufism\n* Kabbalah\n* Humanism\n* Romanticism\n* Advaita Vedanta\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The exact date of Plotinus's birth is unknown.\n* Plotinus's philosophical ideas were shaped by his interactions with various cultures and intellectual traditions.\n* Plotinus's philosophy is characterized by a number of key concepts, including the nature of the ultimate reality, the process of emanation, the true human, and the concept of henosis.\n\n**References**\n\n* Plotinus.

The floods were caused by heavy monsoon rains, which resulted in widespread damage and displacement. This article provides an overview of the background, impact, response, and other related aspects of the 2022 Pakistan floods.\n\n**Background**\n\nPakistan is a country located in South Asia, where the climate is generally hot and dry during the summer months. However, during the monsoon season, which typically runs from June to September, the country experiences heavy rainfall, which can sometimes lead to flooding. The 2022 monsoon season was particularly severe, with multiple low-pressure systems forming over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, bringing heavy rainfall to various parts of the country.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe 2022 Pakistan floods had a significant impact on various regions of the country. The floods resulted in widespread damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. Many communities were affected, with thousands of people forced to flee their homes due to the rising waters.\n\n### **Sindh**\n\nSindh is the most populous province of Pakistan, and it was one of the hardest-hit regions by the 2022 floods. The province received extremely heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving over 1,000 mm of rain in just a few days. The city of Karachi, which is the provincial capital, was severely affected, with many areas submerged under water. The floods caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings, and resulted in the displacement of thousands of people.\n\n### **Balochistan**\n\nBalochistan is the largest province of Pakistan, and it was also severely affected by the 2022 floods.

The province received heavy rainfall, which caused widespread damage to infrastructure and resulted in the displacement of thousands of people. The city of Lahore, which is the provincial capital, was particularly affected, with many areas submerged under water.

The floods also caused significant damage to agriculture, with many crops destroyed or damaged.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe response to the 2022 Pakistan floods was coordinated by the government of Pakistan, with assistance from various international organizations, countries, corporate sector, and private individuals.\n\n### **National**\n\nThe government of Pakistan took immediate action to respond to the floods, with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif, visiting the affected areas to assess the situation and provide assistance. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was activated to coordinate the relief efforts, with the help of various provincial governments. The military was also deployed to assist in the relief efforts, with troops involved in search and rescue operations, providing food and shelter to affected communities, and clearing debris.\n\n### **International**\n\nThe international community provided significant assistance to Pakistan in responding to the floods. The United Nations (UN) played a key role, with the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, expressing solidarity with the people of Pakistan and offering UN assistance. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) worked closely with the government of Pakistan to coordinate international assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank also provided significant assistance, with the ADB announcing a $1.5 billion assistance package and the World Bank announcing a $1.2 billion assistance package.\n\n### **Countries**\n\nVarious countries provided assistance to Pakistan in responding to the floods.
