{"title": "Pope_Benedict_XVI", "content": "\nEarly life: 1927–1951\nJoseph Alois Ratzinger was born on 16 April, Holy Saturday, 1927 at Schulstraße 11 at 8:30 in the morning in his parents' home in Marktl, Bavaria, Germany He was baptised the same day He was the third and youngest child of Joseph Ratzinger Sr., a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (née Peintner); his grand-uncle was the German priest-politician Georg Ratzinger His mother's family was originally from South Tyrol (now in Italy) [23] Benedict's elder brother, Georg, became a Catholic priest and was the former director of the Regensburger Domspatzen choir [24] His sister, Maria, who never married, managed her brother Joseph's household until she died in 1991 [25]\n\n\nWartime and ordination\nRatzinger's family, especially his father, bitterly resented the Nazis, and his father's opposition to Nazism resulted in demotions and harassment of the family [29] Following his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was conscripted into the Hitler Youth – as membership was required by law for all 14-year-old German boys after March 1939 [30] – but was an unenthusiastic member who refused to attend meetings, according to his brother [31] In 1941, one of Ratzinger's cousins, a 14-year-old boy with Down syndrome, was taken away by the Nazi regime and murdered during the Aktion T4 campaign of Nazi eugenics [32] In 1943, while still in seminary, he was drafted into the German anti-aircraft corps as Luftwaffenhelfer [31] Ratzinger then trained in the German infantry [33] As the Allied front drew closer to his post in 1945, he deserted back to his family's home in Traunstein after his unit had ceased to exist, just as American troops established a headquarters in the Ratzinger household [34] As a German soldier, he was interned in US prisoner of war camps, first in Neu-Ulm, then at Fliegerhorst (\"military airfield\") Bad Aibling (shortly to be repurposed as Bad Aibling Station) where he was at the time of Victory in Europe Day, and released on 19 June 1945 [35] [34]\n\n\nEncounter with Romano Guardini\nIn his early twenties, Ratzinger was deeply influenced by the thought of Italian German philosopher Romano Guardini, [39] who taught in Munich from 1946 to 1951 when Ratzinger was studying in Freising and later at the University of Munich The intellectual affinity between these two thinkers, who would later become decisive figures for the twentieth-century Catholic Church, was preoccupied with rediscovering the essentials of Christianity: Guardini wrote his 1938 The Essence of Christianity, while Ratzinger penned Introduction to Christianity, three decades later in 1968 Guardini inspired many in the Catholic social-democratic tradition, particularly the Communion and Liberation movement in the New Evangelization encouraged under the papacy of the Polish Pope John Paul II Ratzinger wrote an introduction to a 1996 reissue of Guardini's 1954 The Lord [40]\n\n\nPre-papal career: 1951–2005\nRatzinger began as assistant pastor (curate) at the parish St Martin, Moosach, in Munich in 1951 [41] Ratzinger became a professor at the University of Bonn in 1959, with his inaugural lecture on \"The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy\" In 1963, he moved to the University of Münster During this period, he participated in the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) and served as a peritus (theological consultant) to Cardinal Frings of Cologne He was viewed during the time of the council as a reformer, cooperating with theologians like Hans Küng [42] and Edward Schillebeeckx [43] Ratzinger became an admirer of Karl Rahner, a well-known academic theologian of the Nouvelle théologie and a proponent of Church reform [44]\n\n\nAcademic career: 1951–1977\nRatzinger began as

Karl Rahner, a well-known academic theologian of the Nouvelle théologie and a proponent of Church reform [44]\n\n\nArchbishop of Munich and Freising: 1977–1982\nOn 24 March 1977, Ratzinger was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising, and was ordained a bishop on 28 May He took as his episcopal motto Cooperatores veritatis (Latin for 'cooperators of the truth'), [56] from the Third Epistle of John, [57] a choice on which he commented in his autobiographical work Milestones [58]\n\n\nPrefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: 1981–2005\nOn 25 November 1981, Pope John Paul II, upon the retirement of Franjo Šeper, named Ratzinger as the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, formerly known as the \"Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office\", the historical Roman Inquisition Consequently, he resigned from his post in Munich in early 1982 He was promoted within the College of Cardinals to become Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni in 1993 and was made the college's vice-dean in 1998 and dean in 2002 Just a year after its foundation in 1990, Ratzinger joined the European Academy of Sciences and Arts in Salzburg [60] [61]\n\n\nPapacy: 2005–2013\nIn April 2005, before his election as pope, Ratzinger was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time [70] While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near Regensburg and dedicate himself to writing books [71]\n\n\nElection to the papacy\nIn April 2005, before his election as pope, Ratzinger was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time [70] While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near Regensburg and dedicate himself to writing books [71]\n\n\nChoice of name\nBenedict XVI chose his papal name, which comes from the Latin word meaning \"the blessed\", in honour of both Benedict XV and Benedict of Nursia [80] Benedict XV was pope during the First World War, during which time he passionately pursued peace between the warring nations St Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the Benedictine monasteries (most monasteries of the Middle Ages were of the Benedictine order) and the author of the Rule of Saint Benedict, which is still the most influential writing regarding the monastic life of Western Christianity The Pope explained his choice of name during his first general audience in St Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005:\n\n\nTone of papacy\nDuring Benedict's inaugural Mass, the previous custom of every cardinal submitting to the pope was replaced by being greeted by twelve people, including cardinals, clergy, religious, a married couple and their child, and some who were newly confirmed people; the cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon the election of the new pontiff He began using an open-topped papal car, saying that he wanted to be closer to the people Benedict continued the tradition of his predecessor John Paul II and baptised several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of each year, on the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome [82]\n\n\nBeatifications\nDuring his pontificate, Benedict XVI beatified 870 people On 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor, Pope John Paul II Normally, five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin However, in an audience with Benedict, Camillo Ruini, vicar general of the Diocese of Rome and the official responsible for promoting the cause for canonization of any person who dies within that diocese, cited \"exceptional circumstances\" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived (This had happened before, when Pope Paul VI waived the five-year rule and announced beatification processes for two of his own predecessors, Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII Benedict XVI followed this precedent when he waived the five-year rule for John Paul II [83]) The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the attempt on John Paul II's life [84] John Paul II often credited Our Lady of Fátima for preserving him on that day Cardinal Ruini inaugurated the diocesan phase of the cause for beatification in the Lateran Basilica on 28 June 2005 [85]\n\n\nCanonizations\nDuring his pontificate, Benedict XVI canonized 45 people [89] He celebrated his first canonizations on 23 October 2005 in St Peter's Square when he canonized Josef Bilczewski, Alberto Hurtado, Zygmunt Gorazdowski, Gaetano Catanoso, and Felice da Nicosia The canonizations were part of a mass that marked the conclusion of the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops and the Year of the Eucharist [90] Benedict canonized Bishop Rafael Guízar y Valencia, Théodore Guérin, Filippo Smaldone, and Rosa Venerini on 15 October 2006.\n\n\nDoctors of the Church\nOn 7 October 2012, Benedict named Hildegard of Bingen and John of Ávila as Doctors of the Church, the 34th and 35th individuals so recognized in the history of Christianity [101]\n\n\nCuria reform\nBenedict made only modest changes to the structure of the Roman Curia In March 2006, he placed both the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace under a single president, Cardinal Renato Martino When Martino retired in 2009, each council received its own president once again Also in March 2006, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue was briefly merged into the Pontifical Council for Culture under Cardinal Paul Poupard Those Councils maintained their separate officials and staffs while their status and competencies continued unchanged, and in May 2007, Interreligious Dialogue was restored to its separate status again with its own president [102] In June 2010, Benedict created the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelization, appointing Archbishop Rino Fisichella its first president [103] On 16 January 2013, the Pope transferred responsibility for catechesis from the Congregation for the Clergy to the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization [104]\n\n\nTeachings\nAs pope, one of Benedict's main roles was to teach about the Catholic faith and the solutions to the problems of discerning and living the faith, [105] a role that he could play well as a former head of the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (The main points of emphasis of his teachings are stated in more detail in Theology of Pope Benedict XVI.)\n\n\n\"Friendship with Jesus Christ\"\nAfter his first homily as pope, Benedict referred to both Jesus Christ and John Paul II Citing John Paul II's well-known words, \"Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!\", Benedict said:\n\n\n\"Dictatorship of relativism\"\nContinuing what he said in the pre-conclave Mass about what he often referred to as the \"central problem of our faith today\", [113] on 6 June 2005, Benedict also said:\n\n\nChristianity as religion according to reason\nIn the discussion with secularism and rationalism, one of Benedict's basic ideas can be found in his address on the \"Crisis of Culture\" in the West, a day before Pope John Paul II died, when he referred to Christianity as the \"religion of the Logos\" (the Greek for \"word\", \"reason\", \"meaning\", or \"intelligence\") He said:\n\n\nEncyclicals\nBenedict wrote three encyclicals: Deus caritas est (Latin for \"God is Love\"), Spe salvi (\"Saved by Hope\"), and Caritas in veritate (\"Love in Truth\").\n\n\nPost-synodal apostolic exhortation\nSacramentum caritatis (The Sacrament of Charity), signed 22 February 2007, was released in Latin, Italian, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Polish It was made available in various languages on 13 March 2007 in Rome The English edition of Libera Editrice Vaticana is 158 pages This apostolic exhortation \"seeks to take up the richness and variety of the reflections and proposals which emerged from the Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops\" which was held in 2006 [128]\n\n\nMotu proprio on Tridentine Mass\nOn 7 July 2007, Benedict issued the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, declaring that upon \"the request of the faithful\", the celebration of Mass according to the Missal of 1962 (of the Tridentine Mass), was to be more easily permitted Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass may now merely request permission from their local priest [129] While Summorum Pontificum directs that pastors should provide the Tridentine Mass upon the requests of the faithful, it also allows for any qualified priest to offer private celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, to which the faithful may be admitted if they wish [130] For regularly scheduled public celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, the permission of the priest in charge of the church is required [131]\n\n\nUnicity and salvific universality of the Catholic Church\nNear the end of June 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document approved by Benedict XVI \"because some contemporary theological interpretations of Vatican II's ecumenical intent had been 'erroneous or ambiguous' and had prompted confusion and doubt.\" The document has been seen as restating \"key sections of a 2000 text the pope wrote when he was prefect of the congregation, Dominus Iesus.\" [136]\n\n\nConsumerism\nBenedict condemned excessive consumerism, especially among youth He stated in December 2007 that \" [A]dolescents, youths and even children are easy victims of the corruption of love, deceived by unscrupulous adults who, lying to themselves and to them, draw them into the dead-end streets of consumerism.\" [137] In June 2009, he blamed outsourcing for the greater availability of consumer goods which lead to the downsizing of social security systems [138]\n\n\nEcumenism\nSpeaking at his weekly audience in St Peter's Square on 7 June 2006, Benedict asserted that Jesus himself had entrusted the leadership of the Church to his apostle Peter \"Peter's responsibility thus consists of guaranteeing the communion with Christ Let us pray so that the primacy of Peter, entrusted to poor human beings, may always be exercised in this original sense desired by the Lord, so that it will be increasingly recognised in its true meaning by brothers who are still not in communion with us.\" [139]\n\n\nInterfaith dialogue\nWhen Benedict ascended to the papacy, his election was welcomed by the Anti-Defamation League who noted \"his great sensitivity to Jewish history and the Holocaust\" [146] However, his election received a more reserved response from British Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who hoped that Benedict would \"continue along the path of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II in working to enhance relations with the Jewish people and the State of Israel.\" [147] Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom also offered tentative praise, though Shalom believed that \"this Pope, considering his historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism.\" [147]\n\n\nJudaism\nWhen Benedict ascended to the papacy, his election was welcomed by the Anti-Defamation League who noted \"his great sensitivity to Jewish history and the Holocaust\" [146] However, his election received a more reserved response from British Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who hoped that Benedict would \"continue along the path of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II in working to enhance relations with the Jewish people and the State of Israel.\" [147] Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom also offered tentative praise, though Shalom believed that \"this Pope, considering his historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism.\" [147]\n\n\nIslam\nBenedict's relations with Islam were strained at times On 12 September 2006, he delivered a lecture which touched on Islam at the University of Regensburg in Germany He had served there as a professor of theology before becoming Pope, and his lecture was entitled \"Faith, Reason and the University – Memories and Reflections\" The lecture received much attention from political and religious authorities Many Islamic politicians and religious leaders registered their protest against what they labelled an insulting mischaracterization of Islam, although his focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and its effect on the religion [158] [159] Muslims were particularly offended by a passage that the Pope quoted in his speech: \"Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.\" [159]\n\n\nBuddhism\nThe Dalai Lama congratulated Benedict XVI upon his election, [165] and visited him in October 2006 in Vatican City In 2007, the People's Republic of China was accused of using its political influence to stop a meeting between the Pope and the Dalai Lama [166]\n\n\nIndigenous American beliefs\nWhile visiting Brazil in May 2007, \"the pope sparked controversy by saying that native populations had been 'silently longing' for the Christian faith brought to South America by colonizers.\" [167] The Pope continued, stating that \"the proclamation of Jesus and of his Gospel did not at any point involve an alienation of the pre-Columbus cultures, nor was it the imposition of a foreign culture.\" [167] Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez demanded an apology, and an indigenous organization in Ecuador issued a response which stated that \"representatives of the Catholic Church of those times, with honourable exceptions, were accomplices, deceivers and beneficiaries of one of the most horrific genocides of all humanity.\" [167] Later, the Pope, speaking Italian, said at a weekly audience that it was \"not possible to forget the suffering and the injustices inflicted by colonizers against the indigenous population, whose fundamental human rights were often trampled\" but made no apology [168]\n\n\nHinduism\nWhile visiting the United States on 17 April 2008, Benedict met with International Society for Krishna Consciousness representative Radhika Ramana Dasa, [169] a noted Hindu scholar [170] and disciple of Hanumatpreshaka Swami [171] On behalf of the Hindu American community, Radhika Ramana Dasa presented a gift of an Om symbol to Benedict [172] [173]\n\n\nPastoral visits and security\nAs pontiff, Benedict carried out numerous Apostolic activities, including journeys in Italy and across the world.\n\n\nSexual abuse in the Catholic Church\nPrior to 2001, the primary responsibility for investigating allegations of sexual abuse and disciplining perpetrators rested with the individual dioceses In 2001, Ratzinger convinced John Paul II to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in charge of all sexual abuse investigations [196] [197] According to John L Allen Jr., Ratzinger in the following years \"acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim Driven by that encounter with what he would later refer to as 'filth' in the Church, Ratzinger seems to have undergone something of a 'conversion experience' throughout 2003–04 From that point forward, he and his staff seemed driven by a convert's zeal to clean up the mess.\" [198]\n\n\nAs Archbishop of Munich and Freising\nDespite being more proactive than his predecessor in addressing sexual abuse, Benedict was nonetheless cited as failing to do so on more than one occasion In January 2022, a report written by German law firm Westpfahl Spilker Wastl and commissioned by the Catholic Church concluded that Cardinal Ratzinger failed to adequately take action against clerics in four cases of alleged abuse while he was Archbishop of Munich and Freising from 1977 to 1982 The pope emeritus denied the accusations [209] [210] [211] Benedict corrected his former statement that he had not been at a meeting of the ordinariate of the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising in January 1980, saying he mistakenly told German investigators he was not there However, the error was \"not done out of bad faith\", but \"the result of an error in the editorial processing\" of his statement According to Reuters, lawyer Martin Pusch said that \"in a total of four cases, we have come to the conclusion that the then Archbishop Cardinal Ratzinger can be accused of misconduct in cases of sexual abuse.\" [212] [213]\n\n\nLegion of Christ founder Marcial Maciel\nOne of the cases Ratzinger pursued involved Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse Biographer Andrea Tornielli suggested that Cardinal Ratzinger had wanted to take action against Maciel but that John Paul II and other high-ranking officials, including several cardinals and the Pope's influential secretary Stanisław Dziwisz, prevented him from doing so [197] [202]\n\n\nTheodore McCarrick controversy\nIn November 2020, the Vatican published a report blaming Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI for allowing defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick to rise in power despite the fact that they both knew of sex abuse allegations against him [218] [219] Despite the fact that Benedict pressured McCarrick to resign as Archbishop of Washington D.C in 2006, McCarrick remained very active in ministry throughout Benedict's papacy and even made a very public appearance when he presided over US senator Ted Kennedy's burial service at Arlington National Cemetery in 2009 [218] [219] [220]\n\n\nPost-papacy\nIn 2019, Benedict released a 6,000-word letter that attributed the Church's sexual abuse crisis to an erosion of morality driven by secularization and the sexual revolution of the 1960s [221] The letter was in sharp contrast to the viewpoint of his successor, Francis, who saw the issue as a byproduct of abuses of power within the Church's hierarchical structure [221] The New York Times later reported that \"given his frail health at the time, however, many church watchers questioned whether Benedict had indeed written the letter or had been manipulated to issue it as a way to undercut Francis.\" [222]\n\n\nAttire\nBenedict re-introduced several papal garments which had fallen into disuse He resumed the use of the traditional red papal shoes, which had been used since Roman times by popes but which had fallen into disuse during the pontificate of John Paul II Contrary to the initial speculation of the press that the shoes had been made by the Italian fashion house Prada, the Vatican announced that the shoes were provided by the Pope's personal shoemaker [224]\n\n\nHealth\nPrior to his election as pope in 2005, Ratzinger had hoped to retire – on account of age-related health problems, a long-held desire to have free time to write, and the retirement age for bishops (75) – and submitted his resignation as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three times, but continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of John Paul II In September 1991, Ratzinger suffered a haemorrhagic stroke, which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily but from which he recovered completely [225] This was never officially made public – the official news was that he had fallen and struck his head against a radiator – but was an open secret known to the conclave that elected him pope [226]\n\n\nResignation\nOn 11 February 2013, the Vatican confirmed that Benedict would resign the papacy on 28 February 2013, as a result of his advanced age, [231] becoming the first pope to resign since Gregory XII in 1415 [232] At the age of 85 years and 318 days on the effective date of his retirement, he was the fourth-oldest person to hold the office of pope The move was unexpected, [233] as all popes in modern times had held office until death Benedict was the first pope to resign without external pressure since Celestine V in 1294 [234] [235]\n\n\nPope emeritus: 2013–2022\nOn the morning of 28 February 2013, Benedict met with the full College of Cardinals and in the early afternoon flew by helicopter to the papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo He stayed there until refurbishment was completed on his retirement home, the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican Gardens near St Peter's, former home of twelve nuns, where he moved on 2 May 2013 [243] [244]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nOn 28 December 2022, Pope Francis said at the end of his audience that Benedict was \"very sick\" and asked God to \"comfort him and support him in this testimony of love for the Church until the end\" [285] The same day, Matteo Bruni, the director of the Holy See Press Office, stated that \"in the last few hours there has been an aggravation of Benedict's health due to advancing age\" and that he was under medical care Bruni also stated that Francis visited Benedict at the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery after the audience [286] [287]\n\n\nWorsening health and death\nOn 28 December 2022, Pope Francis said at the end of his audience that Benedict was \"very sick\" and asked God to \"comfort him and support him in this testimony of love for the Church until the end\" [285] The same day, Matteo Bruni, the director of the Holy See Press Office, stated that \"in the last few hours there has been an aggravation of Benedict's health due to advancing age\" and that he was under medical care Bruni also stated that Francis visited Benedict at the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery after the audience [286] [287]\n\n\nFuneral\nFrom 2 to 4 January 2023, Benedict's body lay in state in St Peter's Basilica, during which around 195,000 people paid their respects [291] His funeral took place on 5 January 2023 in St Peter's Square at 9:30 am, presided over by Pope Francis and celebrated by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re [292] This was the first time since 1802 that a pope had attended a funeral for his predecessor [293] The funeral was attended by an estimated 50,000 people [294] Some attendees held signs reading or shouted \"Santo subito\", calling for his elevation to sainthood, a cry heard previously at the funeral of John Paul II [295] Benedict was interred in the crypt beneath St Peter's Basilica, in the same tomb originally occupied by John Paul II and John XXIII [294] The tomb was opened to the public on 8 January 2023 [296]\n\n\nTitles and styles\n\nAs Pope, Benedict's rarely used full title was:\n\nPositions on morality and politics\nIn 2005, the Pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage, and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms [307] The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS [308] However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's teaching can occur [309] TIME also reported in its edition of 30 April 2006 that the Vatican's position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials \"flatly dismiss [ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use.\" [309]\n\n\nContraception and HIV/AIDS\nIn 2005, the Pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage, and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms [307] The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS [308] However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's teaching can occur [309] TIME also reported in its edition of 30 April 2006 that the Vatican's position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials \"flatly dismiss [ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use.\" [309]\n\n\nHomosexuality\nDuring his time as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), Cardinal Ratzinger made several efforts to tackle the issue of homosexuality within the Catholic Church and the wider world In 1986 the CDF sent a letter to all bishops entitled: On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons The letter condemned a liberal interpretation of the earlier CDF document Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics, which had led to a \"benign\" attitude \"to the homosexual condition itself\" On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons clarified that the Church's position on homosexuality was that \"although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.\" [312] However, the document also condemned homophobic attacks and violence, stating that \"It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs.\" [312]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nIn an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of St John Lateran 6 June 2005, Benedict remarked on the issues of same-sex marriage and abortion: [319]\n\n\nInternational relations\nIn a message released 14 November 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of World Day for Migrants and Refugees, the Pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, exiles, evacuees and internally displaced persons \"The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families,\" the Pope said \"Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done.\" [324]\n\n\nMigrants and refugees\nIn a message released 14 November 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of World Day for Migrants and Refugees, the Pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, exiles, evacuees and internally displaced persons \"The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families,\" the Pope said \"Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done.\" [324]\n\n\nChina\nIn 2007, Benedict sent a letter at Easter to Catholics in China that could have wide-ranging implications for the Church's relationship with China's leadership The letter provides long-requested guidance to Chinese bishops on how to respond to illicitly ordained bishops, as well as how to strengthen ties with the Patriotic Association and the Communist government [327]\n\n\nKorea\nOn 13 November 2006, Benedict said that the dispute over the North Korea nuclear weapons program should be resolved through negotiations, in his first public comment on the security issue, a news report said \"The Holy See encourages bilateral or multilateral negotiations, convinced that the solution must be sought through peaceful means and in respect for agreements taken by all sides to obtain the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.\" Benedict was talking to the new Japanese ambassador to the Vatican [328]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn a 2004 Le Figaro interview, Ratzinger said that Turkey, which is demographically Muslim but governmentally secular by virtue of its state constitution, should seek its future in an association of Muslim nations rather

Benedict XVI\n\nIntroduction\nPope Benedict XVI, born Joseph Alois Ratzinger, was the head of the Catholic Church from 2005 to 2013 and was one of the most influential figures in the world. He was a German theologian and cardinal who served as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith before his papacy. Benedict XVI is known for his conservative views on Christian doctrine, his emphasis on the importance of tradition, and his efforts to promote ecumenism and interfaith dialogue.\n\nEarly Life: 1927–1951\nJoseph Alois Ratzinger was born on 16 April, Holy Saturday, 1927 at Schulstraße 11 at 8:30 in the morning in his parents' home in Marktl, Bavaria, Germany. He was the third and youngest child of Joseph Ratzinger Sr., a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (née Peintner); his grand-uncle was the German priest-politician Georg Ratzinger. Benedict's elder brother, Georg, became a Catholic priest and was the former director of the Regensburger Domspatzen choir. His sister, Maria, who never married, managed her brother Joseph's household until she died in 1991.\n\nWartime and Ordination\nRatzinger's family, especially his father, bitterly resented the Nazis, and his father's opposition to Nazism resulted in demotions and harassment of the family. Following his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was conscripted into the Hitler Youth – as membership was required by law for all 14-year-old German boys after March 1939 – but was an unenthusiastic member who refused to attend meetings, according to his brother. In 1941, one of Ratzinger's cousins, a 14-year-old boy with Down syndrome, was taken away by the Nazi regime and murdered during the Aktion T4 campaign of Nazi eugenics. In 1943, while still in seminary, he was drafted into the German anti-aircraft corps as Luftwaffenhelfer. Ratzinger then trained in the German infantry. As the Allied front drew closer to his post in 1945, he deserted back to his family's home in Traunstein after his unit had ceased to exist, just as American troops established a headquarters in the Ratzinger household. As a German soldier, he was interned in US prisoner of war camps, first in Neu-Ulm, then at Fliegerhorst (\"military airfield\") Bad Aibling (shortly to be repurposed as Bad Aibling Station) where he was at the time of Victory in Europe Day, and released on 19 June 1945.\n\nEncounter with Romano Guardini\nIn his early twenties, Ratzinger was deeply influenced by the thought of Italian German philosopher Romano Guardini, who taught in Munich from 1946 to 1951 when Ratzinger was studying in Freising and later at the University of Munich. The intellectual affinity between these two thinkers, who would later become decisive figures for the twentieth-century Catholic Church, was preoccupied with rediscovering the essentials of Christianity: Guardini wrote his 1938 The Essence of Christianity, while Ratzinger penned Introduction to Christianity, three decades later in 1968. Guardini inspired many in the Catholic social-democratic tradition, particularly the Communion and Liberation movement in the New Evangelization encouraged under the papacy of the Polish Pope John Paul II. Ratzinger wrote an introduction to a 1996 reissue of Guardini's 1954 The Lord.\n\nPre-papal career: 1951–2005\nRatzinger began as assistant pastor (curate) at the parish St Martin, Moosach, in Munich in 1951. Ratzinger became a professor at the University of Bonn in 1959, with his inaugural lecture on \"The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy\". In 1963, he moved to the University of Münster. During this period, he participated in the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) and served as a peritus (theological consultant) to Cardinal Frings of Cologne. He was viewed during the time of the council as a reformer, cooperating with theologians like Hans Küng and Edward Schillebeeckx. Ratzinger became an admirer of Karl Rahner, a well-known academic theologian of the Nouvelle théologie and a proponent of Church reform.\n\nArchbishop of Munich and Freising: 1977–1982\nOn 24 March 1977, Ratzinger was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising, and was ordained a bishop on 28 May. He took as his episcopal motto Cooperatores veritatis (Latin for 'cooperators of the truth'), from the Third Epistle of John, a choice on which he commented in his autobiographical work Milestones.\n\nPrefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: 1981–2005\nOn 25 November 1981, Pope John Paul II, upon the retirement of Franjo Šeper, named Ratzinger as the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, formerly known as the \"Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office\", the historical Roman Inquisition. Consequently, he resigned from his post in Munich in early 1982. He was promoted within the College of Cardinals to become Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni in 1993 and was made the college's vice-dean in 1998 and dean in 2002. Just a year after its foundation in 1990, Ratzinger joined the European Academy of Sciences and Arts in Salzburg.\n\nPapacy: 2005–2013\nIn April 2005, before his election as pope, Ratzinger was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time. While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near Regensburg and dedicate himself to writing books.\n\nElection to the papacy\nIn April 2005, before his election as pope, Ratzinger was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time. While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near Regensburg and dedicate himself to writing books.\n\nChoice of name\nBenedict XVI chose his papal name, which comes from the Latin word meaning \"the blessed\", in honour of both Benedict XV and Benedict of Nursia. Benedict XV was pope during the First World War, during which time he passionately pursued peace between the warring nations. St Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the Benedictine monasteries (most monasteries of the Middle Ages were of the Benedictine order) and the author of the Rule of Saint Benedict, which is still the most influential writing regarding the monastic life of Western Christianity. The Pope explained his choice of name during his first general audience in St Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005.\n\nTone of papacy\nDuring Benedict's inaugural Mass, the previous custom of every cardinal submitting to the pope was replaced by being greeted by twelve people, including cardinals, clergy, religious, a married couple, and some who were newly confirmed people; the cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon the election of the new pontiff. He began using an open-topped papal car, saying that he wanted to be closer to the people. Benedict continued the tradition of his predecessor John Paul II and baptized several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of each year, on the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome.\n\nBeatifications\nDuring his pontificate, Benedict XVI beatified 870 people. On 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Normally, five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Benedict, Camillo Ruini, vicar general of the Diocese of Rome and the official responsible for promoting the cause for canonization of any person who dies within that diocese, cited \"exceptional circumstances\" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the attempt on John Paul II's life. John Paul II often credited Our Lady of Fátima for preserving him on that day. Cardinal Ruini inaugurated the diocesan phase of the cause for beatification in the Lateran Basilica on 28 June 2005.\n\nCanonizations\nDuring his pontificate, Benedict XVI canonized 45 people. He celebrated his first canonizations on 23 October 2005 in St Peter's Square when he canonized Josef Bilczewski, Alberto Hurtado, Zygmunt Gorazdowski, Gaetano Catanoso, and Felice da Nicosia. The canonizations were part of a mass that marked the conclusion of the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops and the Year of the Eucharist. Benedict canonized Bishop Rafael Guízar y Valencia, Théodore Guérin, Filippo Smaldone, and Rosa Venerini on 15 October 2006.\n\nDoctors of the Church\nOn 7 October 2012, Benedict named Hildegard of Bingen and John of Ávila as Doctors of the Church, the 34th and 35th individuals so recognized in the history of Christianity.\n\nCuria reform\nBenedict made only modest changes to the structure of the Roman Curia. In March 2006, he placed both the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace under a single president, Cardinal Renato Martino. When Martino retired in 2009, each council received its own president once again. Also in March 2006, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue was briefly merged into the Pontifical Council for Culture under Cardinal Paul Poupard. Those Councils maintained their separate officials and staffs while their status and competencies continued unchanged, and in May 2007, Interreligious Dialogue was restored to its separate status again with its own president.\n\nTeachings\nAs pope, one of Benedict's main roles was to teach about the Catholic faith and the solutions to the problems of discerning and living the faith, a role that he could play well as a former head of the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (The main points of emphasis of his teachings are stated in more detail in Theology of Pope Benedict XVI.).\n\n\"Friendship with Jesus Christ\"\nAfter his first homily as pope, Benedict referred to both Jesus Christ and John Paul II, citing John Paul II's well-known words, \"Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!\", Benedict said:\n\n\"Dictatorship of relativism\"\nContinuing what he said in the pre-conclave Mass about what he often referred to as the \"central problem of our faith today\", Benedict also said:\n\nChristianity as religion according to reason\nIn the discussion with secularism and rationalism, one of Benedict's basic ideas can be found in his address on the \"Crisis of Culture\" in the West, a day before Pope John Paul II died, when he referred to Christianity as the \"religion of the Logos\" (the Greek for \"word\", \"reason\", \"meaning\", or \"intelligence\"). He said:\n\nEncyclicals\nBenedict wrote three encyclicals: Deus caritas est (Latin for \"God is Love\"), Spe salvi (\"Saved by Hope\"), and Caritas in veritate (\"Love in Truth\").\n\nPost-synodal apostolic exhortation\nSacramentum caritatis (The Sacrament of Charity), signed 22 February 2007, was released in Latin, Italian, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Polish. It was made available in various languages on 13 March 2007 in Rome. The English edition of Libera Editrice Vaticana is 158 pages. This apostolic exhortation \"seeks to take up the richness and variety of the reflections and proposals which emerged from the Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops\" which was held in 2006.\n\nMotu proprio on Tridentine Mass\nOn 7 July 2007, Benedict issued the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, declaring that upon \"the request of the faithful\", the celebration of Mass according to the Missal of 1962 (of the Tridentine Mass), was to be more easily permitted. Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass may now merely request permission from their local priest. While Summorum Pontificum directs that pastors should provide the Tridentine Mass upon the requests of the faithful, it also allows for any qualified priest to offer private celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, to which the faithful may be admitted if they wish. For regularly scheduled public celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, the permission of the priest in charge of the church is required.\n\nUnicity and salvific universality of the Catholic Church\nNear the end of June 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document approved by Benedict XVI because some contemporary theological interpretations of Vatican II's ecumenical intent had been \"erroneous or ambiguous\" and had prompted confusion and doubt. The document has been seen as restating \"key sections of a 2000 text the pope wrote when he was prefect of the congregation, Dominus Iesus.\"\n\nContraception and HIV/AIDS\nIn 2005, the Pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage, and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms. The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS. However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's teaching can occur.\n\nHomosexuality\nDuring his time as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), Cardinal Ratzinger made several efforts to tackle the issue of homosexuality within the Catholic Church and the wider world. In 1986 the CDF sent a letter to all bishops entitled: On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons. The letter condemned a liberal interpretation of the earlier CDF document Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics, which had led to a \"benign\" attitude \"to the homosexual condition itself.\" On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons clarified that the Church's position on homosexuality was that \"although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.\" However, the document also condemned homophobic attacks and violence, stating that \"It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs.\"\n\nSame-sex marriage\nIn an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of St John Lateran on 6 June 2005, Benedict remarked on the issues of same-sex marriage and abortion: \"We are living a moment of particular difficulty for the family, and for the Church. The institution of marriage is being threatened, as is the dignity and the vocation of women. The issue of same-sex unions is being discussed, and the question of abortion is being put on the agenda of many countries.\"\n\nMigrants and refugees\nIn a message released 14 November 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of World Day for Migrants and Refugees, the Pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, exiles, evacuees and internally displaced persons \"The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families,\" the Pope said \"Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done.\"\n\nChina\nIn 2007, Benedict sent a letter at Easter to Catholics in China that could have wide-ranging implications for the Church's relationship with China's leadership. The letter provides long-requested guidance to Chinese bishops on how to respond to illicitly ordained bishops, as well as how to strengthen ties with the Patriotic Association and the Communist government.\n\nKorea\nOn 13 November 2006, Benedict said that the dispute over the North Korea nuclear weapons program should be resolved through negotiations, in his first public comment on the security issue. \"The Holy See encourages bilateral or multilateral negotiations, convinced that the solution must be sought through peaceful means and in respect for agreements taken by all sides to obtain the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.\" Benedict was talking to the new Japanese ambassador to the Vatican.\n\nTurkey\nIn a 2004 Le Figaro interview, Ratzinger said that Turkey, which is demographically Muslim but governmentally secular by virtue of its state constitution, should seek its future in an association of Muslim nations rather than the European Union, which Ratzinger stated has Christian roots. He said Turkey had always been \"in permanent contrast to Europe and that linking it to Europe would be a mistake\".\n\nIsrael\nIn May 2009, Benedict visited Israel. This was the third Papal visit to the Holy Land, the previous ones being made by Paul VI in 1964 and John Paul II in 2000.\n\nVietnam\nVietnamese prime minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng met with Benedict at the Vatican on 25 January 2007 in a \"new and important step towards establishing diplomatic ties\". The Pope met with Vietnamese president Nguyễn Minh Triết on 11 December 2009. Vatican officials called the meeting \"a significant stage in the progress of bilateral relations with Vietnam\".\n\nGlobal economy\nIn July 2009, Benedict published his third encyclical, Caritas in veritate (Charity in truth), setting out the philosophical and moral foundations for human development, individually and collectively, in striving for the common good. This was the last encyclical of Benedict XVI's papacy.\n\nNuclear energy\nBenedict supported the peaceful use of nuclear energy as a tool for development and the fight against poverty. In his message for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the International Atomic Energy Agency, he confirmed: \"The Holy See, fully approving of the IAEA's goal, has been a member from the organisation's foundation and continues to support its activity\".\n\nPersonal life\nBenedict was known to be deeply interested in classical music. His favourite composer was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, of whose music he said: \"His music is by no means just entertainment; it contains the whole tragedy of human existence\". Benedict also stated that Mozart's music affected him greatly as a young man and \"deeply penetrated his soul\". Benedict's favourite works of music were Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet. He recorded an album of contemporary classical music in which he sings and recites prayers to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nCats\nBenedict was also known to be fond of cats.

celebrated his first canonizations on 23 October 2005 in St Peter's Square when he canonized Josef Bilczewski, Alberto Hurtado, Zygmunt Gorazdowski, Gaetano Catanoso, and Felice da Nicosia The canonizations were part of a mass that marked the conclusion of the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops and the Year of the Eucharist [90] Benedict canonized Bishop Rafael Guízar y Valencia, Théodore Guérin, Filippo Smaldone, and Rosa Venerini on 15 October 2006.\n\n\nDoctors of the Church\nOn 7 October 2012, Benedict named Hildegard of Bingen and John of Ávila as Doctors of the Church, the 34th and 35th individuals so recognized in the history of Christianity [101]\n\n\nCuria reform\nBenedict made only modest changes to the structure of the Roman Curia In March 2006, he placed both the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace under a single president, Cardinal Renato Martino When Martino retired in 2009, each council received its own president once again Also in March 2006, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue was briefly merged into the Pontifical Council for Culture under Cardinal Paul Poupard Those Councils maintained their separate officials and staffs while their status and competencies continued unchanged, and in May 2007, Interreligious Dialogue was restored to its separate status again with its own president [102] In June 2010, Benedict created the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelization, appointing Archbishop Rino Fisichella its first president [103] On 16 January 2013, the Pope transferred responsibility for catechesis from the Congregation for the Clergy to the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization [104]\n\n\nTeachings\nAs pope, one of Benedict's main roles was to teach about the Catholic faith and the solutions to the problems of discerning and living the faith, [105] a role that he could play well as a former head of the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (The main points of emphasis of his teachings are stated in more detail in Theology of Pope Benedict XVI.)\n\n\n\"Friendship with Jesus Christ\"\nAfter his first homily as pope, Benedict referred to both Jesus Christ and John Paul II Citing John Paul II's well-known words, \"Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!\", Benedict said:\n\n\n\"Dictatorship of relativism\"\nContinuing what he said in the pre-conclave Mass about what he often referred to as the \"central problem of our faith today\", [113] on 6 June 2005, Benedict also said:\n\n\nChristianity as religion according to reason\nIn the discussion with secularism and rationalism, one of Benedict's basic ideas can be found in his address on the \"Crisis of Culture\" in the West, a day before Pope John Paul II died, when he referred to Christianity as the \"religion of the Logos\" (the Greek for \"word\", \"reason\", \"meaning\", or \"intelligence\") He said:\n\n\nEncyclicals\nBenedict wrote three encyclicals: Deus caritas est (Latin for \"God is Love\"), Spe salvi (\"Saved by Hope\"), and Caritas in veritate (\"Love in Truth\").\n\n\nPost-synodal apostolic exhortation\nSacramentum caritatis (The Sacrament of Charity), signed 22 February 2007, was released in Latin, Italian, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Polish It was made available in various languages on 13 March 2007 in Rome The English edition of Libera Editrice Vaticana is 158 pages This apostolic exhortation \"seeks to take up the richness and variety of the reflections and proposals which emerged from the Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops\" which was held in 2006 [128]\n\n\nMotu proprio on Tridentine Mass\nOn 7 July 2007, Benedict issued the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, declaring that upon \"the request of the faithful\", the celebration of Mass according to the Missal of 1962 (of the Tridentine Mass), was to be more easily permitted Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass may now merely request permission from their local priest [129] While Summorum Pontificum directs that pastors should provide the Tridentine Mass upon the requests of the faithful, it also allows for any qualified priest to offer private celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, to which the faithful may be admitted if they wish [130] For regularly scheduled public celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, the permission of the priest in charge of the church is required [131]\n\n\nUnicity and salvific universality of the Catholic Church\nNear the end of June 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document approved by Benedict XVI \"because some contemporary theological interpretations of Vatican II's ecumenical intent had been 'erroneous or ambiguous' and had prompted confusion and doubt.\" The document has been seen as restating \"key sections of a 2000 text the pope wrote when he was prefect of the congregation, Dominus Iesus.\" [136]\n\n\nConsumerism\nBenedict condemned excessive consumerism, especially among youth He stated in December 2007 that \" [A]dolescents, youths and even children are easy victims of the corruption of love, deceived by unscrupulous adults who, lying to themselves and to them, draw them into the dead-end streets of consumerism.\" [137] In June 2009, he blamed outsourcing for the greater availability of consumer goods which lead to the downsizing of social security systems [138]\n\n\nEcumenism\nSpeaking at his weekly audience in St Peter's Square on 7 June 2006, Benedict asserted that Jesus himself had entrusted the leadership of the Church to his apostle Peter \"Peter's responsibility thus consists of guaranteeing the communion with Christ Let us pray so that the primacy of Peter, entrusted to poor human beings, may always be exercised in this original sense desired by the Lord, so that it will be increasingly recognised in its true meaning by brothers who are still not in communion with us.\" [139]\n\n\nInterfaith dialogue\nWhen Benedict ascended to the papacy, his election was welcomed by the Anti-Defamation League who noted \"his great sensitivity to Jewish history and the Holocaust\" [146] However, his election received a more reserved response from British Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who hoped that Benedict would \"continue along the path of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II in working to enhance relations with the Jewish people and the State of Israel.\" [147] Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom also offered tentative praise, though Shalom believed that \"this Pope, considering his historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism.\" [147]\n\n\nJudaism\nWhen Benedict ascended to the papacy, his election was welcomed by the Anti-Defamation League who noted \"his great sensitivity to Jewish history and the Holocaust\" [146] However, his election received a more reserved response from British Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who hoped that Benedict would \"continue along the path of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II in working to enhance relations with the Jewish people and the State of Israel.\" [147] Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom also offered tentative praise, though Shalom believed that \"this Pope, considering his historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism.\" [147]\n\n\nIslam\nBenedict's relations with Islam were strained at times On 12 September 2006, he delivered a lecture which touched on Islam at the University of Regensburg in Germany He had served there as a professor of theology before becoming Pope, and his lecture was entitled \"Faith, Reason and the University – Memories and Reflections\" The lecture received much attention from political and religious authorities Many Islamic politicians and religious leaders registered their protest against what they labelled an insulting mischaracterization of Islam, although his focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and its effect on the religion [158] [159] Muslims were particularly offended by a passage that the Pope quoted in his speech: \"Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.\" [159]\n\n\nBuddhism\nThe Dalai Lama congratulated Benedict XVI upon his election, [165] and visited him in October 2006 in Vatican City In 2007, the People's Republic of China was accused of using its political influence to stop a meeting between the Pope and the Dalai Lama [166]\n\n\nIndigenous American beliefs\nWhile visiting Brazil in May 2007, \"the pope sparked controversy by saying that native populations had been 'silently longing' for the Christian faith brought to South America by colonizers.\" [167] The Pope continued, stating that \"the proclamation of Jesus and of his Gospel did not at any point involve an alienation of the pre-Columbus cultures, nor was it the imposition of a foreign culture.\" [167] Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez demanded an apology, and an indigenous organization in Ecuador issued a response which stated that \"representatives of the Catholic Church of those times, with honourable exceptions, were accomplices, deceivers and beneficiaries of one of the most horrific genocides of all humanity.\" [167] Later, the Pope, speaking Italian, said at a weekly audience that it was \"not possible to forget the suffering and the injustices inflicted by colonizers against the indigenous population, whose fundamental human rights were often trampled\" but made no apology [168]\n\n\nHinduism\nWhile visiting the United States on 17 April 2008, Benedict met with International Society for Krishna Consciousness representative Radhika Ramana Dasa, [169] a noted Hindu scholar [170] and disciple of Hanumatpreshaka Swami [171] On behalf of the Hindu American community, Radhika Ramana Dasa presented a gift of an Om symbol to Benedict [172] [173]\n\n\nPastoral visits and security\nAs pontiff, Benedict carried out numerous Apostolic activities, including journeys in Italy and across the world.\n\n\nSexual abuse in the Catholic Church\nPrior to 2001, the primary responsibility for investigating allegations of sexual abuse and disciplining perpetrators rested with the individual dioceses In 2001, Ratzinger convinced John Paul II to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in charge of all sexual abuse investigations [196] [197] According to John L Allen Jr., Ratzinger in the following years \"acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim Driven by that encounter with what he would later refer to as 'filth' in the Church, Ratzinger seems to have undergone something of a 'conversion experience' throughout 2003–04 From that point forward, he and his staff seemed driven by a convert's zeal to clean up the mess.\" [198]\n\n\nAs Archbishop of Munich and Freising\nDespite being more proactive than his predecessor in addressing sexual abuse, Benedict was nonetheless cited as failing to do so on more than one occasion In January 2022, a report written by German law firm Westpfahl Spilker Wastl and commissioned by the Catholic Church concluded that Cardinal Ratzinger failed to adequately take action against clerics in four cases of alleged abuse while he was Archbishop of Munich and Freising from 1977 to 1982 The pope emeritus denied the accusations [209] [210] [211] Benedict corrected his former statement that he had not been at a meeting of the ordinariate of the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising in January 1980, saying he mistakenly told German investigators he was not there However, the error was \"not done out of bad faith\", but \"the result of an error in the editorial processing\" of his statement According to Reuters, lawyer Martin Pusch said that \"in a total of four cases, we have come to the conclusion that the then Archbishop Cardinal Ratzinger can be accused of misconduct in cases of sexual abuse.\" [212] [213]\n\n\nLegion of Christ founder Marcial Maciel\nOne of the cases Ratzinger pursued involved Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse Biographer Andrea Tornielli suggested that Cardinal Ratzinger had wanted to take action against Maciel but that John Paul II and other high-ranking officials, including several cardinals and the Pope's influential secretary Stanisław Dziwisz, prevented him from doing so [197] [202]\n\n\nTheodore McCarrick controversy\nIn November 2020, the Vatican published a report blaming Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI for allowing defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick to rise in power despite the fact that they both knew of sex abuse allegations against him [218] [219] Despite the fact that Benedict pressured McCarrick to resign as Archbishop of Washington D.C in 2006, McCarrick remained very active in ministry throughout Benedict's papacy and even made a very public appearance when he presided over US senator Ted Kennedy's burial service at Arlington National Cemetery in 2009 [218] [219] [220]\n\n\nPost-papacy\nIn 2019, Benedict released a 6,000-word letter that attributed the Church's sexual abuse crisis to an erosion of morality driven by secularization and the sexual revolution of the 1960s [221] The letter was in sharp contrast to the viewpoint of his successor, Francis, who saw the issue as a byproduct of abuses of power within the Church's hierarchical structure [221] The New York Times later reported that \"given his frail health at the time, however, many church watchers questioned whether Benedict had indeed written the letter or had been manipulated to issue it as a way to undercut Francis.\" [222]\n\n\nAttire\nBenedict re-introduced several papal garments which had fallen into disuse He resumed the use of the traditional red papal shoes, which had been used since Roman times by popes but which had fallen into disuse during the pontificate of John Paul II Contrary to the initial speculation of the press that the shoes had been made by the Italian fashion house Prada, the Vatican announced that the shoes were provided by the Pope's personal shoemaker [224]\n\n\nHealth\nPrior to his election as pope in 2005, Ratzinger had hoped to retire – on account of age-related health problems, a long-held desire to have free time to write, and the retirement age for bishops (75) – and submitted his resignation as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three times, but continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of John Paul II In September 1991, Ratzinger suffered a haemorrhagic stroke, which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily but from which he recovered completely [225] This was never officially made public – the official news was that he had fallen and struck his head against a radiator – but was an open secret known to the conclave that elected him pope [226]\n\n\nResignation\nOn 11 February 2013, the Vatican confirmed that Benedict would resign the papacy on 28 February 2013, as a result of his advanced age, [231] becoming the first pope to resign since Gregory XII in 1415 [232] At the age of 85 years and 318 days on the effective date of his retirement, he was the fourth-oldest person to hold the office of pope The move was unexpected, [233] as all popes in modern times had held office until death Benedict was the first pope to resign without external pressure since Celestine V in 1294 [234] [235]\n\n\nPope emeritus: 2013–2022\nOn the morning of 28 February 2013, Benedict met with the full College of Cardinals and in the early afternoon flew by helicopter to the papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo He stayed there until refurbishment was completed on his retirement home, the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican Gardens near St Peter's, former home of twelve nuns, where he moved on 2 May 2013 [243] [244]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nOn 28 December 2022, Pope Francis said at the end of his audience that Benedict was \"very sick\" and asked God to \"comfort him and support him in this testimony of love for the Church until the end\" [285] The same day, Matteo Bruni, the director of the Holy See Press Office, stated that \"in the last few hours there has been an aggravation of Benedict's health due to advancing age\" and that he was under medical care Bruni also stated that Francis visited Benedict at the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery after the audience [286] [287]\n\n\nWorsening health and death\nOn 28 December 2022, Pope Francis said at the end of his audience that Benedict was \"very sick\" and asked God to \"comfort him and support him in this testimony of love for the Church until the end\" [285] The same day, Matteo Bruni, the director of the Holy See Press Office, stated that \"in the last few hours there has been an aggravation of Benedict's health due to advancing age\" and that he was under medical care Bruni also stated that Francis visited Benedict at the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery after the audience [286] [287]\n\n\nFuneral\nFrom 2 to 4 January 2023, Benedict's body lay in state in St Peter's Basilica, during which around 195,000 people paid their respects [291] His funeral took place on 5 January 2023 in St Peter's Square at 9:30 am, presided over by Pope Francis and celebrated by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re [292] This was the first time since 1802 that a pope had attended a funeral for his predecessor [293] The funeral was attended by an estimated 50,000 people [294] Some attendees held signs reading or shouted \"Santo subito\", calling for his elevation to sainthood, a cry heard previously at the funeral of John Paul II [295] Benedict was interred in the crypt beneath St Peter's Basilica, in the same tomb originally occupied by John Paul II and John XXIII [294] The tomb was opened to the public on 8 January 2023 [296]\n\n\nTitles and styles\n\nAs Pope, Benedict's rarely used full title was:\n\nPositions on morality and politics\nIn 2005, the Pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage, and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms [307] The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS [308] However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's teaching can occur [309] TIME also reported in its edition of 30 April 2006 that the Vatican's position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials \"flatly dismiss [ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use.\" [309]\n\n\nContraception and HIV/AIDS\nIn 2005, the Pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage, and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms [307] The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS [308] However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's teaching can occur [309] TIME also reported in its edition of 30 April 2006 that the Vatican's position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials \"flatly dismiss [ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use.\" [309]\n\n\nHomosexuality\nDuring his time as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), Cardinal Ratzinger made several efforts to tackle the issue of homosexuality within the Catholic Church and the wider world In 1986 the CDF sent a letter to all bishops entitled: On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons The letter condemned a liberal interpretation of the earlier CDF document Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics, which had led to a \"benign\" attitude \"to the homosexual condition itself\" On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons clarified that the Church's position on homosexuality was that \"although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.\" [312] However, the document also condemned homophobic attacks and violence, stating that \"It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs.\" [312]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nIn an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of St John Lateran 6 June 2005, Benedict remarked on the issues of same-sex marriage and abortion: [319]\n\n\nInternational relations\nIn a message released 14 November 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of World Day for Migrants and Refugees, the Pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, exiles, evacuees and internally displaced persons \"The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families,\" the Pope said \"Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done.\" [324]\n\n\nMigrants and refugees\nIn a message released 14 November 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of World Day for Migrants and Refugees, the Pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, exiles, evacuees and internally displaced persons \"The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families,\" the Pope said \"Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done.\" [324]\n\n\nChina\nIn 2007, Benedict sent a letter at Easter to Catholics in China that could have wide-ranging implications for the Church's relationship with China's leadership The letter provides long-requested guidance to Chinese bishops on how to respond to illicitly ordained bishops, as well as how to strengthen ties with the Patriotic Association and the Communist government [327]\n\n\nKorea\nOn 13 November 2006, Benedict said that the dispute over the North Korea nuclear weapons program should be resolved through negotiations, in his first public comment on the security issue, a news report said \"The Holy See encourages bilateral or multilateral negotiations, convinced that the solution must be sought through peaceful means and in respect for agreements taken by all sides to obtain the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.\" Benedict was talking to the new Japanese ambassador to the Vatican [328]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn a 2004 Le Figaro interview, Ratzinger said that Turkey, which is demographically Muslim but governmentally secular by virtue of its state constitution, should seek its future in an association of Muslim nations rather than the European Union, which Ratzinger stated has Christian roots He said Turkey had always been \"in permanent contrast to Europe and that linking it to Europe would be a mistake\" [329]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn May 2009, Benedict visited Israel [333] [334] This was the third Papal visit to the Holy Land, the previous ones being made by Paul VI in 1964 and John Paul II in 2000.\n\n\nVietnam\nVietnamese prime minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng met with Benedict at the Vatican on 25 January 2007 in a \"new and important step towards establishing diplomatic ties\" [335] The Pope met with Vietnamese president Nguyễn Minh Triết on 11 December 2009 Vatican officials called the meeting \"a significant stage in the progress of bilateral relations with Vietnam.\" [336]\n\n\nGlobal economy\nIn July 2009, Benedict published his third encyclical, Caritas in veritate [337] (Charity in truth), setting out the philosophical and moral foundations for human development, individually and collectively, in striving for the common good This was the last encyclical of Benedict XVI's papacy.\n\n\nNuclear energy\nBenedict supported the peaceful use of nuclear energy as a tool for development and the fight against poverty In his message for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the International Atomic Energy Agency, he confirmed: \"The Holy See, fully approving of the IAEA's goal, has been a member from the organisation's foundation and continues to support its activity.\" [340]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBenedict was known to be deeply interested in classical music, [22] and was an accomplished pianist [341] His favourite composer was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, of whose music he said: \"His music is by no means just entertainment; it contains the whole tragedy of human existence.\" [342] Benedict also stated that Mozart's music affected him greatly as a young man and \"deeply penetrated his soul\" [342] Benedict's favourite works of music were Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet [343] He recorded an album of contemporary classical music in which he sings and recites prayers to the Blessed Virgin Mary [344] The album was set for release on 30 November 2009.\n\n\nInterest in classical music\nBenedict was known to be deeply interested in classical music, [22] and was an accomplished pianist [341] His favourite composer was Wolfgang Amadeus

as a young man and \"deeply penetrated his soul\" [342] Benedict's favourite works of music were Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet [343] He recorded an album of contemporary classical music in which he sings and recites prayers to the Blessed Virgin Mary [344] The album was set for release on 30 November 2009.\n\n\nCats\nBenedict was also known to be fond of cats [22] As Cardinal Ratzinger, he was known (according to former neighbours) to look after stray cats in his neighbourhood, Borgo A book called Joseph and Chico: A Cat Recounts the Life of Pope Benedict XVI was published in 2007 which told the story of the Pope's life from the feline Chico's perspective This story was inspired by an orange tabby Pentling cat, which belonged to the family next door [345] During his trip to Australia for World Youth Day in 2008, the media reported that festival organizers lent the Pope a grey cat called Bella [346] to keep him company during his stay [347]\n\n\nSocial network use\nIn December 2012, the Vatican announced that Benedict XVI had joined social networking website Twitter, under the handle @Pontifex [348] His first tweet was made on 12 December and was \"Dear friends, I am pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter Thank you for your generous response I bless all of you from my heart.\" [349] On 28 February 2013, the day he retired, the tweets were archived, and @Pontifex read \"Sede Vacante\" [350] Pope Francis took control of the @Pontifex account upon his election [351]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nA variety of awards and honours were given to

to do something that was so different\", Sheen has said of the role \"I usually play very extreme characters.\" [63] Also in 2002, he had a minor role in the action-adventure film The Four Feathers

success [108] but Sheen initially accepted the role as a favour to his friends and \"never thought it was going anywhere\" [109] The Guardian said the actor \"exactly captures Frost's verbal tics and mannerisms while suggesting a nervousness behind the self-assurance\" [110] \"He's got the voice, the mannerisms, the blaze,\" said the Financial Times, \"but, more than that, Sheen – as viscerally exciting an actor as any in Britain today – shows us the hunger of Frost's ambition . and fox-like instinct for the hunt and the kill.\" [111] Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and a Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance [112] [113] Sheen next appeared in the 2007 film Music Within as a political activist with cerebral palsy He spoke of having a

Telegraph felt his \"lively hamming as a cane-swishing nightclub owner merely underlines how impersonal—how inhuman—much else here is\" [144] However, USA Today felt his \"scenery-chewing performance .. is meant as comic relief, but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring\" [145] In other 2010 film work, Sheen voiced Nivens McTwisp, the White Rabbit, in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland [146] and Dr Griffiths in Disney's Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue [147] and appeared as a terrorist in Unthinkable [148] On television, Sheen's performance in the

contemplating a return to the Chili Peppers, rejoined the group after being encouraged by Flea [19]\n\n\nMainstream success and side projects (1989–1998)\nFlea and his wife Loesha started to grow apart, and he began trying to recreate the memories of his adolescence by smoking marijuana on a daily basis [26] The Chili Peppers entered the studio, and completed recording of their fourth album, Mother's Milk, in early 1989 Upon release, the album was met with mixed reactions from critics, but received far more commercial attention, peaking at number 52 on the Billboard 200 [23] After this, Flea made appearances playing the trumpet on Jane's Addiction's 1988 album Nothing's Shocking, [29] and bass on the critically acclaimed 1989 Young MC album Stone Cold Rhymin' He would also appear in the video for \"Bust a Move\", the hit single from the same album [30]\n\n\nCalifornication, By the Way and Stadium Arcadium (1998–2007)\nWith Frusciante back on guitar, the band began writing new songs during the summer of 1998 in Flea's garage [17] He and Kiedis were less confident in writing the album after the disappointing results of One Hot Minute [17] Flea had also recently broken up with his girlfriend of two years, Marissa Pouw, causing him to enter a state of depression [48] which was only lifted when his daughter, Clara who was 10 years old, comforted him after several weeks of crying [17]\n\n\nReturn to school, Atoms for Peace, and Rocket Juice & the Moon (2008–2011)\nAfter the Chili Peppers announced a long hiatus due to exhaustion, Flea enrolled in music classes at the University of Southern California, where he studied music theory, composition and jazz trumpet Flea attributed his interest to a newfound desire to widen his appreciation and understanding of music: \"It's so much fun to learn this stuff because I never knew anything I played trumpet in the school bands I learned things I liked to play on my trumpet but I didn't learn why this note goes with this note and why it produces that sound Or how to create tension in the composition  [...] Knowing the structure is really fun.\" [56] Flea said he planned to release a mainly instrumental solo record, recorded in his home; guest musicians would include Patti Smith and a choir from the Silverlake Conservatory [56]\n\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Helen Burns, and The Getaway (2012–2017)\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2012 Flea said: \"It's always been easy for me to pooh-pooh these awards—the  [Rock] Hall of Fame too But I inducted Metallica a couple of years ago, and it was really a beautiful thing to see as all these people were being inducted It made me love it I love halls of fame anyway—the Basketball Hall of Fame, the Baseball Hall of Fame So I feel grateful for the recognition of what we have done and for the hope and potential of what we'll continue to do.\" [67]\n\n\nGang of Four tribute, Unlimited Love, Return of the Dream Canteen, and Bonfire of Teenagers (2019–present)\nIn December 2019, the Red Hot Chili Peppers announced that guitarist John Frusciante would be returning to replace Josh Klinghoffer The band then focussed on preparations for making a new album, which they originally hoped to have released in 2020, along with performing on a few festival dates [73] Since the summer of 2020, the Chili Peppers had been working on their twelfth studio album; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been delays in the writing and recording, with their 2020 tour dates being postponed until 2021.\n\n\nFilm and television\nFlea has pursued a minor acting career since the mid-1980s His first role was as young punk Razzle in the Penelope Spheeris film Suburbia (1984) Shortly thereafter he starred alongside the Chili Peppers, who played themselves, in the skate drama Thrashin' (1986) He played the ill-fated punker Milo in another Penelope Spheeris film, Dudes (1987) He also made an appearance in the Bruce Weber documentary film about the life and career of jazz trumpeter Chet Baker entitled Let's Get Lost (1988) He portrayed the character Douglas J Needles in Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990), though in an interview he referred to Part II as \"a multi-million-dollar piece of trash\", saying that he was happy neither with the film nor his performance in it [78]\n\n\nPersonal life\nFlea has been married twice and has three children From 1988 to 1990, Flea was married to Canadian Loesha Zeviar (Loesha's name remains

Rams, and most notably the Los Angeles Lakers Flea has held Lakers season tickets since 1988 and can often be spotted sitting courtside at Lakers games with some of his bandmates [113] Two songs recorded for the 1989 album Mother's Milk were tribute songs to Hall-of-Fame Lakers players Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar [114] Flea performed the national anthem on April 13, 2016, in honor of Kobe Bryant's final game with the team before his retirement [115] [116] Following the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, Flea and the Chili Peppers performed an impromptu pregame show for fans

battery, after the two were accused of \"attacking a woman\" in the audience of one of their performances; [needs update] [122] as reported by a ranger from Volusia County:\n\nActivism and philanthropy\nFlea and the Chili Peppers appeared in 1992 PSA ads for Rock the Vote, a non-profit organization created to encourage 18- to 24-year-olds in the United States to vote in the upcoming presidential election.\n\n\nAcid for the Children\nIn April 2014, Flea began writing his memoir The original scope of the book was to chronicle Flea's unconventional childhood (including his move from a \"normal\" life in the New York suburbs to a \"bohemian\" lifestyle in Los Angeles with his jazz-playing stepfather), his adventures in the L.A streets, his \"sometimes complex friendship and collaboration\" with Chili Peppers co-founder Anthony Kiedis and the overall \"tumultuous creative journey\" of the band, which formed in 1983 [144]\n\n\nInstruments and sound\nFlea has employed a wide variety of basses over his career with some varying exclusivity, such as Music Man, Modulus, his own brand Fleabass, and Fender Jazz and Precisions [145]\n\n\nBasses\nFlea has employed a wide

with the goal to create quality budget basses for beginners Whilst Flea did not perform with his own Fleabass production model he did however use a custom model created by UK artist Damien Hirst.\n\n\nFender Custom Shop\nIn The Getaway and 2022-2024 Global Stadium tours, Flea uses four Custom Shop Fender Jazz basses \n\n\nAtoms for Peace Basses\nAccording to thekingofgear.com, Flea uses

Canteen (both released in 2022), he used the following amps: [162]\n\n\nMusical style\nFlea has displayed a wide variety of techniques throughout the years, ranging from his initial use of slapping and popping to the more traditional methods he has employed since Blood Sugar Sex Magik Greg Prato of Allmusic wrote that \"by combining funk-style bass with psychedelic, punk, and hard rock, Flea created an original playing style that has been copied numerous times\" Flea stated in an interview, that he was influenced greatly by Louis Armstrong [4] Flea has been considered one of the greatest bassists of all time, with Greg Tate of Rolling Stone saying \"if there were a Most Valuable Bass Player award given out in rock, Flea could have laid claim to that bitch ten years running\" [164] Smashing Pumpkins front man Billy Corgan recalls, that when he first saw the Chili Peppers in 1984, \"Flea was playing so aggressively that he had worn a hole in his thumb and he was literally screaming in pain in-between songs because it hurt so bad Someone kept coming out and pouring crazy glue into the hole.\" [14] Flea's sound is also determined by what type of instrument he plays Before Californication, he did not believe the actual bass held much significance: \"what mattered was how you hit them  [basses] and your emotional intent, and I still think that's the bottom line.\" [149]\n\n\nTechnique\nAny instrument is just a vehicle to express who you are and your relationship to the world No matter what level you're doing it on, playing music is an opportunity to give something to the world.\n\n\nInfluences\nFlea's stepfather was in a bebop jazz band that frequently jammed in his presence, so he soon became fascinated with the trumpet [4] [14] [17] Flea credits his continued interest in music to jazz performers like Jaco Pastorius, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, and Dizzy Gillespie [3] After Kiedis introduced him to punk and rock, Flea became infatuated with artists such as Black Flag, David Bowie, and Defunkt [10] [17] Flea's early influences before Blood Sugar Sex Magik were mainly funk artists They would become a notable aspect of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound up to Mother's Milk Originally, Flea was given the impression by punk bands, that one should play as hard and fast as they possibly could, but ultimately rejected this philosophy during Blood Sugar Sex Magik: \"I was so into being raw  [...] it was all bullshit.\" [149] On Californication and By the Way, Flea drew influence from electronica, gothic rock bands like the Cure, Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees and new wave music rather than funk [123] Flea has also spoken highly of Neil Young; he wrote an article for Rolling Stone praising Young for the consistent authenticity in his artistry, among other things [168]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 2009, Rolling Stone's readers ranked Flea the second-best bassist of all time, behind John Entwistle of the Who and ahead of Paul McCartney of the Beatles [169] In a 2010 poll conducted on the BBC Two series I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band!, Flea was named the bassist in the ultimate fantasy band alongside Freddie Mercury on vocals, Jimi Hendrix on guitar and John Bonham on drums [170] In April 2011, Flea was voted the second-best rock bassist in a poll conducted by Contact Music, behind Entwistle and ahead of McCartney, Geddy Lee of Rush and Les Claypool of Primus [171]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nNon-Red Hot Chili Peppers

"**Flea (musician)**\n\nMichael Peter Balzary, known professionally as Flea, is an Australian-American musician, best known as the bassist and founding member of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. Born on October 16, 1962, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, Flea has become one of the most influential and iconic bassists in the history of rock music.\n\n**Early life**\n\nFlea was born to Mick Balzary, an avid fisherman, and his wife, Patricia. Flea's father's passion for fishing had a significant impact on his early life, as the family would often go on fishing trips together. When Flea was four years old, his family moved to Rye, New York, for his father's career. However, in 1971, his parents divorced, and his father returned to Australia. Flea, along with his sister Karyn, stayed with their mother, Patricia, who subsequently married jazz musician Walter Urban. Flea would go on to spend three years of his life in Canberra, completing his education.\n\n**Career**\n\nFlea's musical journey began in the early 1980s, when he formed a band with his friend Anthony Kiedis, known as Anthym. The band was short-lived, but it laid the foundation for what would become the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band changed its name to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and began playing shows at local venues in Los Angeles. Their repertoire grew to nine songs, and they eventually secured a record deal with EMI. The band's debut album, \"The Red Hot Chili Peppers,\" was released in 1984 to largely poor critical and commercial reviews.\n\n**Early Red Hot Chili Peppers albums (1984-1987)**\n\nThe band's early days were marked by constant lineup changes, with Flea and Kiedis hiring and firing various musicians. The band's first album was a commercial and critical failure, but it laid the groundwork for their future success. Flea and Kiedis hired drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill the spots left vacant by the band's original drummer and guitarist. The band's second album, \"Freaky Styley,\" was released in 1985 to mixed reviews, but it marked a significant improvement over their debut album.\n\n**Mainstream success and side projects (1989-1998)**\n\nThe band's breakthrough album, \"Mother's Milk,\" was released in 1989 to mixed reviews, but it received far more commercial attention, peaking at number 52 on the Billboard 200. Flea made appearances playing the trumpet on Jane's Addiction's \"Nothing's Shocking\" and bass on the critically acclaimed Young MC album \"Stone Cold Rhymin'.\" He would also appear in the video for \"Bust a Move,\" the hit single from the same album.\n\n**Californication, By the Way, and Stadium Arcadium (1998-2007)**\n\nWith guitarist John Frusciante back on board, the band began writing new songs during the summer of 1998 in Flea's garage. The band's seventh studio album, \"Californication,\" was released in 1999 to critical acclaim and commercial success, peaking at number 4 on the Billboard 200. Flea had recently broken up with his girlfriend of two years, Marissa Pouw, causing him to enter a state of depression, which was only lifted when his daughter, Clara, comforted him after several weeks of crying.\n\n**Return to school, Atoms for Peace, and Rocket Juice & the Moon (2008-2011)**\n\nAfter the Chili Peppers announced a long hiatus due to exhaustion, Flea enrolled in music classes at the University of Southern California, where he studied music theory, composition, and jazz trumpet.

\"It's so much fun to learn this stuff because I never knew anything I played trumpet in the school bands I learned things I liked to play on my trumpet but I didn't learn why this note goes with this note and why it produces that sound Or how to create tension in the composition  [...] Knowing the structure is really fun.\" [56] Flea said he planned to release a mainly instrumental solo record, recorded in his home; guest musicians would include Patti Smith and a choir from the Silverlake Conservatory [56]\n\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Helen Burns, and The Getaway (2012–2017)\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2012 Flea said: \"It's always been easy for me to pooh-pooh these awards—the  [Rock] Hall of Fame too But I inducted Metallica a couple of years ago, and it was really a beautiful thing to see as all these people were being inducted It made me love it I love halls of fame anyway—the Basketball Hall of Fame, the Baseball Hall of Fame So I feel grateful for the recognition of what we have done and for the hope and potential of what we'll continue to do.\" [67]\n\n\nGang of Four tribute, Unlimited Love, Return of the Dream Canteen, and Bonfire of Teenagers (2019–present)\nIn December 2019, the Red Hot Chili Peppers announced that guitarist John Frusciante would be returning to replace Josh Klinghoffer The band then focussed on preparations for making a new album, which they originally hoped to have released in 2020, along with performing on a few festival dates [73] Since the summer of 2020, the Chili Peppers had been working on their twelfth studio album; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been delays in the writing and recording, with their 2020 tour dates being postponed until 2021.\n\n\nFilm and television\nFlea has pursued a minor acting career since the mid-1980s His first role was as young punk Razzle in the Penelope Spheeris film Suburbia (1984) Shortly thereafter he starred alongside the Chili Peppers, who played themselves, in the skate drama Thrashin' (1986) He played the ill-fated punker Milo in another Penelope Spheeris film, Dudes (1987) He also made an appearance in the Bruce Weber documentary film about the life and career of jazz trumpeter Chet Baker entitled Let's Get Lost (1988) He portrayed the character Douglas J Needles in Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990), though in an interview he referred to Part II as \"a multi-million-dollar piece of trash\", saying that he was happy neither with the film nor his performance in it [78]\n\n\nPersonal life\nFlea has been married twice and has three children From 1988 to 1990, Flea was married to Canadian Loesha Zeviar (Loesha's name remains tattooed on Flea's chest) Their daughter, Clara Louise Zeviar Balzary, was born in 1988 Clara was featured in the band's Funky Monks documentary She also has appeared at many shows and, as a child,

Rams, and most notably the Los Angeles Lakers Flea has held Lakers season tickets since 1988 and can often be spotted sitting courtside at Lakers games with some of his bandmates [113] Two songs

of Kobe Bryant's final game with the team before his retirement [115] [116] Following the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, Flea and the Chili Peppers performed an impromptu pregame show for fans

was arrested in Daytona Beach, Florida, and charged with battery, disorderly conduct, and solicitation to commit an unnatural and lascivious act, and Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith was charged with battery, after the two were accused of \"attacking a woman\" in the audience of one of their performances; [needs update] [122] as reported by a ranger from Volusia County:\n\nActivism and philanthropy\nFlea and the Chili Peppers appeared in 1992 PSA ads for Rock the Vote, a non-profit organization created to encourage 18- to 24-year-olds in the United States to vote in the upcoming presidential election.\n\n\nAcid for the Children\nIn April 2014, Flea began writing his memoir The original scope of the book was to chronicle Flea's unconventional childhood (including his move from a \"normal\" life in the New York suburbs to a \"bohemian\" lifestyle in Los Angeles with his jazz-playing stepfather), his adventures in the L.A streets, his \"sometimes complex friendship and collaboration\" with Chili Peppers co-founder Anthony Kiedis and the overall \"tumultuous creative journey\" of the band, which formed in 1983 [144]\n\n\nInstruments and sound\nFlea has employed a wide variety of basses over his career with some varying exclusivity, such as Music Man, Modulus, his own brand Fleabass, and Fender Jazz and Precisions [145]\n\n\nBasses\nFlea has employed a wide variety of basses over his career with some varying exclusivity, such as Music Man, Modulus, his own brand Fleabass, and Fender Jazz and Precisions [145]\n\n\nSignature Modulus Flea Bass\nFlea toured the Californication, 2001, By The Way, Roll on the Red, Stadium Arcadium, I'm With You, and 2013–2014 tours with his signature Modulus Flea basses (later renamed Modulus Funk Unlimited after the endorsement) Available in 4- and 5-string versions, Flea was seen with several designs over this time.\n\n\nFleabass (Multi-Coloured Deluxe Spin Basses)\nIn 2009, Flea founded the Fleabass company with the goal to create quality budget basses for beginners Whilst Flea did not perform with his own Fleabass production model he did however use a custom model created by UK artist Damien Hirst.\n\n\nFender Custom Shop\nIn The Getaway and 2022-2024 Global Stadium tours, Flea uses four Custom Shop Fender Jazz basses \n\n\nAtoms for Peace Basses\nAccording to thekingofgear.com, Flea uses the following basses in the Atoms for Peace concerts aside from his 1961 Jazz.: [157]\n\n\nEffects\nThroughout his career, Flea uses these effects units:\n\n\nAmplifiers and cabinets\nAccording to the

Canteen (both released in 2022), he used the following amps: [162]\n\n\nMusical style\nFlea has displayed a wide variety of techniques throughout the years, ranging from his initial use of slapping and popping to the more traditional methods he has employed since Blood Sugar Sex Magik Greg Prato of Allmusic wrote that \"by combining funk-style bass with psychedelic, punk, and hard rock, Flea created an original playing style that has been copied numerous times\" Flea stated in an interview, that he was influenced greatly by Louis Armstrong [4] Flea has been considered one of the greatest bassists of all time, with Greg Tate of Rolling Stone saying \"if there were a Most Valuable Bass Player award given out in rock, Flea could have laid claim to that bitch ten years running\" [164] Smashing Pumpkins front man Billy Corgan recalls, that when he first saw the Chili Peppers in 1984, \"Flea was playing so aggressively that he had worn a hole in his thumb and he was literally screaming in pain in-between songs because it hurt so bad Someone kept coming out and pouring crazy glue into the hole.\" [14] Flea's sound is also determined by what type of instrument he plays Before Californication, he did not believe the actual bass held much significance: \"what mattered was how you hit them  [basses] and your emotional intent, and I still think that's the bottom line.\" [149]\n\n\nTechnique\nAny instrument is just a vehicle to express who you are and your relationship to the world No matter what level you're doing it on, playing music is an opportunity to give something to the world.\n\n\nInfluences\nFlea's stepfather was in a bebop jazz band that frequently jammed in his presence, so he soon became fascinated with the trumpet [4] [14] [17] Flea credits his continued interest in music to jazz performers like Jaco Pastorius, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, and Dizzy Gillespie [3] After Kiedis introduced him to punk and rock, Flea became infatuated with artists such as Black Flag, David Bowie, and Defunkt [10] [17] Flea's early influences before Blood Sugar Sex Magik were mainly funk artists They would become a notable aspect of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound up to Mother's Milk Originally, Flea was given the impression by punk bands, that one should play as hard and fast as they possibly could, but ultimately rejected this philosophy during Blood Sugar Sex Magik: \"I was so into being raw  [...] it was all bullshit.\" [149] On Californication and By the Way, Flea drew influence from electronica, gothic rock bands like the Cure, Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees and new wave music rather than funk [123] Flea has also spoken highly of Neil Young; he wrote an article for Rolling Stone praising Young for the consistent authenticity in his artistry, among other things [168]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 2009, Rolling Stone's readers ranked Flea the second-best bassist of all time, behind John Entwistle of the Who and ahead of Paul McCartney of the Beatles [169] In a 2010 poll conducted on the BBC Two series I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band!, Flea was named the bassist in the ultimate fantasy band alongside Freddie Mercury on vocals, Jimi Hendrix on guitar and John Bonham on drums [170] In April 2011, Flea was voted the second-best rock bassist in a poll conducted by Contact Music, behind Entwistle and ahead of McCartney, Geddy Lee of Rush and Les Claypool of Primus [171]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nNon-Red Hot Chili Peppers

He was a key member of the band for over 50 years, playing a significant role in their distinctive sound and style.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHill was born in Dallas, Texas, to Margaret and Maurice Hill. He and his older brother Rocky, also a musician, were raised in the Lakewood neighborhood of East Dallas. Hill attended Woodrow Wilson High School, where he played the cello.

The band's unique sound, which blended blues, rock, and boogie, was largely due to Hill's distinctive bass playing and vocal style. He was known for his precise and driving bass lines, which provided a solid foundation for the band's music.\n\nThroughout his career with ZZ Top, Hill wrote or co-wrote many of the band's songs, including hits such as \"La Grange,\" \"Tush,\" and \"Gimme All Your Lovin'.\" His bass playing was a key element of the band's sound, and he was widely recognized as one of the most influential bassists in rock music.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nHill was known for his down-to-earth and humble personality. He said he believed in God, but did not know \"what or who God actually is.\" He declined to identify as a Republican or Democrat, preferring to identify as a Texan.

The ranch has been the subject of various investigations, books, and media coverage, with many claiming it to be one of the most haunted places in the world.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nUFO reports in the Uintah Basin were publicized in the 1970s. Claims about the ranch first appeared in 1996 in the Salt Lake City, Utah, Deseret News, and later in the alternative weekly Las Vegas Mercury as a series of articles by investigative journalist George Knapp. These early stories detailed the claims of a family that allegedly experienced inexplicable and frightening events after they purchased and occupied the property.\n\n## Early Reports\n\nThe Sherman family, who owned the ranch from 1994 to 1996, claimed to have experienced strange occurrences, including sightings of UFOs, bigfoot-like creatures, crop circles, glowing orbs, and poltergeist activity. According to the family, these events began shortly after they moved onto the property and continued throughout their stay. The family's experiences were reportedly documented in various forms, including audio recordings and written accounts.\n\nBook and Funding\n----------------\n\nIn 2005, Colm Kelleher and co-author George Knapp published a book, Hunt for the Skinwalker, in which they describe the ranch being acquired by Bigelow to study anecdotal sightings of UFOs, bigfoot-like creatures, crop circles, glowing orbs, and poltergeist activity reported by its former owners. According to the book, Bigelow's company, Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS), conducted a comprehensive investigation of the ranch, gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses.\n\n## The Investigation\n\nThe investigation, led by Colm Kelleher and George Knapp, aimed to gather evidence of the paranormal activity reported by the Sherman family and other witnesses. The team used various methods, including surveillance equipment, audio recordings, and interviews with witnesses. However, the investigation was unable to provide conclusive evidence of paranormal activity.\n\nCriticism\n---------\n\nSkeptical author Robert Sheaffer believes the phenomenon at Skinwalker to be \"almost certainly illusory\", given that NIDsci found no proof after several years of monitoring, and that the previous owners of the property, who had lived there for 60 years, say that no supernatural events of any kind had happened there. Sheaffer considers the \"parsimonious explanation\" to be that the Sherman family invented the story \"prior to selling it to the gullible Bigelow\", with many of the more extraordinary claims originating solely from Terry Sherman, who worked as a caretaker after the ranch was sold to Bigelow.\n\nOwnership\n---------\n\nIn 2016, Bigelow sold Skinwalker Ranch to Adamantium Real Estate LLC for around $500,000. After this purchase, roads leading to the ranch were blocked, the perimeter was guarded by cameras and barbed wire, and signs were posted that aimed to prevent people from approaching the ranch.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n------------------\n\nThe legend of Skinwalker Ranch has been featured in various media outlets, including TV shows, books, and documentaries. The ranch has been referred to as one of the most haunted places in the world, with many claiming it to be a hub for paranormal activity.\n\n## Documentaries and TV Shows\n\nThe ranch has been featured in several documentaries and TV shows, including \"The Curse of Skinwalker Ranch\" and \"Ghost Adventures\". These programs have aimed to investigate the paranormal activity reported at the ranch, with some claiming to have captured evidence of ghostly apparitions and unexplained phenomena.\n\n## Books and Literature\n\nSeveral books have been written about Skinwalker Ranch, including \"Hunt for the Skinwalker\" by Colm Kelleher and George Knapp. These books aim to provide a comprehensive account of the ranch's history and the paranormal activity reported there.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS)\n* Colm Kelleher\n* George Knapp\n* Hunt for the Skinwalker\n* Skinwalker Ranch investigation\n\nFootnotes\n----------\n\nNo footnotes are included in this article.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nNo references are included in this article.\n\nFurther Reading\n---------------\n\nFor further reading on Skinwalker Ranch, we recommend the following:\n\n* \"Hunt for the Skinwalker\" by Colm Kelleher and George Knapp\n* \"The Curse of Skinwalker Ranch\" by John E.

Empire [14] However, according to Bill Mallon's research, this is an error which has been perpetuated in multiple texts [15]\n\n\nBritish successes\nIn the London Games of 1908 a proper international tournament was organised by the Football Association, featuring just six teams The number of teams rose to eleven in 1912, when the competition was organised by the Swedish Football Association Many of these early matches were unbalanced, as evidenced by high scoring games; two players, Sophus Nielsen in 1908 and Gottfried Fuchs in 1912, each scored ten goals in a single match All players were amateurs, in accordance with the Olympic rules, which meant that countries could not send their full senior national teams The National Olympic Committee for Great Britain and Ireland asked the Football Association to send an English national amateur team Some of the English members played with professional clubs, most notably Derby County's Ivan Sharpe, Bradford City F.C Harold Walden and Chelsea's Vivian Woodward England won the first two official tournaments convincingly, beating Denmark both times.\n\n\n1920s and the rise of Uruguay\nDuring the 1920 final against Belgium, the Czechoslovakia national football team walked off the field to protest the refereeing of John Lewis [16] and the militarised mood within the stadium in Antwerp This would be the final all-European football competition at the Olympic games, with Egypt, the United States, and Uruguay participating in 1924 [16] With teams from new regions the quality of play increased, as did fan interest [16] Uruguay dominated the tournament, winning their four games by a combined score of 15-1: the final was a 3–0 victory over Switzerland [16] In 1928, football was the most popular event at the games [17] and the final was an all-South American affair Because no other major international tournament existed yet, Uruguay defeated Argentina 2–1 in what David Goldblatt says was \"football's first world championship\" [18] After these tournaments, FIFA realized that the Olympic movement prevented nations from competing on an equal footing and, given that the Olympics only permitted amateurs to participate, did not represent the true strength of the international game The popularity of international soccer gave FIFA the incentive to create an international tournament, and FIFA began organising the World Cup [17]\n\n\nAfter the first World Cup\nFollowing Jules Rimet's proposal in 1929 to initiate a professional World Championship of Football, the sport was dropped from the 1932 Los Angeles Games by FIFA in an attempt to promote the new tournament Football returned to controversy at the 1936 Berlin Games The German organisers were intent on the return of the game to the Olympic movement since it guaranteed income into the organisation's coffers The Italian team intimidated a referee Peru scored a contested victory over Austria in overtime, with a fan invasion of the field at the very end  The Austrian team asked for the result to be annulled, and the game repeated FIFA agreed, but the Peruvian team refused and left the Olympics [19] [20]\n\n\nTumultuous '30s\nFollowing Jules Rimet's proposal in 1929 to initiate a professional World Championship of Football, the sport was dropped from the 1932 Los Angeles Games by FIFA in an attempt to promote the new

state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs As a result, young Western amateurs had to face seasoned and veteran Soviet Bloc teams, which put them at a significant disadvantage All Olympic football tournaments from 1948 to 1980 were dominated by the Soviet Union and its satellites [21] Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 28 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance The next two tournaments saw some changes due to FIFA's

since the early 20th century. The sport has a rich history at the Olympics, with many notable moments and achievements over the years. From its humble beginnings to the present day, football at the Olympics has undergone significant changes, including the introduction of professional players and the adoption of new rules. This article will provide an overview of the history of football at the Summer Olympics, including the tournament format, participating nations, and notable achievements.\n\n**History**\n\nFootball was not included in the program at the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, as international football was in its infancy at the time. However, sources claim that an unofficial football tournament was organised during the first competition, with participating teams including Athens and Smyrna (İzmir), then part of the Ottoman Empire. However, according to Bill Mallon's research, this is an error which has been perpetuated in multiple texts.\n\nThe sport was introduced to the Olympics in 1908, with a proper international tournament organised by the Football Association, featuring just six teams. The number of teams rose to eleven in 1912, when the competition was organised by the Swedish Football Association. Many of these early matches were unbalanced, as evidenced by high scoring games; two players, Sophus Nielsen in 1908 and Gottfried Fuchs in 1912, each scored ten goals in a single match. All players were amateurs, in accordance with the Olympic rules, which meant that countries could not send their full senior national teams.\n\nThe National Olympic Committee for Great Britain and Ireland asked the Football Association to send an English national amateur team. Some of the English members played with professional clubs, most notably Derby County's Ivan Sharpe, Bradford City F.C Harold Walden and Chelsea's Vivian Woodward. England won the first two official tournaments convincingly, beating Denmark both times.\n\n**1920s and the rise of Uruguay**\n\nDuring the 1920 final against Belgium, the Czechoslovakia national football team walked off the field to protest the refereeing of John Lewis and the militarised mood within the stadium in Antwerp. This would be the final all-European football competition at the Olympic games, with Egypt, the United States, and Uruguay participating in 1924. With teams from new regions the quality of play increased, as did fan interest. Uruguay dominated the tournament, winning their four games by a combined score of 15-1: the final was a 3–0 victory over Switzerland. In 1928, football was the most popular event at the games, and the final was an all-South American affair. Because no other major international tournament existed yet, Uruguay defeated Argentina 2–1 in what David Goldblatt says was \"football's first world championship.\" After these tournaments, FIFA realized that the Olympic movement prevented nations from competing on an equal footing and, given that the Olympics only permitted amateurs to participate, did not represent the true strength of the international game. The popularity of international soccer gave FIFA the incentive to create an international tournament, and FIFA began organising the World Cup.\n\n**After the first World Cup**\n\nFollowing Jules Rimet's proposal in 1929 to initiate a professional World Championship of Football, the sport was dropped from the 1932 Los Angeles Games by FIFA in an attempt to promote the new tournament. Football returned to controversy at the 1936 Berlin Games. The German organisers were intent on the return of the game to the Olympic movement since it guaranteed income into the organisation's coffers. The Italian team intimidated a referee, Peru scored a contested victory over Austria in overtime, with a fan invasion of the field at the very end. The Austrian team asked for the result to be annulled, and the game repeated. FIFA agreed, but the Peruvian team refused and left the Olympics.\n\n**Tumultuous '30s**\n\nFollowing Jules Rimet's proposal in 1929 to initiate a professional World Championship of Football, the sport was dropped from the 1932 Los Angeles Games by FIFA in an attempt to promote the new tournament.

The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. As a result, young Western amateurs had to face seasoned and veteran Soviet Bloc teams, which put them at a significant disadvantage. All Olympic football tournaments from 1948 to 1980 were dominated by the Soviet Union and its satellites. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 28 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. The next two tournaments saw some changes due to FIFA's changing of the call-up rules, with only Yugoslavia (bronze in 1984) and the Soviet Union (gold in 1988) winning medals for the Eastern Bloc.\n\n**Changes and developments**\n\nFor the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC decided to admit professional players, however, FIFA still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup. Since 1992, male competitors have been required to be under 23 years old, and since 1996, a maximum of three over-23-year-old players have been allowed per squad. African countries have taken particular advantage of this, with Nigeria and Cameroon winning in 1996 and 2000 respectively.\n\n**British non-involvement**\n\nFootball in the United Kingdom has no single governing body, and there are separate teams for the UK's four Home Nations: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

She is the second wife of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and the mother of Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Born on October 15, 1959, in London, England, Sarah has been involved in various charitable activities and has pursued a career in television and film.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSarah Margaret Ferguson was born at London's Welbeck Hospital to Major Ronald Ferguson and Susan Wright. She has one older full sister, Jane. After her parents divorced in 1974, her mother married polo player Héctor Barrantes and moved to Trenque Lauquen in the Argentine pampas. Sarah stayed at her father's home, Dummer Down Farm, in Hampshire. At the age of 12, she developed an eating disorder and \"turned to overeating for comfort\" due to her parents' marital issues.\n\n**Marriage to Prince Andrew**\n\nIn 1986, Prince Andrew, who was fourth in line to the throne at the time, and Sarah announced their engagement. The couple had known each other since childhood and had reconnected at Royal Ascot in 1985. Prince Andrew designed the engagement ring himself, which consisted of ten diamonds surrounding a Burmese ruby. Sarah's friendly approach and fun spirit made her a welcome addition to the royal family.\n\n**Separation and Divorce**\n\nBy 1991, the marriage was in trouble, and Sarah found life as a member of the royal family increasingly difficult. The couple's friendship with Texan multimillionaire Steve Wyatt gained much publicity, and photographs of Wyatt with Sarah's toddler daughter appeared in newspapers in January 1992. The Duke and Duchess of York announced their separation on March 19, 1992. Following the separation, the palace announced that Sarah would no longer carry out public engagements on behalf of the Queen.\n\n**Personal Life after Divorce**\n\nAfter the divorce, the British tabloids continued to cover Sarah's lifestyle. In 1995, a baggage handler at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City pleaded guilty to stealing her $382,000 diamond necklace and bracelet. Sarah's commercial interests have included an eleven-year endorsement with Weight Watchers and product development and promotion with Wedgwood and Avon.\n\n**Debt Problems**\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Sarah reportedly had a £4.2 million deficit in her bank account, which she paid off by going on a four-year earning spree in the United States.\n\n**Cash for Access**\n\nIn May 2010, Sarah was filmed by the News of the World offering Mazher Mahmood, an undercover reporter posing as an Indian businessman, access to Prince Andrew for £500,000.

{"title": "Nepal", "content": "\nEtymology\nBefore the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal [c] The precise origin of the term Nepāl is uncertain Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century AD [16] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages [17]\n\n\nHistory\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved [29] [30] [31] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago [32] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time [33]\n\n\nAncient Nepal\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved [29] [30] [31] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago [32] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time [33]\n\n\nMedieval Nepal\nIn the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of India By the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated Baise rajyas, literally 22 states as they were counted The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in the intervening centuries; their language, later renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as much of North-east India [45]\n\n\nUnification, expansion and consolidation (1768–1951)\nIn the mid-18th century, Prithvi Narayan Shah, a Gorkha king, set out to put together what would become present-day Nepal He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the Battle of Kirtipur, he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769 [56]\nThe Gorkha control reached its height when the Kumaon and Garhwal Kingdoms in the west to Sikkim in the east came under Nepalese control A dispute with Tibet over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet prompted the Qing Emperor of China to start the Sino-Nepali War compelling the Nepali to retreat to their own borders in the north [57] The rivalry between the Kingdom of Nepal and the East India Company over the control of states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo-Nepali War (1815–16) At first, the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing Thus began the reputation of Gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers The war ended in the Sugauli Treaty, under which Nepal ceded recently captured lands [58] [45]\n\n\nContemporary history\nIn the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy Following the success of Indian Independence Movement which Nepalese activists had taken part in, with India's support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan, Nepali Congress was successful in toppling the Rana regime, establishing a parliamentary democracy After a decade of power wrangling between the king and the government, King Mahendra (ruled 1955–1972) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1960, and a \"partyless\" Panchayat system was made to govern Nepal The political parties were banned and politicians imprisoned or exiled [63] The Panchayat rule modernised the country, introducing reforms and developing infrastructure, but curtailed liberties and imposed heavy censorship In 1990, the People's Movement forced King Birendra (ruled 1972–2001) to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty democracy [63] [64]\n\n\nGeography\nNepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi) long and 200 kilometres (120 mi) wide, with an area of 147,516 km2 (56,956 sq mi) It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and longitudes 80° and 89°E Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east [76] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate [76] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas [76] The rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke through as late as 100,000 years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley In the western region, rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's deepest gorges [77] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment [78] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain [79] Nepal lies almost completely within this collision zone, occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400 km (1,500 mi)-long Himalayas, [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] with a small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau [77]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nNepal contains a disproportionately large diversity of plants and animals, relative to its size [90] [91] Nepal, in its entirety, forms the western portion of the eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, with notable biocultural diversity [92] The dramatic differences in elevation found in Nepal (60 m from sea level in the Terai plains, to 8,848 m Mount Everest) [93] result in a variety of biomes [90] The Eastern half of Nepal is richer in biodiversity as it receives more rain, compared to western parts, where arctic desert-type conditions are more common at higher elevations [91] Nepal is a habitat for 4.0% of all mammal species, 8.9% of bird species, 1.0% of reptile species, 2.5% of amphibian species, 1.9% of fish species, 3.7% of butterfly species, 0.5% of moth species and 0.4% of spider species [91] In its 35 forest-types and 118 ecosystems, [90] [h] Nepal harbours 2% of the flowering plant species, 3% of pteridophytes and 6% of bryophytes [91]\n\n\nPolitics and government\nNepal is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system [126] Nepal has been referred as the 'Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal' since 2015 [127] It has seven national political parties recognised in the federal parliament: Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist), Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, People's Socialist Party and Janamat Party [128] [126] Of the two major parties which both officially espouse democratic socialism, CPN(UML) is considered leftist while Nepali Congress is considered centrist [129] During most of the brief periods of democratic exercise in the 1950s and the 1990s, Nepali Congress held majority of seats in parliament; CPN (UML) was its competitor in the 1990s [130] After the Maoists entered the political process in 2006, they emerged as the third largest party [70] In the aftermath of the 2017 elections, the first one according to the new constitution, NCP, formed by the merger of CPN (UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre) had become the ruling party at the federal level and in six out of seven provinces [131] After the 2022 general election, the House of Representatives of 2nd Federal parliament was formed as hung parliament and a coalition government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal was formed in December 2022 [132] On 15 July 2024, K P Sharma Oli was sworn in as Nepali Prime minister for fourth time New coalition was formed between Nepali Congress, led by Sher Bahadur Deuba, and UML, led by Oli The party leaders will take turns as prime ministers for 18 months each until the next general elections in 2027 [133]\n\n\nPolitics\nNepal is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system [126] Nepal has been referred as the 'Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal' since 2015 [127] It has seven national

prime ministers for 18 months each until the next general elections in 2027 [133]\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nNepal is a federal republic comprising 7 provinces Each province is composed of 8 to 14 districts The districts, in turn, comprise local units known as urban and rural municipalities [3] There is a total of 753 local units which includes 6 metropolitan municipalities, 11 sub-metropolitan municipalities and 276 municipalities for a total of 293 urban municipalities, and 460 rural municipalities [138] Each local unit is composed of wards There are 6,743 wards in total.\n\n\nLaws and law enforcement\nThe Constitution of Nepal is the supreme law of the land, and any other laws contradicting it are automatically invalid to the extent of the contradiction [139] The specific legal provisions are codified as Civil Code and Criminal Code, accompanied by Civil Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code respectively [140] The Supreme Court is the highest authority in the interpretation of laws and it can direct the parliament to amend or enact new laws as required The death penalty has been abolished [141] It recognises marital rape and supports abortion rights Owing to a rise in sex-selective abortion, however, constraints have been introduced Nepal is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, Conventions/Treaties on the prohibition of Biological, Chemical and Nuclear weapons, [142] International Labour Organization Fundamental Conventions, Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Paris climate accord Some legal provisions, guided by socio-economic, cultural and religious sensibilities, remain discriminatory There is gender-based discrimination against foreign nationals married to Nepali citizens [j] Paternal lineage of a person is valued and required in legal documents Many laws remain unenforced in practice.\n\n\nForeign relations\nNepal depends on diplomacy for national defence It maintains a policy of neutrality between its neighbours, has amicable relations with other countries in the region, and has a policy of non-alignment at the global stage Nepal is a member of SAARC, UN, WTO, BIMSTEC and ACD, among others It has bilateral diplomatic relations with 167 countries and the EU, [152] has embassies in 30 countries [153] and six consulates, [154] while 25 countries maintain embassies in Nepal, and more than 80 others maintain non-residential diplomatic missions [155] Nepal is one of the major contributors to the UN peacekeeping missions, having contributed more than 119,000 personnel to 42 missions since 1958 [156] Nepali people have a reputation for honesty, loyalty and bravery, which has led to them serving as legendary Gurkha warriors in the Indian and British armies for the last 200 years, with service in both world wars, India-Pakistan wars as well as Afghanistan and Iraq, [157] though Nepal was not directly involved in any of those conflicts, and winning the highest military awards, including the Victoria Cross and the Param Vir Chakra [158]\n\n\nMilitary and intelligence\nThe President is the supreme commander of the Nepali Army; its routine management is handled by the Ministry of Defence The military expenditure for 2018 was $398.5 million, [175] around 1.4% of GDP [176] An almost exclusively ground infantry force, Nepal Army numbers at less than one hundred thousand; [177] [178] [179] recruitment is voluntary [180] It has few aircraft, mainly helicopters, primarily used for transport, patrol, and search and rescue [181] Directorate of Military Intelligence under Nepal Army serves as the military intelligence agency; [182] National Investigation Department tasked with national and international intelligence gathering, is independent [177] Nepal Army is primarily used for routine security of critical assets, an anti-poaching patrol of national parks, counterinsurgency, and search and rescue during natural disasters; [183] it also undertakes major construction projects [184] There are no discriminatory policies on recruitment into the army, but it is dominated by men from elite Pahari warrior castes [185] [186]\n\n\nEconomy\nNepal is one of the least developed countries, which ranks 165th in the world [k] in nominal GDP per capita [187] and 162nd [l] in GDP per capita at PPP [188] Nepal's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019 was $34.186 billion [189] [190] Nepal has consistently been ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world [191] [192] [193] Nepal has been a member of WTO since 23 April 2004 [194]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in Nepal, employing more than a million people and contributing 7.9% of the total GDP [219] The number of international visitors crossed one million in 2018 for the first time (not counting Indian tourists arriving by land) [219] [220] Nepal's share of visitors to South Asia is about 6%, and they spend much less on average, with Nepal sharing 1.7% of the earnings [221] Premier destinations include Pokhara, the Annapurna trekking circuit and the four UNESCO world heritage sites—Lumbini, Sagarmatha National Park (home to Mount Everest), seven sites in the Kathmandu Valley collectively listed as one, and Chitwan National Park Most of Nepal's mountaineering earning comes from Mount Everest, which is more accessible from the Nepalese side [222]\n\n\nForeign employment\nThe rate of unemployment and underemployment exceeds half of the working-age population, [225] driving millions to seek employment abroad, mainly in India, the Gulf, and East Asia Mostly unskilled, uneducated, and indebted to loan sharks, these workers are swindled by the manpower companies and sent to exploitative employers or war-ridden countries under fraudulent contracts [226] [227] They have their passports seized, to be returned when the employer grants them leave or terminates their contracts Most do not get paid minimum wage, [228] and many are forced to forfeit all or part of the wages [229] Many Nepalis work in extremely unsafe conditions; an average of two workers die each day [230] Due to restrictions placed on women, many depend on traffickers to get out of the country, and end up victims of violence and abuse [231] Many Nepalese are believed to be working under slavery-like conditions, and Nepal spends billions of rupees rescuing stranded workers, on remuneration to the indebted families of the dead, and in legal costs for those arrested in foreign countries [232] [233] Though millions have raised themselves out of poverty, due to a lack of entrepreneurial skills, the remittance is largely spent on real estate and consumption [234] [233]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe bulk of energy in Nepal comes from biomass (80%) and imported fossil fuels (16%) [235] Most of the final energy consumption goes to the residential sector (84%) followed by transport (7%) and industry (6%); the transport and industry sectors have been expanding rapidly in recent years [235] Except for some lignite deposits, Nepal has no known oil, gas or coal deposits [235] All commercial fossil fuels (mainly oil, LPG and coal) are imported, spending 129% of the country's total export revenue [236] Only about 1% of the energy need is fulfilled by electricity [235] The perennial nature of Nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country's topography provide ideal conditions for the development of hydroelectric projects Estimates put Nepal's economically feasible hydro-power potential at approximately 42,000 MW [235] Nepal has been able to exploit only about 1,100 MW As most of it is generated from run-of-river (ROR) plants, the actual power produced is much lower in the dry winter months when peak demand can reach as high as 1,200 MW, and Nepal needs to import as much as 650 MW from India to meet the demands [237] Major hydro-power projects suffer delays and setbacks [238] [239] [240] Nepal's electrification rate (76%) is comparable to that of other countries in the region but there is significant disparity between the rural (72%) and urban (97%) areas [235] The position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs, high system losses, high generation costs, high overheads, over staffing, and lower domestic demand [241]\n\n\nEnergy\nThe

position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs, high system losses, high generation costs, high overheads, over staffing, and lower domestic demand [241]\n\n\nTransportation\nNepal remains isolated from the world's major land, air and sea transport routes, although, within the country, aviation is in a better state, with 47 airports, 11 of them with paved runways; [242] flights are frequent and support a sizeable traffic The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive As of 2016 [update], there were just over 11,890 km (7,388 mi) of paved roads, 16,100 km (10,004 mi) of unpaved roads, and just 59 km (37 mi) of railway line in the south [242] As of 2018 [update], all district headquarters (except Simikot) had been connected to the road network [184] Most of the rural roads are not operable during the rainy season; even national highways regularly become inoperable [243] Nepal depends almost entirely on assistance from countries like China, India and Japan, for building, maintenance and expansion of the road network The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Kolkata in India The national carrier, Nepal Airlines, is in poor shape due to mismanagement and corruption, and has been blacklisted by the EU [244] Internally, the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets, schools, and health clinics a challenge [214] Nepal has the worst road infrastructure in Asia [245]\n\n\nCommunication\nAccording to the Nepal Telecommunication Authority MIS August 2019 report, voice telephony subscription rate was at 2.70% of total population for fixed phones and 138.59% for mobile; 98% of all voice telephony was through mobile phones [246] Similarly, while an estimated 14.52% had access to fixed broadband, an additional 52.71% were accessing the internet using their mobile data subscriptions; almost 15 million of them with 3G or better [246] The mobile voice telephony and broadband market was dominated by two telecommunications companies, the state-owned Nepal Telecom (55%) and the private multinational, Ncell (40%) [246] Of the 21% market share enjoyed by fixed broadband, around 25% was again shared by Nepal Telecom, with the rest going to the private Internet Service Providers [246] Although there is high disparity in penetration rate between the rural and urban areas, mobile service has reached 75 districts of the country covering 90% of land area, and broadband access is expected to reach 90% of the population by 2020 [242]\n\n\nMedia\nAs of 2019 [update], the state operates three television stations as well as national and regional radio stations There are 117 private TV channels and 736 FM radio stations licensed for operation, at least 314 of them, community radio stations [242] According to the 2011 census, the percentage of households possessing radio was 50.82%, television 36.45%, cable TV 19.33%, and computer 7.28% [247] According to the Press Council Nepal classification, as of 2017 [update] of the 833 publications producing original content, ten national dailies and weeklies are rated A+ class [248] In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked Nepal at 106th in the world in terms of press freedom [249]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe citizens of Nepal are known as Nepali or Nepalese The Nepali are descendants of three major migrations from India, Tibet and North Burma, and the Chinese province of Yunnan via Assam Among the earliest inhabitants were the Kirat of the eastern region, Newars of the Kathmandu Valley, aboriginal Tharus of the Terai plains and the Khas Pahari people of the far-western hills Despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the Terai in recent years, the majority of Nepalese still live in the central highlands, and the northern mountains are sparsely populated.\n\n\nLargest cities\nNepal's diverse linguistic heritage stems from three major language groups: Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan and various indigenous language isolates The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as native language) according to the 2011 census are Nepali (44.6%), Maithili (11.7%), Bhojpuri (6.0%), Tharu (5.8%), Tamang (5.1%), Nepal Bhasa (3.2%), Bajjika (3%) and Magar (3.0%), Doteli (3.0%), Urdu (2.6%), Awadhi (1.89%), and Sunwar Nepal is home to at least four indigenous sign languages [citation needed]\n\n\nLanguage\nNepal's diverse

and Sunwar Nepal is home to at least four indigenous sign languages [citation needed]\n\n\nReligion\nNepal is a secular country, as declared by the Constitution of Nepal 2012 (Part 1, Article 4), where secularism 'means religious, cultural freedom, along with the protection of religion, culture handed down from time immemorial (सनातन)' [255] [256] The 2011 census reported that the religion with the largest number of followers in Nepal was Hinduism (81.3% of the population), followed by Buddhism (9%); the remaining were Islam (4.4%), Kirant (3.1%), Christianity (1.4%) and Prakriti or nature worship (0.5%) [257] By percentage of population, Nepal has the largest population of Hindus in the world [258] Nepal was officially a Hindu Kingdom until recently, and Shiva was considered the guardian deity of the country [259] Although many government policies throughout history have disregarded or marginalised minority religions, Nepalese societies generally enjoy religious tolerance and harmony among all religions, with only isolated incidents of religiously motivated violence [260] [261] Nepal's constitution does not give anyone the right to convert any person to another religion Nepal also passed a more stringent anti-conversion law on 2017 [262] Nepal has the second-largest number of Hindus in the world after India [263]\n\n\nEducation\nNepal entered modernity in 1951 with a literacy rate of 5% and about 10,000 students enrolled in 300 schools [citation needed] By 2017, there were more than seven million students enrolled in 35,601 schools [264] The overall literacy rate (for population age five years and above) increased from 54.1% in 2001 to 65.9% in 2011 [250] The net primary enrolment rate reached 97% by 2017, [265] [266] yet enrolment was less than 60% at the secondary level (grades 9 –12), [267] and around 12% at the tertiary level [267] Though there is significant gender disparity in overall literacy rate, [250] girls have overtaken boys in enrolment to all levels of education [267] Nepal has eleven universities and four independent science academies [264] Nepal was ranked 109th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [268]\n\n\nHealth\nHealth care services in Nepal are provided by both the public and private sectors Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 71 years as of 2017, 153rd highest in the world, [276] up from 54 years in the 1990s and 35 years in 1950 [277] [278] Two-thirds of all deaths are due to non-communicable diseases; heart disease is the leading cause of death [279] While sedentary lifestyle, imbalanced diet and consumption of tobacco and alcohol has contributed in the rise of non-communicable diseases, many lose their life to communicable and treatable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition due to a lack of education, awareness and access to healthcare services [279] [280]\n\n\nImmigrants and refugees\nNepal has a long tradition of accepting immigrants and refugees [291] In modern times, Tibetans and Bhutanese have constituted a majority of refugees in Nepal Tibetan refugees began arriving in 1959, [292] and many more cross into Nepal every year [293] The Bhutanese Lhotsampa refugees began arriving in the 1980s and numbered more than 110,000 by the 2000s Most of them have been resettled in third countries [294] In late 2018, Nepal had a total of 20,800 confirmed refugees, 64% of them Tibetan and 31% Bhutanese [295] Economic immigrants, and refugees fleeing persecution or war, from neighbouring countries, Africa and the Middle East, termed \"urban refugees\" because they live in apartments in the cities instead of refugee camps, [296] [297] [298] lack official recognition; the government facilitates their resettlement in third countries [299]\n\n\nCulture\nTraditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy The Nepali caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia Social classes are defined by more than a hundred endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\" Nepal declared untouchability to be illegal in 1963 [302] and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives At the workplace and educational institutions in urban Nepal, caste-related identification has pretty much lost its importance [citation

importance [citation needed]\n\n\nSymbols\nThe emblem of Nepal depicts the snowy Himalayas, the forested hills, and the fertile Terai, supported by a wreath of rhododendrons, with the national flag at the crest and in the foreground, a plain white map of Nepal below it, and a man's and woman's right hands joined to signify gender equality At the bottom is the national motto, a Sanskrit quote of patriotism attributed in Nepali folklore to Lord Rama, written in Devanagari script—\"Mother and motherland are greater than heaven\" [citation needed]\n\n\nArt and architecture\nThe oldest known examples of architecture in Nepal are stupas of early Buddhist constructions in and around Kapilvastu in south-western Nepal, and those constructed by Ashoka in the Kathmandu Valley c. 250 BC The characteristic architecture associated exclusively with Nepal was developed and refined by Newa artisans of the Kathmandu Valley starting no later than the Lichchhavi period A Tang dynasty Chinese travel book, probably based on records from c. 650 AD, describes contemporary Nepali architecture, predominantly built with wood, as rich in artistry, as well as wood and metal sculpture It describes a magnificent seven-storied pagoda in the middle of a palace, with copper-tiled roofs, its balustrade, grills, columns and beams set about with fine and precious stones, and four golden sculptures of Makaras in the four corners of the base spouting water from their mouths like a fountain, supplied by copper pipes connected to the runnels at the top of the tower Later Chinese chronicles describe Nepal's king's palace as an immense structure with many roofs, suggesting that the Chinese were not yet familiar with the pagoda architecture, which has now become one of the chief characteristics of Chinese architecture.\n\n\nLooting of the cultural heritage of Nepal\nCultural looting is a crisis in Nepal despite efforts to combat it [330] [331] [332] Volunteers working for the Nepal Heritage Recovery Campaign have helped recover artifacts [333] In 2022 Barakat Gallery's London branch relinquished 16th-century carved wooden Torana, a ceremonial gateway, and the 17th-century stone statue of a kneeling devotee, both taken from sacred sites near Kathmandu [334] In 2023 Nepalese artifacts suspected of having been looted were found in the Art Institute of Chicago, [335] the Metropolitan Museum of Art, [336] [337] the Dallas Museum of Art, [338] the Rubin Museum [339] and other museums, and turned up in auctions at Christie's, [340] Bonhams [341] and other auction houses.\n\n\nLiterature and the performing arts\nNepal's literature was closely intertwined with that of the rest of South Asia until its unification into a modern kingdom Literary works, which were written in Sanskrit by Brahmin priests educated and sometimes also based in Varanasi, included religious texts and other fantasies involving kings, gods and demons [342] The oldest extant Nepali language text is dated to the 13th century but except for the epigraphic material, Nepali language literature older than the 17th century have not been found Newar literature dates back almost 500 years [327] The modern history of Nepali literature begins with Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814–1868), who for the first time composed major and influential works in Nepali, the language accessible to the masses, most prominently, the Bhanubhakta Ramayana, a translation of the ancient Hindu epic [342] By the end of the nineteenth century, Motiram Bhatta had published print editions of the works of Acharya, and through his efforts, single-handedly popularised and propelled Nepali language literature into modernity [327] By the mid-twentieth century, Nepali literature was no longer limited to the Hindu literary traditions Influenced by western literary traditions, writers in this period started producing literary works addressing the contemporary social problems, [343] while many others continued to enrich Nepali poetic traditions with authentic Nepali poetry Newar literature also emerged as a premier literary tradition After the advent of democracy in 1951, Nepali literature flourished Literary works in many other languages began to be produced Nepali literature continued to modernise, and in recent years, has been strongly influenced by the post civil-war Nepali experience as well as global literary traditions [344] [345] [346] [327]\n\n\nClothing\nThe most widely worn traditional dress in Nepal, for both women and men, from ancient times until the advent of modern times, was draped [348] For women, it eventually took the form of a sari, a single long piece of cloth, famously six yards long, and of width spanning the lower body [348] The sari is tied around the waist and knotted at one end, wrapped around the lower body, and then over the shoulder [348] In its more modern form, it has been used to cover the head, and sometimes the face, as a veil, [348] particularly in the Terai It has been combined with an underskirt, or the petticoat, and tucked in the waistband for more secure fastening It is worn with a blouse, or cholo, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end, passing over the shoulder, now serving to obscure the upper body's contours, and to cover the midriff [348] Cholo-sari has become the attire of choice for formal occasions, official environs and festive gatherings In its more traditional form, as part of traditional dresses and as worn in daily life while performing household chores or labour, it takes the form of a fariya or gunyu, usually shorter than a sari in length as well as breadth, and all of it wrapped around the lower body.\n\n\nCuisine\nNepali cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other, using locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruit [353] The Columbian exchange had brought the potato, the tomato, maize, peanuts, cashew nuts, pineapples, guavas, and most notably, chilli peppers, to South Asia Each became staples of use [354] The cereals grown in Nepal, their choice, times, and regions of planting, correspond strongly to the timing of Nepal's monsoons, [355] and the variations in altitude Rice and wheat are mostly cultivated in the terai plains and well-irrigated valleys, and maize, millet, barley and buckwheat in the lesser fertile and drier hills [353] [356]\n\n\nSports and recreation\nNepali indigenous sports, like dandi biyo and kabaddi which were considered the unofficial national sports until recently, [323] are still popular in rural areas [364] Despite efforts, standardisation and development of dandi biyo has not been achieved, [365] [366] while Kabaddi, as a professional sport, is still in its infancy in Nepal [367] Bagh-chal, an ancient board game that is thought to have originated in Nepal, can be played on chalk-drawn boards, with pebbles, and is still popular today [368] [369] Ludo, snakes and ladders and carrom are popular pastimes [370] Chess is also played [364] Volleyball was declared as the national sport of Nepal in 2017 [323] Popular children's games include versions of tag, [364] knucklebones, [364] hopscotch, Duck, duck, goose [364] and lagori, while marbles, [364] top, hoop rolling and gully cricket are also popular among boys Rubber bands, or ranger bands cut from tubes in bike tyres, make a multi-purpose sporting equipment for Nepali children, which may be bunched or chained together, and used to play dodgeball, cat's cradle, jianzi [364] and a variety of skipping rope games [364]\n\n\nSee

landlocked country located in South Asia, with a diverse geography and culture. It is situated between India to the east, west and south, and Tibet to the north. The country has a rich history, with a unique blend of Hinduism and Buddhism.\n\nEtymology\nThe term \"Nepal\" is believed to have originated from the Sanskrit word \"Nepala\", which means \"land of the gods\". The country has been known by various names throughout history, including \"Nepal\" (नेपाल), \"Nepalaya\" (नेपालया), and \"Nepalika\" (नेपलिका).\n\nHistory\nThe earliest known human habitation in Nepal dates back to the Paleolithic era, with archaeological evidence suggesting that humans lived in the region as far back as 55,000 years ago. The country was later inhabited by various tribes and civilizations, including the Kirat, Tharu, and Newar.\n\nAncient Nepal\nThe Kirat people were the first known inhabitants of Nepal, with their kingdom dating back to the 8th century BC. The Kirat kingdom was later conquered by the Licchavis, a powerful dynasty that ruled Nepal from the 3rd to the 11th centuries AD.\n\nMedieval Nepal\nThe Malla dynasty ruled Nepal from the 12th to the 18th centuries AD, with their capital in the Kathmandu Valley. The Malla kingdom was later divided into three separate kingdoms, each ruled by a different branch of the Malla family.\n\nUnification, expansion and consolidation (1768-1951)\nIn the mid-18th century, Prithvi Narayan Shah, a Gorkha king, embarked on a mission to unify the various kingdoms of Nepal. After several bloody battles and sieges, he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769. The Gorkha control reached its height when the Kumaon and Garhwal Kingdoms in the west to Sikkim in the east came under Nepalese control.\n\nContemporary history\nIn the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy. Following the success of Indian Independence Movement, which Nepali activists had taken part in, with India's support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan, Nepali Congress was successful in toppling the Rana regime, establishing a parliamentary democracy.\n\nPolitics and government\nNepal is a federal republic comprising 7 provinces, each composed of 8 to 14 districts. The districts, in turn, comprise local units known as urban and rural municipalities. There is a total of 753 local units, including 6 metropolitan municipalities, 11 sub-metropolitan municipalities, and 276 municipalities for a total of 293 urban municipalities, and 460 rural municipalities.\n\nLaws and law enforcement\nThe Constitution of Nepal is the supreme law of the land, and any other laws contradicting it are automatically invalid to the extent of the contradiction. The specific legal provisions are codified as Civil Code and Criminal Code, accompanied by Civil Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code respectively.\n\nForeign relations\nNepal depends on diplomacy for national defence and maintains a policy of neutrality between its neighbours and global stage. It has bilateral diplomatic relations with 167 countries and the EU, has embassies in 30 countries, and six consulates.\n\nMilitary and intelligence\nThe President is the supreme commander of the Nepali Army, with the Ministry of Defence handling its routine management. The military expenditure for 2018 was $398.5 million, around 1.4% of GDP. The Directorate of Military Intelligence under Nepal Army serves as the military intelligence agency.\n\nEconomy\nNepal is one of the least developed countries, ranking 165th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 162nd in GDP per capita at PPP. Nepal's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019 was $34.186 billion. The country has been a member of WTO since 23 April 2004.\n\nInfrastructure\nNepal remains isolated from the world's major land, air and sea transport routes, although, within the country, aviation is in a better state, with 47 airports, 11 of them with paved runways. The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive.\n\nCommunication\nAccording to the Nepal Telecommunication Authority MIS August 2019 report, voice telephony subscription rate was at 2.70% of total population for fixed phones and 138.59% for mobile. The mobile voice telephony and broadband market was dominated by two telecommunications companies, the state-owned Nepal Telecom (55%) and the private multinational, Ncell (40%).\n\nCulture\nTraditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy, with the Nepali caste system embodying much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia. Social classes are defined by more than a hundred endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jatis, or \"castes\".\n\nDemographics\nThe citizens of Nepal are known as Nepali or Nepalese. The country has a diverse linguistic heritage, with three major language groups: Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan, and various indigenous language isolates. The major languages spoken in Nepal are Nepali, Maithili, Bhojpuri, Tharu, Tamang, Nepal Bhasa, Bajjika, Magar, Doteli, Urdu, Awadhi, and Sunwar.\n\nSymbols\nThe emblem of Nepal depicts the snowy Himalayas, the forested hills, and the fertile Terai, supported by a wreath of rhododendrons, with the national flag at the crest and in the foreground, a plain white map of Nepal below it, and a man's and woman's right hands joined to signify gender equality.\n\nArt and architecture\nThe oldest known examples of architecture in Nepal are stupas of early Buddhist constructions in and around Kapilvastu in south-western Nepal, and those constructed by Ashoka in the Kathmandu Valley c. 250 BC. The characteristic architecture associated exclusively with Nepal was developed and refined by Newa artisans of the Kathmandu Valley starting no later than the Lichchhavi period.\n\nLiterature and the performing arts\nNepal's literature was closely intertwined with that of the rest of South Asia until its unification into a modern kingdom. The oldest extant Nepali language text is dated to the 13th century, but except for epigraphic material, Nepali language literature older than the 17th century has not been found. Newar literature dates back almost 500 years.\n\nCuisine\nNepali cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines, given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations. The country's cuisine varies substantially from each other, using locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruit.\n\nSports and recreation\nNepali indigenous sports, like dandi biyo and kabaddi, were considered the unofficial national sports until recently. Popular children's games include versions of tag, knucklebones, hopscotch, Duck, duck, goose, and lagori, while marbles, top, hoop rolling, and gully cricket are also popular among boys.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nepal\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nBefore the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal [c] The precise origin of the term Nepāl is uncertain Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century AD [16] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages [17]\n\n\nHistory\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved [29] [30] [31] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago [32] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time [33]\n\n\nAncient Nepal\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved [29] [30] [31] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago [32] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time [33]\n\n\nMedieval Nepal\nIn the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of India By the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated Baise rajyas, literally 22 states as they were counted The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in the intervening centuries; their language, later renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as much of North-east India [45]\n\n\nUnification, expansion and consolidation (1768–1951)\nIn the mid-18th century, Prithvi Narayan Shah, a Gorkha king, set out to put together what would become present-day Nepal He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the Battle of Kirtipur, he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769 [56]\nThe Gorkha control reached its height when the Kumaon and Garhwal Kingdoms in the west to Sikkim in the east came under Nepalese control A dispute with Tibet over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet prompted the Qing Emperor of China to start the Sino-Nepali War compelling the Nepali to retreat to their own borders in the north [57] The rivalry between the Kingdom of Nepal and the East India Company over the control of states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo-Nepali War (1815–16) At first, the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing Thus began the reputation of Gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers The war ended in the Sugauli Treaty, under which Nepal ceded recently captured lands [58] [45]\n\n\nContemporary history\nIn the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy Following the success of Indian Independence Movement which Nepalese activists had taken part in, with India's support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan, Nepali Congress was successful in toppling the Rana regime, establishing a parliamentary democracy After a decade of power wrangling between the king and the government, King Mahendra (ruled 1955–1972) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1960, and a \"partyless\" Panchayat system was made to govern Nepal The political parties were banned and politicians imprisoned or exiled [63] The Panchayat rule modernised the country, introducing reforms and developing infrastructure, but curtailed liberties and imposed heavy censorship In 1990, the People's Movement forced King Birendra (ruled 1972–2001) to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty democracy [63] [64]\n\n\nGeography\nNepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi) long and 200 kilometres (120 mi) wide, with an area of 147,516 km2 (56,956 sq mi) It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and longitudes 80° and 89°E Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east [76] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate [76] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas [76] The rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke through as late as 100,000 years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley In the western region, rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's deepest gorges [77] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment [78] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain [79] Nepal lies almost completely within this collision zone, occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400 km (1,500 mi)-long Himalayas, [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] with a small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau [77]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nNepal contains a disproportionately large diversity of plants and animals, relative to its size [90] [91] Nepal, in its entirety, forms the western portion of the eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, with notable biocultural diversity [92] The dramatic differences in elevation found in Nepal (60 m from sea level in the Terai plains, to 8,848 m Mount Everest) [93] result in a variety of biomes [90] The Eastern half of Nepal is richer in biodiversity as it receives more rain, compared to western parts, where arctic desert-type conditions are more common at higher elevations [91] Nepal is a habitat for 4.0% of all mammal species, 8.9% of bird species, 1.0% of reptile species, 2.5% of amphibian species, 1.9% of fish species, 3.7% of butterfly species, 0.5% of moth species and 0.4% of spider species [91] In its 35 forest-types and 118 ecosystems, [90] [h] Nepal harbours 2% of the flowering plant species, 3% of pteridophytes and 6% of bryophytes [91]\n\n\nPolitics and government\nNepal is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system [126] Nepal has been referred as the 'Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal' since 2015 [127] It has seven national political parties recognised in the federal parliament: Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist), Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, People's Socialist Party and Janamat Party [128] [126] Of the two major parties which both officially espouse democratic socialism, CPN(UML) is considered leftist while Nepali Congress is considered centrist [129] During most of the brief periods of democratic exercise in the 1950s and the 1990s, Nepali Congress held majority of seats in parliament; CPN (UML) was its competitor in the 1990s [130] After the Maoists entered the political process in 2006, they emerged as the third largest party [70] In the aftermath of the 2017 elections, the first one according to the new constitution, NCP, formed by the merger of CPN (UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre) had become the ruling party at the federal level and in six out of seven provinces [131] After the 2022 general election, the House of Representatives of 2nd Federal parliament was formed as hung parliament and a coalition government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal was formed in December 2022 [132] On 15 July 2024, K P Sharma Oli was sworn in as Nepali Prime minister for fourth time New coalition was formed between Nepali Congress, led by Sher Bahadur Deuba, and UML, led by Oli The party leaders will take turns as prime ministers for 18 months each until the next general elections in 2027 [133]\n\n\nPolitics\nNepal is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system [126] Nepal has been referred

municipalities [138] Each local unit is composed of wards There are 6,743 wards in total.\n\n\nLaws and law enforcement\nThe Constitution of Nepal is the supreme law of the land, and any other laws contradicting it are automatically invalid to the extent of the contradiction [139] The specific legal provisions are codified as Civil Code and Criminal Code, accompanied by Civil Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code respectively [140] The Supreme Court is the highest authority in the interpretation of laws and it can direct the parliament to amend or enact new laws as required The death penalty has been abolished [141] It recognises marital rape and supports abortion rights Owing to a rise in sex-selective abortion, however, constraints have been introduced Nepal is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, Conventions/Treaties on the prohibition of Biological, Chemical and Nuclear weapons, [142] International Labour Organization Fundamental Conventions, Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Paris climate accord Some legal provisions, guided by socio-economic, cultural and religious sensibilities, remain discriminatory There is gender-based discrimination against foreign nationals married to Nepali citizens [j] Paternal lineage of a person is valued and required in legal documents Many laws remain unenforced in practice.\n\n\nForeign relations\nNepal depends on diplomacy for national defence It maintains a policy of neutrality between its neighbours, has amicable relations with other countries in the region, and has a policy of non-alignment at the global stage Nepal is a member of SAARC, UN, WTO, BIMSTEC and ACD, among others It has bilateral diplomatic relations with 167 countries and the EU, [152] has embassies in 30 countries [153] and six consulates, [154] while 25 countries maintain embassies in Nepal, and more than 80 others maintain non-residential diplomatic missions [155] Nepal is one of the major contributors to the UN peacekeeping missions, having contributed more than 119,000 personnel to 42 missions since 1958 [156] Nepali people have a reputation for honesty, loyalty and bravery, which has led to them serving as legendary Gurkha warriors in the Indian and British armies for the last 200 years, with service in both world wars, India-Pakistan wars as well as Afghanistan and Iraq, [157] though Nepal was not directly involved in any of those conflicts, and winning the highest military awards, including the Victoria Cross and the Param Vir Chakra [158]\n\n\nMilitary and intelligence\nThe President is the supreme commander of the Nepali Army; its routine management is handled by the Ministry of Defence The military expenditure for 2018 was $398.5 million, [175] around 1.4% of GDP [176] An almost exclusively ground infantry force, Nepal Army numbers at less than one hundred thousand; [177] [178] [179] recruitment is voluntary [180] It has few aircraft, mainly helicopters, primarily used for transport, patrol, and search and rescue [181] Directorate of Military Intelligence under Nepal Army serves as the military intelligence agency; [182] National Investigation Department tasked with national and international intelligence gathering, is independent [177] Nepal Army is primarily used for routine security of critical assets, an anti-poaching patrol of national parks, counterinsurgency, and search and rescue during natural disasters; [183] it also undertakes major construction projects [184] There are no discriminatory policies on recruitment into the army, but it is dominated by men from elite Pahari warrior castes [185] [186]\n\n\nEconomy\nNepal is one of the least developed countries, which ranks 165th in the world [k] in nominal GDP per capita [187] and 162nd [l] in GDP per capita at PPP [188] Nepal's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019 was $34.186 billion [189] [190] Nepal has consistently been ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world [191] [192] [193] Nepal has been a member of WTO since 23 April 2004 [194]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in Nepal, employing more than a million people and contributing 7.9% of the total GDP [219] The number of international visitors crossed one million in 2018 for the first time (not counting Indian tourists arriving by land) [219] [220] Nepal's share of visitors to South Asia is about 6%, and they spend much less on average, with Nepal sharing 1.7% of the earnings [221] Premier destinations include Pokhara, the Annapurna trekking circuit and the four UNESCO world heritage sites—Lumbini, Sagarmatha National Park (home to Mount Everest), seven sites in the Kathmandu Valley collectively listed as one, and Chitwan National Park Most of Nepal's mountaineering earning comes from Mount Everest, which is more accessible from the Nepalese side [222]\n\n\nForeign employment\nThe rate of unemployment and underemployment exceeds half of the working-age population, [225] driving millions to seek employment abroad, mainly in India, the Gulf, and East Asia Mostly unskilled, uneducated, and indebted to loan sharks, these workers are swindled by the manpower companies and sent to exploitative employers or war-ridden countries under fraudulent contracts [226] [227] They have their passports seized, to be returned when the employer grants them leave or terminates their contracts Most do not get paid minimum wage, [228] and many are forced to forfeit all or part of the wages [229] Many Nepalis work in extremely unsafe conditions; an average of two workers die each day [230] Due to restrictions placed on women, many depend on traffickers to get out of the country, and end up victims of violence and abuse [231] Many Nepalese are believed to be working under slavery-like conditions, and Nepal spends billions of rupees rescuing stranded workers, on remuneration to the indebted families of the dead, and in legal costs for those arrested in foreign countries [232] [233] Though millions have raised themselves out of poverty, due to a lack of entrepreneurial skills, the remittance is largely spent on real estate and consumption [234] [233]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe bulk of energy in Nepal comes from biomass (80%) and imported fossil fuels (16%) [235] Most of the final energy consumption goes to the residential sector (84%) followed by transport (7%) and industry (6%); the transport and industry sectors have been expanding rapidly in recent years [235] Except for some lignite deposits, Nepal has no known oil, gas or coal deposits [235] All commercial fossil fuels (mainly oil, LPG and coal) are imported, spending 129% of the country's total export revenue [236] Only about 1% of the energy need is fulfilled by electricity [235] The perennial nature of Nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country's topography provide ideal conditions for the development of hydroelectric projects Estimates put Nepal's economically feasible hydro-power potential at approximately 42,000 MW [235] Nepal has been able to exploit only about 1,100 MW As most of it is generated from run-of-river (ROR) plants, the actual power produced is much lower in the dry winter months when peak demand can reach as high as 1,200 MW, and Nepal needs to import as much as 650 MW from India to meet the demands [237] Major hydro-power projects suffer delays and setbacks [238] [239] [240] Nepal's electrification rate (76%) is comparable to that of other countries in the region but there is significant disparity between the rural (72%) and urban (97%) areas [235] The position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs, high system losses, high generation costs, high overheads, over staffing, and lower domestic demand [241]\n\n\nEnergy\nThe bulk of energy in Nepal comes from biomass (80%) and imported fossil fuels (16%) [235] Most of the final energy

aviation is in a better state, with 47 airports, 11 of them with paved runways; [242] flights are frequent and support a sizeable traffic The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive As of 2016 [update], there were just over 11,890 km (7,388 mi) of paved roads, 16,100 km (10,004 mi) of unpaved roads, and just 59 km (37 mi) of railway line in the south [242] As of 2018 [update], all district headquarters (except Simikot) had been connected to the road network [184] Most of the rural roads are not operable during the rainy season; even national highways regularly become inoperable [243] Nepal depends almost entirely on assistance from countries like China, India and Japan, for building, maintenance and expansion of the road network The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Kolkata in India The national carrier, Nepal Airlines, is in poor shape due to mismanagement and corruption, and has been blacklisted by the EU [244] Internally, the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets, schools, and health clinics a challenge [214] Nepal has the worst road infrastructure in Asia [245]\n\n\nCommunication\nAccording to the Nepal Telecommunication Authority MIS August 2019 report, voice telephony subscription rate was at 2.70% of total population for fixed phones and 138.59% for mobile; 98% of all voice telephony was through mobile phones [246] Similarly, while an estimated 14.52% had access to fixed broadband, an additional 52.71% were accessing the internet using their mobile data subscriptions; almost 15 million of them with 3G or better [246] The mobile voice telephony and broadband market was dominated by two telecommunications companies, the state-owned Nepal Telecom (55%) and the private multinational, Ncell (40%) [246] Of the 21% market share enjoyed by fixed broadband, around 25% was again shared by Nepal Telecom, with the rest going to the private Internet Service Providers [246] Although there is high disparity in penetration rate between the rural and urban areas, mobile service has reached 75 districts of the country covering 90% of land area, and broadband access is expected to reach 90% of the population by 2020 [242]\n\n\nMedia\nAs of 2019 [update], the state operates three television stations as well as national and regional radio stations There are 117 private TV channels and 736 FM radio stations licensed for operation, at least 314 of them, community radio stations [242] According to the 2011 census, the percentage of households possessing radio was 50.82%, television 36.45%, cable TV 19.33%, and computer 7.28% [247] According to the Press Council Nepal classification, as of 2017 [update] of the 833 publications producing original content, ten national dailies and weeklies are rated A+ class [248] In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked Nepal at 106th in the world in terms of press freedom [249]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe citizens of Nepal are known as Nepali or Nepalese The Nepali are descendants of three major migrations from India, Tibet and North Burma, and the Chinese province of Yunnan via Assam Among the earliest inhabitants were the Kirat of the eastern region, Newars of the Kathmandu Valley, aboriginal Tharus of the Terai plains and the Khas Pahari people of the far-western hills Despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the Terai in recent years, the majority of Nepalese still live in the central highlands, and the northern mountains are sparsely populated.\n\n\nLargest cities\nNepal's diverse linguistic heritage stems from three major language groups: Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan and various indigenous language isolates The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as native language) according to the 2011 census are Nepali (44.6%), Maithili (11.7%), Bhojpuri (6.0%), Tharu (5.8%), Tamang (5.1%), Nepal Bhasa (3.2%), Bajjika (3%) and Magar (3.0%), Doteli (3.0%), Urdu (2.6%), Awadhi (1.89%), and Sunwar Nepal is home to at least four indigenous sign languages [citation

Doteli (3.0%), Urdu (2.6%), Awadhi (1.89%), and Sunwar Nepal is home to at least four indigenous sign languages [citation needed]\n\n\nReligion\nNepal is a secular country, as declared by the Constitution of Nepal 2012 (Part 1, Article 4), where secularism 'means religious, cultural freedom, along with the protection of religion, culture handed down from time immemorial (सनातन)' [255] [256] The 2011 census reported that the religion with the largest number of followers in Nepal was Hinduism (81.3% of the population), followed by Buddhism (9%); the remaining were Islam (4.4%), Kirant (3.1%), Christianity (1.4%) and Prakriti or nature worship (0.5%) [257] By percentage of population, Nepal has the largest population of Hindus in the world [258] Nepal was officially a Hindu Kingdom until recently, and Shiva was considered the guardian deity of the country [259] Although many government policies throughout history have disregarded or marginalised minority religions, Nepalese societies generally enjoy religious tolerance and harmony among all religions, with only isolated incidents of religiously motivated violence [260] [261] Nepal's constitution does not give anyone the right to convert any person to another religion Nepal also passed a more stringent anti-conversion law on 2017 [262] Nepal has the second-largest number of Hindus in the world after India [263]\n\n\nEducation\nNepal entered modernity in 1951 with a literacy rate of 5% and about 10,000 students enrolled in 300 schools [citation needed] By 2017, there were more than seven million students enrolled in 35,601 schools [264] The overall literacy rate (for population age five years and above) increased from 54.1% in 2001 to 65.9% in 2011 [250] The net primary enrolment rate reached 97% by 2017, [265] [266] yet enrolment was less than 60% at the secondary level (grades 9 –12), [267] and around 12% at the tertiary level [267] Though there is significant gender disparity in overall literacy rate, [250] girls have overtaken boys in enrolment to all levels of education [267] Nepal has eleven universities and four independent science academies [264] Nepal was ranked 109th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [268]\n\n\nHealth\nHealth care services in Nepal are provided by both the public and private sectors Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 71 years as of 2017, 153rd highest in the world, [276] up from 54 years in the 1990s and 35 years in 1950 [277] [278] Two-thirds of all deaths are due to non-communicable diseases; heart disease is the leading cause of death [279] While sedentary lifestyle, imbalanced diet and consumption of tobacco and alcohol has contributed in the rise of non-communicable diseases, many lose their life to communicable and treatable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition due to a lack of education, awareness and access to healthcare services [279] [280]\n\n\nImmigrants and refugees\nNepal has a long tradition of accepting immigrants and refugees [291] In modern times, Tibetans and Bhutanese have constituted a majority of refugees in Nepal Tibetan refugees began arriving in 1959, [292] and many more cross into Nepal every year [293] The Bhutanese Lhotsampa refugees began arriving in the 1980s and numbered more than 110,000 by the 2000s Most of them have been resettled in third countries [294] In late 2018, Nepal had a total of 20,800 confirmed refugees, 64% of them Tibetan and 31% Bhutanese [295] Economic immigrants, and refugees fleeing persecution or war, from neighbouring countries, Africa and the Middle East, termed \"urban refugees\" because they live in apartments in the cities instead of refugee camps, [296] [297] [298] lack official recognition; the government facilitates their resettlement in third countries [299]\n\n\nCulture\nTraditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy The Nepali caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia Social classes are defined by more than a hundred endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\" Nepal declared untouchability to be illegal in 1963 [302] and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives At the workplace and educational institutions in urban Nepal, caste-related identification has pretty much lost its importance [citation needed]\n\n\nSociety\nTraditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy The Nepali caste system embodies much of the social stratification

caste-related identification has pretty much lost its importance [citation needed]\n\n\nSymbols\nThe emblem of Nepal depicts the snowy Himalayas, the forested hills, and the fertile Terai, supported by a wreath of rhododendrons, with the national flag at the crest and in the foreground, a plain white map of Nepal below it, and a man's and woman's right hands joined to signify gender equality At the bottom is the national motto, a Sanskrit quote of patriotism attributed in Nepali folklore to Lord Rama, written in Devanagari script—\"Mother and motherland are greater than heaven\" [citation needed]\n\n\nArt and architecture\nThe oldest known examples of architecture in Nepal are stupas of early Buddhist constructions in and around Kapilvastu in south-western Nepal, and those constructed by Ashoka in the Kathmandu Valley c. 250 BC The characteristic architecture associated exclusively with Nepal was developed and refined by Newa artisans of the Kathmandu Valley starting no later than the Lichchhavi period A Tang dynasty Chinese travel book, probably based on records from c. 650 AD, describes contemporary Nepali architecture, predominantly built with wood, as rich in artistry, as well as wood and metal sculpture It describes a magnificent seven-storied pagoda in the middle of a palace, with copper-tiled roofs, its balustrade, grills, columns and beams set about with fine and precious stones, and four golden sculptures of Makaras in the four corners of the base spouting water from their mouths like a fountain, supplied by copper pipes connected to the runnels at the top of the tower Later Chinese chronicles describe Nepal's king's palace as an immense structure with many roofs, suggesting that the Chinese were not yet familiar with the pagoda architecture, which has now become one of the chief characteristics of Chinese architecture.\n\n\nLooting of the cultural heritage of Nepal\nCultural looting is a crisis in Nepal despite efforts to combat it [330] [331] [332] Volunteers working for the Nepal Heritage Recovery Campaign have helped recover artifacts [333] In 2022 Barakat Gallery's London branch relinquished 16th-century carved wooden Torana, a ceremonial gateway, and the 17th-century stone statue of a kneeling devotee, both taken from sacred sites near Kathmandu [334] In 2023 Nepalese artifacts suspected of having been looted were found in the Art Institute of Chicago, [335] the Metropolitan Museum of Art, [336] [337] the Dallas Museum of Art, [338] the Rubin Museum [339] and other museums, and turned up in auctions at Christie's, [340] Bonhams [341] and other auction houses.\n\n\nLiterature and the performing arts\nNepal's literature was closely intertwined with that of the rest of South Asia until its unification into a modern kingdom Literary works, which were written in Sanskrit by Brahmin priests educated and sometimes also based in Varanasi, included religious texts and other fantasies involving kings, gods and demons [342] The oldest extant Nepali language text is dated to the 13th century but except for the epigraphic material, Nepali language literature older than the 17th century have not been found Newar literature dates back almost 500 years [327] The modern history of Nepali literature begins with Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814–1868), who for the first time composed major and influential works in Nepali, the language accessible to the masses, most prominently, the Bhanubhakta Ramayana, a translation of the ancient Hindu epic [342] By the end of the nineteenth century, Motiram Bhatta had published print editions of the works of Acharya, and through his efforts, single-handedly popularised and propelled Nepali language literature into modernity [327] By the mid-twentieth century, Nepali literature was no longer limited to the Hindu literary traditions Influenced by western literary traditions, writers in this period started producing literary works addressing the contemporary social problems, [343] while many others continued to enrich Nepali poetic traditions with authentic Nepali poetry Newar literature also emerged as a premier literary tradition After the advent of democracy in 1951, Nepali literature flourished Literary works in many other languages began to be produced Nepali literature continued to modernise, and in recent years, has been strongly influenced by the post civil-war Nepali experience as well as global literary traditions [344] [345] [346] [327]\n\n\nClothing\nThe most widely worn traditional dress in Nepal, for both women and men, from ancient times until the advent of modern times, was draped [348] For women, it eventually took the form of a sari, a single long piece of cloth, famously six yards long, and of width spanning the lower body [348] The sari is tied around the waist and knotted at one end, wrapped around the lower body, and then over the shoulder [348] In its more modern form, it has been used to cover the head, and sometimes the face, as a veil, [348] particularly in the Terai It has been combined with an underskirt, or the petticoat, and tucked in the waistband for more secure fastening It is worn with a blouse, or cholo, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end, passing over the shoulder, now serving to obscure the upper body's contours, and to cover the midriff [348] Cholo-sari has become the attire of choice for formal occasions, official environs and festive gatherings In its more traditional form, as part of traditional dresses and as worn in daily life while performing household chores or labour, it takes the form of a fariya or gunyu, usually shorter than a sari in length as well as breadth, and all of it wrapped around the lower body.\n\n\nCuisine\nNepali cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other, using locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruit [353] The Columbian exchange had brought the potato, the tomato, maize, peanuts, cashew nuts, pineapples, guavas, and most notably, chilli peppers, to South Asia Each became staples of use [354] The cereals grown in Nepal, their choice, times, and regions of planting, correspond strongly to the timing of Nepal's monsoons, [355] and the variations in altitude Rice and wheat are mostly cultivated in the terai plains and well-irrigated valleys, and maize, millet, barley and buckwheat in the lesser fertile and drier hills [353] [356]\n\n\nSports and recreation\nNepali indigenous sports, like dandi biyo and kabaddi which were considered the unofficial national sports until recently, [323] are still popular in rural areas [364] Despite efforts, standardisation and development of dandi biyo has not been achieved, [365] [366] while Kabaddi, as a professional sport, is still in its infancy in Nepal [367] Bagh-chal, an ancient board game that is thought to have originated in Nepal, can be played on chalk-drawn boards, with pebbles, and is still popular today [368] [369] Ludo, snakes and ladders and carrom are popular pastimes [370] Chess is also played [364] Volleyball was declared as the national sport of Nepal in 2017 [323] Popular children's games include versions of tag, [364] knucklebones, [364] hopscotch, Duck, duck, goose [364] and lagori, while marbles, [364] top, hoop rolling and gully cricket are also popular among boys Rubber bands, or ranger bands cut from tubes in bike tyres, make a multi-purpose sporting equipment for Nepali children, which may be bunched or chained together, and used to play dodgeball, cat's cradle, jianzi [364] and a variety of skipping rope games

{"title": "14th_Dalai_Lama", "content": "\nEarly life and background\nLhamo Thondup [31] was born on 6 July 1935 to a farming and horse trading family in the small hamlet of Taktser, [e] or Chija Tagtser, [36] [f] at the edge of the traditional Tibetan region of Amdo in Qinghai Province [32]\n\n\nLife as the Dalai Lama\nHistorically the Dalai Lamas or their regents held political and religious leadership over Tibet from Lhasa with varying degrees of influence depending on the regions of Tibet and periods of history This began with the 5th Dalai Lama's rule in 1642 and lasted until the 1950s (except for 1705–1750), during which period the Dalai Lamas headed the Tibetan government or Ganden Phodrang Until 1912 however, when the 13th Dalai Lama declared the complete independence of Tibet, their rule was generally subject to patronage and protection of firstly Mongol kings (1642–1720) and then the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1720–1912) [74]\n\n\nCooperation and conflicts with the People's Republic of China\nThe Dalai Lama's formal rule as head of the government in Tibet was brief although he was enthroned as spiritual leader on 22 February 1940 When Chinese cadres entered Tibet in 1950, with a crisis looming, the Dalai Lama was asked to assume the role of head of state at the age of 15, which he did on 17 November 1950 Customarily the Dalai Lama would typically assume control at about the age of 20 [82]\n\n\nExile to India\nAt the outset of the 1959 Tibetan uprising, fearing for his life, the Dalai Lama and his retinue fled Tibet with the help of the CIA's Special Activities Division, [115] crossing into India on 30 March 1959, reaching Tezpur in Assam on 18 April [116] Some time later he set up the Government of Tibet in Exile in Dharamshala, India, [117] which is often referred to as \"Little Lhasa\" After the founding of the government in exile he re-established the approximately 80,000 Tibetan refugees who followed him into exile in agricultural settlements [70]\n\n\nInternational advocacy\nAt the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in 1987 in Washington, D.C., the Dalai Lama gave a speech outlining his ideas for the future status of Tibet The plan called for Tibet to become a democratic \"zone of peace\" without nuclear weapons, and with support for human rights [citation needed] The plan would come to be known as the \"Strasbourg proposal,\" because the Dalai Lama expanded on the plan at Strasbourg on 15 June 1988 There, he proposed the creation of a self-governing Tibet \"in association with the People's Republic of China.\" This would have been pursued by negotiations with the PRC government, but the plan was rejected by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile in 1991 [123] The Dalai Lama has indicated that he wishes to return to Tibet only if the People's Republic of China agrees not to make any precondition for his return [124] In the 1970s, the Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping set China's sole return requirement to the Dalai Lama as that he \"must  [come back] as a Chinese citizen .. that is, patriotism\" [125]\n\n\nTeaching activities, public talks\nDespite becoming 80 years old in 2015, he maintains a busy international lecture and teaching schedule [134] His public talks and teachings are usually webcast live in multiple languages, via an inviting organisation's website, or on the Dalai Lama's own website Scores of his past teaching videos can be viewed there, as well as public talks, conferences, interviews, dialogues and panel discussions [135]\n\n\nInterfaith dialogue\nThe Dalai Lama met Pope Paul VI at the Vatican in 1973 He met Pope John Paul II in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1990, and 2003 In 1990, he met a delegation of Jewish teachers in Dharamshala for an extensive interfaith dialogue [164] He has since visited Israel three times, and in 2006 met the Chief Rabbi of Israel In 2006, he met Pope Benedict XVI privately He has met the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Robert Runcie, and other leaders of the Anglican Church in London, Gordon B Hinckley, who at the time was the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as senior Eastern Orthodox Church, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, and Sikh officials.\n\n\nInterest in science, and Mind and Life Institute\nThe Dalai Lama's lifelong interest in science [175] [176] and technology [177] dates from his childhood in Lhasa, Tibet, when he was fascinated by mechanical objects like clocks, watches, telescopes, film projectors, clockwork soldiers [177] and motor cars, [178] and loved to repair, disassemble and reassemble them [175] Once, observing the Moon through a telescope as a child, he realised it was a crater-pocked lump of rock and not a heavenly body emitting its own light as Tibetan cosmologists had taught him [175] He has also said that had he not been brought up as a monk he would probably have been an engineer [179] On his first trip to the west in 1973 he asked to visit Cambridge University's astrophysics department in the UK and he sought out renowned scientists such as Sir Karl Popper, David Bohm and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, [178] who taught him the basics of science.\n\n\nPersonal meditation practice\n\nThe Dalai Lama uses various meditation techniques, including analytic meditation and emptiness meditation [205] He has said that the aim of meditation is \n\nSocial stances\nDespite initially advocating for Tibetan independence from 1961 to 1974, the Dalai Lama no longer supports it Instead he advocates for more meaningful autonomy for Tibetans within the People's Republic of China [208] This approach is known as the \"Middle Way\" In 2005, the 14th Dalai Lama emphasized that Tibet is a part of China, and Tibetan culture and Buddhism are part of Chinese culture \n [209] In a speech at Kolkata in 2017, the Dalai Lama stated that Tibetans wanted to stay with China and they did not desire independence He said that he believed that China after opening up, had changed 40 to 50 per cent of what it was earlier, and that Tibetans wanted to get more development from China [210] In October 2020, the Dalai Lama stated that he did not support Tibetan independence and hoped to visit China as a Nobel Prize winner He said \"I prefer the concept of a 'republic' in the People's Republic of China In the concept of republic, ethnic minorities are like Tibetans, The Mongols, Manchus, and Xinjiang Uyghurs, we can live in harmony\" [211]\n\n\nTibetan independence\nDespite initially advocating for Tibetan independence from 1961 to 1974, the Dalai Lama no longer supports it Instead he advocates for more meaningful autonomy for Tibetans within the People's Republic of China [208] This approach is known as the \"Middle Way\" In 2005, the 14th Dalai Lama emphasized that Tibet is a part of China, and Tibetan culture and Buddhism are part of Chinese culture \n [209] In a speech at Kolkata in 2017, the Dalai Lama stated that Tibetans wanted to stay with China and they did not desire independence He said that he believed that China after opening up, had changed 40 to 50 per cent of what it was earlier, and that Tibetans wanted to get more development from China [210] In October 2020, the Dalai Lama stated that he did not support Tibetan independence and hoped to visit China as a Nobel Prize winner He said \"I prefer the concept of a 'republic' in the People's Republic of China In the concept of republic, ethnic minorities are like Tibetans, The Mongols, Manchus, and Xinjiang Uyghurs, we can live in harmony\" [211]\n\n\nAbortion\nThe Dalai Lama has said that, from the perspective of the Buddhist precepts, abortion is an act of killing [214] In 1993, he clarified a more nuanced position, stating, \".. it depends on the circumstances If the unborn child will be retarded or if the birth will create serious problems for the parent, these are cases where there can be an exception I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance.\" [215]\n\n\nDeath penalty\nThe Dalai Lama has repeatedly expressed his opposition to the death penalty, saying that it contradicts the Buddhist philosophy of non-violence and that it expresses anger, not compassion [216] During a 2005 visit to Japan, a country which has the death penalty, the Dalai Lama called for the abolition of the death penalty and said in his address, \"Criminals, people who commit crimes, usually society rejects these people They are also part of society Give them some form of punishment to say they were wrong, but show them they are part of society and can change Show them compassion.\" [217] The Dalai Lama has also praised U.S states that have abolished the death penalty [218]\n\n\nDemocracy, nonviolence, religious harmony, and Tibet's relationship with India\nThe Dalai Lama says that he is active in spreading India's message of nonviolence and religious harmony throughout the world [219] \"I am the messenger of India's ancient thoughts the world over.\" He has said that democracy has deep roots in India He says he considers India the master and Tibet its disciple, as great scholars went from India to Tibet to teach Buddhism He has noted that millions of people lost their lives in violence and the economies of many countries were ruined due to conflicts in the 20th century \"Let the 21st century be a century of tolerance and dialogue.\" [220]\n\n\nDiet and animal welfare\nPeople think of animals as if they were vegetables, and that is not right We have to change the way people think about animals I encourage the Tibetan people and all people to move toward a vegetarian diet that doesn't cause suffering.\n\nEconomics and political stance\nThe Dalai Lama has referred to himself as a Marxist and has articulated criticisms of capitalism [247] [248] [249]\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe Dalai Lama is outspoken in his concerns about environmental problems, frequently giving public talks on themes related to the environment He has pointed out that many rivers in Asia originate in Tibet, and that the melting of Himalayan glaciers could affect the countries in which the rivers flow [256] He acknowledged official Chinese laws against deforestation in Tibet, but lamented they can be ignored due to possible corruption [257] He was quoted as saying \"ecology should be part of our daily life\"; [258] personally, he takes showers instead of baths, and turns lights off when he leaves a room [256]\n\n\nSexuality\nThe Dalai Lama's stances on topics of sexuality have changed over time.\n\n\nWomen's rights\nIn 2007, he said that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman: \"If a woman reveals herself as more useful the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form.\" [273]\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2013, at the Culture of Compassion event in Derry, Northern Ireland, the Dalai Lama said that \"Warm-heartedness is a key factor for healthy individuals, healthy families and healthy communities.\" [278]\n\n\nResponse to COVID-19\nIn a 2020 statement in Time magazine on the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dalai Lama said that the pandemic must be combated with compassion, empirical science, prayer, and the courage of healthcare workers He emphasised \"emotional disarmament\" (seeing things with a clear and realistic perspective, without fear or rage) and wrote: \"The outbreak of this terrible coronavirus has shown that what happens to one person can soon affect every other being But it also reminds us that a compassionate or constructive act – whether working in hospitals or just observing social distancing – has the potential to help many.\" [279]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn September 2018, speaking at a conference in Malmö, Sweden, home to a large immigrant population, the Dalai Lama said \"I think Europe belongs to the Europeans,\" but also that Europe was \"morally responsible\" for helping \"a refugee really facing danger against their life\" He stated that Europe has a responsibility to refugees to \"receive them, help them, educate them,\" but that they should aim to return to their places of origin and that \"they ultimately should rebuild their own country\" [280] [281]\n\n\nRetirement and succession plans\nIn 2007 the 14th Dalai Lama said his reincarnation could be a woman [284] This was mentioned again in 2015 [285] and 2019 [286]\n\n\nCIA Tibetan program\nIn October 1998, the Dalai Lama's administration acknowledged that it received $1.7 million a year in the 1960s from the U.S government through a Central Intelligence Agency program [300] When asked by CIA officer John Kenneth Knaus in 1995 to comment on the CIA Tibetan program, the Dalai Lama replied that though it helped the morale of those resisting the Chinese, \"thousands of lives were lost in the resistance\" and further, that \"the U.S Government had involved itself in his country's affairs not to help Tibet but only as a Cold War tactic to challenge the Chinese.\" [301] As part of the program the Dalai Lama received 180,000 dollars a year from 1959 till 1974 for his own personal use [302]\n\n\nCriticism\nThe Chinese Communist Party has criticised the 14th Dalai Lama for his close ties with India [305] In 2008, the Dalai Lama said that Arunachal Pradesh, partially claimed by China, is part of India, citing the disputed 1914 Simla Accord [306] In 2010 at the International Buddhist Conference in Gujarat, he described himself as a \"son of India\" and \"Tibetan in appearance, but an Indian in spirituality.\" The newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, People's Daily, questioned if the Dalai Lama, by considering himself Indian rather than Chinese, is still entitled to represent Tibetans, alluding to the links between Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama siding with India on southern Tibet [307] Dhundup Gyalpo, the Dalai Lama's eventual secretary in New Delhi, argued that Tibetan and Chinese peoples have no connections apart from a few culinary dishes and that Chinese Buddhists could also be deemed \"Indian in spirituality\", because both Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism originated from India [308] [309]\n\n\nTies to India\nThe Chinese Communist Party has criticised the 14th Dalai Lama for his close ties with India [305] In 2008, the Dalai Lama said that Arunachal Pradesh, partially claimed by China, is part of India, citing the disputed 1914 Simla Accord [306] In 2010 at the International Buddhist Conference in Gujarat, he described himself as a \"son of India\" and \"Tibetan in appearance, but an Indian in spirituality.\" The newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, People's Daily, questioned if the Dalai Lama, by considering himself Indian rather than Chinese, is still entitled to represent Tibetans, alluding to the links between Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama siding with India on southern Tibet [307] Dhundup Gyalpo, the Dalai Lama's eventual secretary in New Delhi, argued that Tibetan and Chinese peoples have no connections apart from a few culinary dishes and that Chinese Buddhists could also be deemed \"Indian in spirituality\", because both Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism originated from India [308] [309]\n\n\nShugden controversy\nDorje Shugden is an entity in Tibetan Buddhism that, since the 1930s, has become a point of contention over whether to include or exclude certain non-Gelug teachings After the 1975 publication of the Yellow Book containing stories about Dorje Shugden acting wrathfully against Gelugpas who also practised Nyingma, the 14th Dalai Lama, himself a Gelugpa and advocate of an inclusive approach, [310] publicly renounced the practice of Dorje Shugden [311] [312] Several groups broke away as a result, notably the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) According to Tibetologists, the Dalai Lama's disapproval has reduced the prevalence of Shugden sects among Tibetans in China and India [313]\n\n\nComments on a potential female Dalai Lama\nIn 2010, the Dalai Lama told a reporter that the first time someone asked him about the possibility of a female Dalai Lama, he said \"if she is an ugly female, she won't be very effective, will she?\" [319] In 2015, he once said \"more than 50 years ago\" in Paris to a women's magazine reporter that a female Dalai Lama would need to have a \"very, very attractive\" face, as otherwise she would be \"not much use\" [320] [321] When asked about the comment in 2019, he reiterated that a female successor \"should be more attractive.\" [320] In response to the controversy sparked by the interview, his office released a statement to clarify his remarks and put them into context, expressing that the Dalai Lama \"is deeply sorry that people have been hurt by what he said and offers his sincere apologies.\" The statement explains, the original context of the Dalai Lama's referring to the physical appearance of a female successor was a conversation with the then Paris editor of Vogue magazine, who had invited His Holiness in 1992 to guest-edit the next edition She asked if a future Dalai Lama could be a woman His Holiness replied, 'Certainly, if that would be more helpful,' adding, as a joke, that she should be attractive [322] The statement also noted, the Dalai Lama \"consistently emphasizes the need for people to connect with each other on a deeper human level, rather than getting caught up in preconceptions based on superficial appearances.\" [277] [323]\n\n\nGedhun Choekyi Nyima\nIn April 2018, the Dalai Lama confirmed Chinese government claims about Gedhun Choekyi Nyima by saying that he knew from \"reliable sources\" that the Panchen Lama he had recognised was alive and receiving normal education He said he hoped that the Chinese-recognised Panchen Lama (Gyaincain Norbu) studied well under the guidance of a good teacher, adding that there were instances in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, of a reincarnated lama taking more than one manifestation [324] [325]\n\n\nControversy over young boy and \"suck my tongue\"\nIn a February 2023 video, the Dalai Lama was recorded kissing a young boy on the lips and asking the child to suck his tongue [326] [327] The meeting took place at his temple in Dharamshala, India Nearly 100 students were in attendance, as well as the boy's mother, a trustee of the event's organiser [328] [329] Her son had asked for and received a hug from the Dalai Lama He then pointed to his own cheek and lips, requesting and receiving two kisses at those locations from the boy, pulling the child's chin closer during the second one [330] [331] He then gestured at and said \"suck my tongue,\" stretching it out and moved closer [332] [333] The boy had been pulling away, and the two ended up pressing their heads together [334] [335] The video resurfaced in April 2023, and the Dalai Lama's conduct was condemned by many who called it \"inappropriate,\" \"scandalous\" and \"disgusting\" [327] His office issued a statement saying that the Dalai Lama often teases \"in an innocent and playful way,\" adding that he wants to apologise to those involved \"for the hurt his words may have caused\" and \"regrets the incident\" [336] [337]\n\n\nVideo of touching Lady Gaga\nFollowing the temple child incident in 2023, video footage from 2016 showing the Dalai Lama touching Lady Gaga's leg caused further controversy [349] [350] The event occurred during a compassion conference in Indiana about individuals experiencing physical and psychological difficulties and how to support them [351] In the video, the religious leader is seen hardly paying any attention to the speaker He looked down at Lady Gaga's leg, where the skin is exposed from her torn trousers, and touched it with his fingers Lady Gaga looked back at the Dalai Lama, shook her head, and smiled awkwardly [352] When he attempted the same action on her other leg, she grabbed his hand and stopped him from following through [353] [354] Following the resurfaced Lady Gaga incident, another video was posted on Spanish-language social media (notably X) showing him stroking a disabled girl's arm at an unknown event, drawing further criticism [355] [351]\n\n\nPublic image\nThe Dalai Lama places highly in global surveys of the world's most admired men, ranking with Pope Francis as among the world's

14th Dalai Lama**\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is a Buddhist monk and the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He was born on July 6, 1935, in the small hamlet of Taktser, in the Amdo region of Qinghai Province, China.\n\n**Early Life and Background**\n\nLhamo Thondup was born to a farming and horse trading family. His father, Choekyong Tsering, was a farmer, and his mother, Diki Tsering, was a housewife. He was the fourth of five children, and his family was considered to be of modest means. Lhamo Thondup was recognized as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama at the age of two and a half, and he was taken to the Potala Palace in Lhasa to begin his monastic education.\n\n**Life as the Dalai Lama**\n\nHistorically, the Dalai Lamas or their regents held political and religious leadership over Tibet from Lhasa with varying degrees of influence depending on the regions of Tibet and periods of history. This began with the 5th Dalai Lama's rule in 1642 and lasted until the 1950s (except for 1705–1750), during which period the Dalai Lamas headed the Tibetan government or Ganden Phodrang. Until 1912, however, when the 13th Dalai Lama declared the complete independence of Tibet, their rule was generally subject to patronage and protection of firstly Mongol kings (1642–1720) and then the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1720–1912).\n\n**Cooperation and Conflicts with the People's Republic of China**\n\nThe Dalai Lama's formal rule as head of the government in Tibet was brief although he was enthroned as spiritual leader on February 22, 1940. When Chinese cadres entered Tibet in 1950, with a crisis looming, the Dalai Lama was asked to assume the role of head of state at the age of 15, which he did on November 17, 1950. Customarily, the Dalai Lama would typically assume control at about the age of 20.\n\n**Exile to India**\n\nAt the outset of the 1959 Tibetan uprising, fearing for his life, the Dalai Lama and his retinue fled Tibet with the help of the CIA's Special Activities Division, crossing into India on March 30, 1959, reaching Tezpur in Assam on April 18. Some time later, he set up the Government of Tibet in Exile in Dharamshala, India, which is often referred to as \"Little Lhasa.\" After the founding of the government in exile, he re-established the approximately 80,000 Tibetan refugees who followed him into exile in agricultural settlements.\n\n**International Advocacy**\n\nAt the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in 1987 in Washington, D.C., the Dalai Lama gave a speech outlining his ideas for the future status of Tibet. The plan called for Tibet to become a democratic \"zone of peace\" without nuclear weapons, and with support for human rights. The plan would come to be known as the \"Strasbourg proposal,\" because the Dalai Lama expanded on the plan at Strasbourg on June 15, 1988. There, he proposed the creation of a self-governing Tibet \"in association with the People's Republic of China.\" This would have been pursued by negotiations with the PRC government, but the plan was rejected by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile in 1991.\n\n**Teaching Activities, Public Talks**\n\nDespite becoming 80 years old in 2015, he maintains a busy international lecture and teaching schedule. His public talks and teachings are usually webcast live in multiple languages, via an inviting organization's website, or on the Dalai Lama's own website. Scores of his past teaching videos can be viewed there, as well as public talks, conferences, interviews, dialogues, and panel discussions.\n\n**Interfaith Dialogue**\n\nThe Dalai Lama has been involved in numerous interfaith dialogues and has met with leaders from various faiths, including Pope Paul VI, Pope John Paul II, and Pope Benedict XVI. In 1990, he met a delegation of Jewish teachers in Dharamshala for an extensive interfaith dialogue. He has since visited Israel three times and has met the Chief Rabbi of Israel. In 2006, he met Pope Benedict XVI privately.\n\n**Interest in Science, and Mind and Life Institute**\n\nThe Dalai Lama's lifelong interest in science dates from his childhood in Lhasa, Tibet, when he was fascinated by mechanical objects like clocks, watches, telescopes, film projectors, clockwork soldiers, and motor cars. He has also said that had he not been brought up as a monk, he would probably have been an engineer. On his first trip to the West in 1973, he asked to visit Cambridge University's astrophysics department in the UK and sought out renowned scientists such as Sir Karl Popper, David Bohm, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker.\n\n**Personal Meditation Practice**\n\nThe Dalai Lama uses various meditation techniques, including analytic meditation and emptiness meditation. He has said that the aim of meditation is to cultivate a calm and clear mind, which is essential for spiritual growth and development.\n\n**Social Stances**\n\nThe Dalai Lama has taken a number of social stances on various issues. He has expressed his opposition to the death penalty, saying that it contradicts the Buddhist philosophy of non-violence. He has also spoken out against abortion, but has clarified his position by stating that it depends on the circumstances. In 2007, he said that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman, and in 2015, he reiterated that a female successor should be more attractive.\n\n**Tibetan Independence**\n\nThe Dalai Lama has stated that he no longer supports Tibetan independence, instead advocating for more meaningful autonomy for Tibetans within the People's Republic of China. This approach is known as the \"Middle Way.\" In 2005, he emphasized that Tibet is a part of China, and Tibetan culture and Buddhism are part of Chinese culture.\n\n**Health**\n\nThe Dalai Lama has spoken about the importance of health and well-being. In 2013, at the Culture of Compassion event in Derry, Northern Ireland, he said that \"warm-heartedness is a key factor for healthy individuals, healthy families, and healthy communities.\"\n\n**Immigration**\n\nIn September 2018, speaking at a conference in Malmö, Sweden, he said that \"I think Europe belongs to the Europeans,\" but also that Europe was \"morally responsible\" for helping \"a refugee really facing danger against their life.\" He stated that Europe has a responsibility to refugees to \"receive them, help them, educate them,\" but that they should aim to return to their places of origin and \"they ultimately should rebuild their own country.\"\n\n**Retirement and Succession Plans**\n\nIn 2007, the Dalai Lama said that his reincarnation could be a woman. This was mentioned again in 2015 and 2019. In April 2018, the Dalai Lama confirmed Chinese government claims about Gedhun Choekyi Nyima by saying that he knew from \"reliable sources\" that the Panchen Lama he had recognized was alive and receiving normal education.\n\n**CIA Tibetan Program**\n\nIn October 1998, the Dalai Lama's administration acknowledged that it received $1.7 million a year in the 1960s from the U.S government through a Central Intelligence Agency program. When asked by CIA officer John Kenneth Knaus in 1995 to comment on the CIA Tibetan program, the Dalai Lama replied that though it helped the morale of those resisting the Chinese, \"thousands of lives were lost in the resistance\" and further, that \"the U.S Government had involved itself in his country's affairs not to help Tibet but only as a Cold War tactic to challenge the Chinese.\"\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has criticized the Dalai Lama for his close ties with India. In 2008, the Dalai Lama said that Arunachal Pradesh, partially claimed by China, is part of India, citing the disputed 1914 Simla Accord. In 2010, at the International Buddhist Conference in Gujarat, he described himself as a \"son of India\" and \"Tibetan in appearance, but an Indian in spirituality.\"\n\n**Shugden Controversy**\n\nThe Dalai Lama has been involved in a controversy surrounding the practice of Dorje Shugden, an entity in Tibetan Buddhism that has become a point of contention over whether to include or exclude certain non-Gelug teachings. He publicly renounced the practice of Dorje Shugden in 1975, after the publication of the Yellow Book containing stories about Dorje Shugden acting wrathfully against Gelugpas who also practiced Nyingma.\n\n**Controversy over Young Boy and \"Suck My Tongue\"**\n\nIn February 2023, a video was recorded of the Dalai Lama kissing a young boy on the lips and asking the child to suck his tongue. The meeting took place at his temple in Dharamshala, India. The video resurfaced in April 2023, and the Dalai Lama's conduct was condemned by many who called it \"inappropriate,\" \"scandalous,\" and \"disgusting.\"\n\n**Public Image**\n\nThe Dalai Lama places highly in global surveys of the world's most admired men, ranking with Pope Francis as among the world's religious leaders cited as the most admired.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nThe Dalai Lama has received numerous awards and honors worldwide over his spiritual and political career. For a more complete list, see Awards and Honors presented to the 14th Dalai Lama.\n\n**Publications**\n\nThe Dalai Lama has written numerous books on various topics, including Buddhism, philosophy, and spirituality. Some of his notable works include \"The Art of Happiness,\" \"The Power of Forgiveness,\" and \"The Universe in a Single Atom.\"\n\n**Discography**\n\nThe Dalai Lama has released several albums of his teachings and talks, including \"The Dalai Lama Speaks\" and \"The Teachings of the Dalai Lama.\"\n\n**Studio Albums**\n\n* \"The Dalai Lama Speaks\" (1997)\n* \"The Teachings of the Dalai Lama\"

as the \"Strasbourg proposal,\" because the Dalai Lama expanded on the plan at Strasbourg on 15 June 1988 There, he proposed the creation of a self-governing Tibet \"in association with the People's Republic of China.\" This would have been pursued by negotiations with the PRC government, but the plan was rejected by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile in 1991 [123] The Dalai Lama has indicated that he wishes to return to Tibet only if the People's Republic of China agrees not to make any precondition for his return [124] In the 1970s, the Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping set China's sole return requirement to the Dalai Lama as that he \"must  [come back] as a Chinese citizen .. that is, patriotism\" [125]\n\n\nTeaching activities, public talks\nDespite becoming 80 years old in 2015, he

Orthodox Church, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, and Sikh officials.\n\n\nInterest in science, and Mind and Life Institute\nThe Dalai Lama's lifelong interest in science [175] [176] and technology [177] dates from his childhood in Lhasa, Tibet, when he was fascinated by mechanical objects like clocks, watches, telescopes, film projectors, clockwork soldiers [177] and motor cars, [178] and loved to repair, disassemble and reassemble them [175] Once, observing the Moon through a telescope as a child, he realised it was a crater-pocked lump of rock and not a heavenly body emitting its own light as Tibetan cosmologists had taught him [175] He has also said that had he not been brought up as a monk he would probably have been an engineer [179] On his first trip to the west in 1973 he asked to visit Cambridge University's astrophysics department in the UK and he sought out renowned scientists such as Sir Karl Popper, David Bohm and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, [178] who taught him the basics of science.\n\n\nPersonal meditation practice\n\nThe Dalai Lama uses various meditation techniques, including analytic meditation and emptiness meditation [205] He has said that the aim of meditation is

Chinese culture \n [209] In a speech at Kolkata in 2017, the Dalai Lama stated that Tibetans wanted to stay with China and they did not desire independence He said that he believed that China after

Tibetan independence and hoped to visit China as a Nobel Prize winner He said \"I prefer the concept of a 'republic' in the People's Republic of China In the concept of republic, ethnic minorities are

be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance.\" [215]\n\n\nDeath penalty\nThe Dalai Lama has repeatedly expressed his opposition to the death penalty, saying that it contradicts the Buddhist philosophy of non-violence and that it expresses anger, not compassion [216] During a 2005 visit to Japan, a country which has the death penalty, the Dalai Lama called for the abolition of the death penalty and said in his address, \"Criminals, people who commit crimes, usually society rejects these people They are also part of society Give them some form of punishment to say they were

part of our daily life\"; [258] personally, he takes showers instead of baths, and turns lights off when he leaves a room [256]\n\n\nSexuality\nThe Dalai Lama's stances on topics of sexuality have changed over time.\n\n\nWomen's rights\nIn 2007, he said that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman: \"If a woman reveals herself as more useful the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form.\" [273]\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2013, at the Culture of Compassion event in Derry, Northern Ireland, the Dalai Lama said that \"Warm-heartedness is a key factor for healthy individuals, healthy families and healthy communities.\" [278]\n\n\nResponse to COVID-19\nIn a 2020 statement in Time magazine on the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dalai Lama said that the pandemic must be combated with compassion, empirical science, prayer, and the courage of healthcare workers He emphasised \"emotional disarmament\" (seeing things with a clear and realistic perspective, without fear or rage) and wrote: \"The outbreak of this terrible coronavirus has shown that what happens to one person can soon affect every other being But it also reminds us that a compassionate or constructive act – whether working in hospitals or just observing social distancing – has the potential to help many.\" [279]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn September 2018, speaking at a conference in Malmö, Sweden, home to a large immigrant population, the Dalai Lama said \"I think Europe belongs to the Europeans,\" but also that Europe was \"morally responsible\" for helping \"a refugee really facing danger against their

Accord [306] In 2010 at the International Buddhist Conference in Gujarat, he described himself as a \"son of India\" and \"Tibetan in appearance, but an Indian in spirituality.\" The newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, People's Daily, questioned if the Dalai Lama, by considering himself Indian rather than Chinese, is still entitled to represent Tibetans, alluding to the links between Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama siding with India on southern Tibet [307] Dhundup Gyalpo, the Dalai Lama's eventual secretary in New Delhi, argued that Tibetan and Chinese peoples have no connections apart from a few culinary dishes and that Chinese Buddhists could also be deemed \"Indian in spirituality\", because both Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism originated from India [308] [309]\n\n\nTies to India\nThe Chinese Communist Party has criticised the 14th Dalai Lama for his close ties with India [305] In 2008, the Dalai Lama said that Arunachal Pradesh,

Gyalpo, the Dalai Lama's eventual secretary in New Delhi, argued that Tibetan and Chinese peoples have no connections apart from a few culinary dishes and that Chinese Buddhists could also be deemed \"Indian in spirituality\", because both Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism originated from India [308] [309]\n\n\nShugden controversy\nDorje Shugden is an entity in Tibetan Buddhism that, since the 1930s, has become a point of contention over whether to include or exclude certain non-Gelug teachings After the 1975 publication of the Yellow Book containing stories about Dorje Shugden acting wrathfully against Gelugpas who also practised Nyingma, the 14th Dalai Lama, himself a Gelugpa and advocate of an inclusive approach, [310] publicly renounced the practice of Dorje Shugden [311] [312] Several groups broke away as a result, notably the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) According to Tibetologists, the Dalai Lama's disapproval has reduced the prevalence of Shugden sects among Tibetans in China and India [313]\n\n\nComments on a potential female Dalai Lama\nIn 2010, the Dalai Lama told a reporter that the first time someone asked him about the possibility of a female Dalai Lama, he said \"if she is an ugly female, she won't be very effective, will she?\" [319] In 2015, he once said \"more than 50 years ago\" in Paris to a women's magazine reporter that a female Dalai Lama would need to have a \"very, very attractive\" face, as otherwise she would be \"not much use\" [320] [321] When asked about the comment in 2019, he reiterated that a female successor \"should be more attractive.\" [320] In response to the controversy sparked by the interview, his office released a statement to clarify his remarks and put them into context, expressing that the Dalai Lama \"is deeply sorry that people have been hurt by what he said and offers his sincere apologies.\" The statement explains, the original context of the Dalai Lama's referring to the physical appearance of a female successor was a conversation with the then Paris editor of Vogue magazine, who had invited His Holiness in 1992 to guest-edit the next edition She asked if a future Dalai Lama could be a woman His Holiness replied, 'Certainly, if that would be more helpful,' adding, as a joke, that she should be attractive [322] The statement also noted, the Dalai Lama \"consistently emphasizes the need for people to connect with each other on a deeper human level, rather than getting caught up in preconceptions based on superficial appearances.\" [277] [323]\n\n\nGedhun Choekyi Nyima\nIn April 2018, the Dalai Lama confirmed Chinese government claims about Gedhun Choekyi Nyima by saying that he knew from \"reliable sources\" that the Panchen Lama he had recognised was alive and receiving normal education He said he hoped that the Chinese-recognised Panchen Lama (Gyaincain Norbu) studied well under the guidance of a good teacher, adding that there were instances in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, of a reincarnated lama taking more than one manifestation [324] [325]\n\n\nControversy over young boy and \"suck my tongue\"\nIn a February 2023 video, the Dalai Lama was recorded kissing a young boy on the lips and asking the child to suck his tongue [326] [327] The meeting took place at his temple in Dharamshala, India Nearly 100 students were in attendance, as well as the boy's mother, a trustee of the event's organiser [328] [329] Her son had asked for and received a hug from the Dalai Lama He then pointed to his own cheek and lips, requesting and receiving two kisses at those locations from the boy, pulling the child's chin closer during the second one [330] [331] He then gestured at and said \"suck my tongue,\" stretching it out and moved closer [332] [333] The boy had been pulling away, and the two ended up pressing their heads together [334] [335] The video resurfaced in April 2023, and the Dalai Lama's conduct was condemned by many who called it \"inappropriate,\" \"scandalous\" and \"disgusting\" [327] His office issued a statement saying that the Dalai Lama often teases \"in an innocent and playful way,\" adding that he wants to apologise to those involved \"for the hurt his words may have caused\" and \"regrets the incident\" [336] [337]\n\n\nVideo of touching Lady Gaga\nFollowing the temple child incident in 2023, video footage from 2016 showing the Dalai Lama touching Lady Gaga's leg caused further controversy [349] [350] The event occurred during a compassion conference in Indiana about individuals experiencing physical and psychological difficulties and how to support them [351] In the video, the religious leader is seen hardly paying any attention to the speaker He looked down at Lady Gaga's leg, where the skin is exposed from her torn trousers, and touched it with his fingers Lady Gaga looked back at the Dalai Lama, shook her head, and smiled awkwardly [352] When he attempted the same action on her other leg, she grabbed his hand and stopped him from following through [353] [354] Following the resurfaced Lady Gaga incident, another video was posted on Spanish-language social media (notably X) showing him stroking a disabled girl's arm at an unknown event, drawing further criticism [355] [351]\n\n\nPublic image\nThe Dalai Lama places highly in global surveys of the world's most admired men, ranking with Pope Francis as among the world's religious leaders cited as the most admired [356] [357]\n\n\nIn the media\nThe 14th Dalai Lama has appeared in several non-fiction films including:\n\n\nAwards and honours\nThe Dalai Lama has received numerous awards and honours worldwide over his spiritual and political career [372] [373] [374] For a more complete list see Awards and honours presented to the 14th Dalai

{"title": "All_I_Want_for_Christmas_Is_You", "content": "\nBackground and writing\nFollowing the success of her 1993 album Music Box, Carey and her management at Columbia Records—including Carey's then-husband, Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia's parent label Sony Music Entertainment—began planning further projects [12] The group discussed recording a Christmas album, but hesitated, as such albums were typically released when artists' careers are waning [13] Carey's songwriting partner of over four years, Walter Afanasieff, said in 2015: \"Back then, you didn't have a lot of artists with Christmas albums It wasn't a known science at all back then, and there was nobody who did new, big Christmas songs So we were going to release it as kind of an everyday, 'Hey, you know, we're putting out a Christmas album No big deal.'\" [12]\n\n\nComposition and lyrics\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is an uptempo song, composed with pop, soul, R&B, gospel, dance-pop and adult contemporary influences and stylings [17] [18] [19] By early August, Carey already had two original songs written alongside Afanasieff including the \"sad and ballad-y\" \"Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)\" and the \"Gospel-tinged and religious\" \"Jesus Born on This Day\" The third and final original song the pair planned to write was to be centered and inspired and in the vein of a \"Phil Spector, old rock 'n roll, sixties-sounding Christmas song\" [12] [15]\n\n\nReception\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" received widespread acclaim Roch Parisien from AllMusic called the song \"a year-long banger\", complimenting its instrumentation and melody [23] Steve Morse, editor of The Boston Globe, wrote that Carey sang with a lot of soul [26] In his review for Carey's Merry Christmas II You, Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun-Times called the song \"a simple, well-crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon\" [27] Shona Craven of Scotland's The Herald, said, \" [it's] a song of optimism and joy that maybe, just maybe, hints at the real meaning of Christmas.\" [28] Additionally, she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject \"you\" in the lyrics, explaining, \"Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it's for absolutely everyone.\" Craven opened her review with a bold statement: \"Bing Crosby may well be turning in his grave, but no child of the 1980s will be surprised to see Mariah Carey's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation's top festive song.\" [28] While reviewing the 2009 remix version, Becky Bain from Idolator called the song a \"timeless classic\" and wrote, \"We love the original song to pieces—we blast it while decorating our Christmas tree and lighting our Menorah.\" [29]\n\n\nChart performance\nIn the United States, in the first week of January 1995, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" peaked at No 6 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary and at No 12 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart [48] The song placed on these two charts again in December 1995 and in December 1996 [48] The song was ineligible for inclusion on the Billboard Hot 100 during its original release, because it was not released commercially as a single in any physical format This rule lapsed in 1998, however, allowing the song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 (appearing for one week, at No 83 in January 2000) The song topped the Billboard Hot Digital Songs chart in December 2005, but it was unable to attain a new peak on the Billboard Hot 100 chart because it was considered a recurrent single and was thus ineligible for chart re-entry [49]\n\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States, in the first week of January 1995, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\"

The song peaked at number 2 in the United Kingdom for a second time in December 2017 and reached number 2 again in 2018 and 2019. It topped the UK Singles Chart for the first time ever on December 11, 2020, 26 years after its initial release. The song also set an Official Chart record, reaching number one in its seventieth week in the top 40; no other song in UK chart history has spent more weeks in the top 40 before reaching number one.\n\n**Oceania**\n\nThe song originally peaked at No 2 on the ARIA Singles Chart in 1994, and was certified 11× Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of over 770,000 units. Following the inclusion of streams in the ARIA charts, \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" topped the chart in December 2018, becoming the first Christmas song to do so in Australia since \"Snoopy's Christmas\" by the Royal Guardsmen in 1967. It gave Carey her third number-one song in the country after \"Fantasy\" in 1995 and \"We Belong Together\" in 2005, and made her the eleventh act to top the country's charts in three back-to-back decades.\n\n**Asia**\n\nIn Japan, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was released under the regional title \"Koibito-tachi no Christmas\" (恋人たちのクリスマス, lit \"Lovers' Christmas\") and became Carey's best-selling single in the country. It was used as the theme song to the popular drama 29-sai no Christmas (29才のクリスマス, lit \"Christmas at 29 Years Old, 29th Christmas\"). The single peaked at No 2 for two weeks, blocked from the top spot by \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"Everybody Goes\", both released by rock band Mr Children. It sold in excess of 1.1 million units in Japan. Due to strong sales and airplay, the song re-charted in Japan in 2010, peaking at No 6 on the Japan Hot 100. The single has been certified the Million award by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) on two different formats (compact disc and ringtone), in 1994 and 2008, respectively.\n\n**Africa**\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" also experienced success in the continent.

The song also entered the top-twenty in Peru, as it peaked at number 19 on the week dated January 6, 2024, becoming Carey's first charting song in the country.\n\n**Remixes**\n\nWhen the song was first released as a single in 1994, no remixes were commissioned. Carey re-released the song commercially in Japan in 2000, with a new remix known as the So So Def remix. The remix contains new vocals and is played over a harder, more urban beat that contains a sample of Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force's \"Planet Rock\"; it features guest vocals by Jermaine Dupri and Bow Wow. The remix appears on Carey's compilation album Greatest Hits (2001) as a bonus track. A video was created for the So So Def remix, but it does not feature Carey or the hip-hop musicians that perform in the song. Instead, the video is animated and based on a scene in the video from Carey's \"Heartbreaker\" (1999). It features cartoon cameo appearances by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Bow Wow, Luis Miguel (Carey's boyfriend at the time), Carey's dog Jack, and Santa Claus.\n\n**Live performances**\n\nCarey has performed the song during concerts as well as live televised performances. It was part of the setlist of several of her concert tours, including the Japanese shows of Carey's Daydream World Tour (1996), Butterfly World Tour (1998), Rainbow World Tour (2000), Charmbracelet World Tour (2002–03), The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006) and her concert residency All I Want For Christmas Is You, A Night of Joy & Festivity (various years).\n\n**Music videos**\n\nThe first, primary video for the song was shot in the style of a home movie using Super 8 film; it was directed and filmed by Carey during the Christmas season of 1993. The video begins with Carey decorating a Christmas tree with holiday ornaments and frolicking through a snowy mountainside. Outdoor scenes were shot at the Fairy Tale Forest in New Jersey, where Carey's then-husband Tommy Mottola made a cameo appearance as Santa Claus. It continues with scenes of Carey preparing for the Christmas season of 1994, getting ready for her album cover photo shoot and spending time with her dog Jack. It concludes with Santa Claus leaving Carey with a bag of presents and waving goodbye. The video has more than 713 million views on YouTube as of December 2021. In the song's alternate video, inspired by the Ronettes, Carey dances in a 1960s-influenced studio surrounded by go–go dancers. For a 1960s look, the video was filmed in black and white, with Carey in white boots and teased up hair. This video was also directed by Carey. There are two edits to this version of the video.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nOn June 3, 2022, songwriter Andy Stone from Vince Vance & the Valiants filed a copyright lawsuit against Carey, alleging that she \"exploited\" and made \"undeserved profits\" off his song, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", which was written five years prior to Carey's version. Despite sharing the same title, the two songs were musically different. On November 2, 2022, Stone dropped his lawsuit, but in November 2023, the lawsuit was refiled. The case is being moved to California from Louisiana.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nDue to the song's lasting impact, Carey has been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\". Carey has taken advantage of the song's popularity and her honorific title by posting a video every year since 2019, around midnight Eastern time on November 1, saying when it is officially time to play the song.\n\n**Cultural impact**\n\nDue to the song's lasting impact, Carey has been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\".

On March 21, 2017, Carey announced via her Twitter account that a film based on the song was in development. She later released an animated family film titled Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas Is You, based upon the book and song, on November 14, 2017. Lacey Chabert, Henry Winkler, and Breanna Yde were attached to the film. Carey was the executive producer of the film alongside Stella Bulochnikov for Magic Carpet Productions, in partnership with producer Mike Young and Splash Entertainment. In 2018, Judy Greer, Saara Chaudry, Jaiden Canatelli, and Shayle Simons covered the song for the PBS Christmas special of Let's Go Luna!", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"All_I_Want_for_Christmas_Is_You\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground and writing\nFollowing the success of her 1993 album Music Box, Carey and her management at Columbia Records—including Carey's then-husband, Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia's parent label Sony Music Entertainment—began planning further projects [12] The group discussed recording a Christmas album, but hesitated, as such albums were typically released when artists' careers are waning [13] Carey's songwriting partner of over four years, Walter Afanasieff, said in 2015: \"Back then, you didn't have a lot of artists with Christmas albums It wasn't a known science at all back then, and there was nobody who did new, big Christmas songs So we were going to release it as kind of an everyday, 'Hey, you know, we're putting out a Christmas album No big deal.'\" [12]\n\n\nComposition and lyrics\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is an uptempo song, composed with pop, soul, R&B, gospel, dance-pop and adult contemporary influences and stylings [17] [18] [19] By early August, Carey already had two original songs written alongside Afanasieff including the \"sad and ballad-y\" \"Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)\" and the \"Gospel-tinged and religious\" \"Jesus Born on This Day\" The third and final original song the pair planned to write was to be centered and inspired and in the vein of a \"Phil Spector, old rock 'n roll, sixties-sounding Christmas song\" [12] [15]\n\n\nReception\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" received widespread acclaim Roch Parisien from AllMusic called the song \"a year-long banger\", complimenting its instrumentation and melody [23] Steve Morse, editor of The Boston Globe, wrote that Carey sang with a lot of soul [26] In his review for Carey's Merry Christmas II You, Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun-Times called the song \"a simple, well-crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon\" [27] Shona Craven of Scotland's The Herald, said, \" [it's] a song of optimism and joy that maybe, just maybe, hints at the real meaning of Christmas.\" [28] Additionally, she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject \"you\" in the lyrics, explaining, \"Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it's for absolutely everyone.\" Craven opened her review with a bold statement: \"Bing Crosby may well be turning in his grave, but no child of the 1980s will be surprised to see Mariah Carey's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation's top festive song.\" [28] While reviewing the 2009 remix version, Becky Bain from Idolator called the song a \"timeless classic\" and wrote, \"We love the original song to pieces—we blast it while decorating our Christmas tree and lighting our Menorah.\" [29]\n\n\nChart performance\nIn the United States, in the first week of January 1995, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" peaked at No 6 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary and at No 12 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart [48] The song placed on these two charts again in December 1995 and in December 1996 [48] The song was ineligible for inclusion on the Billboard Hot 100 during its original release, because it was not released commercially as a single in any physical format This rule lapsed in 1998, however, allowing the song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 (appearing for one week, at No 83 in January 2000) The song topped the Billboard Hot Digital Songs chart in December 2005, but it was unable to attain a new peak on the Billboard Hot 100 chart because it was considered a recurrent single and was thus ineligible for chart re-entry [49]\n\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States, in the first week of January

{"title": "Leif_Erikson", "content": "\nEarly life\nLeif was the son of Erik the Red and his wife Thjodhild (Old Norse: Þjóðhildur), and, through his paternal line, the grandson of Thorvald Ásvaldsson When Erik the Red was young, his father was banished from Norway for manslaughter, and the family went into exile in Iceland (which, during the century preceding Leif's birth, had been colonized by Norsemen, mainly from Norway) Leif was also a distant relative of Naddodd, [13] [unreliable source?] who discovered Iceland [14]\n\n\nDiscovering Vinland\nThe Saga of Erik the Red and the Saga of the Greenlanders, both thought to have been written around 1200, [21] contain different accounts of the voyages to Vinland (usually interpreted as coastal North America) [22] [23] The only two known strictly historical mentions of Vinland are found in the work of Adam of Bremen c. 1075 and in the Book of Icelanders, compiled c. 1122 by Ari the Wise [24]\n\n\nAccount in the Saga of Erik the Red\nAccording to this saga, Leif discovered Vinland after being blown off course on his way from Norway to Greenland [25] Before this voyage, Leif had spent time at the court of Norwegian King Olaf Tryggvesson, where he had converted to Christianity When Leif encountered the storm that forced him off course, he had been on his way to introduce Christianity to the Greenlanders After they had arrived at an unknown shore, the crew disembarked and explored the area They found wild grapes, self-sown wheat, and maple trees Afterwards, they loaded their ship with samples of these newly-found goods and sailed east to Greenland, rescuing a group of shipwrecked sailors along the way For this act, and for converting Norse Greenland to Christianity, Leif earned the nickname \"Leif the Lucky\" [26] Leif did not return to Vinland, but others from Greenland and Iceland did, including Thorfinn Karlsefni [27]\n\n\nAccount in the Saga of the Greenlanders\nAccording to this saga, Leif was not the first European to discover Vinland Instead Bjarni Herjólfsson and his crew—on a voyage from Iceland to Greenland—were overtaken by wind and fog, missed the southern tip of Greenland, and encountered an unknown coast Believing it to be somewhere other than Greenland, they did not disembark but rather continued to sail and found two additional coasts that did not correspond with their understanding of Greenland [28] After sailing back east, they eventually made it to their original destination, and then told of their discoveries [29]\n\n\nArcheological evidence of Vinland\nMost researchers and scholars agree that Vinland was a region in North America [38]\n\n\nPersonal life\nLeif has been described in the Vinland sagas as a wise, considerate and strong man of striking appearance [48] When he was of a proper age, Leif went to Norway, likely to serve as a retainer to its king, Olaf Tryggvason [49] It was on this journey to Norway that the Saga of Erik the Red states that Leif's ship was driven to the Hebrides, where he and his crew were forced to remain for much of the summer, awaiting favorable winds [50] During his stay there, Leif fell in love with a noblewoman, Thorgunna, who gave birth to their son Thorgils [19] Thorgunna remained in the Hebrides when Leif left, as he refused to take her along without permission from her family [51] Thorgils was later sent to Leif in Greenland, but he did not become popular [52]\n\n\nChieftaincy and death\nThe winter following Leif's return from Vinland, his father died (shortly after 1000 CE), [1] making Leif paramount chief in Greenland [31]  Leif is last mentioned alive in 1018 in the Saga of St Olaf [1] According to The Saga of the Sworn Brothers, by 1025 the chieftaincy of Eiríksfjǫrðr had passed to his son Thorkel [56] [1] Nothing is mentioned about his death in the sagas—he probably died in Greenland some time between these dates [57] Nothing further is known about his family beyond the succession of Thorkell as chieftain [1]\n\n\nHistoricity\nLeif is, in all likelihood, a historical figure who remains the first known European to set foot in continental North America, [58] but other details of his life vary and are a subject of debate It has been suggested by several scholars that both Leif's sister, Freydís, and his foster father, Tyrker, are works of fiction, as are their roles in the Vinland sagas [59] Leif's commission as a missionary to Greenland may also be fictional, as that aspect of his story is often attributed to Gunnlaugr Leifsson's version of Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar (which likely served as a source for some of the other sagas which mention Leif) [60] [31]\n\n\nLegacy\nLeif's successful expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to also make the journey, and the Norse became the first Europeans to colonize the area In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries [61] [62] The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it was assumed to be public knowledge, or both [24] Knowledge of the Vinland journeys spread around medieval Europe, although to what extent is unclear; writers made mention of remote lands to the west, and notably the medieval chronicler Adam of Bremen directly mentions Vinland (c 1075) based upon reports from the Danes [note 2] It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it [63]\n\n\nNorse and medieval Europe\nLeif's successful expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to also make the journey, and the Norse became the first Europeans to colonize the area In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries [61] [62] The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was

referring to them as skrælingi, an archaic term for \"wretches\" [66]\n\n\nTravels and commemoration\nStories of Leif's journey to North America had a profound effect on the identity and self-perception of later Nordic Americans and Nordic immigrants to the United States [18] The first statue of Erikson (by Anne Whitney) [67] was erected in Boston in 1887 at the instigation of Eben Norton Horsford, who was among those who believed that Vinland could have been located on the Charles River or Cape Cod; [18] not long after, another casting of Whitney's statue was erected in Milwaukee [68] A statue was also erected in Chicago in 1901, having been originally commissioned for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition to coincide with the arrival of the reconstructed Viking ship from Bergen, Norway [18] Another work of art made for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the painting Leiv Eirikson Discovering America by Christian Krohg, was in the possession of a Leif Erikson Memorial Association in Chicago before being given back to the National Gallery of Norway in 1900 [69]\n\n\nLeif Erikson Day\nIn 1929, the Wisconsin Legislature passed a bill to make 9 October \"Leif Erikson Day\" in the state, and in the years following, several other states adopted laws to observe the day [77] In 1935, legislation was introduced to the United States Congress requesting federal observance of the day Before the legislation was passed, it was amended so that the observance would only occur in 1935 [78] (which it was, following a proclamation that year by President President Franklin D Roosevelt) [79] In the subsequent decades, a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to pass legislation requesting Leif Erikson Day be proclaimed annually by the president [80] Proponents eventually succeeded, when, in 1964, the Congress authorized and requested the president to proclaim 9 October of each year as \"Leif Erikson Day\" [18] In the years since, each president has issued an annual proclamation calling for observance of the day [81]\n\n\nGallery of art and sculptures\n\n\nIn fiction\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal

permission from her family [51] Thorgils was later sent to Leif in Greenland, but he did not become popular [52]\n\n\nChieftaincy and death\nThe winter following Leif's return from Vinland, his father died (shortly after 1000 CE), [1] making Leif paramount chief in Greenland [31]  Leif is last mentioned alive in 1018 in the Saga of St Olaf [1] According to The Saga of the Sworn Brothers, by 1025 the chieftaincy of Eiríksfjǫrðr had passed to his son Thorkel [56] [1] Nothing is mentioned about his death in the sagas—he probably died in Greenland some time between these dates [57] Nothing further is known about his family beyond the succession of Thorkell as chieftain [1]\n\n\nHistoricity\nLeif is, in all likelihood, a historical figure who remains the first known European to set foot in continental North America, [58] but other details of his life vary and are a subject of debate It has been suggested by several scholars that both Leif's sister, Freydís, and his foster father, Tyrker, are works of fiction, as are their roles in the Vinland sagas [59] Leif's commission as a missionary to Greenland may also be fictional, as that aspect of his story is often attributed to Gunnlaugr Leifsson's version of Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar (which likely served as a source for some of the other sagas which mention Leif) [60] [31]\n\n\nLegacy\nLeif's successful expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to also make the journey, and the Norse became the first Europeans to colonize the area In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries [61] [62] The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it was assumed to be public knowledge, or both [24] Knowledge of the Vinland journeys spread around medieval Europe, although to what extent is unclear; writers made mention of remote lands to the west, and notably the medieval chronicler Adam of Bremen directly mentions Vinland (c 1075) based upon reports from the Danes [note 2] It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it [63]\n\n\nNorse and medieval Europe\nLeif's successful expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to also make the journey, and the Norse became the first Europeans to colonize the area In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries [61] [62] The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it was assumed to be public knowledge, or both [24] Knowledge of the Vinland journeys spread around medieval Europe, although to what extent is unclear; writers made mention of remote lands to the west, and notably the medieval chronicler Adam of Bremen directly mentions Vinland (c 1075) based upon reports from the Danes [note 2] It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it [63]\n\n\nNorse encounters with the Indigenous peoples\nWhile Leif had no contact with the Indigenous peoples of Vinland, [64] [65] later Norse explorers did, referring to them as skrælingi, an archaic term for \"wretches\" [66]\n\n\nTravels and commemoration\nStories of Leif's journey to North America had a profound effect on the identity and self-perception of later Nordic Americans and Nordic immigrants to the United States [18] The first statue of Erikson (by Anne Whitney) [67] was erected in Boston in 1887 at the instigation of Eben Norton Horsford, who was among those who believed that Vinland could have been located on the Charles River or Cape Cod; [18] not long after, another casting of Whitney's statue was erected in Milwaukee [68] A statue was also erected in Chicago in 1901, having been originally commissioned for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition to coincide with the arrival of the reconstructed Viking ship from Bergen, Norway [18] Another work of art made for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the painting Leiv Eirikson Discovering America by Christian Krohg, was in the possession of a Leif Erikson Memorial Association in Chicago before being given back to the National Gallery of Norway in 1900 [69]\n\n\nLeif Erikson Day\nIn 1929, the Wisconsin Legislature passed a bill to make 9 October \"Leif Erikson Day\" in the state, and in the years following, several other states adopted laws to observe the day [77] In 1935, legislation was introduced to the United States Congress requesting federal observance of the day Before the legislation was passed, it was amended so that the observance would only occur in 1935 [78] (which it was, following a proclamation that year by President President Franklin D Roosevelt) [79] In the subsequent decades, a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to pass legislation requesting Leif Erikson Day be proclaimed annually by the president [80] Proponents eventually succeeded, when, in 1964, the Congress authorized and requested the president to proclaim 9 October of each year as \"Leif Erikson Day\" [18] In the years since, each president has issued an annual proclamation calling for observance of the day [81]\n\n\nGallery of art and sculptures\n\n\nIn fiction\n\n\nSee

with wins in Australia and Malaysia, before a second-place finish at the Chinese Grand Prix due to poor tyre management, possibly related to his inability to properly communicate with his team, as his radio was broken [56] In Monaco, Vettel led the race but due to another radio malfunction, the Red Bull pit crew was not prepared when he came in The pit stop was slow and he was sent out on the wrong tyres, handing the lead to Button Vettel switched to a one-stop strategy and stuck with one set of soft tyres for 56 laps He was caught by Alonso and Button as his tyres deteriorated, but neither were able to pass him [57] The race was red-flagged with few laps remaining, which allowed teams to change their tyres; when the race was restarted under the safety car, Vettel was able to retain the lead and win [58]\n\n\n2012: Triple World Champion\nVettel started the 2012 season with a second place at the Australian Grand Prix, before he finished outside the points in Malaysia following a collision

seconds faster than teammate Webber in qualifying during a wet session [88] He won the race, though not without controversy Vettel ignored the team orders and passed Webber for the lead Webber was furious after the race and said that Vettel \"will have protection as usual and that's the way it goes\" [89] Team principal Horner, although unhappy with Vettel's actions, pointed out that Webber had defied team orders on several previous occasions He acknowledged that the already fragile relationship between the two drivers had further broken down as a result of the incident [90] Vettel claimed that he was not sorry for winning and that if the situation presented itself again, he would have passed Webber despite the order, adding that he felt Webber did not deserve to win the race [91]\n\n\nFerrari (2015–2020)\nThe next stage of my Formula 1 career will be spent with Scuderia Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari I already got a small taste of what the Ferrari spirit means, when I took my first win at Monza in 2008, with an engine from the Prancing Horse built in Maranello The Scuderia has a great tradition in this sport and I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top I will put my heart and soul into making it happen.\n\n\n2015–2016: Returning to the top step\nVettel made his Ferrari debut by finishing third in the Australian Grand Prix [108] He followed that up with winning the Malaysian Grand Prix, [109] his first race victory for over a year and the first win for Ferrari for almost two years After the race, an emotional Vettel paid tribute to Schumacher, saying that his hero's achievements with Ferrari made the first win all the more special [110]\n\n\n2017–2018: Title battles versus Hamilton\nHis third season at Ferrari started with victory in Australia, his first in 18 months [125] The early form continued the following races, winning in Bahrain and Monaco, [126] [127] and finishing second in China, Russia and Spain [128] In Russia, Vettel took his first pole position in 18 months and with Räikkönen alongside him, Ferrari had their first front row lock out since the 2008 French Grand Prix [129] Vettel's lead at the top of the standings increased to 25 points after the Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari's first victory at the circuit since Schumacher won there in 2001 [127]\n\n\n2019–2020: Decline and departure from Ferrari\n\nAfter showing impressive pace throughout pre-season testing in Barcelona, Vettel and his new teammate Charles Leclerc headed to Australia with many pundits believing they had the car to beat for the 2019 season [160] The opening weekend proved to be difficult, however, as Vettel qualified some seven tenths off pole position in third and finished the race in fourth place [161] Third-place finishes in China and Azerbaijan followed, as Mercedes continued to dominate [162] Vettel took pole position in Canada; his first pole in 17 races [163] Midway through the race, a snap of oversteer caused him to run wide onto the grass Vettel received a five-second time penalty from the stewards, who believed he had returned to the track \"in an unsafe manner and forced  [Hamilton] off track\" [164] Vettel crossed the line in first place but lost his victory as a result of the penalty After the race, he swapped the number one and two signs in front of Hamilton's Mercedes and the empty spot that was supposed for his own car, as Vettel parked his car at the start of the pit entry [165] At the German Grand Prix, Vettel was unable to qualify after a turbo issue, which meant he would start in last place During a race with mixed weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to second place [166]\n\nAston Martin (2021–2022)\nVettel joined Aston Martin for the 2021 season, replacing Sergio Pérez [182] In his debut race weekend in Bahrain, he received a grid penalty in qualifying, forcing him to start last While Vettel started well, he had a collision with Esteban Ocon, giving him a time penalty and ended up finishing in 15th place He received five penalty points on his superlicence [183] Aston Martin team principal Otmar Szafnauer reported no concerns, owing to this being a very different car from the Ferrari, lack of laps in pre-season testing and a very impressive race start [184] In the fifth race of the season, Vettel scored his first points for the team with a fifth-place finish in Monaco [185] At the following race, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, he claimed Aston Martin's first podium with a second-place finish [186] Vettel also finished second in Hungary, but was later disqualified, after his car failed to provide the one litre sample of fuel required [187] He ended the season in 12th place in the Drivers' standings, ahead of teammate Stroll [188] During the season, Vettel made 132 overtakes—the most of any driver—and won the inaugural Overtake Award [189]\n\n\nDriver profile\nVettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the \"Baby Schumi\" He was not just dubbed this for his nationality but also because of his driving style, his concentration and the hands-on role he plays behind the scenes with his team of engineers Vettel played down the comparison stating he wanted to be the \"New Vettel\" [193]\n\n\nComparison to Michael Schumacher\nVettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the \"Baby Schumi\" He was not just dubbed this for his nationality but also because of his driving style, his concentration and the hands-on role he plays behind the scenes with his team of engineers Vettel played down the comparison stating he wanted to be the \"New Vettel\" [193]\n\n\nHelmet\nFrom his karting days, Vettel worked with helmet designer Jens Munser At the age of eight, Vettel wanted Sebastian the crab from The Little Mermaid on his helmet [199] Vettel's original helmet in Formula One, like most Red Bull-backed drivers, was heavily influenced by the energy drink company logo New to Vettel's helmet at the start of 2008 was the incorporation of the red cross shape of the Kreis Bergstraße coat of arms on the front, just underneath the visor, in honour of the

Vettel**\n\nSebastian Vettel is a German Formula One racing driver who has been active in the sport since 2007. Born on 3 July 1987 in Heppenheim, West Germany, Vettel is the youngest driver to have won the World Drivers' Championship three times.\n\n**Early life**\n\nVettel was born to Norbert and Heike Vettel. He has one younger brother, Fabian, who is also a racing driver, and two older sisters, Melanie and Stefanie. Vettel's childhood heroes were Michael Schumacher, Michael Jordan, and Michael Jackson. He mentioned that he wanted to be a singer like Jackson, but realized that he did not have the voice. Vettel is also a fan of the Beatles, collecting several records, including Abbey Road, and his favourite song being \"Drive My Car\". In an interview on Top Gear, he stated that he is a fan of British comedy such as Little Britain and Monty Python's Life of Brian.\n\n**Junior racing career**\n\nVettel began karting at the age of three and began racing in karting series in 1995 at the age of eight. He was accepted into the Red Bull Junior Team in 1998 and won various titles, including the Junior Monaco Kart Cup in 2001.\n\n**Lower formulae**\n\nVettel was promoted to open-wheel cars in 2003 and was given a chance by Derrick Walker to test a Reynard Motorsport Champ Car in a two-day private test at the Homestead–Miami Speedway. A year later, he won the 2004 Formula BMW ADAC championship with 18 victories from 20 races.\n\n**Formula BMW**\n\nVettel was promoted to open-wheel cars in 2003 and was given a chance by Derrick Walker to test a Reynard Motorsport Champ Car in a two-day private test at the Homestead–Miami Speedway. A year later, he won the 2004 Formula BMW ADAC championship with 18 victories from 20 races.\n\n**Formula Three and Formula Renault**\n\nVettel drove for ASL Mücke Motorsport in the 2005 Formula 3 Euro Series and was placed fifth in the final standings with 63 points and won the Rookie Cup. He tested for the Williams Formula One team later that year as a reward for his Formula BMW success. Vettel then went on to test for the BMW Sauber Formula One team.\n\n**Formula One career**\n\nVettel became BMW Sauber's third driver at the 2006 Turkish Grand Prix, when former incumbent Robert Kubica replaced Jacques Villeneuve as second driver for the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. On his testing debut, Vettel set the fastest time in the second Friday free practice. Vettel became the then-youngest Formula One driver to participate in a Grand Prix weekend at 19 years and 53 days. He also set a record for collecting his first fine in nine seconds into his career, as Vettel exceeded the pitlane speed limit on the way to the track. In his second testing session at the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, he set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions.\n\n**BMW Sauber (2006–2007)**\n\nVettel became BMW Sauber's third driver at the 2006 Turkish Grand Prix, when former incumbent Robert Kubica replaced Jacques Villeneuve as second driver for the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. On his testing debut, Vettel set the fastest time in the second Friday free practice. Vettel became the then-youngest Formula One driver to participate in a Grand Prix weekend at 19 years and 53 days. He also set a record for collecting his first fine in nine seconds into his career, as Vettel exceeded the pitlane speed limit on the way to the track. In his second testing session at the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, he set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions.\n\n**2007: Debut**\n\nVettel was confirmed as BMW's test driver for 2007. Following Kubica's crash at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel was named his replacement at the 2007 United States Grand Prix. He started in seventh position and finished in eighth to become the then-youngest driver to score a point in Formula One.\n\n**Toro Rosso (2007–2008)**\n\nBMW released Vettel in July 2007 to join Red Bull's Scuderia Toro Rosso, replacing Scott Speed from the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix onwards, as Vettel was already under contract to Red Bull Racing. It was also announced that he would drive for Toro Rosso in 2008 alongside Sébastien Bourdais.\n\n**2007–2008: Maiden race win and rise to prominence**\n\nBMW released Vettel in July 2007 to join Red Bull's Scuderia Toro Rosso, replacing Scott Speed from the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix onwards, as Vettel was already under contract to Red Bull Racing. It was also announced that he would drive for Toro Rosso in 2008 alongside Sébastien Bourdais.\n\n**Red Bull (2009–2014)**\n\nAt the start of the 2009 season, Vettel replaced the retired David Coulthard at Red Bull Racing. He began strongly at the Australian Grand Prix, running in second for the majority of the race. However, a clash with Robert Kubica over second place in the latter stages forced both to retire. He went on to take pole position and the race win at the Chinese Grand Prix; Red Bull Racing's maiden pole and win.\n\n**2009: Championship contender**\n\nAt the start of the 2009 season, Vettel replaced the retired David Coulthard at Red Bull Racing. He began strongly at the Australian Grand Prix, running in second for the majority of the race. However, a clash with Robert Kubica over second place in the latter stages forced both to retire. He went on to take pole position and the race win at the Chinese Grand Prix; Red Bull Racing's maiden pole and win.\n\n**2010: Youngest World Champion**\n\nVettel took the first pole position of the 2010 season at the Bahrain Grand Prix. He led most of the race but as a result of a spark plug failure, Vettel finished in fourth place. At the Australian Grand Prix, Vettel was appointed as a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association. He took his first win of the season in Malaysia.\n\n**2011: Dominant second title**\n\nVettel started the 2011 season with wins in Australia and Malaysia, before a second-place finish at the Chinese Grand Prix due to poor tyre management, possibly related to his inability to properly communicate with his team, as his radio was broken. In Monaco, Vettel led the race but due to another radio malfunction, the Red Bull pit crew was not prepared when he came in. The pit stop was slow and he was sent out on the wrong tyres, handing the lead to Button. Vettel switched to a one-stop strategy and stuck with one set of soft tyres for 56 laps. He was caught by Alonso and Button as his tyres deteriorated, but neither were able to pass him. The race was red-flagged with few laps remaining, which allowed teams to change their tyres; when the race was restarted under the safety car, Vettel was able to retain the lead and win.\n\n**2012: Triple World Champion**\n\nVettel started the 2012 season with a second place at the Australian Grand Prix, before he finished outside the points in Malaysia following a collision with backmarker Narain Karthikeyan. Vettel and Horner criticised Karthikeyan's driving, with Vettel calling him an \"idiot\", and a \"cucumber\". Karthikeyan hit back, calling Vettel a \"cry baby\". Vettel crossed the line in first place at the Bahrain Grand Prix to go top of the championship standings. Three races without a podium place followed, before he retired at the European Grand Prix after an alternator failure, dropping him to fourth in the standings. In Germany, Vettel finished second behind Alonso but received a 20-second time penalty after the race, as he was off the track when he overtook Button; Vettel dropped back to fifth. He started in 10th place but finished second in Belgium to climb up to second place in the championship. Vettel then retired at the Italian Grand Prix due to an alternator failure, which saw the gap to leader Alonso grow to 39 points with seven races remaining. He won next race in Singapore, as he kept the lead until the 2-hour race limit was reached. At the Japanese Grand Prix he took his second career grand slam and coupled with Alonso's retirement, he cut the gap down to just four points. After winning at the Korean Grand Prix, the Indian Grand Prix brought another victory, as Vettel topped all three practice sessions before taking pole position and leading every lap of the race to win.\n\n**2013–2014: Record-breaking season and departure from Red Bull**\n\nVettel started the first two races of the 2013 season on pole position, and at the Malaysian Grand Prix, he lapped over 2.5 seconds faster than teammate Webber in qualifying during a wet session. He won the race, though not without controversy. Vettel ignored the team orders and passed Webber for the lead, Webber was furious after the race and said that Vettel \"will have protection as usual and that's the way it goes\". Team principal Horner, although unhappy with Vettel's actions, pointed out that Webber had defied team orders on several previous occasions. He acknowledged that the already fragile relationship between the two drivers had further broken down as a result of the incident. Vettel claimed that he was not sorry for winning and that if the situation presented itself again, he would have passed Webber despite the order, adding that he felt Webber did not deserve to win the race.\n\n**Ferrari (2015–2020)**\n\nThe next stage of my Formula 1 career will be spent with Scuderia Ferrari, and for me, that means the dream of a lifetime has come true. When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol, and now it's an incredible honor to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari. I already got a small taste of what the Ferrari spirit means, when I took my first win at Monza in 2008, with an engine from the Prancing Horse built in Maranello. The Scuderia has a great tradition in this sport, and I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen.\n\n**2015–2016: Returning to the top step**\n\nVettel made his Ferrari debut by finishing third in the Australian Grand Prix. He followed that up with winning the Malaysian Grand Prix, his first race victory for over a year and the first win for Ferrari for almost two years. After the race, an emotional Vettel paid tribute to Schumacher, saying that his hero's achievements with Ferrari made the first win all the more special.\n\n**2017–2018: Title battles versus Hamilton**\n\nHis third season at Ferrari started with victory in Australia, his first in 18 months. The early form continued the following races, winning in Bahrain and Monaco, and finishing second in China, Russia, and Spain. In Russia, Vettel took his first pole position in 18 months and with Räikkönen alongside him, Ferrari had their first front-row lockout since the 2008 French Grand Prix. Vettel's lead at the top of the standings increased to 25 points after the Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari's first victory at the circuit since Schumacher won there in 2001.\n\n**2019–2020: Decline and departure from Ferrari**\n\nAfter showing impressive pace throughout pre-season testing in Barcelona, Vettel and his new teammate Charles Leclerc headed to Australia with many pundits believing they had the car to beat for the 2019 season. The opening weekend proved to be difficult, however, as Vettel qualified some seven tenths off pole position in third and finished the race in fourth place. Third-place finishes in China and Azerbaijan followed, as Mercedes continued to dominate. Vettel took pole position in Canada; his first pole in 17 races. Midway through the race, a snap of oversteer caused him to run wide onto the grass. Vettel received a five-second time penalty from the stewards, who believed he had returned to the track \"in an unsafe manner and forced Hamilton off track\". Vettel crossed the line in first place but lost his victory as a result of the penalty. After the race, he swapped the number one and two signs in front of Hamilton's Mercedes and the empty spot that was supposed for his own car, as Vettel parked his car at the start of the pit entry. At the German Grand Prix, Vettel was unable to qualify after a turbo issue, which meant he would start in last place. During a race with mixed weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to second place.\n\n**Aston Martin (2021–2022)**\n\nVettel joined Aston Martin for the 2021 season, replacing Sergio Pérez. In his debut race weekend in Bahrain, he received a grid penalty in qualifying, forcing him to start last. While Vettel started well, he had a collision with Esteban Ocon, giving him a time penalty and ended up finishing in 15th place. He received five penalty points on his superlicence. Aston Martin team principal Otmar Szafnauer reported no concerns, owing to this being a very different car from the Ferrari, lack of laps in pre-season testing, and a very impressive race start. In the fifth race of the season, Vettel scored his first points for the team with a fifth-place finish in Monaco. At the following race, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, he claimed Aston Martin's first podium with a second-place finish. Vettel also finished second in Hungary, but was later disqualified, after his car failed to provide the one-litre sample of fuel required. He ended the season in 12th place in the Drivers' standings, ahead of teammate Stroll. During the season, Vettel made 132 overtakes—the most of any driver—and won the inaugural Overtake Award.\n\n**Driver profile**\n\nVettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the \"Baby Schumi\". He was not just dubbed this for his nationality but also because of his driving style, his concentration, and the hands-on role he plays behind the scenes with his team of engineers. Vettel played down the comparison, stating he wanted to be the \"New Vettel\".\n\n**Comparison to Michael Schumacher**\n\nVettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the \"Baby Schumi\".

Vettel played down the comparison, stating he wanted to be the \"New Vettel\".\n\n**Helmet**\n\nFrom his karting days, Vettel worked with helmet designer Jens Munser. At the age of eight, Vettel wanted Sebastian the crab from The Little Mermaid on his helmet. Vettel's original helmet in Formula One, like most Red Bull-backed drivers, was heavily influenced by the energy drink company logo. New to Vettel's helmet at the start of 2008 was the incorporation of the red cross shape of the Kreis Bergstraße coat of arms on the front, just underneath the visor, in honour of the region of his birthplace, Heppenheim.\n\n**Car names**\n\nInspired by American bomber pilots during World War II, Vettel made it a tradition to name each of his cars in Formula One from 2008 to 2021, stating \"it's important to have a close relationship with a car. Like a ship, a car should be named after a girl as it's sexy\".\n\n**Awards and honours**\n\nVettel was named Rookie of the Year at the 2008 Autosport Awards.

Klitschko in amateur boxing: [56]\n\n\nProfessional career\n\"Wladimir hits very hard, harder than (Mike) Tyson At one point, they ran twelve 800-meter  [roughly a half mile] sprints, each under 3 minutes, with a minute rest between each one I timed every one and every one was under 3 minutes I never saw a heavyweight do anything even close to that They work their asses off To be able to do that, two 250-pound guys – whew They're two of the best athletes I've ever trained.\"\n\n\nEarly career\nKlitschko turned professional with Universum Box-Promotion in Hamburg under the tutelage of Fritz Sdunek, often being featured on fight cards alongside his elder brother Vitali After building an undefeated record of 24–0 with 21 KOs, he suffered his first loss to 24–13–1 Ross Puritty, in what was Klitschko's first and only professional fight in Ukraine Puritty forced Klitschko, who had at that time not gone beyond eight rounds, to punch himself out Klitschko began to be overwhelmed in the tenth round and went down twice but was allowed to continue At the start of the eleventh round, with Puritty continuing to land hard punches, Klitschko's trainer, Fritz Sdunek, entered the ring and stopped the fight [58] Three years later, Klitschko's brother Vitali stopped Puritty in the eleventh round himself On 18 March 2000, Klitschko fought Paea Wolfgramm, whom he fought previously in the 1996 super-heavyweight Olympic finals In their professional rematch, Klitschko knocked Wolfgramm out in the first round.\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Byrd, Jefferson, Shufford\nWladimir Klitschko got his chance to fight for the world heavyweight championship on 14 October 2000 against WBO champion Chris Byrd Byrd, considered one of the most avoided fighters in the heavyweight division at the time, [59] [60] won the title six months earlier on 1 April from Wladimir's brother Vitali (who had a perfect record of 27 fights, 27 wins, 27 KOs coming into the fight), [59] [61] being a late replacement for Donovan Ruddock In that fight, Byrd was trailing on the scorecards (83–88, 83–88, & 82–89) but was declared the winner after Vitali retired on his stool between 9th and 10th rounds due to shoulder injury [59] Byrd's title defence against Wladimir was scheduled to take place at Kölnarena in Cologne and was billed as \"Revenge Of The Brother\" [62] In a fight that was aired on pay-per-view in the United Kingdom, [63] Wladimir won the WBO world heavyweight title from Byrd by a wide unanimous decision (UD) with scores of 120–106, 119–107, and 118–108, flooring his opponent twice [64]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Botha, Mercer, McCline\nKlitschko returned to Germany for the next defence of his WBO title against Francois Botha The fight took place at Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle in Stuttgart, the same venue where Botha had fought Axel Schulz for the IBF title six years earlier, in the most watched boxing match in German TV history [76] [77] According to Botha's coach Abel Sanchez, Botha was in the best shape of his career [78] The South African contender was game in the opening rounds, trying to catch Klitschko with the right hook, but Klitschko was successfully keeping him at the end of his jab [78] In the eighth round, Klitschko caught him with a counter right hand and then hit Botha with several shots, knocking him down with a left hook Botha got up, but was unsteady on his feet and had both eyes swollen, proceeding the referee to stop the bout [78] [79]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Sanders, Brewster\nAfter failing to reach agreements with Kirk Johnson, Fres Oquendo, Lou Savarese and Danny Williams, Universum ultimately signed a 4-fight contract with Corrie Sanders, who was ranked No.9 contender by WBO at the time According to the agreement, Sanders' first fight was going to be for the WBO world heavyweight title The fight was scheduled to take place on 8 March 2003 in Hanover, Germany Klitschko later admitted that he came to the fight unmotivated and was already thinking about the vacation he was going to enjoy after the fight [90] Klitschko suffered an upset TKO loss to Sanders With thirty seconds left in the opening round, Wladimir threw a jab but Sanders countered with a big left hook, prompting Klitschko to enter a clinch While in the clinch, Sanders landed another left hook that send Klitschko to the canvas Klitschko got up but was dropped again almost immediately The following round, Sanders continued his assault on a visibly hurt Klitschko, dropping him twice more at the beginning of the round The referee waived it off after the fourth knockdown The fight was named Upset of the Year by The Ring for 2003 [91]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Williamson, Castillo, Peter\nFollowing his loss to Brewster, Klitschko began his journey back towards the top of the heavyweight division First, he faced hard-hitting DaVarryl Williamson [109] The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada [110] Williamson dropped Klitschko forty seconds into the second round, but was outboxed throughout the rest of the bout [109] An accidental head butt in the closing seconds of the fifth round caused Klitschko bleeding from a cut above his right eye Due to the cut, the fight was prematurely stopped, with Klitschko being declared the winner by technical decision Two of the judges scored the fight identically 49–46 in favour of Klitschko, while the third judge had Williamson winning 48–47 [111] [112]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Byrd II, Brock, Austin\nOn 22 April 2006, in Mannheim, Germany, Klitschko faced Chris Byrd for a second time, this time for the IBF heavyweight title At the time of the bout, Byrd was ranked as the best heavyweight by The Ring, while Klitschko was ranked eighth [121] Coming into the fight, Klitschko was viewed as the favourite Many observers expected Klitschko to dominate Byrd similarly to their first bout [122]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Brewster II, Ibragimov, Thompson\nKlitschko then avenged one of his previous losses as he defeated Lamon Brewster on 7 July 2007, in Cologne, Germany Brewster's corner asked the referee to stop the fight at the end of the sixth round It was later revealed that Klitschko fought most of the fight with a broken middle finger on his left hand [135]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Rahman, Chagaev, Chambers\nKlitschko was scheduled to defend his titles against Alexander Povetkin later in 2008, [178] but on 25 October, Povetkin withdrew from the fight due to an ankle injury Instead, Klitschko faced Hasim Rahman on 13 December 2008 and won by TKO This was the third time Klitschko fought at the SAP Arena in Mannheim, Germany He dominated the fight, winning every round while making good use of his left jab Rahman seemed unable to withstand the Klitschko's punch power In the sixth round, Klitschko knocked Rahman down with a series of left hooks, leaving Rahman visibly disoriented Between the sixth and seventh rounds, the referee warned Rahman he's going to stop the fight if Rahman continues absorbing punishment without firing back [179] The referee ultimately called a stop to the contest in the 7th round after Rahman failed to respond to a series of shots [180] [181] [182] At the time of the stoppage, Klitschko was leading on all three judges scorecards, respectively 60–53, 60–53, and 60–47 [183] According to CompuBox, Klitschko landed 194 punches (50.4% accuracy) to Rahman's 35 (16.8% accuracy), a nearly six-fold disparity [184]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Peter II\nFollowing the match with Chambers, a unification fight between Klitschko and David Haye, who, as of November 2009, had held the WBA title, appeared to be in the offing Klitschko called out the Briton on YouTube in April 2010, stating, \"I want to send this message to boxing fans and directly to David Haye David, you've bitched out on fighting both Klitschko brothers twice already and now's the time to make it happen On behalf of the boxing fans around the world, I am officially calling you out to fight me You can't run away from me forever and you need to follow through with this fight if you want to be respected I'm ready What're you waiting for?\" [206] [207]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Haye\nOn 5 January 2011, it was announced that Derek Chisora would get his fight with Klitschko This enraged David Haye's trainer Adam Booth, who described the move as a \"disgrace\" on a heated live phone-in with Sky Sports News Booth alleged Haye had met every single one of Klitschko's demands [225] The fight against Chisora was rescheduled for 30 April 2011 and was going to take place in SAP Arena, Mannheim [226] However, on 4 March, it was announced that Klitschko had pulled out of the fight due to not being fully recovered from a torn abdominal muscle On 5 March, it was instead announced that the highly anticipated fight against Haye would take place on 2 July 2011 [227] The fight was contingent on Klitschko's recovery from a torn abdominal muscle The contract was written so that if Klitschko was not fully healed, then Haye would fight his brother, Vitali [228]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Mormeck, Thompson II, Wach\nOn 6 October 2011, Klitschko announced his next fight It was originally to be on 10 December 2011 against the former two time unified cruiserweight world champion, Jean-Marc Mormeck (36–4, 22 KOs) The fight would have taken place at Esprit Arena, Düsseldorf [239] This was Wladimir's first title defence after his win over David Haye unified all major heavyweight belts in the hands of the Klitschko brothers The fight was predicted to generate 500 million viewers worldwide, similarly to Wladimir's fight against Haye [240] On 5 December 2011, the fight was cancelled because Klitschko checked into a hospital to have a kidney stone removed After the removal operation he suffered from fever and inflammation [241] The fight was rescheduled for 3 March 2012, with Klitschko dominating and knocking out Mormeck in the fourth round [242] CompuBox showed that in the 10 minutes and 12 seconds the fight lased, Klitschko landed 39 of 135 punches thrown (29%) and Mormeck landed just 3 of 19 thrown (16%) Mormeck failed to land anything in rounds 1 and 4 [243]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Pianeta, Povetkin, Leapai\nAt the end of 2012, the WBA ordered Klitschko to fight WBA (Regular) champion Alexander Povetkin of Russia by 24 February 2013, [281] but the two sides couldn't reach an agreement [282] The WBA let Klitschko have another voluntary title defence before taking on Povetkin, but there should have been a signed contract with Povetkin before 28 February, with a new deadline for their bout no later than 31 July [283] [284]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Pulev, Jennings\nThe IBF finally ordered Klitschko vs Kubrat Pulev on 8 May 2014 and gave a 30-day negotiation period [324] Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente stated that a potential fight with WBC champion Bermane Stiverne was their main priority, a fight which would see all of the heavyweight belts at stake Kalle Sauerland stated that he would request to get Klitschko (62–3, 52 KOs) stripped of the IBF title if he didn't fight Pulev At the same time Deontay Wilder was named as Stiverne's mandatory and the WBC stated he must fight Wilder next [325] With the IBF purse bid split being 75–25 in favour of the champion, Klitschko requested the split be 80–20 in his favour The IBF accepted the request [326] A purse bid took place on 17 June, which was won by K2 Promotions The winning bid was $7.25 million Sauerland Event put in a bid for $5.29 million As per the bid, K2 had the location set as the O2 World Arena in Hamburg, with a possible date being 6 September 2014 [327] In August, Klitschko suffered a bicep injury, thus postponing the fight by at least two months A new date of 15 November was set [328] HBO announced that they would air the fight live in the afternoon, making it the 19th Klitschko fight they would show [329] Two days before the fight, it was revealed only the IBF title would be at stake for Pulev, however if Klitschko loses, the remaining titles would be vacated [330] [331] The fight's worldwide audience was estimated to be 300 million viewers [332] [333] [334]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Fury\nKlitschko was scheduled to take on undefeated heavyweight contender Tyson Fury, the WBO mandatory challenger, on 24 October 2015 On 25 September 2015, Klitschko postponed the fight, citing a calf injury It was rescheduled for 28 November 2015 [348] On the night of the fight, there was much controversy, first starting with the gloves, then there was a complaint about the ring canvas Klitschko reportedly had his hands wrapped without a representative of Fury present, so had to do them again [349] Klitschko lost the fight by UD, with scores of 115–112, 115–112, and 116–111 all in favour of Fury [350] [351] It was the first defeat Klitschko had suffered in over ten years and marked the end of the 'Klitschko Era', referring to the time period where both Klitschko brothers dominated the division Klitschko and Fury showed little offence during the twelve rounds, but Fury did enough to take the decision Klitschko landed 52 of 231 punches thrown (22.5%) and Fury landed 86 of 371 thrown (23.2%) [352]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Joshua\nDays after the Fury rematch was called off, Klitschko was approached by Eddie Hearn, promoter of IBF champion Anthony Joshua, to fight on 28 November date they had set for a second defence Terms seemed to have been agreed for a £30m fight showdown although an initial contract was yet to be signed [358] After Fury gave up his world titles, it was said that Klitschko wanted the WBA (Super) title up for grabs in the potential match up against Joshua and waiting for approval, which the WBA kept postponing [359] A reason as to why the WBA was delaying sanctioning the fight was due them having a legal settlement with Lucas Browne so he could fight for the vacant title next Klitschko then turned his attention to fighting Browne instead on 10 December, a date his team had an arena set for in Germany [360] On 24 October, Klitschko suffered a minor calf injury which would rule him out until 2017 Talks between the Klitschko camp and Hearn remained active with a fight set for the first part of 2017 [361] [362] On 2 November, the WBA finally agreed to sanction a fight for their super title as long as Joshua defeats Eric Molina in December 2016 [363]\n\n\nRetirement\nOn 3 August 2017, Klitschko announced on his official website and social media channels that he was retiring from boxing

Klitschko caught Botha with a counter right hand and then hit Botha with several shots, knocking him down with a left hook. Botha got up, but was unsteady on his feet and had both eyes swollen, proceeding the referee to stop the bout.\n\nKlitschko then avenged one of his previous losses as he defeated Lamon Brewster on 7 July 2007, in Cologne, Germany. Brewster's corner asked the referee to stop the fight at the end of the sixth round.

However, on 25 October, Povetkin withdrew from the fight due to an ankle injury. Klitschko faced Hasim Rahman on 13 December 2008 and won by TKO. This was the third time Klitschko fought at the SAP Arena in Mannheim, Germany. Klitschko dominated the fight, winning every round while making good use of his left jab. Rahman seemed unable to withstand the Klitschko's punch power. In the sixth round, Klitschko knocked Rahman down with a series of left hooks, leaving Rahman visibly disoriented. Between the sixth and seventh rounds, the referee warned Rahman he's going to stop the fight if Rahman continues absorbing punishment without firing back. The referee ultimately called a stop to the contest in the 7th round after Rahman failed to respond to a series of shots.\n\nKlitschko faced David Haye on 2 July 2011. The fight was a highly anticipated unification bout, with Klitschko seeking to unify all four major heavyweight titles.

Klitschko lost the fight by unanimous decision, with scores of 115–112, 115–112, and 116–111.\n\nLegacy\n-------\n\nDuring Klitschko's reign as world heavyweight champion, his fights would reportedly draw up to 500 million viewers worldwide.

[55]\n\n\nHighlights\nBelow are the notable achievements of Wladimir Klitschko in amateur boxing: [56]\n\n\nProfessional career\n\"Wladimir hits very hard, harder than (Mike) Tyson At one point, they ran twelve 800-meter  [roughly a half mile] sprints, each under 3 minutes, with a minute rest between each one I timed every one and every one was under 3 minutes I never saw a heavyweight do anything even close to that They work their asses off To be able to do that, two 250-pound guys – whew They're two of the best athletes I've ever trained.\"\n\n\nEarly career\nKlitschko turned professional with Universum Box-Promotion in Hamburg under the tutelage of Fritz Sdunek, often being featured on fight cards alongside his elder brother Vitali After building an undefeated record of 24–0 with 21 KOs, he suffered his first loss to 24–13–1 Ross Puritty, in what was Klitschko's first and only professional fight in Ukraine Puritty forced Klitschko, who had at that time not gone beyond eight rounds, to punch himself out Klitschko began to be overwhelmed in the tenth round and went down twice but was allowed to continue At the start of the eleventh round, with Puritty continuing to land hard punches, Klitschko's trainer, Fritz Sdunek, entered the ring and stopped the fight [58] Three years later, Klitschko's brother Vitali stopped Puritty in the eleventh round himself On 18 March 2000, Klitschko fought Paea Wolfgramm, whom he fought previously in the 1996 super-heavyweight Olympic finals In their professional rematch, Klitschko knocked Wolfgramm out in the first round.\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Byrd, Jefferson, Shufford\nWladimir Klitschko got his chance to fight for the world heavyweight championship on 14 October 2000 against WBO champion Chris Byrd Byrd, considered one of the most avoided fighters in the heavyweight division at the time, [59] [60] won the title six months earlier on 1 April from Wladimir's brother Vitali (who had a perfect record of 27 fights, 27 wins, 27 KOs coming into the fight), [59] [61] being a late replacement for Donovan Ruddock In that fight, Byrd was trailing on the scorecards (83–88, 83–88, & 82–89) but was declared the winner after Vitali retired on his stool between 9th and 10th rounds due to shoulder injury [59] Byrd's title defence against Wladimir was scheduled to take place at Kölnarena in Cologne and was billed as \"Revenge Of The Brother\" [62] In a fight that was aired on pay-per-view in the United Kingdom, [63] Wladimir won the WBO world heavyweight title from Byrd by a wide unanimous decision (UD) with scores of 120–106, 119–107, and 118–108, flooring his opponent twice [64]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Botha, Mercer, McCline\nKlitschko returned to Germany for the next defence of his WBO title against Francois Botha The fight took place at Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle in Stuttgart, the same venue where Botha had fought Axel Schulz for the IBF title six years earlier, in the most watched boxing match in German TV history [76] [77] According to Botha's coach Abel Sanchez, Botha was in the best shape of his career [78] The South African contender was game in the opening rounds, trying to catch Klitschko with the right hook, but Klitschko was successfully keeping him at the end of his jab [78] In the eighth round, Klitschko caught him with a counter right hand and then hit Botha with several shots, knocking him down with a left hook Botha got up, but was unsteady on his feet and had both eyes swollen, proceeding the referee to stop the bout [78] [79]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Sanders, Brewster\nAfter failing to reach agreements with Kirk Johnson, Fres Oquendo, Lou Savarese and Danny Williams, Universum ultimately signed a 4-fight contract with Corrie Sanders, who was ranked No.9 contender by WBO at the time According to the agreement, Sanders' first fight was going to be for the WBO world heavyweight title The fight was scheduled to take place on 8 March 2003 in Hanover, Germany Klitschko later admitted that he came to the fight unmotivated and was already thinking about the vacation he was going to enjoy after the fight [90] Klitschko suffered an upset TKO loss to Sanders With thirty seconds left in the opening round, Wladimir threw a jab but Sanders countered with a big left hook, prompting Klitschko to enter a clinch While in the clinch, Sanders landed another left hook that send Klitschko to the canvas Klitschko got up but was dropped again almost immediately The following round, Sanders continued his assault on a visibly hurt Klitschko, dropping him twice more at the beginning of the round The referee waived it off after the fourth knockdown The fight was named Upset of the Year by The Ring for 2003 [91]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Williamson, Castillo, Peter\nFollowing his loss to Brewster, Klitschko began his journey back towards the top of the heavyweight division First, he faced hard-hitting DaVarryl Williamson [109] The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada [110] Williamson dropped Klitschko forty seconds into the second round, but was outboxed throughout the rest of the bout [109] An accidental head butt in the closing seconds of the fifth round caused Klitschko bleeding from a cut above his right eye Due to the cut, the fight was prematurely stopped, with Klitschko being declared the winner by technical decision Two of the judges scored the fight identically 49–46 in favour of Klitschko, while the third judge had Williamson winning 48–47 [111] [112]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Byrd II, Brock, Austin\nOn 22 April 2006, in Mannheim, Germany, Klitschko faced Chris Byrd for a second time, this time for the IBF heavyweight title At the time of the bout, Byrd was ranked as the best heavyweight by The Ring, while Klitschko was ranked eighth [121] Coming into the fight, Klitschko was viewed as the favourite Many observers expected Klitschko to dominate Byrd similarly to their first bout [122]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Brewster II, Ibragimov, Thompson\nKlitschko then avenged one of his previous losses as he defeated Lamon Brewster on 7 July 2007, in Cologne, Germany Brewster's corner asked the referee to stop the fight at the end of the sixth round It was later revealed that Klitschko fought most of the fight with a broken middle finger on his left hand [135]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Rahman, Chagaev, Chambers\nKlitschko was scheduled to defend his titles against Alexander Povetkin later in 2008, [178] but on 25 October, Povetkin withdrew from the fight due to an ankle injury Instead, Klitschko faced Hasim Rahman on 13 December 2008 and won by TKO This was the third time Klitschko fought at the SAP Arena in Mannheim, Germany He dominated the fight, winning every round while making good use of his left jab Rahman seemed unable to withstand the Klitschko's punch power In the sixth round, Klitschko knocked Rahman down with a series of left hooks, leaving Rahman visibly disoriented Between the sixth and seventh rounds, the referee warned Rahman he's going to stop the fight if Rahman continues absorbing punishment without firing back [179] The referee ultimately called a stop to the contest in the 7th round after Rahman failed to respond to a series of shots [180] [181] [182] At the time of the stoppage, Klitschko was leading on all three judges scorecards, respectively 60–53, 60–53, and 60–47 [183] According to CompuBox, Klitschko landed 194 punches (50.4% accuracy) to Rahman's 35 (16.8% accuracy), a nearly six-fold disparity [184]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Peter II\nFollowing the match with Chambers, a unification fight between Klitschko and David Haye, who, as of November 2009, had held the WBA title, appeared to be in the offing Klitschko called out the Briton on YouTube in April 2010, stating, \"I want to send this message to boxing fans and directly to David Haye David, you've bitched out on fighting both Klitschko brothers twice already and now's the time to make it happen On behalf of the boxing fans around the world, I am officially calling you out to fight me You can't run away from me forever and you need to follow through with this fight if you want to be respected I'm ready What're you waiting for?\" [206] [207]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Haye\nOn 5 January 2011, it was announced that Derek Chisora would get his fight with Klitschko This enraged David Haye's trainer Adam Booth, who described the move as a \"disgrace\" on a heated live phone-in with Sky Sports News Booth alleged Haye had met every single one of Klitschko's demands [225] The fight against Chisora was rescheduled for 30 April 2011 and was going to take place in SAP Arena, Mannheim [226] However, on 4 March, it was announced that Klitschko had pulled out of the fight due to not being fully recovered from a torn abdominal muscle On 5 March, it was instead announced that the highly anticipated fight against Haye would take place on 2 July 2011 [227] The fight was contingent on Klitschko's recovery from a torn abdominal muscle The contract was written so that if Klitschko was not fully healed, then Haye would fight his brother, Vitali [228]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Mormeck, Thompson II, Wach\nOn 6 October 2011, Klitschko announced his next fight It was originally to be on 10 December 2011 against the former two time unified cruiserweight world champion, Jean-Marc Mormeck (36–4, 22 KOs) The fight would have taken place at Esprit Arena, Düsseldorf [239] This was Wladimir's first title defence after his win over David Haye unified all major heavyweight belts in the hands of the Klitschko brothers The fight was predicted to generate 500 million viewers worldwide, similarly to Wladimir's fight against Haye [240] On 5 December 2011, the fight was cancelled because Klitschko checked into a hospital to have a kidney stone removed After the removal operation he suffered from fever and inflammation [241] The fight was rescheduled for 3 March 2012, with Klitschko dominating and knocking out Mormeck in the fourth round [242] CompuBox showed that in the 10 minutes and 12 seconds the fight lased, Klitschko landed 39 of 135 punches thrown (29%) and Mormeck landed just 3 of 19 thrown (16%) Mormeck failed to land anything in rounds 1 and 4 [243]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Pianeta, Povetkin, Leapai\nAt the end of 2012, the WBA ordered Klitschko to fight WBA (Regular) champion Alexander Povetkin of Russia by 24 February 2013, [281] but the two sides couldn't reach an agreement [282] The WBA let Klitschko have another voluntary title defence before taking on Povetkin, but there should have been a signed contract with Povetkin before 28 February, with a new deadline for their bout no later than 31 July [283] [284]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Pulev, Jennings\nThe IBF finally ordered Klitschko vs Kubrat Pulev on 8 May 2014 and gave a 30-day negotiation period [324] Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente stated that a potential fight with WBC champion Bermane Stiverne was their main priority, a fight which would see all of the heavyweight belts at stake Kalle Sauerland stated that he would request to get Klitschko (62–3, 52 KOs) stripped of the IBF title if he didn't fight Pulev At the same time Deontay Wilder was named as Stiverne's mandatory and the WBC stated he must fight Wilder next [325] With the IBF purse bid split being 75–25 in favour of the champion, Klitschko requested the split be 80–20 in his favour The IBF accepted the request [326] A purse bid took place on 17 June, which was won by K2 Promotions The winning bid was $7.25 million Sauerland Event put in a bid for $5.29 million As per the bid, K2 had the location set as the O2 World Arena in Hamburg, with a possible date being 6 September 2014 [327] In August, Klitschko suffered a bicep injury, thus postponing the fight by at least two months A new date of 15 November was set [328] HBO announced that they would air the fight live in the afternoon, making it the 19th Klitschko fight they would show [329] Two days before the fight, it was revealed only the IBF title would be at stake for Pulev, however if Klitschko loses, the remaining titles would be vacated [330] [331] The fight's worldwide audience was estimated to be 300 million viewers [332] [333] [334]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Fury\nKlitschko was scheduled to take on undefeated heavyweight contender Tyson Fury, the WBO mandatory challenger, on 24 October 2015 On 25 September 2015, Klitschko postponed the fight, citing a calf injury It was rescheduled for 28 November 2015 [348] On the night of the fight, there was much controversy, first starting with the gloves, then there was a complaint about the ring canvas Klitschko reportedly had his hands wrapped without a representative of Fury present, so had to do them again [349] Klitschko lost the fight by UD, with scores of 115–112, 115–112, and 116–111 all in favour of Fury [350] [351] It was the first defeat Klitschko had suffered in over ten years and marked the end of the 'Klitschko Era', referring to the time period where both Klitschko brothers dominated the division Klitschko and Fury showed little offence during the twelve rounds, but Fury did enough to take the decision Klitschko landed 52 of 231 punches thrown (22.5%) and Fury landed 86 of 371 thrown (23.2%) [352]\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Joshua\nDays after the Fury rematch was called off, Klitschko was approached by Eddie Hearn, promoter of IBF champion Anthony Joshua, to fight on 28 November date they had set for a second defence Terms seemed to have been agreed for a £30m fight showdown although an initial contract was yet to be signed [358] After Fury gave up his world titles, it was said that Klitschko wanted the WBA (Super) title up for grabs in the potential match up against Joshua and waiting for approval, which the WBA kept postponing [359] A reason as to why the WBA was delaying sanctioning the fight was due them having a legal settlement with Lucas Browne so he could fight for the vacant title next Klitschko then turned his attention to fighting Browne instead on 10 December, a date his team had an arena set for in Germany [360] On 24 October, Klitschko suffered a minor calf injury which would rule him out until 2017 Talks between the Klitschko camp and Hearn remained active with a fight set for the first part of 2017 [361] [362] On 2 November, the WBA finally agreed to sanction a fight for their super title as long as Joshua defeats Eric Molina in December 2016 [363]\n\n\nRetirement\nOn 3 August 2017, Klitschko announced on

Born in Genoa, Chiesa began his playing career at amateur club Pontedecimo in 1986, before joining Sampdoria in 1989. He went on to play for several other clubs, including Teramo, Chieti, Modena, and Cremonese, before returning to Sampdoria in 1995.\n\n**Club Career**\n\nChiesa made his debut for Sampdoria on 16 April 1989 in a 1–0 loss against Roma in the 1988–89 Serie A. However, he failed to impress and was subsequently loaned out to Teramo and Chieti in the lower divisions. In 1992, he returned to Sampdoria, but again failed to make an impact, leading to loan spells at Modena and Cremonese.\n\nIn 1995, Chiesa returned to Sampdoria, where he formed a notable attacking duo with Roberto Mancini. He scored 22 goals in 27 matches in Serie A, earning his place as one of the top strikers in Italy. Chiesa's success with Sampdoria was not limited to his goalscoring, as he also played a key role in the team's attacking play, creating scoring opportunities for his teammates.\n\n**International Career**\n\nChiesa played for the Italy national team from 1996 to 2001, collecting a total of 22 caps and scoring 7 goals. He made his senior international debut on 29 May 1996 in a 2–2 friendly draw against Belgium, marking the occasion with a goal. Chiesa was subsequently selected by manager Arrigo Sacchi to play for Italy at the UEFA Euro 1996 tournament, where he appeared in two group stage matches, scoring Italy's only goal in a 2–1 defeat against the Czech Republic.\n\nChiesa also played for Italy at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where he appeared in Italy's opening group match against Chile, which ended in a 2–2 draw. He also appeared as a substitute in the round of 16 match against Norway, which Italy won 1–0. Italy was eliminated in the quarter-finals on penalties by hosts and eventual champions France.\n\nUnder manager Dino Zoff, Chiesa appeared in Italy's 6–2 friendly win over the FIFA World Stars on 16 December 1998, scoring a hat-trick. He also scored a goal in a 4–0 victory over Wales in a European qualifying match in Bologna on 5 June 1999. Chiesa made his final appearance for Italy under Giovanni Trapattoni in a 1–0 friendly win over South Africa in Perugia on 25 April 2001.\n\n**Style of Play**\n\nChiesa was a prolific goalscorer, known for his speed, power, and accuracy on the ball. He was a versatile player, capable of playing as a main striker or supporting forward, due to his vision, technique, and tactical intelligence. Chiesa was also known for his ability to make attacking runs into the area and strike the ball first time while on the run.\n\nHe was a skilled free-kick taker, and is the joint ninth-highest goalscorer of all time from free kicks in Serie A, with 13 goals, alongside Michel Platini and Álvaro Recoba. Fabio Capello described Chiesa as a complete forward, and as a cross between Gigi Riva and Paolo Rossi, due to his opportunism, anticipation, and excellent striking ability.\n\n**Coaching Career**\n\nIn June 2010, it was announced that Chiesa was appointed the new head coach of Figline for the 2010–11 season.

He also stated that although the Democratic Action Party or other races party managed to form a new government in the country if winning the election, the Malays will never perish since the overwhelming majority of Malaysian voters are still Malays and the overwhelming majority of parliamentary and state assembly constituencies in the country are Malay voter-majority constituencies.\n\n**Alleged Sea Turtle Egg Consumption**\n\nOn November 4, 2015, a photo of Ismail Sabri having dinner at a seafood restaurant in Sandakan with Beluran Umno chief Datuk James Ratib went viral.

On November 19, 2015, other photos surfaced and went viral on Facebook showing fragments of turtle eggshells on the table in front of some of the diners. Possession of sea turtles and their products is an offence under the Sabah Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997. Ismail Sabri denied consuming the turtle eggs, citing health reasons and said he was not aware of laws prohibiting their consumption.\n\n**Support of the Vaping Industry**\n\nOn November 9, 2015, Ismail Sabri stated that he supports the vaping industry in Malaysia. He says that the Malay-dominated industry is a success story for bumiputera entrepreneurism despite health warnings by the Malaysian Health Ministry. He has gone further in hoping that the unregulated industry can expand globally. Many prominent doctors and physicians have publicly chided Ismail Sabri's support for the industry, including the Sultan of Johor Ibrahim Ismail, who publicly decreed that all vape outlets must be shut down by January 1, 2016.\n\n**Nurul Izzah Anwar Defamation Suit**\n\nPKR's Nurul Izzah Anwar sued Ismail Sabri Yaakob and IGP Khalid Abu Bakar in November 2015 for allegedly accusing her of being a traitor to the country. She claimed that Ismail Sabri said words that implied she was a traitor to the country and had declared war on the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. She also claimed that Khalid said defamatory words about her in another press conference. Both incidents occur just a few days after photographs of her with Jacel Kiram, daughter of Jamalul Kiram III, who is said to have ordered or led the 2013 invasion of Sabah surfaced. In April 2018, the High Court ordered Ismail and Khalid to pay Nurul RM600,000 and RM400,000 in damages, respectively, after ruling that their statements had defamed Nurul in their natural and ordinary meaning.\n\n**Petition Against His Appointment as Prime Minister**\n\nHours after Ismail Sabri was announced and nominated by his party as the 9th Prime Minister of Malaysia on August 19, 2021, an online petition was launched to address to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong as well as the Istana Negara, calling on all Malaysians against his possible appointment as the nation's next prime minister after the collapse of the Perikatan Nasional administration on August 16, 2021. The petition on change.org gained over 200,000 signatures within 8 hours of going online, later increasing to over 350,000 signatures. The petition was critical of Ismail Sabri's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in his prior positions leading to large-scale infections, and for previous comments on race and Malay \"special rights.\" According to the petition, he had also issued numerous remarks which were deemed inappropriate such as the boycott call in 2015, where he urged Malay consumers to use their \"power and rights\" to pressure the Malaysian Chinese minority to lower prices, as well as promoting racial segregation between the Malays and Chinese in the country. Ismail has been also criticised in the petition for the sometimes confusing and conflicting health protocols, namely Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), including on which economic sectors should stay shut as COVID-19 cases kept rising.\n\n**Implementation of Bumiputera Policies**\n\nA new equity policy for bumiputeras in the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (12MP) attracted controversy. The policy is said to ensure sustainable equity holdings by bumiputeras, with an equity safety net to guarantee that the sale of shares or bumiputera-owned firms would only be sold solely to bumiputera-owned companies, consortium, or individuals. Syed Saddiq said that the new rulings were unfair as they would be tantamount to taking equity from the non-bumiputeras and giving them to bumiputeras. Former Health Minister, Dzulkefly Ahmad had also described the policy as \"suicidal\" and claimed that the new policy would only kill the bumiputera companies economically if that is their intention. He also said that based on the feedback from Malay businessmen, most were against the idea of the new bumiputera-only policy being implemented. Ismail Sabri announced it after revealing that the government's target to raise bumiputera equity ownership to 30% had yet to be achieved. He also announced funding to improve bumiputera businesses' sustainability to hit 15% contribution in gross domestic product (GDP) by bumiputera micro, small, and medium enterprises by 2025.\n\n**Promoting the Malaysian Language**\n\nIn early 2022, Ismail Sabri suggested that the Malaysia language should be more widely used, especially by ASEAN in official capacities. In response, Nadiem Makarim, Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of Indonesia, expressed that the Indonesian language should sit in the lead. In Malaysia, both languages are commonly viewed as the same, whereas Indonesia views its language as a more distinct branch.\n\n**On Israel-Palestine**\n\nIsmail Sabri has called on the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Arab League, United Nations, and the entire Muslim community to halt \"atrocities committed by the Zionist regime.\" He said the right of the Palestinians to form a sovereign and independent state must be upheld. He added that the latest conflict between Palestine and Israel stems from a very long history and that the Palestinians had been locked up in the world's largest open-air prison for decades.

Ryan Coogan opined that the two rappers' poetic talents had elevated their conflict from celebrity gossip to art He further claimed that the feud \"has caused both men to dig deep and produce some of their best work in years\" [157] Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork labeled the feud \"the most miserable spectacle in rap history\", calling it a \"disinformation campaign that has turned rap's all-time biggest beef into a messy, confusing conflict that, at its core, is nothing but ugly\" and stated it \"doesn't even sound like rap beef anymore, but the death knell of an entire era\", specifically

despite the victory feeling hollow [52] The Roots drummer Questlove condemned both for engaging in \"wrestling match level mudslinging\", opining that neither can reasonably be considered to have emerged victorious, concluding \"Hip Hop truly is dead\" [137] [166] Other writers took a contrary view, arguing that the feud was a net positive for hip-hop Yemi Abiade of BBC News said the feud \"entertained the entire world, enhancing the legacies of two generational rap artists\" and claimed that \"rap music wins, yet again\" [167]\n\n\nFull song chronology\n\n\nRelated songs\n\n\nSee

[52] The cover art for the track was a satellite image of Drake's mansion labeled with pins representing sexual predators [81] After the release of the song, on Google Maps, fans have found Drake's mansion and have labeled the house, using Google Maps' option to customize locations, as \"Owned by Kendrick\", as well as things like \"A-Minor\", referencing the first verse of \"Not Like Us\" and \"Kendrick's Dog\", which could be another reference to Drake's latest album, For All the Dogs [82]\n\n\nThe Pop Out concert and \"Not Like Us\" video\nIn June 2024, Lamar announced a one-off concert at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, titled The Pop Out: Ken & Friends in reference to a lyric from \"Not Like Us\" (\"Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas\") The concert was scheduled for Juneteenth, which Charlamagne tha God suggested was a dig aimed at Drake [89] Lamar opened his part of the show with \"Euphoria\", which contained updated lyrics aimed at Drake's possession of Tupac Shakur's crown ring Later in the show, Ab-Soul accompanied Lamar for the debut performance of \"6:16 in LA\" Lamar performed his verse on \"Like That\" for the first time before inviting Dr Dre on stage Lamar and Dre performed Dre's hits \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love\", the latter of which Dre had recorded with Shakur After these two songs, Dre performed the intro to \"Not Like Us\" (\"Pssst, I see dead people\") Lamar concluded the concert with a \"Not Like Us\" encore, afterwards repeating the song five more times while dancing on stage with colleagues and members of many Los Angeles street gangs, including the Crips and Bloods, before taking a group photo onstage [90]\n\n\nConcert cancellations at History\nSchoolboy Q was set to commence his Blue Lips Weekends concert tour, in support of his sixth studio album Blue Lips (2024), on July 18, 2024, at History in Toronto [106] The music venue was established in 2021 through a creative partnership between Drake and Live Nation Entertainment [107] On the evening prior to opening night, Schoolboy Q announced that the sold-out concert was unexpectedly cancelled [108] He blamed the cancellation on Drake and Lamar's feud, citing his longtime friendship with Lamar, and claimed the Toronto Police Service prohibited artists from Top Dawg Entertainment from performing in the city due to safety concerns [109] The police agency dismissed rumors of their involvement, saying the decision to cancel the performance was made solely by History [108]\n\n\n\"Watch The Party Die\"\nOn September 11, 2024, Lamar released a single on his Instagram Page As of September 12, 2024, there is no given name to this song, but it is commonly known as \"Watch the Party Die\", as the lyric is repeated throughout the song Some saw it as a revival to the feud not too long after the announcement of Lamar's Super Bowl LIX Performance The song references the feud, and many view it as a jab towards the music industry [113]\n\n\nCommentary\nDrake has been supported by Birdman, Azealia Banks, 50 Cent, the Game, and Juelz Santana, among others [note 3] Lamar has been supported by Metro Boomin, Future, Pusha T, Kanye West, The Weeknd, ASAP Rocky, Rick Ross, and Jay Rock, among others [note 4]\n\n\nCelebrity and media reactions\nDrake has been supported by Birdman, Azealia Banks, 50 Cent, the Game, and Juelz Santana, among others [note 3] Lamar has been supported by Metro Boomin, Future, Pusha T, Kanye West, The Weeknd, ASAP Rocky, Rick Ross, and Jay Rock, among others [note 4]\n\n\n\"BBL Drizzy\" beat giveaway\nOn May 5, 2024, Metro Boomin started a contest where he would give a free beat and $10,000 to whoever recorded the best diss against Drake over a semi-instrumental track called \"BBL Drizzy\", whose chorus is based on the rumor that Drake has had a Brazilian butt lift The song samples an AI generated R&B parody song evocative of 1970s music created by comedic performer King Willonius [148] The instrumental received more than 3.3 million streams on SoundCloud within a week and managed to maintain the number one spot on the platform's \"New and Hot\" chart [149] The track also drew responses on social media, with celebrities and internet personalities including Elon Musk, Dr Miami, and more reacting [150] In addition to freestyle raps, users also recreated the song beyond the hip hop in house, merengue and Bollywood styles [151] [152] [149] Some also created covers of the song on a variety of musical instruments, including on saxophone, guitar and harp [152] [149]\n\n\nAnalysis\nAccording to The Ringer, the feud has been considered the \"last great rap beef\", with Holmes asserting that \" [I]n terms of size, scale, and capital, we're witnessing the last rap beef of this magnitude.\" [52] Multiple commentators, including Todd Boyd, compared the feud to the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry from the 1990s, [153] [154] which culminated with the drive-by shooting deaths of both Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G in 1996 and 1997, respectively [155] The feud was also considered a debate about the future of the genre and its culture, specifically in regards towards its commercial appeal and authenticity; an MSNBC article drew parallels to the feud between Jay-Z and Nas [156] Likening the feud to literary debates, The Independent's Ryan Coogan opined that the two rappers' poetic talents had elevated their conflict from celebrity gossip to art He further claimed that the feud \"has caused both men to dig deep and produce some of their best work in years\" [157] Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork labeled the feud \"the most miserable spectacle in rap history\", calling it a \"disinformation campaign that has turned rap's all-time biggest beef into a messy, confusing conflict that, at its core, is nothing but ugly\" and stated it \"doesn't even sound like rap beef anymore, but the death knell of an entire era\", specifically noting both the severity of the accusations leveled against the parties involved and how the feud had been received on social media in light of those accusations [28]\n\n\nVerdict\nBy early May, various music outlets such as Pitchfork, [28] The Ringer, [52] and Rolling Stone [165] cited Lamar as winning in the feud An Insider article claimed that both music critics and social media users conceded Lamar as the victor [60] However, Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork avowed that Lamar's victory was \"pyrrhic\", [28] while Charles Holmes for The Ringer similarly claimed Lamar was in the lead despite the victory feeling hollow [52] The Roots drummer Questlove condemned both for engaging in \"wrestling match level mudslinging\", opining that neither can reasonably be considered to have emerged victorious, concluding \"Hip Hop truly is dead\" [137] [166] Other writers took a contrary view, arguing that the feud was a net positive for hip-hop Yemi Abiade of BBC News said the feud \"entertained the entire world, enhancing the legacies of two generational rap artists\" and claimed that \"rap music wins, yet again\" [167]\n\n\nFull song chronology\n\n\nRelated songs\n\n\nSee

This group may be composed of individuals who have gained power through their wealth, birth, or social status. Oligarchies often arise when a society is divided into a small, privileged class and a larger, disenfranchised majority.\n\n**Types**\n\nThe consolidation of power by a dominant religious or ethnic minority can be considered a form of oligarchy. Examples include South Africa during apartheid, Liberia under Americo-Liberians, the Sultanate of Zanzibar, and Rhodesia. In these cases, oligarchic rule was often tied to the legacy of colonialism.\n\n**Minority Rule**\n\nThe consolidation of power by a dominant religious or ethnic minority can also be seen as a form of minority rule. This can occur when a minority group gains control of the government and imposes its will on the majority population. Examples of minority rule include the government of Kuwait, where a small group of ruling families hold significant power, and the government of Saudi Arabia, where the ruling family holds a disproportionate amount of power.\n\n**Putative Oligarchies**\n\nBusiness groups may be considered oligarchies if they meet certain criteria. This can include the concentration of wealth and power among a small group of individuals, as well as the use of this power to influence government policies and decisions. Examples of putative oligarchies include the media conglomerates that dominate the global media landscape, the tech giants that shape the digital economy, and the financial institutions that control the global financial system.\n\n**Intellectual Oligarchies**\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw coined the concept of an intellectual oligarchy in his play Major Barbara (1907). In the play, Shaw criticizes the control of society by intellectual elites and expresses a desire for the empowerment of the common people. This concept of intellectual oligarchy highlights the ways in which power can be concentrated among a small group of individuals who hold significant social and cultural influence.\n\n**Countries Perceived as Oligarchies**\n\nSeveral countries have been described as oligarchies by scholars and commentators. These include Colombia, Indonesia, Russia, Singapore, and the United States. Each of these countries has a unique set of characteristics that contribute to the concentration of power among a small elite.\n\nIn Colombia, for example, the country's powerful paramilitary groups have been accused of exerting significant influence over the government and economy. In Indonesia, the country's wealthy elite has been accused of using its power to manipulate the government and the economy. In Russia, the country's oligarchs have been accused of using their wealth and influence to shape government policy and decisions. In Singapore, the country's ruling party has been accused of using its power to maintain a tight grip on the economy and society. And in the United States, the country's wealthy elite has been accused of using its power to shape government policy and decisions.\n\n**The Philippines**\n\nDuring the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos from 1965 to 1986, several monopolies arose in the Philippines, primarily linked to the Marcos family and their close associates. Analysts have described this period, and even subsequent decades, as an era of oligarchy in the Philippines.\n\n**Russian Federation**\n\nSince the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent privatization of state-owned assets, a class of Russian oligarchs emerged. These oligarchs gained control of significant portions of the economy, especially in the energy, metals, and natural resources sectors. Many of these individuals maintained close ties with government officials, particularly the president, leading some to characterize modern Russia as an oligarchy intertwined with the state.\n\n**Iran**\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, established after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, is sometimes described as a clerical oligarchy. Its ruling system, known as Velayat-e-Faqih (Governance of the Jurist), places power in the hands of a small group of high-ranking Shia clerics, led by the Supreme Leader. This group holds significant influence over the country's legislative, military, and economic affairs, and critics argue that this system concentrates power in a religious elite, marginalizing other voices within society.\n\n**Ukraine**\n\nSince Ukraine's independence in 1991, a powerful class of business elites, known as Ukrainian oligarchs, has played a significant role in the country's politics and economy. These oligarchs gained control of state assets during the rapid privatization that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. By 2021, Ukraine passed a law aimed at curbing oligarchic influence on politics and the economy.\n\n**United States**\n\nSeveral commentators and scholars have suggested that the United States demonstrates characteristics of an oligarchy, particularly in relation to the concentration of wealth and political influence among a small elite. As exemplified by the list of top donors to the major political parties, the United States has a small group of wealthy individuals who have a disproportionate amount of influence over the government and the economy.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Plutocracy\n* Democracy\n* Authoritarianism\n* Totalitarianism\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \"The Oligarchy Question\" by Jeffrey A.

{"title": "Bible", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe term \"Bible\" can refer to the Hebrew Bible or the Christian Bible, which contains both the Old and New Testaments [3]\n\n\nDevelopment and history\nThe Bible is not a single book; it is a collection of books whose complex development is not completely understood The oldest books began as songs and stories orally transmitted from generation to generation Scholars of the twenty-first century are only in the beginning stages of exploring \"the interface between writing, performance, memorization, and the aural dimension\" of the texts Current indications are that writing and orality were not separate so much as ancient writing was learned in a context of communal oral performance [11] The Bible was written and compiled by many people, who many scholars say are mostly unknown, from a variety of disparate cultures and backgrounds [12]\n\n\nHebrew Bible\nThe authoritative Hebrew Bible is taken from the masoretic text (called the Leningrad Codex) which dates from 1008 The Hebrew Bible can therefore sometimes be referred to as the Masoretic Text [94]\n\n\nNew Testament\nThe New Testament is the name given to the second portion of the Christian Bible While some scholars assert that Aramaic was the original language of the New Testament, [153] the majority view says it was written in the vernacular form of Koine Greek Still, there is reason to assert that it is a heavily Semitized Greek: its syntax is like conversational Greek, but its style is largely Semitic [154] [x] [y] Koine Greek was the common language of the western Roman Empire from the Conquests of Alexander the Great (335–323 BCE) until the evolution of Byzantine Greek (c. 600) while Aramaic was the language of Jesus, the Apostles and the ancient Near East [153] [z] [aa] [ab] The term \"New Testament\" came into use in the second century during a controversy over whether the Hebrew Bible should be included with the Christian writings as sacred scripture [155]\n\n\nVariants\nAll biblical texts were treated with reverence and care by those that copied them, yet there are transmission errors, called variants, in all biblical manuscripts [59] [60] A variant is any deviation between two texts Textual critic Daniel B Wallace explains that \"Each deviation counts as one variant, regardless of how many MSS  [manuscripts] attest to it.\" [61] Hebrew scholar Emanuel Tov says the term is not evaluative; it is a recognition that the paths of development of different texts have separated [62]\n\n\nContent and themes\nThe narratives, laws, wisdom sayings, parables, and unique genres of the Bible provide opportunity for discussion on most topics of concern to human beings: The role of women, [69]: 203  sex, [70] children, marriage, [71] neighbours, [72]: 24  friends, the nature of authority and the sharing of power, [73]: 45–48  animals, trees and nature, [74]: xi  money and economics, [75]: 77  work, relationships, [76] sorrow and despair and the nature of joy, among others [77] Philosopher and ethicist Jaco Gericke adds: \"The meaning of good and evil, the nature of right and wrong, criteria for moral discernment, valid sources of morality, the origin and acquisition of moral beliefs, the ontological status of moral norms, moral authority, cultural pluralism,  [as well as] axiological and aesthetic assumptions about the nature of value and beauty These are all implicit in the texts.\" [78]\n\n\nThemes\nThe narratives, laws, wisdom sayings, parables, and unique genres of the Bible

implicit in the texts.\" [78]\n\n\nHebrew Bible\nThe authoritative Hebrew Bible is taken from the masoretic text (called the Leningrad Codex) which dates from 1008 The Hebrew Bible can therefore sometimes be referred to as the Masoretic Text [94]\n\n\nTorah\nThe Torah (תּוֹרָה) is also known as the \"Five Books of Moses\" or the Pentateuch, meaning \"five scroll-cases\" [99] Traditionally these books were considered to have been dictated to Moses by God himself [100] [101] Since the 17th century, scholars have viewed the original sources as being the product of multiple anonymous authors while also allowing the possibility that Moses first assembled the separate sources [102] [103] There are a variety of hypotheses regarding when and how the Torah was composed, [104] but there is a general consensus that it took its final form during the reign of the Persian Achaemenid Empire (probably 450–350 BCE), [105] [106] or perhaps in the early Hellenistic period (333–164 BCE) [107]\n\n\nNevi'im\nNevi'im (Hebrew: נְבִיאִים, romanized: Nəḇī'īm, \"Prophets\") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the Torah and Ketuvim It contains two sub-groups, the Former Prophets (Nevi'im Rishonim נביאים ראשונים, the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (Nevi'im Aharonim נביאים אחרונים, the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets).\n\n\nFormer Prophets\nThe Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings They contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the Promised Land, and end with the release from imprisonment of the last king of Judah Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:\n\n\nLatter Prophets\nThe Latter Prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets, counted as a single book.\n\n\nKetuvim\nKetuvim (in Biblical Hebrew: כְּתוּבִים, romanized: Kəṯūḇīm \"writings\") is the third and final section of the Tanakh The Ketuvim are believed to have been written under the inspiration of Ruach HaKodesh (the Holy Spirit) but with one level less authority than that of prophecy [110]\n\n\nThe five scrolls\nThe five relatively short books of Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Book of Esther are collectively known as the Hamesh Megillot These are the latest books collected and designated as authoritative in the Jewish canon even though they were not complete until the second century CE [113]\n\n\nOther books\nThe books of Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah [h] and Chronicles share a distinctive style that no other Hebrew literary text, biblical or extra-biblical, shares [114] They were not written in the normal style of Hebrew of the post-exilic period The authors of these books must have chosen to write in their own distinctive style for unknown reasons [115]\n\n\nBook order\nThe following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most current printed editions.\n\n\nSeptuagint\nThe Septuagint (\"the Translation of the Seventy\", also called \"the LXX\"), is a Koine Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible begun in the late third century BCE.\n\n\nIncorporations from Theodotion\nThe Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter Masoretic Text and in two longer Greek versions, the original Septuagint version, c. 100 BCE, and the later Theodotion version from c. second century CE Both Greek texts contain three additions to Daniel: The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children; the story of Susannah and the Elders; and the story of Bel and the Dragon Theodotion's translation was so widely copied in the Early Christian church that its version of the Book of Daniel virtually superseded the Septuagint's The priest Jerome, in his preface to Daniel (407 CE), records the rejection of the Septuagint version of that book in Christian usage: \"I .. wish to emphasize to the reader the fact that it was not according to the Septuagint version but according to the version of Theodotion himself that the churches publicly read Daniel.\" [128] Jerome's preface also mentions that the Hexapla had notations in it, indicating several major differences in content between the Theodotion Daniel and the earlier versions in Greek and Hebrew.\n\n\nFinal form\nTextual critics are now debating how to reconcile the earlier view of the Septuagint as 'careless' with content from the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran, scrolls discovered at Wadi Murabba'at, Nahal Hever, and those discovered at Masada These scrolls are 1000–1300 years older than the Leningrad text, dated to 1008 CE, which forms the basis of the Masoretic text [130] The scrolls have confirmed much of the Masoretic text, but they have also differed from it, and many of those differences agree with the Septuagint, the Samaritan Pentateuch or the Greek Old Testament instead [121]\n\n\nPseudepigraphal books\nPseudepigrapha are works whose authorship is wrongly attributed A written work can be pseudepigraphical and not be a forgery, as forgeries are intentionally deceptive With pseudepigrapha, authorship has been mistransmitted for any one of a number of reasons [132] For example, the Gospel of Barnabas claims to be written by Barnabas the companion of the Apostle Paul, but both its manuscripts date from the Middle Ages \n\n\nBook of Enoch\nNotable pseudepigraphal works include the Books of Enoch such as 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, which survives only in Old Slavonic, and 3 Enoch, surviving in Hebrew of the c. fifth century – c. sixth century CE These are ancient Jewish religious works, traditionally ascribed to the prophet Enoch, the great-grandfather of the patriarch Noah The fragment of Enoch found among the Qumran scrolls attest to it being an ancient work [134] The older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300 BCE, and the latest part (Book of Parables) was probably composed at the end of the first century BCE [135]\n\n\nChristian Bible\nA Christian Bible is a set of books divided into the Old and New Testament that a Christian denomination has, at some point in their past or present, regarded as divinely inspired scripture by the Holy Spirit [138] The Early Church primarily used the Septuagint, as it was written in Greek, the common tongue of the day, or they used the Targums among Aramaic speakers Modern English translations of the Old Testament section of the Christian Bible are based on the Masoretic Text [37] The Pauline epistles and the gospels were soon added, along with other writings, as the New Testament [139]\n\n\nOld Testament\nThe Old Testament has been important to the life of the Christian church from its earliest days Bible scholar N T Wright says \"Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures.\" [140] Wright adds that the earliest Christians searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus They regarded the \"holy writings\" of the Israelites as necessary and instructive for the Christian, as seen from Paul's words to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15), as pointing to the Messiah, and as having reached a climactic fulfilment in Jesus generating the \"new covenant\" prophesied by Jeremiah [141]\n\n\nNew Testament\nThe New Testament is the name given to the second portion of the Christian Bible While some scholars assert that Aramaic was the original language of the New Testament, [153] the majority view says it was written in the vernacular form of Koine Greek Still, there is reason to assert that it is a heavily Semitized Greek: its syntax is like conversational Greek, but its style is largely Semitic [154] [x] [y] Koine Greek was the common language of the western Roman Empire from the Conquests of Alexander the Great (335–323 BCE) until the evolution of Byzantine Greek (c. 600) while Aramaic was the language of Jesus, the Apostles and the ancient Near East [153] [z] [aa] [ab] The term \"New Testament\" came into use in the second century during a controversy over whether the Hebrew Bible should be included with the Christian writings as sacred scripture [155]\n\n\nCanon variations\nThe Peshitta (Classical Syriac: ܦܫܺܝܛܬܳܐ or ܦܫܝܼܛܬܵܐ pšīṭtā) is the standard version of the Bible for churches in the Syriac tradition The consensus within biblical scholarship, although not universal, is that the Old Testament of the Peshitta was translated into Syriac from biblical Hebrew, probably in the 2nd century CE, and that the New Testament of the Peshitta was translated from the Greek [ac] This New Testament, originally excluding certain disputed books (2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation), had become a standard by the early 5th century The five excluded books were added in the Harklean Version (616 CE) of Thomas of Harqel [ad] [153]\n\n\nPeshitta\nThe Peshitta (Classical Syriac: ܦܫܺܝܛܬܳܐ or ܦܫܝܼܛܬܵܐ pšīṭtā) is the standard version of the Bible for churches in the Syriac tradition The consensus within biblical scholarship,

excluded books were added in the Harklean Version (616 CE) of Thomas of Harqel [ad] [153]\n\n\nCatholic Church canon\nThe canon of the Catholic Church was affirmed by the Council of Rome (382), the Synod of Hippo (393), the Council of Carthage (397), the Council of Carthage (419), the Council of Florence (1431–1449) and finally, as an article of faith, by the Council of Trent (1545–1563) establishing the canon consisting of 46 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in the New Testament for a total of 73 books in the Catholic Bible [170] [171] [ae]\n\n\nEthiopian Orthodox canon\nThe canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is wider than the canons used by most other Christian churches There are 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible [173] In addition to the books found in the Septuagint accepted by other Orthodox Christians, the Ethiopian Old Testament Canon uses Enoch and Jubilees (ancient Jewish books that only survived in Ge'ez, but are quoted in the New Testament), [144] Greek Ezra and the Apocalypse of Ezra, 3 books of Meqabyan, and Psalm 151 at the end of the Psalter [n] [l] The three books of Meqabyan are not to be confused with the books of Maccabees The order of the books is somewhat different in that the Ethiopian Old Testament follows the Septuagint order for the Minor Prophets rather than the Jewish order [173]\n\n\nNew Testament Apocryphal books\nThe New Testament apocrypha are a number of writings by early professed Christians that give accounts of Jesus and his teachings, the nature of God, or the teachings of his Apostles and of their activities Some of these writings were cited as Scripture by some early Christians, but since the fifth century a widespread consensus emerged limiting the New Testament to the 27 books of the modern canon [174] [175] Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Western Protestant churches do not view the New Testament apocrypha as part of the inspired Bible [175] Although some Oriental Orthodox canons to some extent have The Armenian Apostolic church at times has included the Third Epistle to the Corinthians, but does not always list it with the other 27 canonical New Testament books The New Testament of the Coptic Bible, adopted by the Egyptian Church, includes the two Epistles of Clement [176]\n\n\nTextual history\nThe original autographs, that is, the original Greek writings and manuscripts written by the original authors of the New Testament, have not survived [177] But, historically, copies of those original autographs exist and were transmitted and preserved in a number of manuscript traditions The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the Alexandrian text-type (generally minimalist), the Byzantine text-type (generally maximalist), and the Western text-type (occasionally wild) Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts Very early on, Christianity replaced scrolls with codexes, the forerunner of bound books, and by the 3rd century, collections of biblical books began being copied as a set [178]\n\n\nInfluence\nWith a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible is one of the most influential works ever written From practices of personal hygiene to philosophy and ethics, the Bible has directly and indirectly influenced politics and law, war and peace, sexual morals, marriage and family life, letters and learning, the arts, economics, social justice, medical care and more [180]\n\n\nPolitics and law\nThe Bible has been used to support and oppose political power It has inspired revolution and \"a reversal of power\" because God is so often portrayed as choosing what is \"weak and humble...(the stammering Moses, the infant Samuel, Saul from an insignificant family, David confronting Goliath, etc.)....to confound the mighty\" [186] [187] Biblical texts have been the catalyst for political concepts like democracy, religious toleration and religious freedom [188]: 3  These have, in turn, inspired movements ranging from abolitionism in the 18th and 19th century, to the civil rights movement, the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and liberation theology in Latin America The Bible has been the source of many peace movements and efforts at reconciliation around the world  [189]\n\n\nSocial responsibility\nThe philosophical foundation of human rights is in the Bible's teachings of natural law [195] [196] The prophets of the Hebrew Bible repeatedly admonish the people to practice justice, charity, and social responsibility H A Lockton writes that \"The Poverty and Justice Bible (The Bible Society (UK), 2008) claims there are more than 2000 verses in the Bible dealing with the justice issues of rich-poor relations, exploitation and oppression\" [197] Judaism practised charity and healing the sick but tended to limit these practices to their own people [198] For Christians, the Old Testament statements are enhanced by multiple verses such as Matthew 10:8, Luke 10:9 and 9:2, and Acts 5:16 that say \"heal the sick\" Authors Vern and Bonnie Bullough write in The care of the sick: the emergence of modern nursing, that this is seen as an aspect of following Jesus's example, since so much of his public ministry focused on healing [198]\n\n\nLiterature and the arts\nThe Bible has directly and indirectly influenced literature: St Augustine's Confessions is widely considered the first autobiography in Western Literature [209] The Summa Theologica, written 1265–1274, is \"one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature.\" [210] These both influenced the writings of Dante's epic poetry and his Divine Comedy, and in turn, Dante's creation and sacramental theology has contributed to influencing writers such as J R R Tolkien [211] and William Shakespeare [212]\n\n\nCriticism\nCritics view certain biblical texts to be morally problematic The Bible neither calls for nor condemns slavery outright, but there are verses that address dealing with it, and these verses have been used to support it Some have written that supersessionism begins in the book of Hebrews where others locate its beginnings in the culture of the fourth century Roman empire [2]: 1  The Bible has been used to support the death penalty, patriarchy, sexual intolerance, the violence of total war, and colonialism.\n\n\nInterpretation and inspiration\nBiblical texts have always required interpretation, and this has given rise to multiple views and approaches according to the interplay between various religions and the book [228]\n\n\nReligious significance\n\nBoth Judaism and Christianity see the Bible as religiously and intellectually significant [247] It provides insight into its time and into the composition of the texts, and it represents an important step in the development of thought [247] It is used in communal worship, recited and memorized, provides personal guidance, a basis for counseling, church doctrine, religious culture (teaching, hymns and worship), and ethical standards [247] [248]: 145 \n\nVersions and translations\nThe original texts of the Tanakh were almost entirely written in Hebrew with about one per cent in Aramaic The earliest translation of any Bible text is the Septuagint which translated the Hebrew into Greek [36] As the first translation of any biblical literature, the translation that became the Septuagint was an unparalleled event in the ancient world [259] This translation was made possible by a common Mediterranean culture where Semitism had been foundational to Greek culture [260] In the Talmud, Greek is the only language officially allowed for translation [122] The Targum Onkelos is the Aramaic translation of the Hebrew Bible believed to have been written in the second century CE [36] These texts attracted the work of various scholars, but a standardized text was not available before the 9th century [36]\n\n\nArchaeological and historical research\nBiblical archaeology is a subsection of archaeology that relates to and sheds light upon the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament [275] It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times [276] There are a wide range of interpretations in the field of biblical archaeology [277] One broad division includes biblical maximalism, which generally takes the view that most of the Old Testament or the Hebrew Bible is based on history although it is presented through the religious viewpoint of its time According to historian Lester L Grabbe, there are \"few, if any\" maximalists in mainstream scholarship [278] It is considered to be the extreme opposite of biblical minimalism which considers the Bible to be a purely post-exilic (5th century BCE and later) composition [279] According to Mary-Joan Leith, professor of religious studies, many minimalists have ignored evidence for the antiquity of the Hebrew language in the Bible, and few take archaeological evidence into consideration [280] Most biblical scholars and archaeologists fall somewhere on a spectrum between these two [281] [278]\n\n\nBiblical criticism\nBiblical criticism refers to the analytical investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as history, authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention It is not the same as criticism of the Bible, which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance, nor is it criticism of possible translation errors [291]\n\n\nBible museums\nThe grandest medieval Bibles were illuminated manuscripts in which the text is supplemented by the addition of decoration, such as decorated initials, borders (marginalia) and miniature illustrations Up to the 12th century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a commission from a wealthy patron Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the monks who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a scriptorium, where \"separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk.\" [308] By the 14th century, the cloisters of monks writing in the scriptorium started to employ laybrothers from the urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands [309]\nDemand for manuscripts grew to an extent that the Monastic libraries were unable to meet with the demand, and began employing secular scribes and illuminators [310] These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in certain instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day [311] A notable example of an illuminated manuscript is the Book of Kells, produced circa the year 800 containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables.\n\n\nIllustrations\nThe grandest medieval Bibles were illuminated manuscripts in which the text is supplemented by the addition of decoration, such as

played a central role in the development of Western culture and society. It is a collection of books that have been written and compiled by many people over a period of centuries, and its content reflects the history, culture, and spiritual practices of ancient civilizations. The Bible is considered a sacred text by Christians, Jews, and other faith communities, and its teachings have had a profound impact on art, literature, music, and politics. This article provides an overview of the Bible, its history, composition, and significance.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe term \"Bible\" can refer to the Hebrew Bible or the Christian Bible, which contains both the Old and New Testaments. The term \"Bible\" is derived from the Greek word \"biblia,\" which means \"books.\" The word \"biblia\" was used to describe a collection of books, and it was later adopted as the title for the Christian Bible.\n\n# Development and history\n\nThe Bible is not a single book; it is a collection of books whose complex development is not completely understood. The oldest books began as songs and stories orally transmitted from generation to generation. Scholars of the twenty-first century are only in the beginning stages of exploring \"the interface between writing, performance, memorization, and the aural dimension\" of the texts. The Bible was written and compiled by many people, who many scholars say are mostly unknown, from a variety of disparate cultures and backgrounds.\n\n## Hebrew Bible\n\nThe authoritative Hebrew Bible is taken from the masoretic text (called the Leningrad Codex) which dates from 1008. The Hebrew Bible can therefore sometimes be referred to as the Masoretic Text. The Torah (תּוֹרָה) is also known as the \"Five Books of Moses\" or the Pentateuch, meaning \"five scroll-cases.\" Traditionally these books were considered to have been dictated to Moses by God himself. Since the 17th century, scholars have viewed the original sources as being the product of multiple anonymous authors while also allowing the possibility that Moses first assembled the separate sources.\n\n## New Testament\n\nThe New Testament is the name given to the second portion of the Christian Bible. While some scholars assert that Aramaic was the original language of the New Testament, the majority view says it was written in the vernacular form of Koine Greek. Koine Greek was the common language of the western Roman Empire from the Conquests of Alexander the Great (335–323 BCE) until the evolution of Byzantine Greek (c. 600) while Aramaic was the language of Jesus, the Apostles and the ancient Near East.\n\n# Variants\n\nAll biblical texts were treated with reverence and care by those that copied them, yet there are transmission errors, called variants, in all biblical manuscripts. A variant is any deviation between two texts. Hebrew scholar Emanuel Tov says the term is not evaluative; it is a recognition that the paths of development of different texts have separated.\n\n## Septuagint\n\nThe Septuagint (\"the Translation of the Seventy\", also called \"the LXX\") is a Koine Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible begun in the late third century BCE. The Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter Masoretic Text and in two longer Greek versions, the original Septuagint version, c. 100 BCE, and the later Theodotion version from c. second century CE.\n\n## Pseudepigraphal books\n\nPseudepigrapha are works whose authorship is wrongly attributed. A written work can be pseudepigraphical and not be a forgery, as forgeries are intentionally deceptive. For example, the Gospel of Barnabas claims to be written by Barnabas the companion of the Apostle Paul, but both its manuscripts date from the Middle Ages.\n\n# Canon variations\n\nThe Peshitta (Classical Syriac: ܦܫܺܝܛܬܳܐ or ܦܫܝܼܛܬܵܐ pšīṭtā) is the standard version of the Bible for churches in the Syriac tradition. The consensus within biblical scholarship, although not universal, is that the Old Testament of the Peshitta was translated into Syriac from biblical Hebrew, probably in the 2nd century CE, and that the New Testament of the Peshitta was translated from the Greek.\n\n## Catholic Church canon\n\nThe canon of the Catholic Church was affirmed by the Council of Rome (382), the Synod of Hippo (393), the Council of Carthage (397), the Council of Carthage (419), the Council of Florence (1431–1449) and finally, as an article of faith, by the Council of Trent (1545–1563) establishing the canon consisting of 46 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in the New Testament for a total of 73 books in the Catholic Bible.\n\n## Ethiopian Orthodox canon\n\nThe canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is wider than the canons used by most other Christian churches.

The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the Alexandrian text-type (generally minimalist), the Byzantine text-type (generally maximalist), and the Western text-type (occasionally wild).\n\n## Biblical criticism\n\nBiblical criticism refers to the analytical investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as history, authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention.

Up to the 12th century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a commission from a wealthy patron.\n\n## Gallery\n\nThe Bible has been a source of inspiration for many artists and has been the subject of numerous works of art throughout history. From the intricate illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period to the modern-day illustrations and graphics, the Bible has been a source of creative expression and artistic inspiration.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Bible is a collection of sacred texts that have played a central role in the development of Western culture and society. Its teachings have had a profound impact on art, literature, music, and politics, and its influence can still be seen today. The Bible is a complex and multifaceted text that has been interpreted and understood in many different ways throughout history, and its significance continues to be felt in many different contexts.",

\"five scroll-cases\" [99] Traditionally these books were considered to have been dictated to Moses by God himself [100] [101] Since the 17th century, scholars have viewed the original sources as being the product of multiple anonymous authors while also allowing the possibility that Moses first assembled the separate sources [102] [103] There are a variety of hypotheses regarding when and how the Torah was composed, [104] but there is a general consensus that it took its final form during the reign of the Persian Achaemenid Empire (probably 450–350 BCE), [105] [106] or perhaps in the early Hellenistic period (333–164 BCE) [107]\n\n\nNevi'im\nNevi'im (Hebrew: נְבִיאִים, romanized: Nəḇī'īm, \"Prophets\") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the Torah and Ketuvim It contains two sub-groups, the Former Prophets (Nevi'im Rishonim נביאים ראשונים, the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (Nevi'im Aharonim נביאים אחרונים, the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets).\n\n\nFormer Prophets\nThe Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings They contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the Promised Land, and end with the release from imprisonment of the last king of Judah Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:\n\n\nLatter Prophets\nThe Latter Prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets, counted as a single book.\n\n\nKetuvim\nKetuvim (in Biblical Hebrew: כְּתוּבִים, romanized: Kəṯūḇīm \"writings\") is the third and final section of the Tanakh The Ketuvim are believed to have been written under the inspiration of Ruach HaKodesh (the Holy Spirit) but with one level less authority than that of prophecy [110]\n\n\nThe five scrolls\nThe five relatively short books of Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Book of Esther are collectively known as the Hamesh Megillot These are the latest books collected and designated as authoritative in the Jewish canon even though they were not complete until the second century CE [113]\n\n\nOther books\nThe books of Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah [h] and Chronicles share a distinctive style that no other Hebrew literary text, biblical or extra-biblical, shares [114] They were not written in the normal style of Hebrew of the post-exilic period The authors of these books must have chosen to write in their own distinctive style for unknown reasons [115]\n\n\nBook order\nThe following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most current printed editions.\n\n\nSeptuagint\nThe Septuagint (\"the Translation of the Seventy\", also called \"the LXX\"), is a Koine Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible begun in the late third century BCE.\n\n\nIncorporations from Theodotion\nThe Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter Masoretic Text and in two longer Greek versions, the original Septuagint version, c. 100 BCE, and the later Theodotion version from c. second century CE Both Greek texts contain three additions to Daniel: The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children; the story of Susannah and the Elders; and the story of Bel and the Dragon Theodotion's translation was so widely copied in the Early Christian church that its version of the Book of Daniel virtually superseded the Septuagint's The priest Jerome, in his preface to Daniel (407 CE), records the rejection of the Septuagint version of that book in Christian usage: \"I .. wish to emphasize to the reader the fact that it was not according to the Septuagint version but according to the version of Theodotion himself that the churches publicly read Daniel.\" [128] Jerome's preface also mentions that the Hexapla had notations in it, indicating several major differences in content between the Theodotion Daniel and the earlier versions in Greek and Hebrew.\n\n\nFinal form\nTextual critics are now debating how to reconcile the earlier view of the Septuagint as 'careless' with content from the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran, scrolls discovered at Wadi Murabba'at, Nahal Hever, and those discovered at Masada These scrolls are 1000–1300 years older than the Leningrad text, dated to 1008 CE, which forms the basis of the Masoretic text [130] The scrolls have confirmed much of the Masoretic text, but they have also differed from it, and many of those differences agree with the Septuagint, the Samaritan Pentateuch or the Greek Old Testament instead [121]\n\n\nPseudepigraphal books\nPseudepigrapha are works whose authorship is wrongly attributed A written work can be pseudepigraphical and not be a forgery, as forgeries are intentionally deceptive With pseudepigrapha, authorship has been mistransmitted for any one of a number of reasons [132] For example, the Gospel of Barnabas claims to be written by Barnabas the companion of the Apostle Paul, but both its manuscripts date from the Middle Ages \n\n\nBook of Enoch\nNotable pseudepigraphal works include the Books of Enoch such as 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, which survives only in Old Slavonic, and 3 Enoch, surviving in Hebrew of the c. fifth century – c. sixth century CE These are ancient Jewish religious works, traditionally ascribed to the prophet Enoch, the great-grandfather of the patriarch Noah The fragment of Enoch found among the Qumran scrolls attest to it being an ancient work [134] The older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300 BCE, and the latest part (Book of Parables) was probably composed at the end of the first century BCE [135]\n\n\nChristian Bible\nA Christian Bible is a set of books divided into the Old and New Testament that a Christian denomination has, at some point in their past or present, regarded as divinely inspired scripture by the Holy Spirit [138] The Early Church primarily used the Septuagint, as it was written in Greek, the common tongue of the day, or they used the Targums among Aramaic speakers Modern English translations of the Old Testament section of the Christian Bible are based on the Masoretic Text [37] The Pauline epistles and the gospels were soon added, along with other writings, as the New Testament [139]\n\n\nOld Testament\nThe Old Testament has been important to the life of the Christian church from its earliest days Bible scholar N T Wright says \"Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures.\" [140] Wright adds that the earliest Christians searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus They regarded the \"holy writings\" of the Israelites as necessary and instructive for the Christian, as seen from Paul's words to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15), as pointing to the Messiah, and as having reached a climactic fulfilment in Jesus generating the \"new covenant\" prophesied by Jeremiah [141]\n\n\nNew Testament\nThe New Testament is the name given to the second portion of the Christian Bible While some scholars assert that Aramaic was the original language of the New Testament, [153] the majority view says it was written in the vernacular form of Koine Greek Still, there is reason to assert that it is a heavily Semitized Greek: its syntax is like conversational Greek, but its style is largely Semitic [154] [x] [y] Koine Greek was the common language of the western Roman Empire from the Conquests of Alexander the Great (335–323 BCE) until the evolution of Byzantine Greek (c. 600) while Aramaic was the language of Jesus, the Apostles and the ancient Near East [153] [z] [aa] [ab] The term \"New Testament\" came into use in the second century during a controversy over whether the Hebrew Bible should be included with the Christian writings as sacred scripture [155]\n\n\nCanon variations\nThe Peshitta (Classical Syriac: ܦܫܺܝܛܬܳܐ or ܦܫܝܼܛܬܵܐ pšīṭtā) is the standard version of the Bible for churches in the Syriac tradition The consensus within biblical scholarship, although not universal, is that the Old Testament of the Peshitta was translated into Syriac from biblical Hebrew, probably in the 2nd century CE, and that the New Testament of the Peshitta was translated from the Greek [ac] This New Testament, originally excluding certain disputed books (2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation), had become a standard by the early 5th century The five excluded books were added in the Harklean Version (616 CE) of Thomas of Harqel [ad] [153]\n\n\nPeshitta\nThe Peshitta (Classical Syriac: ܦܫܺܝܛܬܳܐ or ܦܫܝܼܛܬܵܐ pšīṭtā) is the standard version of the Bible for churches in the Syriac

standard by the early 5th century The five excluded books were added in the Harklean Version (616 CE) of Thomas of Harqel [ad] [153]\n\n\nCatholic Church canon\nThe canon of the Catholic Church was affirmed by the Council of Rome (382), the Synod of Hippo (393), the Council of Carthage (397), the Council of Carthage (419), the Council of Florence (1431–1449) and finally, as an article of faith, by the Council of Trent (1545–1563) establishing the canon consisting of 46 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in the New Testament for a total of 73 books in the Catholic Bible [170] [171] [ae]\n\n\nEthiopian Orthodox canon\nThe canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is wider than the canons used by most other Christian churches There are 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible [173] In addition to the books found in the Septuagint accepted by other Orthodox Christians, the Ethiopian Old Testament Canon uses Enoch and Jubilees (ancient Jewish books that only survived in Ge'ez, but are quoted in the New Testament), [144] Greek Ezra and the Apocalypse of Ezra, 3 books of Meqabyan, and Psalm 151 at the end of the Psalter [n] [l] The three books of Meqabyan are not to be confused with the books of Maccabees The order of the books is somewhat different in that the Ethiopian Old Testament follows the Septuagint order for the Minor Prophets rather than the Jewish order [173]\n\n\nNew Testament Apocryphal books\nThe New Testament apocrypha are a number of writings by early professed Christians that give accounts of Jesus and his teachings, the nature of God, or the teachings of his Apostles and of their activities Some of these writings were cited as Scripture by some early Christians, but since the fifth century a widespread consensus emerged limiting the New Testament to the 27 books of the modern canon [174] [175] Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Western Protestant churches do not view the New Testament apocrypha as part of the inspired Bible [175] Although some Oriental Orthodox canons to some extent have The Armenian Apostolic church at times has included the Third Epistle to the Corinthians, but does not always list it with the other 27 canonical New Testament books The New Testament of the Coptic Bible, adopted by the Egyptian Church, includes the two Epistles of Clement [176]\n\n\nTextual history\nThe original autographs, that is, the original Greek writings and manuscripts written by the original authors of the New Testament, have not survived [177] But, historically, copies of those original autographs exist and were transmitted and preserved in a number of manuscript traditions The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the Alexandrian text-type (generally minimalist), the Byzantine text-type (generally maximalist), and the Western text-type (occasionally wild) Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts Very early on, Christianity replaced scrolls with codexes, the forerunner of bound books, and by the 3rd century, collections of biblical books began being copied as a set [178]\n\n\nInfluence\nWith a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible is one of the most influential works ever written From practices of personal hygiene to philosophy and ethics, the Bible has directly and indirectly influenced politics and law, war and peace, sexual morals, marriage and family life, letters and learning, the arts, economics, social justice, medical care and more [180]\n\n\nPolitics and law\nThe Bible has been used to support and oppose political power It has inspired revolution and \"a reversal of power\" because God is so often portrayed as choosing what is \"weak and humble...(the stammering Moses, the infant Samuel, Saul from an insignificant family, David confronting Goliath, etc.)....to confound the mighty\" [186] [187] Biblical texts have been the catalyst for political concepts like democracy, religious toleration and religious freedom [188]: 3  These have, in turn, inspired movements ranging from abolitionism in the 18th and 19th century, to the civil rights movement, the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and liberation theology in Latin America The Bible has been the source of many peace movements and efforts at reconciliation around the world  [189]\n\n\nSocial responsibility\nThe philosophical foundation of human rights is in the Bible's teachings of natural law [195] [196] The prophets of the Hebrew Bible repeatedly admonish the people to practice justice, charity, and social responsibility H A Lockton writes that \"The Poverty and Justice Bible (The Bible Society (UK), 2008) claims there are more than 2000 verses in the Bible dealing with the justice issues of rich-poor relations, exploitation and oppression\" [197] Judaism practised charity and healing the sick but tended to limit these practices to their own people [198] For Christians, the Old Testament statements are enhanced by multiple verses such as Matthew 10:8, Luke 10:9 and 9:2, and Acts 5:16 that say \"heal the sick\" Authors Vern and Bonnie Bullough write in The care of the sick: the emergence of modern nursing, that this is seen as an aspect of following Jesus's example, since so much of his public ministry focused on healing [198]\n\n\nLiterature and the arts\nThe Bible has directly and indirectly influenced literature: St Augustine's Confessions is widely considered the first autobiography in Western Literature [209] The Summa Theologica, written 1265–1274, is \"one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature.\" [210] These both influenced the writings of Dante's epic poetry and his Divine Comedy, and in turn, Dante's creation and sacramental theology has contributed to influencing writers such as J R R Tolkien [211] and William Shakespeare [212]\n\n\nCriticism\nCritics view certain biblical texts to be morally problematic The Bible neither calls for nor condemns slavery outright, but there are verses that address dealing with it, and these verses have been used to support it Some have written that supersessionism begins in the book of Hebrews where others locate its beginnings in the culture of the fourth century Roman empire [2]: 1  The Bible has been used to support the death penalty, patriarchy, sexual intolerance, the violence of total war, and colonialism.\n\n\nInterpretation and inspiration\nBiblical texts have always required interpretation, and this has given rise to multiple views and approaches according to the interplay between various religions and the book [228]\n\n\nReligious significance\n\nBoth Judaism and Christianity see the Bible as religiously and intellectually significant [247] It provides insight into its time and into the composition of the texts, and it represents an important step in the development of thought [247] It is used in communal worship, recited and memorized, provides personal guidance, a basis for counseling, church doctrine, religious culture (teaching, hymns and worship), and ethical standards [247] [248]: 145 \n\nVersions and translations\nThe original texts of the Tanakh were almost entirely written in Hebrew with about one per cent in Aramaic The earliest translation of any Bible text is the Septuagint which translated the Hebrew into Greek [36] As the first translation of any biblical literature, the translation that became the Septuagint was an unparalleled event in the ancient world [259] This translation was made possible by a common Mediterranean culture where Semitism had been foundational to Greek culture [260] In the Talmud, Greek is the only language officially allowed for translation [122] The Targum Onkelos is the Aramaic translation of the Hebrew Bible believed to have been written in the second century CE [36] These texts attracted the work of various scholars, but a standardized text was not available before the 9th century [36]\n\n\nArchaeological and historical research\nBiblical archaeology is a subsection of archaeology that relates to and sheds light upon the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament [275] It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times [276] There are a wide range of interpretations in the field of biblical archaeology [277] One broad division includes biblical maximalism, which generally takes the view that most of the Old Testament or the Hebrew Bible is based on history although it is presented through the religious viewpoint of its time According to historian Lester L Grabbe, there are \"few, if any\" maximalists in mainstream scholarship [278] It is considered to be the extreme opposite of biblical minimalism which considers the Bible to be a purely post-exilic (5th century BCE and later) composition [279] According to Mary-Joan Leith, professor of religious studies, many minimalists have ignored evidence for the antiquity of the Hebrew language in the Bible, and few take archaeological evidence into consideration [280] Most biblical scholars and archaeologists fall somewhere on a spectrum between these two [281] [278]\n\n\nBiblical criticism\nBiblical criticism refers to the analytical investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as history, authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention It is not the same as criticism of the Bible, which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance, nor is it criticism of possible translation errors [291]\n\n\nBible museums\nThe grandest medieval Bibles were illuminated manuscripts in which the text is supplemented by the addition of decoration, such as decorated initials, borders (marginalia) and miniature illustrations Up to the 12th century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a commission from a wealthy patron Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the monks who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a scriptorium, where \"separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk.\" [308] By the 14th century, the cloisters of monks writing in the scriptorium started to employ laybrothers from the urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands [309]\nDemand for manuscripts grew to an extent that the Monastic libraries were unable to meet with the demand, and began employing secular scribes and illuminators [310] These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in certain instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day [311] A notable example of an illuminated manuscript is the Book of Kells, produced circa the year 800 containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables.\n\n\nIllustrations\nThe grandest medieval Bibles were illuminated manuscripts in which the text is supplemented by the addition of decoration, such as

January 1978, Bruce Campbell was a college dropout who had just quit his job as a taxicab driver Sam Raimi was studying literature at Michigan State University with Robert Tapert, who was finishing his economics degree While putting the finishing touches on It's Murder!, Tapert suggested doing a feature-length film to Raimi Raimi felt it impossible, stating that they could never acquire the funding Campbell declared: \"I could always move back home.\" Tapert feared a career in fisheries/wildlife, while Raimi was afraid that he would have to go back to work at his dad's home furnishing store These were the practical reasons that convinced the three to put forth a feature-length film [27] The three were big fans of the comedy genre, but they decided not to produce a comedy as they felt \"a feature-length yuck fest just didn't compute\" A well-noted scene from It's Murder moved Raimi to write the short film Clockwork The three felt the result was very effective and represented a new direction that their films could take, that of a semi-successful horror film [28]\n\n\nFinancing\nFilming was first commissioned for the summer of 1979 in Michigan In order to organize the budget, Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell bought a few \"how to make an independent film\" guide publications The budget was originally to be $150,000, while shooting with a Super 8 camera However, due to technical difficulties, it was decided to move it up to 16 mm format, as they wanted to film the project in the style of the many low-budget films at the time that had come out in the 1970s [32] Since they had little experience in the film industry, the three felt they should buy business suits and briefcases as a means to convince investors that they \"had all the answers.\" A man named Andy Grainger, who was a friend of Tapert and owner of a series of movie theaters, was the first primary investor He stated: \"Fellas, no matter what, just keep the blood running.\" As a tribute to him, there's a scene in the finished film where an old film projector whirs to life and \"projects\" blood running down the screen [33]\n\n\nMain cast and characters\nThere have been multiple Evil

concept and acquire funding from producers and studios for a feature-length film The short was a meager success Despite this, the release proceeded to spawn the entire franchise.\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn January 1978, Bruce Campbell was a college dropout who had just quit his job as a taxicab driver Sam Raimi was studying literature at Michigan State University with Robert Tapert, who was finishing his economics degree While putting the finishing touches on It's Murder!, Tapert suggested doing a feature-length film to Raimi Raimi felt it impossible, stating that they could never acquire the funding Campbell declared: \"I could always move back home.\" Tapert feared a career in fisheries/wildlife, while Raimi was afraid that he would have to go back to work at his dad's home furnishing store These were the practical reasons that convinced the three to put forth a feature-length film [27] The three were big fans of the comedy genre, but they decided not to produce a comedy as they felt \"a feature-length yuck fest just didn't compute\" A well-noted scene from It's Murder moved Raimi to write the short film Clockwork The three felt the result was very effective and represented a new direction that their films could take, that of a semi-successful horror film [28]\n\n\nFinancing\nFilming was first commissioned for the summer of 1979 in Michigan In order to organize the budget, Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell bought a few \"how to make an independent film\" guide publications The budget was originally to be $150,000, while shooting with a Super 8 camera However, due to technical difficulties, it was decided to move it up to 16 mm format, as they wanted to film the project in the style of the many low-budget films at the time that had come out in the 1970s [32] Since they had little experience in the film industry, the three felt they should buy business suits and briefcases as a means to convince investors that they \"had all the answers.\" A man named Andy Grainger, who was a friend of Tapert and owner of a series of movie theaters, was the first primary investor He stated: \"Fellas, no matter what, just keep the blood running.\" As a tribute to him, there's a scene in the finished film where an old film projector whirs to life and \"projects\" blood running down the screen [33]\n\n\nMain cast and characters\nThere have been multiple Evil

Born on October 10, 1992, in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada, Leclerc spent his early years exploring the mountains and developing a passion for climbing.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMarc-André Leclerc was born to Michelle Kuipers and Serge Leclerc. His grandfather, a mountaineer himself, introduced Leclerc to climbing at a young age by gifting him Chris Bonington's book, \"Quest for Adventure,\" when Leclerc was eight years old. This early exposure sparked Leclerc's interest in climbing, and he quickly began to explore the sport on his own. At the age of nine, Leclerc had his first climbing experience on an indoor climbing wall in Coquitlam, and later that year, he joined a gym in Abbotsford called Project Climbing.\n\nIn 2005, Leclerc's family moved to Agassiz, near the Cascade Range peaks, where he began teaching himself how to mountain climb. Leclerc would often ride his bike out to Harrison Bluffs, a rock climbing area in British Columbia, to climb and spend the night alone. At the age of 15, his mother bought him a copy of \"Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills,\" which inspired him to join the British Columbia Mountaineering Club.

In 2015, he spent a significant amount of time in southern Argentine Patagonia, where he completed his first solo ascent of \"The Corkscrew\" (5.10d A1) on Cerro Torre on February 21.

Brilliant Pebbles, where weapons were to be staged in low orbits to intercept ballistic missiles at short notice The potential for low-latency communication was also recognized and development offshoots in the 1990s led to numerous commercial megaconstellations using around 100 satellites such as Celestri, Teledesic, Iridium, and Globalstar However all entities entered bankruptcy by the dot-com bubble burst, due in part to excessive launch costs at the time [20] [21]\n\n\nBackground\nConstellations of low Earth orbit satellites were first conceptualized in the mid-1980s as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative, culminating in Brilliant Pebbles, where weapons were to be staged in low orbits to intercept ballistic missiles at short notice The potential for low-latency communication was also recognized and development offshoots in the 1990s led to numerous commercial megaconstellations using around 100 satellites such as Celestri, Teledesic, Iridium, and Globalstar However all entities entered bankruptcy by the dot-com bubble burst, due in part to excessive launch costs at the time [20] [21]\n\n\nDesign phase (2015–2016)\nStarlink was publicly announced in January 2015 with the opening of the SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington During the opening, Musk stated there is still significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilities [31] [32] and that Starlink would target bandwidth to carry up to 50% of all backhaul communications traffic, and up to 10% of local Internet traffic, in high-density cities [33] [34] Musk further stated that the positive cash flow from selling satellite internet services would be necessary to fund their Mars plans [35] Furthermore, SpaceX has long-term plans to develop and deploy a version of the satellite communication system to serve Mars [36]\n\n\nStart of development phase (2016–2019)\nIn November 2016, SpaceX filed an application with the FCC for a \"non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite system in the fixed-satellite service using the Ku- and Ka- frequency bands\" [42]\n\n\nFirst launches (2019–2020)\nAfter launching two test satellites in February 2018, the first batch of 60 operational Starlink satellites were launched in May 2019 [48]\n\n\nCommercial service (2021–present)\nPre-orders were first opened to the public in the United States and Canada in early 2021 [53]\n\n\nSubscribers\nThe number of customers [a] of Starlink worldwide has reached 4 million as of September 2024 [9]\n\n\nServices\nStarlink provides satellite-based internet connectivity to underserved areas of the planet, as well as competitively priced service in more urbanized areas [90]\n\n\nSatellite internet\nStarlink provides satellite-based internet connectivity to underserved areas of the planet, as well as competitively priced service in more urbanized areas [90]\n\n\nSatellite cellular service\nFor future service, T-Mobile US and SpaceX are partnering to add satellite cellular service capability to Starlink satellites It will provide dead-zone cell phone coverage across the US using the existing midband PCS spectrum owned by T-Mobile [105] [106] Cell coverage will begin with text messaging and expand to include voice and limited data services later, with testing to begin in 2024 [107] T-Mobile plans to connect to Starlink satellites via existing 4G LTE mobile devices, unlike previous generations of satellite phones, which used specialized radios, modems, and antennas to connect to satellites in higher orbits [5] Bandwidth will be limited to 2 to 4 megabits per second total, split across a very large cell coverage area, which would be limited to thousands of voice calls or millions of text messages simultaneously in a coverage area The size of a single coverage cell has not yet been publicly released [105]\n\n\nMilitary applications\nSpaceX also designs, builds, and launches customized military satellites based on variants of the Starlink satellite bus, with the largest publicly known customer being the Space Development Agency (SDA).\n\n\nStarshield\nIn December 2022, SpaceX announced Starshield, a separate Starlink service designed for government entities and military agencies [124] [14] [15] [125] Starshield enables the U.S Department of Defense (DoD) to own or lease Starshield satellites for partners and allies [124] Cybernews remarked that Starshield was first announced in late 2022, when Starlink's presence in Ukraine showed the importance it can have in modern warfare [126] While Starlink had not been adapted for military use, Starshield has the usual requirements for mobile military systems like encryption and anti-jam capabilities [125] Elon Musk stated that \"Starlink needs to be a civilian network, not a participant to combat Starshield will be owned by the US government and controlled by DoD Space Force This is the right order of things.\" [127]\n\n\nMilitary communications\nIn 2019, tests by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) demonstrated a 610 Mbit/s data link through Starlink to a Beechcraft C-12 Huron aircraft in flight [136] Additionally, in late 2019, the United States Air Force successfully tested a connection with Starlink on an AC-130 Gunship [137]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nStarlink was activated during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, after a request from the Ukrainian government [146] [147] Ukraine's military and government rapidly became dependent on Starlink to maintain Internet access [148] [149] [139] Starlink is used by Ukraine for communication, such as keeping in touch with the outside world and keeping the energy infrastructure working [150] [151]\n\n\nIsrael–Hamas War\nIn October 2023 after the Israel–Hamas conflict started, users shared the hashtag #starlinkforgaza on Elon Musk's social network X (formerly Twitter), demanding he activate Starlink in Gaza after Internet service in the region was lost [158] Musk answered that Starlink connectivity would be provided for aid groups in Gaza [159] At the end of November, Musk said the Starlink service would only be provided for Gaza with the approval of the government of Israel [160]\n\n\nIran\nIn 2022, the U.S State Department and U.S Treasury Department updated rules regarding export of technology to Iran, allowing Starlink to be exported to Iran in support of the Iranian protests against compulsory hijab, which had triggered extensive government censorship [161] Immediately afterwards, Starlink service was activated in Iran [162] In 2023, the Iranian government filed a complaint with the ITU against SpaceX for unauthorized Starlink operation in Iran [163] In October 2023 and March 2024, the ITU ruled in favor of Iran, dismissing a SpaceX assertion that it should not be expected to verify the location of every terminal connecting to its satellites [163] Iran claimed that SpaceX was capable of determining their user terminal locations by citing a tweet from Musk saying there were 100 Starlink terminals operating within Iran [163] [164]\n\n\nInternet availability and regulatory approval by country\nIn order to offer satellite services in any nation-state, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) regulations and long-standing international treaties require that landing rights be granted by each country jurisdiction, and within a country, by the national communications regulators As a result, even though the Starlink network has near-global reach at latitudes below approximately 60°, broadband services can only be provided in 40 countries as of September 2022 [165] SpaceX can also have business operation and economic considerations that may make a difference in which countries Starlink service is offered, in which order, and how soon For example, SpaceX formally requested authorization for Canada only in June 2020, [166] the Canadian regulatory authority approved it in November 2020, [167] and SpaceX rolled out service two months later, in January 2021 [168] As of September 2022, Starlink services were on offer in 40 countries, [165] with applications pending regulatory approval in many more [169]\n\n\nTechnology\nThe internet communication satellites were expected to be smallsats, 100 to 500 kg (220 to 1,100 lb) in mass, and were intended to be in low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of approximately 1,100 km (680 mi), according to early public releases of information in 2015 The first significant deployment of 60 satellites was in May 2019, with each satellite weighing 227 kg (500 lb) [48] SpaceX decided to place the satellites at a relatively low 550 km (340 mi) due to concerns associated with space debris from failures or low fuel in the space environment, as well as letting them use fewer satellites than what was initially needed [304] Initial plans as of January 2015 [update] were for the constellation to be made up of approximately 4,000 cross-linked [305] satellites, more than twice as many operational satellites as were in orbit in January 2015 [34]\n\n\nSatellite hardware\nThe internet communication satellites were expected to be smallsats, 100 to 500 kg (220 to 1,100 lb) in mass, and were intended to be in low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of approximately 1,100 km (680 mi), according to early public

were in orbit in January 2015 [34]\n\n\nUser terminals\nThe system does not directly connect from its satellites to handsets (like the constellations from Iridium, Globalstar, Thuraya and Inmarsat) Instead, it is linked to flat user terminals the size of a pizza box, which have phased array antennas and track the satellites The terminals can be mounted anywhere, as long as they can see the sky [305] This includes fast-moving objects like trains [320] Photographs of the customer antennas were first seen on the internet in June 2020, supporting earlier statements by SpaceX CEO Musk that the terminals would look like a \"UFO on a stick Starlink Terminal has motors to self-adjust optimal angle to view sky\" [321] The antenna is known internally as \"Dishy McFlatface\" [322] [323]\n\n\nGround stations\nSpaceX has made applications to the FCC for at least 32 ground stations in United States, and as of July 2020 [update] has approvals for five of them (in five states) Until February 2023, Starlink used the Ka-band to connect with ground stations [329] With the launch of v2 Mini, frequencies were added in the 71–86 GHz W band (or E band waveguide) range [330]\n\n\nSatellite revisions\nMicroSat-1a and MicroSat-1b were originally slated to be launched into 625 km (388 mi) circular orbits at approximately 86.4° inclination, and to include panchromatic video imager cameras to film images of Earth and the satellite [333] The two satellites, \"MicroSat-1a\" and \"MicroSat-1b\" were meant to be launched together as secondary payloads on one of the Iridium NEXT flights, but they were instead used for ground-based tests [334]\n\n\nMicroSat\nMicroSat-1a and MicroSat-1b were originally slated to be launched into 625 km (388 mi) circular orbits at approximately 86.4° inclination, and to include panchromatic video imager cameras to film images of Earth and the satellite [333] The two satellites, \"MicroSat-1a\" and \"MicroSat-1b\" were meant to be launched together as secondary payloads on one of the Iridium NEXT flights, but they were instead used for ground-based tests [334]\n\n\nTintin\nAt the time of the June 2015 announcement, SpaceX had stated plans to launch the first two demonstration satellites in 2016, [335] but the target date was subsequently moved out to 2018 [336] SpaceX began flight testing their satellite technologies in 2018 [336] with the launch of two test satellites The two identical satellites were called MicroSat-2a and MicroSat-2b [337] during development but were renamed Tintin A and Tintin B upon orbital deployment on February 22, 2018 The satellites were launched by a Falcon 9 rocket, and they were piggy-pack payloads launching with the Paz satellite.\n\n\nv0.9 (test)\nThe 60 Starlink v0.9 satellites, launched in May 2019, had the following characteristics: [48]\n\n\nv1.0 (operational)\nThe Starlink v1.0 satellites, launched since November 2019, have the following additional characteristics: [citation needed]\n\n\nv1.5 (operational)\nThe Starlink v1.5 satellites, launched since January 24, 2021, have the following additional characteristics:\n\n\nStarshield (operational)\nThese are satellites buses with two solar arrays derived from Starlink v1.5 and v2.0 for military use and can host classified government or military payloads [352]\n\n\nv2 (initial deployment)\nSpaceX was preparing for the production of Starlink v2 satellites by early 2021 [353] According to Musk, Starlink v2 satellites will be \"…an order of magnitude better than Starlink 1\" in terms of communications bandwidth [354]\n\n\nLaunches\nBetween February 2018 and May 2024, SpaceX successfully launched over 6,000 Starlink satellites into orbit, including prototypes and satellites that later failed or were de-orbited before entering operational service [7] In March 2020, SpaceX reported producing six satellites per day [365]\n\n\nConstellation design and status\nIn March 2017, SpaceX filed plans with the FCC to field a second orbital shell of more than 7,500 \"V-band satellites in non-geosynchronous orbits to provide communications services\" in an electromagnetic spectrum that has not previously been heavily employed for commercial communications services Called the \"Very-low Earth orbit (VLEO) constellation\", [370] it was to have comprised 7,518 satellites that were to orbit at just 340 km (210 mi) altitude, [371] while the smaller, originally planned group of 4,425 satellites would operate in the Ka- and Ku-bands and orbit at 1,200 km (750 mi) altitude [370] [371] By 2022, SpaceX had withdrawn plans to field the 7,518-satellite V-band system, superseding it with a more comprehensive design for a second-generation (Gen2) Starlink network [66]\n\n\nFirst generation\nThe chart below contains all v0.9 and first generation satellites (Tintin A and Tintin B, as test satellites, are not included).\n\n\nSecond Generation\nWith the unknown of when Starship will be able to launch the second generation satellites, SpaceX modified the original V2 blueprint into a smaller, more compact one named \"v2 mini\" This adjustment allowed Falcon 9 to transport these satellites, though not as many, into orbit [405] The first set of 21 of these satellites was launched on February 27, 2023 SpaceX committed to reducing debris by keeping the Starlink tension rods, which hold the V2 mini-satellites together, attached to the Falcon 9 second stage These tension rods were discarded into orbit while launching earlier versions of Starlink satellites [406]  [full citation needed] Observations confirm these V2 mini-satellites host two solar panels like the Starship V2 satellites [407]\n\n\nImpact on astronomy\nThe planned large number of satellites has been met with criticism from the astronomical community because of concerns over light pollution [410] [411] [412] Astronomers claim that their brightness in both optical and radio wavelengths will severely impact scientific observations While astronomers can schedule observations to avoid pointing where satellites currently orbit, it is \"getting more difficult\" as more satellites come online [413] The International Astronomical Union (IAU), National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and Square Kilometre Array Organization (SKAO) have released official statements expressing concern on the matter Recent studies have proved that the \"unintended electromagnetic radiation\" affects radio telescopes creating distortions and excessive noise and the IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference was created to manage these new man made obstacles to space exploration [414] [415] [416] [417]\n\n\nVisible Optical interference\nOn November 20, 2019, the four-meter (13') Blanco telescope of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) recorded strong signal loss [clarification needed] and the appearance of 19 white lines on a DECam shot (right image) This image noise was correlated to the transit of a Starlink satellite train, launched a week earlier [418]\n\n\nRadio interference\nIn October 2023, research published in \"Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters\" had reportedly found that Starlink satellites were \"leaking radio signals\" finding that at the site of the future Square Kilometer Array, radio emissions from Starlink satellites were brighter than any natural source in the sky [436] The paper concluded that these emissions will be \"detrimental to key SKA science goals without future mitigation\" [437] [417]\n\n\nIncreased risk of satellite collision\nThe large number of satellites employed by Starlink may create the long-term danger of space debris resulting from placing thousands of satellites in orbit and the risk of causing a satellite collision, potentially triggering a cascade phenomenon known as Kessler syndrome [438] [439] SpaceX has said that most of the satellites are launched at a lower altitude, and failed satellites are expected to deorbit within five years without propulsion [440] [441]\n\n\nCompetition and market effects\nIn addition to the OneWeb constellation, announced nearly concurrently with the SpaceX constellation, a 2015 proposal from Samsung outlined a 4,600-satellite constellation orbiting at 1,400 km (870 mi) that could provide a zettabyte per month capacity worldwide, an equivalent of 200 gigabytes per month for 5 billion users of Internet data, [448] [449] but by 2020, no more public information had been released about the Samsung constellation Telesat announced a smaller 117 satellite constellation in 2015 with plans to deliver initial service in 2021 [450] Amazon announced a large broadband internet satellite constellation in April 2019, planning to launch 3,236 satellites in the next decade in what the company calls \"Project Kuiper\", a satellite constellation that will work in concert [451] with Amazon's previously announced large network of twelve satellite ground station facilities (the \"AWS ground station unit\") announced in November 2018 [452]\n\n\nSimilar or competitive

services would be necessary to fund their Mars plans [35] Furthermore, SpaceX has long-term plans to develop and deploy a version of the satellite communication system to serve Mars [36]\n\n\nStart of development phase (2016–2019)\nIn November 2016, SpaceX filed an application with the FCC for a \"non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite system in the fixed-satellite service using the Ku- and Ka- frequency bands\" [42]\n\n\nFirst launches (2019–2020)\nAfter launching two test satellites in February 2018, the first batch of 60 operational Starlink satellites were launched in May 2019 [48]\n\n\nCommercial service (2021–present)\nPre-orders were first opened to the public in the United States and Canada in early 2021 [53]\n\n\nSubscribers\nThe number of customers [a] of Starlink worldwide has reached 4 million as of September 2024 [9]\n\n\nServices\nStarlink provides satellite-based internet connectivity to underserved areas of the planet, as well as competitively priced service in more urbanized areas [90]\n\n\nSatellite internet\nStarlink provides satellite-based internet connectivity to underserved areas of the planet, as well as competitively priced service in more urbanized areas [90]\n\n\nSatellite cellular service\nFor future service, T-Mobile US and SpaceX are partnering to add satellite cellular service capability to Starlink satellites It will provide dead-zone cell phone coverage across the US using the existing midband PCS spectrum owned by T-Mobile [105] [106] Cell coverage will begin with text messaging and expand to include voice and limited data services later, with testing to begin in 2024 [107] T-Mobile plans to connect to Starlink satellites via existing 4G LTE mobile devices, unlike previous generations of satellite phones, which used specialized radios, modems, and antennas to connect to satellites in higher orbits [5] Bandwidth will be limited to 2 to 4 megabits per second total, split across a very large cell coverage area, which would be limited to thousands of voice calls or millions of text messages simultaneously in a coverage area The size of a single coverage cell has not yet been publicly released [105]\n\n\nMilitary applications\nSpaceX also designs, builds, and launches customized military satellites based on variants of the Starlink satellite bus, with the largest publicly known customer being the Space Development Agency (SDA).\n\n\nStarshield\nIn December 2022, SpaceX announced Starshield, a separate Starlink service designed for government entities and military agencies [124] [14] [15] [125] Starshield enables the U.S Department of Defense (DoD) to own or lease Starshield satellites for partners and allies [124] Cybernews remarked that Starshield was first announced in late 2022, when Starlink's presence in Ukraine showed the importance it can have in modern warfare [126] While Starlink had not been adapted for military use, Starshield has the usual requirements for mobile military systems like encryption and anti-jam capabilities [125] Elon Musk stated that \"Starlink needs to be a civilian network, not a participant to combat Starshield will be owned by the US government and controlled by DoD Space Force This is the right order of things.\" [127]\n\n\nMilitary communications\nIn 2019, tests by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) demonstrated a 610 Mbit/s data link through Starlink to a Beechcraft C-12 Huron aircraft in flight [136] Additionally, in late 2019, the United States Air Force successfully tested a connection with Starlink on an AC-130 Gunship [137]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nStarlink was activated during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, after a request from the Ukrainian government [146] [147] Ukraine's military and government rapidly became dependent on Starlink to maintain Internet access [148] [149] [139] Starlink is used by Ukraine for communication, such as keeping in touch with the outside world and keeping the energy infrastructure working [150] [151]\n\n\nIsrael–Hamas War\nIn October 2023 after the Israel–Hamas conflict started, users shared the hashtag #starlinkforgaza on Elon Musk's social network X (formerly Twitter), demanding he activate Starlink in Gaza after Internet service in the region was lost [158] Musk answered that Starlink connectivity would be provided for aid groups in Gaza [159] At the end of November, Musk said the Starlink service would only be provided for Gaza with the approval of the government of Israel [160]\n\n\nIran\nIn 2022, the U.S State Department and U.S Treasury Department updated rules regarding export of technology to Iran, allowing Starlink to be exported to Iran in support of the Iranian protests against compulsory hijab, which had triggered extensive government censorship [161] Immediately afterwards, Starlink service was activated in Iran [162] In 2023, the Iranian government filed a complaint with the ITU against SpaceX for unauthorized Starlink operation in Iran [163] In October 2023 and March 2024, the ITU ruled in favor of Iran, dismissing a SpaceX assertion that it should not be expected to verify the location of every terminal connecting to its satellites [163] Iran claimed that SpaceX was capable of determining their user terminal locations by citing a tweet from Musk saying there were 100 Starlink terminals operating within Iran [163] [164]\n\n\nInternet availability and regulatory approval by country\nIn order to offer satellite services in any nation-state, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) regulations and long-standing international treaties require that landing rights be granted by each country jurisdiction, and within a country, by the national communications regulators As a result, even though the Starlink network has near-global reach at latitudes below approximately 60°, broadband services can only be provided in 40 countries as of September 2022 [165] SpaceX can also have business operation and economic considerations that may make a difference in which countries Starlink service is offered, in which order, and how soon For example, SpaceX formally requested authorization for Canada only in June 2020, [166] the Canadian regulatory authority approved it in November 2020, [167] and SpaceX rolled out service two months later, in January 2021 [168] As of September 2022, Starlink services were on offer in 40 countries, [165] with applications pending regulatory approval in many more [169]\n\n\nTechnology\nThe internet communication satellites were expected to be smallsats, 100 to 500 kg (220 to 1,100 lb) in mass, and were intended to be in low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of approximately 1,100 km (680 mi), according to early public releases of information in 2015 The first significant deployment of 60 satellites was in May 2019, with each satellite weighing 227 kg (500 lb) [48] SpaceX decided to place the satellites at a relatively low 550 km (340 mi) due to concerns associated with space debris from failures or low fuel in the space environment, as well as letting them use fewer satellites than what was initially needed [304] Initial plans as of January 2015 [update] were for the constellation to be made up of approximately 4,000 cross-linked [305] satellites, more than twice as many operational satellites as were in orbit in January 2015 [34]\n\n\nSatellite hardware\nThe internet communication satellites were expected to be smallsats, 100 to 500 kg (220 to 1,100 lb) in mass, and were intended to be in low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of approximately 1,100 km (680 mi), according to early public releases of information in 2015 The first significant deployment of 60 satellites was in May 2019, with each satellite weighing 227 kg (500 lb) [48] SpaceX decided to place the satellites at a relatively low 550 km (340 mi) due to concerns associated with space debris from failures or low fuel in the

4,000 cross-linked [305] satellites, more than twice as many operational satellites as were in orbit in January 2015 [34]\n\n\nUser terminals\nThe system does not directly connect from its satellites to handsets (like the constellations from Iridium, Globalstar, Thuraya and Inmarsat) Instead, it is linked to flat user terminals the size of a pizza box, which have phased array antennas and track the satellites The terminals can be mounted anywhere, as long as they can see the sky [305] This includes fast-moving objects like trains [320] Photographs of the customer antennas were first seen on the internet in June 2020, supporting earlier statements by SpaceX CEO Musk that the terminals would look like a \"UFO on a stick Starlink Terminal has motors to self-adjust optimal angle to view sky\" [321] The antenna is known internally as \"Dishy McFlatface\" [322] [323]\n\n\nGround stations\nSpaceX has made applications to the FCC for at least 32 ground stations in United States, and as of July 2020 [update] has approvals for five of them (in five states) Until February 2023, Starlink used the Ka-band to connect with ground stations [329] With the launch of v2 Mini, frequencies were added in the 71–86 GHz W band (or E band waveguide) range [330]\n\n\nSatellite revisions\nMicroSat-1a and MicroSat-1b were originally slated to be launched into 625 km (388 mi) circular orbits at approximately 86.4° inclination, and to include panchromatic video imager cameras to film images of Earth and the satellite [333] The two satellites, \"MicroSat-1a\" and \"MicroSat-1b\" were meant to be launched together as secondary payloads on one of the Iridium NEXT flights, but they were instead used for ground-based tests [334]\n\n\nMicroSat\nMicroSat-1a and MicroSat-1b were originally slated to be launched into 625 km (388 mi) circular orbits at approximately 86.4° inclination, and to include panchromatic video imager cameras to film images of Earth and the satellite [333] The two satellites, \"MicroSat-1a\" and \"MicroSat-1b\" were meant to be launched together as secondary payloads on one of the Iridium NEXT flights, but they were instead used for ground-based tests [334]\n\n\nTintin\nAt the time of the June 2015 announcement, SpaceX had stated plans to launch the first two demonstration satellites in 2016, [335] but the target date was subsequently moved out to 2018 [336] SpaceX began flight testing their satellite technologies in 2018 [336] with the launch of two test satellites The two identical satellites were called MicroSat-2a and MicroSat-2b [337] during development but were renamed Tintin A and Tintin B upon orbital deployment on February 22, 2018 The satellites were launched by a Falcon 9 rocket, and they were piggy-pack payloads launching with the Paz satellite.\n\n\nv0.9 (test)\nThe 60 Starlink v0.9 satellites, launched in May 2019, had the following characteristics: [48]\n\n\nv1.0 (operational)\nThe Starlink v1.0 satellites, launched since November 2019, have the following additional characteristics: [citation needed]\n\n\nv1.5 (operational)\nThe Starlink v1.5 satellites, launched since January 24, 2021, have the following additional characteristics:\n\n\nStarshield (operational)\nThese are satellites buses with two solar arrays derived from Starlink v1.5 and v2.0 for military use and can host classified government or military payloads [352]\n\n\nv2 (initial deployment)\nSpaceX was preparing for the production of Starlink v2 satellites by early 2021 [353] According to Musk, Starlink v2 satellites will be \"…an order of magnitude better than Starlink 1\" in terms of communications bandwidth [354]\n\n\nLaunches\nBetween February 2018 and May 2024, SpaceX successfully launched over 6,000 Starlink satellites into orbit, including prototypes and satellites that later failed or were de-orbited before entering operational service [7] In March 2020, SpaceX reported producing six satellites per day [365]\n\n\nConstellation design and status\nIn March 2017, SpaceX filed plans with the FCC to field a second orbital shell of more than 7,500 \"V-band satellites in non-geosynchronous orbits to provide communications services\" in an electromagnetic spectrum that has not previously been heavily employed for commercial communications services Called the \"Very-low Earth orbit (VLEO) constellation\", [370] it was to have comprised 7,518 satellites that were to orbit at just 340 km (210 mi) altitude, [371] while the smaller, originally planned group of 4,425 satellites would operate in the Ka- and Ku-bands and orbit at 1,200 km (750 mi) altitude [370] [371] By 2022, SpaceX had withdrawn plans to field the 7,518-satellite V-band system, superseding it with a more comprehensive design for a second-generation (Gen2) Starlink network [66]\n\n\nFirst generation\nThe chart below contains all v0.9 and first generation satellites (Tintin A and Tintin B, as test satellites, are not included).\n\n\nSecond Generation\nWith the unknown of when Starship will be able to launch the second generation satellites, SpaceX modified the original V2 blueprint into a smaller, more compact one named \"v2 mini\" This adjustment allowed Falcon 9 to transport these satellites, though not as many, into orbit [405] The first set of 21 of these satellites was launched on February 27, 2023 SpaceX committed to reducing debris by keeping the Starlink tension rods, which hold the V2 mini-satellites together, attached to the Falcon 9 second stage These tension rods were discarded into orbit while launching earlier versions of Starlink satellites [406]  [full citation needed] Observations confirm these V2 mini-satellites host two solar panels like the Starship V2 satellites [407]\n\n\nImpact on astronomy\nThe planned large number of satellites has been met with criticism from the astronomical community because of concerns over light pollution [410] [411] [412] Astronomers claim that their brightness in both optical and radio wavelengths will severely impact scientific observations While astronomers can schedule observations to avoid pointing where satellites currently orbit, it is \"getting more difficult\" as more satellites come online [413] The International Astronomical Union (IAU), National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and Square Kilometre Array Organization (SKAO) have released official statements expressing concern on the matter Recent studies have proved that the \"unintended electromagnetic radiation\" affects radio telescopes creating distortions and excessive noise and the IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference was created to manage these new man made obstacles to space exploration [414] [415] [416] [417]\n\n\nVisible Optical interference\nOn November 20, 2019, the four-meter (13') Blanco telescope of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) recorded strong signal loss [clarification needed] and the appearance of 19 white lines on a DECam shot (right image) This image noise was correlated to the transit of a Starlink satellite train, launched a week earlier [418]\n\n\nRadio interference\nIn October 2023, research published in \"Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters\" had reportedly found that Starlink satellites were \"leaking radio signals\" finding that at the site of the future Square Kilometer Array, radio emissions from Starlink satellites were brighter than any natural source in the sky [436] The paper concluded that these emissions will be \"detrimental to key SKA science goals without future mitigation\" [437] [417]\n\n\nIncreased risk of satellite collision\nThe large number of satellites employed by Starlink may create the long-term danger of space debris resulting from placing thousands of satellites in orbit and the risk of causing a satellite collision, potentially triggering a cascade phenomenon known as Kessler syndrome [438] [439] SpaceX has said that most of the satellites are launched at a lower altitude, and failed satellites are expected to deorbit within five years without propulsion [440] [441]\n\n\nCompetition and market effects\nIn addition to the OneWeb constellation, announced nearly concurrently with the SpaceX constellation, a 2015 proposal from Samsung outlined a 4,600-satellite constellation orbiting at 1,400 km (870 mi) that could provide a zettabyte per month capacity worldwide, an equivalent of 200 gigabytes per month for 5 billion users of Internet data, [448] [449] but by 2020, no more public information had been released about the Samsung constellation Telesat announced a smaller 117 satellite constellation in 2015 with plans to deliver initial service in 2021 [450] Amazon announced a large broadband internet satellite constellation in April 2019, planning to launch 3,236 satellites in the next decade in what the company calls \"Project Kuiper\", a satellite constellation that will work in concert [451] with Amazon's previously announced large network of twelve satellite ground station facilities (the \"AWS ground station unit\") announced in November 2018 [452]\n\n\nSimilar or competitive systems\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

During the Kyiv offensive, which began on the first day of the invasion, videos on social media began widely circulating of fighter jets in Ukraine shortly after the invasion started, including claims of a pilot who took down multiple Russian jets. The claim that a MiG-29 pilot nicknamed the \"Ghost of Kyiv\" who won six air fights in the skies of Kyiv appeared during the first 30 hours of the invasion.

During the Kyiv offensive, which began on the first day of the invasion, videos on social media began widely circulating of fighter jets in Ukraine shortly after the invasion started, including claims of a pilot who took down multiple Russian jets. The claim that a MiG-29 pilot nicknamed the \"Ghost of Kyiv\" who won six air fights in the skies of Kyiv appeared during the first 30 hours of the invasion. The six planes were reported as two Su-35s, two Su-25s, an Su-27, and an enemy MiG-29. If the flying ace had existed, they would have been the first recorded fighter ace of the 21st century.\n\nThe story of the Ghost of Kyiv was widely shared on social media, with many Ukrainians claiming to have seen the pilot in action. The rumors of the Ghost of Kyiv's exploits spread quickly, with many believing that the pilot was a Ukrainian hero who was single-handedly taking down Russian aircraft.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nA day later, however, The Times reported that a Ukrainian military source said the pilot was real and still alive. The Armed Forces of Ukraine posted on Facebook the purported pilot in his helmet with the visor up with the caption, \"Hello, occupier, I'm coming for your soul!\" However, many were skeptical about the claims, and some questioned whether the story was a myth or a fabrication.\n\n**Clarifications**\n\nThe persona is based on confirmed downing of Russian planes, assigned to one heroic figure. However, the exact identity of the Ghost of Kyiv remains a mystery, and many believe that the story may be a composite of multiple pilots who have taken down Russian aircraft.\n\n**Representations**\n\nAfter Ukrainian fighter pilot Andrii Pilshchykov died on 25 August 2023, it was revealed that the original photo which purported to show the Ghost of Kyiv, shared by Poroshenko and spread by the media, showed Pilshchykov, who was also one of the original creators of the \"Ghost of Kyiv\" myth. The revelation sparked a debate about the true identity of the Ghost of Kyiv and the authenticity of the story.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nDespite the Ghost of Kyiv being an urban legend or instance of war propaganda, the pilot's alleged existence has been credited as a major morale boost for the Ukrainian population by bolstering optimism during the Russian invasion.

[172]\n\n\nInternational career\nAs a college sophomore, Verlander pitched for the United States national baseball team in 2003 and helped the US win a silver medal in the Pan American Games in Santo Domingo.\n\n\nPitching style\nVerlander throws four pitches: a hard four-seam fastball averaging 94–95 mph (topping out at 102 [178]), a slider in the mid-to-high 80s, a 12–6 curveball around 80, and a changeup at 85–88 mph [179] His four-seam fastball has an \"elite\" spin rate of over 2500 rpm according to Statcast, giving it a late \"tailing\" action that cuts inside to righties and away from lefties He often uses his four-seam fastball up in the zone to hitters This has allowed him to strike out more batters with that pitch than any other His slider has evolved throughout his career In his early years, his slider was in the mid-80s with a larger break However, in recent years, Verlander has added velocity to his slider This change has caused a later, sharper break that has led many to believe it is actually a cutter, although Verlander has denied this on various occasions In 2017, Verlander began to incorporate both sliders He usually throws the slower, longer slider under the hands of lefties, and the sharper, faster slider down and away to righties His 12–6 curveball has always been a dominant pitch that buckles hitters' knees at any point in the count He also intentionally uses this pitch up in the zone at times to freeze hitters or throw off their timing Since the 2016 season, Verlander has essentially become a three-pitch pitcher (fastball, slider, curveball) His changeup has been used almost exclusively against left-handed batters in recent years, and its usage has dropped considerably The changeup accounted for 8.5 percent of his pitches in 2016, only 4 percent of his pitches in 2017, and less than 2 percent of his pitches in 2018.\n\n\nCharity work\nIn 2016, Verlander started the \"Wins For Warriors Foundation\" for veterans of the United States Military [188] The \"Wins For Warriors Foundation\" campaign raised $246,311 to help Houston recover from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 [189] To date, [as of?] Verlander has donated over $1 million to this cause [190] Verlander has also supported various local Detroit charities for the impoverished as well as helping out with national efforts such as the Red Cross [citation

[172]\n\n\nInternational career\nAs a college sophomore, Verlander pitched for the United States national baseball team in 2003 and helped the US win a silver medal in the Pan American Games in Santo Domingo.\n\n\nPitching style\nVerlander throws four pitches: a hard four-seam fastball averaging 94–95 mph (topping out at 102 [178]), a slider in the mid-to-high 80s, a 12–6 curveball around 80, and a changeup at 85–88 mph [179] His four-seam fastball has an \"elite\" spin rate of over 2500 rpm according to Statcast, giving it a late \"tailing\" action that cuts inside to righties and away from lefties He often uses his four-seam fastball up in the zone to hitters This has allowed him to strike out more batters with that pitch than any other His slider has evolved throughout his career In his early years, his slider was in the mid-80s with a larger break However, in recent years, Verlander has added velocity to his slider This change has caused a later, sharper break that has led many to believe it is actually a cutter, although Verlander has denied this on various occasions In 2017, Verlander began to incorporate both sliders He usually throws the slower, longer slider under the hands of lefties, and the sharper, faster slider down and away to righties His 12–6 curveball has always been a dominant pitch that buckles hitters' knees at any point in the count He also intentionally uses this pitch up in the zone at times to freeze hitters or throw off their timing Since the 2016 season, Verlander has essentially become a three-pitch pitcher (fastball, slider, curveball) His changeup has been used almost exclusively against left-handed batters in recent years, and its usage has dropped considerably The changeup accounted for 8.5 percent of his pitches in 2016, only 4 percent of his pitches in 2017, and less than 2 percent of his pitches in 2018.\n\n\nCharity work\nIn 2016, Verlander started the \"Wins For Warriors Foundation\" for veterans of the United States Military [188] The \"Wins For Warriors Foundation\" campaign raised $246,311 to help Houston recover from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 [189] To date, [as of?] Verlander has donated over $1 million to this cause [190] Verlander has also supported various local Detroit charities for the impoverished as well as helping out with national efforts such as the Red Cross [citation needed]\n\n\nPersonal life\nVerlander grew up in Manakin-Sabot, Virginia, with his parents, Richard and Kathy Verlander and a younger brother, Ben Verlander His life experiences and the story of his development are outlined in his parents' 2012 book, Rocks Across the Pond: Lessons Learned, Stories Told [192]\n\n\nAwards and accolades\nItalics denotes active player\n\n\nSee also\nItalics denotes

{"title": "Hunter_Biden_laptop_controversy", "content": "\nBackground\nThe media coverage of the laptop spurred speculation about the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, which falsely [26] alleged that then vice president Joe Biden acted in Ukraine to protect his son from a corruption investigation by Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin On October 14, 2020, the New York Post published an article based on an email from the laptop about a purported meeting between then vice president Joe Biden and the Burisma advisor Vadym Pozharskyi The Biden campaign denied Joe Biden had any meeting with Pozharskyi and said that if they had ever met, it would have been a brief encounter [27] Witnesses at the dinner where they allegedly met said Joe Biden briefly passed by to see an old friend The Post reported in its story that Pozharskyi declined to comment, and he did not comment to a Politico journalist who reported extensively on the story a year later [28]\n\n\nNew York Post reporting\nOn October 14, 2020, the New York Post published articles containing purported emails of unknown authorship which suggested that Hunter Biden provided an \"opportunity\" to Vadym Pozharskyi, an advisor to the board of Burisma, to meet his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden [2] [36] [37] Joe Biden stated in September 2019 that he had never spoken to his son about his foreign business dealings [38] His presidential campaign denied such a meeting took place and stated the New York Post had never contacted them \"about the critical elements of this story\" [39] Michael Carpenter, Vice President Biden's foreign policy adviser in 2015, told The Washington Post that he had accompanied Joe Biden during all of his meetings about Ukraine: \"He never met with  [Pozharskyi] In fact, I had never heard of this guy until the New York Post story broke.\" [40] One of the purported emails showed Pozharskyi saying he would share information with Amos Hochstein, a State Department advisor close to Vice President Biden, though Hochstein stated, \"The Republican Senate investigation subpoenaed all my records, including emails and calendars and found no mention of this man I led the US energy efforts in Ukraine and never even heard of him before yesterday.\" [41]\n\n\nLaptop and hard drive\nRudy Giuliani provided the materials to the New York Post after they were allegedly found on a water-damaged [49] MacBook Pro left at The Mac Shop, a Wilmington, Delaware, computer repair business owned by John Paul Mac Isaac [50] Mac Isaac obtained the laptop in April 2019, claiming it had been dropped off by a man who identified himself as Hunter Biden and requested that the data on the damaged laptop be recovered [1] [51] [52] Mac Isaac also said that he is legally blind and could not be sure if the person who supposedly left the laptop was actually Hunter Biden [1]\n\n\nUkraine material\nMaterial similar to the alleged hard-drive contents was reportedly circulating in Ukraine in 2019 One individual interviewed by Time magazine stated that he had been approached in late May 2019, and a second person stated that he had been approached in mid-September According to the second individual, the seller wished to sell compromising information about Hunter Biden to Republican Party allies of Donald Trump for $5 million \"I walked away from it, because it smelled awful\", he told Time Igor Novikov, a former advisor to the Ukrainian president and a disinformation researcher, said that the market for kompromat (damaging material) had been very active in the past year in reaction to political events in the United States, with political operatives rushing to respond to Giuliani's call for damaging information on the Bidens Novikov characterized the materials available on the market as \"extremely hard to verify, yet very easy to fake\".\n\n\nHunter Biden story pitch\nEarlier in October, before the Post's report, White House lawyer Eric Herschmann, former deputy White House counsel Stefan Passantino, former Hunter Biden business partner Tony Bobulinski, and close Donald Trump Jr associate Arthur Schwartz pitched a story about Hunter Biden's business dealings in China to The Wall Street Journal, which the Trump team saw as an ideal outlet due to its combination of conservatism and industry credibility Without warning to the Trump team and while the Journal was exercising due diligence in investigating the story, the New York Post went ahead and published a version of the story based on documents and emails with \"questionable provenance\" that alleged, but did not prove, Joe Biden's involvement in his son's affairs [70]\n\n\nAftermath and veracity concerns\nThe New York Times reported in May 2021 that federal investigators in Brooklyn had begun a criminal investigation late in the Trump administration into possible efforts by several current and former Ukrainian officials to spread unsubstantiated allegations about Joe Biden concerning corruption The investigators had been examining whether the Ukrainians used Giuliani as a channel for the allegations, though he was not a specific subject of the investigation, in contrast to a long-running investigation of Giuliani by the US attorney's office in Manhattan [72]\n\n\nForensic analysis\nIn March 2022, The Washington Post published the findings of two forensic information analysts it had retained to examine 217 gigabytes of data provided to the paper on a hard drive by Republican activist Jack Maxey, who represented that its contents came from the laptop One of the analysts characterized the data as a \"disaster\" from a forensics standpoint The analysts found that people other than Hunter Biden had repeatedly accessed and copied data for nearly three years; they also found evidence that people other than Hunter Biden had accessed and written files to the drive, both before and after the New York Post story In September 2020, someone created six new folders on the drive, including with the names \"Biden Burisma\", \"Big Guy File\", \"Salacious Pics Package\" and \"Hunter Burisma Documents\" One of the analysts found evidence someone may have accessed the drive contents from a West Coast location days after The New York Post published their stories about the laptop [5]\n\n\nLawsuits\nIn December 2020, Mac Isaac sued Twitter for defamation over their handling of the New York Post story, claiming that their decision to remove the article under their \"hacked materials\" policy falsely tarred him as a hacker [82] Florida district judge Beth Bloom dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice in September 2021, noting that Twitter never mentioned Mac Isaac or his business, and ordered Mac Isaac to pay Twitter's attorney fees under Florida's anti-SLAPP statute [83] In May 2022, Mac Isaac again sued a number of individuals and publications for defamation, alleging that he had suffered reputational damage over claims that the laptop story had been part of a Russian disinformation campaign and that he had illegally accessed the data on the laptop The suit named Hunter Biden, Democratic representative Adam Schiff, and the news publications CNN, Politico, and The Daily Beast [84] [85] [86]\n\n\nTrial on gun charges\nIn June 2024, special counsel Weiss introduced the laptop, related files, and an invoice from Mac Isaac's repair shop as evidence in Biden's trial in Delaware, in which he was found guilty of purchasing a firearm while a recent drug user [92] Defense attorneys for Biden argued that they had \"numerous reasons to believe the data had been altered and compromised before investigators obtained the electronic material\", which Weiss described as \"a conspiracy theory with no supporting evidence\" Prosecutors stated that defense attorneys had not \"provided any evidence or information that shows that his laptop contains false information\" The presiding judge sided with prosecutors [93] [94]\n\n\nReactions\nDuring an April 2021 interview with CBS correspondent Tracy Smith, when asked if the laptop was his, Hunter Biden replied that he did not know and did not remember dropping off a laptop in Delaware for repairs, adding: \"There could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me It could be that I was hacked It could be that it was Russian intelligence It could be that it was stolen from me.\" [100]\n\n\nHunter Biden\nDuring an April 2021 interview with CBS correspondent Tracy Smith, when asked if the laptop was his, Hunter Biden replied that he did not know and did not remember dropping off a laptop in Delaware for repairs, adding: \"There could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me It could be that I was hacked It could be that it was Russian intelligence It could be that it was stolen from me.\" [100]\n\n\nIntelligence officials\nOn October 19, 2020, a group of 51 former senior intelligence officials, who had served in the Trump administration and those of the three previous presidents, released an open letter stating that the release of the alleged emails \"has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation\", adding:\n\n\nSocial media corporations\nAfter the 2016 election, social media companies were criticized for allowing false political information to proliferate on their platforms, including disinformation from Russian intelligence, suggesting it may have assisted Trump's election [113]\n\n\nJoe Biden 2020 presidential campaign\nThe Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign press secretary Jamal Brown stated that Twitter's action concerning the New York Post story indicated that the allegations in the story were false [138] Brown specifically denied that Joe Biden ever had a formal meeting with Pozharskyi, and said that if they had ever met, it would have been a brief encounter [139]\n\n\nCongress\nOn January 21, 2021, the day after Biden's inauguration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed an article of impeachment, which made a reference to the laptop [140] [141] No fellow members of Congress co-sponsored the article.\n\n\nOther press outlets\nThe New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal stated that they could not independently verify the data provided by the New York Post [32] NBC News requested a copy of the hard drive from Giuliani, who said he would not provide one and offered it copies of a small portion of emails instead [142] In May 2022, NBC News published an analysis of a copy of the hard drive they received from Giuliani and documents released by Republicans on two Senate committees The analysis found that Hunter Biden's firm took in $11 million from 2013 to 2018 and spent the money fast The analysis also found that few of Hunter Biden's deals ever came to fruition [73]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Hunter Biden laptop controversy refers to a series of events

In September 2020, someone created six new folders on the drive, including with the names \"Biden Burisma,\" \"Big Guy File,\" \"Salacious Pics Package,\" and \"Hunter Burisma Documents.\" One of the analysts found evidence someone may have accessed the drive contents from a West Coast location days after The New York Post published their stories about the laptop.\n\n**Lawsuits**\n\nIn December 2020, Mac Isaac sued Twitter for defamation over their handling of the New York Post story, claiming that their decision to remove the article under their \"hacked materials\" policy falsely tarred him as a hacker. Florida district judge Beth Bloom dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice in September 2021, noting that Twitter never mentioned Mac Isaac or his business, and ordered Mac Isaac to pay Twitter's attorney fees under Florida's anti-SLAPP statute. In May 2022, Mac Isaac again sued a number of individuals and publications for defamation, alleging that he had suffered reputational damage over claims that the laptop story had been part of a Russian disinformation campaign and that he had illegally accessed the data on the laptop. The suit named Hunter Biden, Democratic representative Adam Schiff, and the news publications CNN, Politico, and The Daily Beast.\n\n**Trial on gun charges**\n\nIn June 2024, special counsel Weiss introduced the laptop, related files, and an invoice from Mac Isaac's repair shop as evidence in Biden's trial in Delaware, in which he was found guilty of purchasing a firearm while a recent drug user. Defense attorneys for Biden argued that they had \"numerous reasons to believe the data had been altered and compromised before investigators obtained the electronic material,\" which Weiss described as \"a conspiracy theory with no supporting evidence.\" Prosecutors stated that defense attorneys had not \"provided any evidence or information that shows that his laptop contains false information.\" The presiding judge sided with prosecutors.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nDuring an April 2021 interview with CBS correspondent Tracy Smith, when asked if the laptop was his, Hunter Biden replied that he did not know and did not remember dropping off a laptop in Delaware for repairs, adding: \"There could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me. It could be that I was hacked. It could be that it was Russian intelligence. It could be that it was stolen from me.\"\n\n**Intelligence officials**\n\nOn October 19, 2020, a group of 51 former senior intelligence officials, who had served in the Trump administration and those of the three previous presidents, released an open letter stating that the release of the alleged emails \"has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,\" adding that \"we will be forced to reconsider our previous assessments of Moscow's motivations and capabilities if the current picture becomes any clearer.\"\n\n**Social media corporations**\n\nAfter the 2016 election, social media companies were criticized for allowing false political information to proliferate on their platforms, including disinformation from Russian intelligence, suggesting it may have assisted Trump's election.\n\n**Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign**\n\nThe Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign press secretary Jamal Brown stated that Twitter's action concerning the New York Post story indicated that the allegations in the story were false. Brown specifically denied that Joe Biden ever had a formal meeting with Pozharskyi, and said that if they had ever met, it would have been a brief encounter.\n\n**Congress**\n\nOn January 21, 2021, the day after Biden's inauguration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed an article of impeachment, which made a reference to the laptop. No fellow members of Congress co-sponsored the article.\n\n**Other press outlets**\n\nThe New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal stated that they could not independently verify the data provided by the New York Post. NBC News requested a copy of the hard drive from Giuliani, who said he would not provide one and offered it copies of a small portion of emails instead. In May 2022, NBC News published an analysis of a copy of the hard drive they received from Giuliani and documents released by Republicans on two Senate committees. The analysis found that Hunter Biden's firm took in $11 million from 2013 to 2018 and spent the money fast. The analysis also found that few of Hunter Biden's deals ever came to fruition.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2020 United States presidential election\n* Russian interference in the 2020 United States

outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe media coverage of the laptop spurred speculation about the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, which falsely [26] alleged that then vice president Joe Biden acted in Ukraine to protect his son from a corruption investigation by Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin On October 14, 2020, the New York Post published an article based on an email from the laptop about a purported meeting between then vice president Joe Biden and the Burisma advisor Vadym Pozharskyi The Biden campaign denied Joe Biden had any meeting with Pozharskyi and said that if they had ever met, it would have been a brief encounter [27] Witnesses at the dinner where they allegedly met said Joe Biden briefly passed by to see an old friend The Post reported in its story that Pozharskyi declined to comment, and he did not comment to a Politico journalist who reported extensively on the story a year later [28]\n\n\nNew York Post reporting\nOn October 14, 2020, the New York Post published articles containing purported emails of unknown authorship which suggested that Hunter Biden provided an \"opportunity\" to Vadym Pozharskyi, an advisor to the board of Burisma, to meet his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden [2] [36] [37] Joe Biden stated in September 2019 that he had never spoken to his son about his foreign business dealings [38] His presidential campaign denied such a meeting took place and stated the New York Post had never contacted them \"about the critical elements of this story\" [39] Michael Carpenter, Vice President Biden's foreign policy adviser in 2015, told The Washington Post that he had accompanied Joe Biden during all of his meetings about Ukraine: \"He never met with  [Pozharskyi] In fact, I had never heard of this guy until the New York Post story broke.\" [40] One of the purported emails showed Pozharskyi saying he would share information with Amos Hochstein, a State Department advisor close to Vice President Biden, though Hochstein stated, \"The Republican Senate investigation subpoenaed all my records, including emails and calendars and found no mention of this man I led the US energy efforts in Ukraine and never even heard of him before yesterday.\" [41]\n\n\nLaptop and hard drive\nRudy Giuliani provided the materials to the New York Post after they were allegedly found on a water-damaged [49] MacBook Pro left at The Mac Shop, a Wilmington, Delaware, computer repair business owned by John Paul Mac Isaac [50] Mac Isaac obtained the laptop in April 2019, claiming it had been dropped off by a man who identified himself as Hunter Biden and requested that the data on the damaged laptop be recovered [1] [51] [52] Mac Isaac also said that he is legally blind and could not be sure if the person who supposedly left the laptop was actually Hunter Biden [1]\n\n\nUkraine material\nMaterial similar to the alleged hard-drive contents was reportedly circulating in Ukraine in 2019 One individual interviewed by Time magazine stated that he had been approached in late May 2019, and a second person stated that he had been approached in mid-September According to the second individual, the seller wished to sell compromising information about Hunter Biden to Republican Party allies of Donald Trump for $5 million \"I walked away from it, because it smelled awful\", he told Time Igor Novikov, a former advisor to the Ukrainian president and a disinformation researcher, said that the market for kompromat (damaging material) had been very active in the past year in reaction to political events in the United States, with political operatives rushing to respond to Giuliani's call for damaging information on the Bidens Novikov characterized the materials available on the market as \"extremely hard to verify, yet very easy to fake\".\n\n\nHunter Biden story pitch\nEarlier in October, before the Post's report, White House lawyer Eric Herschmann, former deputy White House counsel Stefan Passantino, former Hunter Biden business partner Tony Bobulinski, and close Donald Trump Jr associate Arthur Schwartz pitched a story about Hunter Biden's business dealings in China to The Wall Street Journal, which the Trump team saw as an ideal outlet due to its combination of conservatism and industry credibility Without warning to the Trump team and while the Journal was exercising due diligence in investigating the story, the New York Post went ahead and published a version of the story based on documents and emails with \"questionable provenance\" that alleged, but did not prove, Joe Biden's involvement in his son's affairs [70]\n\n\nAftermath and veracity concerns\nThe New York Times reported in May 2021 that federal investigators in Brooklyn had begun a criminal investigation late in the Trump administration into possible efforts by several current and former Ukrainian officials to spread unsubstantiated allegations about Joe Biden concerning corruption The investigators had been examining whether the Ukrainians used Giuliani as a channel for the allegations, though he was not a specific subject of the investigation, in contrast to a long-running investigation of Giuliani by the US attorney's office in Manhattan [72]\n\n\nForensic analysis\nIn March 2022, The Washington Post published the findings of two forensic information analysts it had retained to examine 217 gigabytes of data provided to the paper on a hard drive by Republican activist Jack Maxey, who represented that its contents came from the laptop One of the analysts characterized the data as a \"disaster\" from a forensics standpoint The analysts found that people other than Hunter Biden had repeatedly accessed and copied data for nearly three years; they also found evidence that people other than Hunter Biden had accessed and written files to the drive, both before and after the New York Post story In September 2020, someone created six new folders on the drive, including with the names \"Biden Burisma\", \"Big Guy File\", \"Salacious Pics Package\" and \"Hunter Burisma Documents\" One of the analysts found evidence someone may have accessed the drive contents from a West Coast location days after The New York Post published their stories about the laptop [5]\n\n\nLawsuits\nIn December 2020, Mac Isaac sued Twitter for defamation over their handling of the New York Post story, claiming that their decision to remove the article under their \"hacked materials\" policy falsely tarred him as a hacker [82] Florida district judge Beth Bloom dismissed the lawsuit with

{"title": "Iceland", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe Sagas of Icelanders say that a Norwegian named Naddodd (or Naddador) was the first Norseman to reach Iceland; in the ninth century, he named it Snæland or \"Snowland\" because it was snowing Following Naddodd, the Swede Garðar Svavarsson arrived, and so the island was then called Garðarshólmur, which means \"Garðar's Isle\" [21]\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to both Landnámabók and Íslendingabók, monks known as the Papar lived in Iceland before Scandinavian settlers arrived, possibly members of a Hiberno-Scottish mission An archaeological excavation has revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula Carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880 [23] In 2016, archaeologists uncovered a longhouse in Stöðvarfjörður that has been dated to as early as 800 [24]\n\n\n874–1262: settlement and Commonwealth\nAccording to both Landnámabók and Íslendingabók, monks known as the Papar lived in Iceland before Scandinavian settlers arrived, possibly members of a Hiberno-Scottish mission An archaeological excavation has revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula Carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880 [23] In 2016, archaeologists uncovered a longhouse in Stöðvarfjörður that has been dated to as early as 800 [24]\n\n\nIceland as a possession\nThe Icelandic Commonwealth lasted until the 13th century when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains [33] The internal struggles and civil strife of the Age of the Sturlungs led to the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown Possession of Iceland passed from the Kingdom of Norway (872–1397) to the Kalmar Union in 1415, when the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden were united After the break-up of the union in 1523, it remained a Norwegian dependency, as a part of Denmark–Norway.\n\n\nThe Middle Ages\nThe Icelandic Commonwealth lasted until the 13th century when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains [33] The internal struggles and civil strife of the Age of the Sturlungs led to the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown Possession of Iceland passed from the Kingdom of Norway (872–1397) to the Kalmar Union in 1415, when the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden were united After the break-up of the union in 1523, it remained a Norwegian dependency, as a part of Denmark–Norway.\n\n\nReformation and the Early Modern period\nAround the middle of the 16th century, as part of the Protestant Reformation, King Christian III of Denmark began to impose Lutheranism on all his subjects Jón Arason, the last Catholic bishop of Hólar, was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons The country subsequently became officially Lutheran, and Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion.\n\n\n1814–1918: independence movement\nIn 1814, following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark-Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the Treaty of Kiel, but Iceland remained a Danish dependency Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow colder, resulting in mass emigration to the New World, particularly to the region of Gimli, Manitoba in Canada, which was sometimes referred to as New Iceland About 15,000 people emigrated, out of a total population of 70,000 [42]\n\n\n1918–1944: independence and the Kingdom of Iceland\nThe Danish–Icelandic Act of Union, an agreement with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25 years, recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign and independent state in a personal union with Denmark The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark carry out on its behalf certain defence and foreign affairs matters, subject to consultation with the Althing Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the Kingdom of Iceland Iceland's legal position became comparable to those of countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations, such as Canada, whose sovereign is King Charles III.\n\n\n1944–present: Republic of Iceland\nOn 31 December 1943, the Danish–Icelandic Act of Union expired after 25 years Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with Denmark, abolish the monarchy, and establish a republic The vote was 97% to end the union, and 95% in favour of the new republican constitution [45] Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944, with Sveinn Björnsson as its first president.\n\n\nEconomic boom and crisis\nIn 2003–2007, following the privatisation of the banking sector under the government of Davíð Oddsson, Iceland moved towards having an economy based on international investment banking and financial services [52] It was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world, but was hit hard by a major financial crisis [52] The crisis resulted in the greatest migration from Iceland since 1887, with a net emigration of 5,000 people in 2009 [53]\n\n\nSince 2012\nIceland's economy stabilised under the government of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir and grew by 1.6% in 2012 [54] The centre-right Independence Party was returned to power in coalition with the Progressive Party in the 2013 election [55] In the following years, Iceland saw a surge in tourism as the country became a popular holiday destination In 2016, Prime Minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned after being implicated in the Panama Papers scandal [56] Early elections in 2016 resulted in a right-wing coalition government of the Independence Party, the Reform Party and Bright Future [57] This government fell when Bright Future quit the coalition due to a scandal involving then-Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson's father's letter of support for a convicted child sex offender [58] Snap elections in October 2017 brought to power a new coalition consisting of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Left-Green Movement, headed by Katrín Jakobsdóttir [59]\n\n\nGeography\nIceland is at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans The main island is entirely south of the Arctic Circle, which passes through the small Icelandic island of Grímsey off the main island's northern coast The country lies between latitudes 63 and 68°N, and longitudes 25 and 13°W.\n\n\nGeology\nA geologically young land at 16 to 18 million years old, Iceland is the surface expression of the Iceland Plateau, a large igneous province forming as a result of volcanism from the Iceland hotspot and along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the latter of which runs right through it [72] [73] This means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes including Hekla, Eldgjá, Herðubreið, and Eldfell [74] The volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783–1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island's population [75] In addition, the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for several months afterwards, and affected climates in other areas [76]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Iceland's coast is subarctic The warm North Atlantic Current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world Regions in the world with similar climates include the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Peninsula, and Tierra del Fuego, although these regions are closer to the equator Despite its proximity to the Arctic, the island's coasts remain ice-free through the winter Ice incursions are rare, with the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969 [82]\n\n\nWildlife\nThe entire country is in a single ecoregion, the Iceland boreal birch forests and alpine tundra Some areas are covered by glaciers.\n\n\nPlants\nPhytogeographically, Iceland belongs to the Arctic province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom Plantlife consists mainly of grassland, which is regularly grazed by livestock The most common tree native to Iceland is the northern birch (Betula pubescens), which formerly formed forests over much of Iceland, along with aspens (Populus tremula), rowans (Sorbus aucuparia), common junipers (Juniperus communis), and other smaller trees, mainly willows.\n\n\nAnimals\nThe only native land mammal when humans arrived was the Arctic fox, [84] which came to the island at the end of the ice age, walking over the frozen sea On rare occasions, bats have been carried to the island with the winds, but they are not able to breed there No native or free-living reptiles or amphibians are on the island [88]\n\n\nPolitics\nIceland is a parliamentary representative democratic republic, whereby the president is the head of state, while the prime minister of Iceland serves as the head of government in a multi-party system Members of the Icelandic parliament are voted in by proportional representation, by constituency.\n\n\nWomen's rights\nWomen in Iceland first gained the right to vote in 1915 (with restrictions) and increased voting rights in 1920 [102] Iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women [103] Known as the Women's List (Kvennalistinn), it was founded in 1983 to advance the political, economic, and social needs of women It left a lasting influence on Iceland's politics: every major party has a 40% quota for women In the 2021 elections, 48% of members of parliament are female compared to the global average of 16% in 2009 [104] [105] [106] Vigdís Finnbogadóttir was the world's first democratically elected female head of state In 2009, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir became the world's first openly LGBT head of government [107]\n\n\nGovernment\nIceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic The modern parliament, Alþingi (English: Althing), was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch It was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the Commonwealth period and temporarily suspended from 1799 to 1845 Consequently, \"it is arguably the world's oldest parliamentary democracy.\" [108] It has 63 members, elected for a maximum period of four years [109]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nIceland is divided into regions, constituencies, and municipalities The eight regions are primarily used for statistical purposes District court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division [69] Until 2003, the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions, but by an amendment to the constitution, they were changed to the current six constituencies:\n\n\nForeign relations\nIceland, which is a member of the UN, NATO, EFTA, Council of Europe, and OECD, maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations, but its ties with the Nordic countries, Germany, the United States, Canada, and the other NATO nations are particularly close Historically, due to cultural, economic, and linguistic similarities, Iceland is a Nordic country, and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the Nordic Council.\n\n\nMilitary\nIceland has no standing army but has the Icelandic Coast Guard which also maintains the Iceland Air Defence System, and an Iceland Crisis Response Unit to support peacekeeping missions and perform paramilitary functions.\n\n\nEconomy\nIn 2022, Iceland was the eighth-most productive country in the world per capita (US$78,837), and the thirteenth-most productive by GDP at purchasing power parity ($69,833) [130] About 85 percent of the total primary energy supply in Iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources [131] Use of abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power has made Iceland the world's largest electricity producer per capita [132]\n\n\nEconomic contraction\nIceland was hit especially hard by the Great Recession that began in December 2007 because of the failure of its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of €14 billion ($19 billion) [155] [156] In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the financial crisis The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks [157] Icelandic officials, including central bank governor Davíð Oddsson, stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks' foreign debts or assets Instead, new banks were established to take on the domestic operations of the banks, and the old banks were to be run into bankruptcy.\n\n\nTransport\nIceland has a high level of car ownership per capita, with a car for every 1.5 inhabitants; it is the main form of transport [165] Iceland has 13,034 km (8,099 mi) of administered roads, of which 4,617 km (2,869 mi) are paved and 8,338 km (5,181 mi) are not The road speed limits are 30 and 50 km/h (19 and 31 mph) in towns, 80 km/h (50 mph) on gravel country roads and 90 km/h (56 mph) on hard-surfaced roads A great number of interior roads remain unpaved, mostly little-used rural roads [166]\n\n\nRoad\nIceland has a high level of car ownership per capita, with a car for every 1.5 inhabitants; it is the main form of transport [165] Iceland has 13,034 km (8,099 mi) of administered roads, of which 4,617 km (2,869 mi) are paved and 8,338 km (5,181 mi) are not The road speed limits are 30 and 50 km/h (19 and 31 mph) in towns, 80 km/h (50 mph) on gravel country roads and 90 km/h (56 mph) on hard-surfaced roads A great number of interior roads remain unpaved, mostly little-used rural roads [166]\n\n\nPublic transport\nCity buses in Reykjavík (including the Capital Region) are operated by Strætó bs Long-distance public bus services throughout the country are also provided by Strætó bs Smaller towns such as Akureyri, Reykjanesbær and Selfoss also provide local bus services [169] Public and private bus services are available to and from Keflavik International Airport [170]\n\n\nAir travel\nKeflavík International Airport (KEF) [171] is the largest airport and the main aviation hub for international passenger transport [172] KEF is in the southwest of the country, 49 km (30 mi) [173] from the Reykjavík city centre.\n\n\nSea\nSeveral ferry services provide regular access to various island communities or shorten travel distances The Smyril Line operates the ship Norröna providing an international ferry service from Seyðisfjörður to the Faroe Islands and Denmark [179]\n\n\nEnergy\nRenewable sources—geothermal and hydropower—provide effectively all of Iceland's electricity [181] and around 85% of the nation's total primary energy consumption, [182] with most of the remainder consisting of imported oil products used in transportation and in the fishing fleet [183] [184] Iceland's largest geothermal power plants are Hellisheiði and Nesjavellir, [185] [186] while Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant is the country's largest hydroelectric power station [187] When the Kárahnjúkavirkjun started operating, Iceland became the world's largest electricity producer per capita [188]\n\n\nEducation and science\nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Culture is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines However, playschools, primary schools, and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities The government does allow citizens to home educate their children, however, under a very strict set of demands [198] Students must adhere closely to the government-mandated curriculum, and the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe original population of Iceland was of Norse and Gaelic origin This is evident from literary evidence dating from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as blood type and genetic analyses One such genetic study indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin while the majority of the women were of Gaelic origin, meaning many settlers of Iceland were Norsemen who brought Gaelic slaves with them [211]\n\n\nUrbanisation\nIceland's 10 most populous urban areas:\n\n\n\nLanguage\nIceland's official written and spoken language is Icelandic, a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse In grammar and vocabulary, it has changed less from Old Norse than the other Nordic languages; Icelandic has preserved more verb and noun inflection, and has to a considerable extent developed new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from other languages The puristic tendency in the development of Icelandic vocabulary is to a large degree a result of conscious language planning, in addition to centuries of isolation Icelandic is the only living language to retain the use of the runic letter Þ in Latin script The closest living relative of the Icelandic language is Faroese.\n\n\nHealth\nIceland has a universal health care system that is administered by its Ministry of Welfare (Icelandic: Velferðarráðuneytið) [227] and paid for mostly by taxes (85%) and to a lesser extent by service fees (15%) Unlike most countries, there are no private hospitals, and private insurance is practically nonexistent [228]\n\n\nReligion\nIcelanders have freedom of religion guaranteed under the Constitution, although the Church of Iceland, a Lutheran body, is the state church:\n\n\nCulture\nIcelandic culture has its roots in North Germanic traditions Icelandic literature is popular, in particular the sagas and eddas that were written during the High and Late Middle Ages Centuries of isolation have helped to insulate the country's Nordic culture from external influence; a prominent example is the preservation of the Icelandic language, which remains the closest to Old Norse of all modern Nordic languages [246]\n\n\nLiterature\nIn 2011, Reykjavík was designated a UNESCO City of Literature [256]\n\nArt\nThe distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement for home rule and independence, which was very active in the mid-19th century.\n\n\nMusic\nMuch Icelandic music is related to Nordic music, and includes folk and pop traditions Notable Icelandic music acts include medieval music group Voces Thules, alternative and indie rock acts such as The Sugarcubes, Sóley and Of Monsters and Men, jazz fusion band Mezzoforte, pop singers such as Hafdís Huld, Emilíana Torrini and Björk, solo ballad singers like Bubbi Morthens, and post-rock bands such as Amiina and Sigur Rós Independent music is strong in Iceland, with bands such as múm and solo artists such as Daði Freyr.\n\n\nMedia\nIceland's largest television stations are the state-run Sjónvarpið and the privately owned Stöð 2 and SkjárEinn Smaller stations exist, many of them local Radio is broadcast throughout the country, including in some parts of the interior The main radio stations are Rás 1, Rás 2, X-ið 977, Bylgjan and FM957 The daily newspapers are Morgunblaðið and Fréttablaðið The most popular websites are the news sites Vísir and Mbl.is [265]\n\n\nCuisine\nMuch of Iceland's cuisine is based on fish, lamb, and dairy products, with little to no use of herbs or spices Due to the island's climate, fruits and vegetables are not generally a component of traditional dishes, although the use of greenhouses has made them more common in contemporary food Þorramatur is a selection of traditional cuisine consisting of many dishes and is usually consumed around the month of Þorri, which begins on the first Friday after 19 January Traditional dishes also include skyr (a yogurt-like cheese), hákarl (cured shark), cured ram, singed sheep heads, and black pudding, Flatkaka (flatbread), dried fish and dark rye bread traditionally baked in the ground in geothermal areas [281] Puffin is considered a local delicacy that is often prepared through broiling.\n\n\nSport\nSport is an important part of Icelandic culture, as the population is generally quite active [287] The main traditional sport in Iceland is Glíma, a form of wrestling thought to have originated in medieval times.\n\n\nSee also\n65°N 18°W﻿ / ﻿65°N 18°W﻿ / 65; -18\n\n\nNotes\n65°N 18°W﻿ / ﻿65°N 18°W﻿ / 65;

The country's unique geography and geology have shaped its history, culture, and economy. With a population of approximately 360,000 people, Iceland is one of the most sparsely populated countries in Europe.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe name \"Iceland\" is derived from the Old Norse word \"Ísland,\" which means \"land of ice.\" This name was given to the island by the Viking settlers who arrived in the late 9th century. According to the Sagas of Icelanders, a Norseman named Naddodd or Naddador was the first to reach Iceland, and he named it \"Snæland\" or \"Snowland\" because of the snow that was falling when he arrived.\n\n## History\n\n### 874-1262: Settlement and Commonwealth\n\nAccording to the Landnámabók and Íslendingabók, monks known as the Papar lived in Iceland before Scandinavian settlers arrived, possibly as part of a Hiberno-Scottish mission. Archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula, which dates back to around 770-880. In 2016, archaeologists uncovered a longhouse in Stöðvarfjörður that has been dated to as early as 800.\n\n### 1262-1814: Icelandic Commonwealth and Danish Rule\n\nThe Icelandic Commonwealth lasted until the 13th century, when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains. The internal struggles and civil strife of the Age of the Sturlungs led to the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown. Possession of Iceland passed from the Kingdom of Norway to the Kalmar Union in 1415, and later to Denmark-Norway.\n\n### 1814-1918: Independence Movement\n\nIn 1814, following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark-Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms, but Iceland remained a Danish dependency. Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow colder, resulting in mass emigration to the New World, particularly to the region of Gimli, Manitoba in Canada.\n\n### 1918-1944: Independence and the Kingdom of Iceland\n\nThe Danish-Icelandic Act of Union, signed on 1 December 1918, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign and independent state in a personal union with Denmark. The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark carry out certain defense and foreign affairs matters on its behalf.\n\n### 1944-Present: Republic of Iceland\n\nOn 31 December 1943, the Danish-Icelandic Act of Union expired, and on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite to terminate the personal union with Denmark, abolish the monarchy, and establish a republic. The vote was 97% in favor of ending the union, and 95% in favor of the new republican constitution. Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944, with Sveinn Björnsson as its first president.\n\n## Geography\n\nIceland is a geologically young land, with a surface age of around 16-18 million years. The country lies between latitudes 63 and 68°N, and longitudes 25 and 13°W. Iceland is at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, and its unique geography has shaped its history, culture, and economy.\n\n## Geology\n\nIceland is a highly geologically active country, with many volcanoes, including Hekla, Eldgjá, Herðubreið, and Eldfell. The volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783-1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island's population and had a significant impact on the global climate.\n\n## Climate\n\nThe climate of Iceland's coast is subarctic, with the warm North Atlantic Current ensuring generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world. Regions in the world with similar climates include the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Peninsula, and Tierra del Fuego.\n\n## Wildlife\n\nIceland is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including the Arctic fox, which is the country's only native land mammal. The country is also home to a number of seabird species, including puffins, guillemots, and gulls.\n\n## Plants\n\nIceland's plant life is primarily limited to grasses and other low-growing vegetation. The most common tree native to Iceland is the northern birch (Betula pubescens), which formerly formed forests over much of the island.\n\n## Politics\n\nIceland is a parliamentary representative democratic republic, with a president as head of state and a prime minister as head of government. The country has a multi-party system, with six parties currently represented in the Althing, the country's parliament.\n\n## Women's Rights\n\nWomen in Iceland gained the right to vote in 1915, although with restrictions. In 1920, they gained increased voting rights. Iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women, known as the Women's List.\n\n## Government\n\nThe Althing, the country's parliament, was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch. It has 63 members, who are elected for a maximum period of four years.\n\n## Administrative Divisions\n\nIceland is divided into eight regions, which are primarily used for statistical purposes. The country is also divided into 63 municipalities, which are responsible for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and transportation.\n\n## Foreign Relations\n\nIceland is a member of the United Nations, NATO, EFTA, the Council of Europe, and the OECD. The country maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations, but its ties with the Nordic countries, Germany, the United States, Canada, and other NATO nations are particularly close.\n\n## Economy\n\nIceland has a highly developed economy, with a GDP per capita of around $78,837 in 2022. The country has a strong service sector, with a focus on tourism, finance, and technology. Iceland is also a significant producer of renewable energy, with 85% of its primary energy coming from geothermal and hydroelectric power.\n\n## Education and Science\n\nThe Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use. The country has a strong focus on science and technology education, with a number of universities and research institutions.\n\n## Demographics\n\nThe original population of Iceland was of Norse and Gaelic origin. A genetic study indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin, while the majority of the women were of Gaelic origin.\n\n## Language\n\nIcelandic is the official language of Iceland, with a unique grammar and vocabulary. The language has preserved more verb and noun inflection than other Nordic languages and has developed new vocabulary based on native roots.\n\n## Health\n\nIceland has a universal health care system that is administered by its Ministry of Welfare. The country has a high life expectancy and a low infant mortality rate.\n\n## Culture\n\nIcelandic culture is heavily influenced by the country's unique geography and history. The country has a strong focus on literature, music, and art, with a number of notable authors, musicians, and artists.\n\n## Cuisine\n\nIcelandic cuisine is primarily based on fish, lamb, and dairy products, with little use of herbs or spices. The country is known for its unique and traditional dishes, such as hákarl (cured shark) and skyr (a yogurt-like cheese).\n\n## Sport\n\nSport is an important part of Icelandic culture, with a number of traditional sports such as Glíma (a form of wrestling) and Knattleikur (a ball game). The country has a strong focus on outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, and fishing.\n\n## See Also\n\n* List of cities in Iceland\n* List of regions in Iceland\n* List of municipalities in Iceland\n* List of mountains in Iceland\n* List of rivers in Iceland\n\nNote: This article is a general overview of Iceland and its various aspects.

outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe Sagas of Icelanders say that a Norwegian named Naddodd (or Naddador) was the first Norseman to reach Iceland; in the ninth century, he named it Snæland or \"Snowland\" because it was snowing Following Naddodd, the Swede Garðar Svavarsson arrived, and so the island was then called Garðarshólmur, which means \"Garðar's Isle\" [21]\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to both Landnámabók and Íslendingabók, monks known as the Papar lived in Iceland before Scandinavian settlers arrived, possibly members of a Hiberno-Scottish mission An archaeological excavation has revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula Carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880 [23] In 2016, archaeologists uncovered a longhouse in Stöðvarfjörður that has been dated to as early as 800 [24]\n\n\n874–1262: settlement and Commonwealth\nAccording to both Landnámabók and Íslendingabók, monks known as the Papar lived in Iceland before

possession\nThe Icelandic Commonwealth lasted until the 13th century when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains [33] The internal struggles and civil strife of the Age of the Sturlungs led to the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown Possession of Iceland passed from the Kingdom of Norway (872–1397) to the Kalmar Union in 1415, when the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden were united After the break-up of the union in 1523, it remained a Norwegian dependency, as a part of Denmark–Norway.\n\n\nThe Middle Ages\nThe Icelandic Commonwealth lasted until the 13th century when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains [33] The internal struggles and civil strife of the Age of the Sturlungs led to the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown Possession of Iceland passed from the Kingdom of Norway (872–1397) to the Kalmar Union in 1415, when the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden were united After the break-up of the union in 1523, it remained a Norwegian dependency, as a part of Denmark–Norway.\n\n\nReformation and the Early Modern period\nAround the middle of the 16th century, as part of the Protestant Reformation, King Christian III of Denmark began to impose Lutheranism on all his subjects Jón Arason, the last Catholic bishop of Hólar, was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons The country subsequently became officially Lutheran, and Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion.\n\n\n1814–1918: independence movement\nIn 1814, following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark-Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the Treaty of Kiel, but Iceland remained a Danish dependency Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow colder, resulting in mass emigration to the New World, particularly to the region of Gimli, Manitoba in Canada, which was sometimes referred to as New Iceland About 15,000 people emigrated, out of a total population of 70,000 [42]\n\n\n1918–1944: independence and the Kingdom of Iceland\nThe Danish–Icelandic Act of Union, an agreement with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25 years, recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign and independent state in a personal union with Denmark The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark carry out on its behalf certain defence and foreign affairs matters, subject to consultation with the Althing Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the Kingdom of Iceland Iceland's legal position became comparable to those of countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations, such as Canada, whose sovereign is King Charles III.\n\n\n1944–present: Republic of Iceland\nOn 31 December 1943, the Danish–Icelandic Act of Union expired after 25 years Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with Denmark, abolish the monarchy, and establish a republic The vote was 97% to end the union, and 95% in favour of the new republican constitution [45] Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944, with Sveinn Björnsson as its first president.\n\n\nEconomic boom and crisis\nIn 2003–2007, following the privatisation of the banking sector under the government of Davíð Oddsson, Iceland moved towards having an economy based on international investment banking and financial services [52] It was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world, but was hit hard by a major financial crisis [52] The crisis resulted in the greatest migration from Iceland since 1887, with a net emigration of 5,000 people in 2009 [53]\n\n\nSince 2012\nIceland's economy stabilised under the government of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir and grew by 1.6% in 2012 [54] The centre-right Independence Party was returned to power in coalition with the Progressive Party in the 2013 election [55] In the following years, Iceland saw a surge in tourism as the country became a popular holiday destination In 2016, Prime Minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned after being implicated in the Panama Papers scandal [56] Early elections in 2016 resulted in a right-wing coalition government of the Independence Party, the Reform Party and Bright Future [57] This government fell when Bright Future quit the coalition due to a scandal involving then-Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson's father's letter of support for a convicted child sex offender [58] Snap elections in October 2017 brought to power a new coalition consisting of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Left-Green Movement, headed by Katrín Jakobsdóttir [59]\n\n\nGeography\nIceland is at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans The main island is entirely south of the Arctic Circle, which passes through the small Icelandic island of Grímsey off the main island's northern coast The country lies between latitudes 63 and 68°N, and longitudes 25 and 13°W.\n\n\nGeology\nA geologically young land at 16 to 18 million years old, Iceland is the surface expression of the Iceland Plateau, a large igneous province forming as a result of volcanism from the Iceland hotspot and along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the latter of which runs right through it [72] [73] This means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes including Hekla, Eldgjá, Herðubreið, and Eldfell [74] The volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783–1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island's population [75] In addition, the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for several months afterwards, and affected climates in other areas [76]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Iceland's coast is subarctic The warm North Atlantic Current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world Regions in the world with similar climates include the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Peninsula, and Tierra del Fuego, although these regions are closer to the equator Despite its proximity to the Arctic, the island's coasts remain ice-free through the winter Ice incursions are rare, with the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969 [82]\n\n\nWildlife\nThe entire country is in a single ecoregion, the Iceland boreal birch forests and alpine tundra Some areas are covered by glaciers.\n\n\nPlants\nPhytogeographically, Iceland belongs to the Arctic province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom Plantlife consists mainly of grassland, which is regularly grazed by livestock The most common tree native to Iceland is the northern birch (Betula pubescens), which formerly formed forests over much of Iceland, along with aspens (Populus tremula), rowans (Sorbus aucuparia), common junipers (Juniperus communis), and other smaller trees, mainly willows.\n\n\nAnimals\nThe only native land mammal when humans arrived was the Arctic fox, [84] which came to the island at the end of the ice age, walking over the frozen sea On rare occasions, bats have been carried to the island with the winds, but they are not able to breed there No native or free-living reptiles or amphibians are on the island [88]\n\n\nPolitics\nIceland is a parliamentary representative democratic republic, whereby the president is the head of state, while the prime minister of Iceland serves as the head of government in a multi-party system Members of the Icelandic parliament are voted in by proportional representation, by constituency.\n\n\nWomen's rights\nWomen in Iceland first gained the right to vote in 1915 (with restrictions) and increased voting rights in 1920 [102] Iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women [103] Known as the Women's List (Kvennalistinn), it was founded in 1983 to advance the political, economic, and social needs of women It left a lasting influence on Iceland's politics: every major party has a 40% quota for women In the 2021 elections, 48% of members of parliament are female compared to the global average of 16% in 2009 [104] [105] [106] Vigdís Finnbogadóttir was the world's first democratically elected female head of state In 2009, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir became the world's first openly LGBT head of government [107]\n\n\nGovernment\nIceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic The modern parliament, Alþingi (English: Althing), was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch It was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the Commonwealth period and temporarily suspended from 1799 to 1845 Consequently, \"it is arguably the world's oldest parliamentary democracy.\" [108] It has 63 members, elected for a maximum period of four years [109]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nIceland is divided into regions, constituencies, and municipalities The eight regions are primarily used for statistical purposes District court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division [69] Until 2003, the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions, but by an amendment to the constitution, they were changed to the current six constituencies:\n\n\nForeign relations\nIceland, which is a member of the UN, NATO, EFTA, Council of Europe, and OECD, maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations, but its ties with the Nordic countries, Germany, the United States, Canada, and the other NATO nations are particularly close Historically, due to cultural, economic, and linguistic similarities, Iceland is a Nordic country, and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the Nordic Council.\n\n\nMilitary\nIceland has no standing army but has the Icelandic Coast Guard which also maintains the Iceland Air Defence System, and an Iceland Crisis Response Unit to support peacekeeping missions and perform paramilitary functions.\n\n\nEconomy\nIn 2022, Iceland was the eighth-most productive country in the world per capita (US$78,837), and the thirteenth-most productive by GDP at purchasing power parity ($69,833) [130] About 85 percent of the total primary energy supply in Iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources [131] Use of abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power has made Iceland the world's largest electricity producer per capita [132]\n\n\nEconomic contraction\nIceland was hit especially hard by the Great Recession that began in December 2007 because of the failure of its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of €14 billion ($19 billion) [155] [156] In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the financial crisis The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks [157] Icelandic officials, including central bank governor Davíð Oddsson, stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks' foreign debts or assets Instead, new banks were established to take on the domestic operations of the banks, and the old banks were to be run into bankruptcy.\n\n\nTransport\nIceland has a high level of car ownership per capita, with a car for every 1.5 inhabitants; it is the main form of transport [165] Iceland has 13,034 km (8,099 mi) of administered roads, of which 4,617 km (2,869 mi) are paved and 8,338 km (5,181 mi) are not The road speed limits are 30 and 50 km/h (19 and 31 mph) in towns, 80 km/h (50 mph) on gravel country roads and 90 km/h (56 mph) on hard-surfaced roads A great number of interior roads remain unpaved, mostly little-used rural roads [166]\n\n\nRoad\nIceland has a high level of car ownership per

roads remain unpaved, mostly little-used rural roads [166]\n\n\nPublic transport\nCity buses in Reykjavík (including the Capital Region) are operated by Strætó bs Long-distance public bus services throughout the country are also provided by Strætó bs Smaller towns such as Akureyri, Reykjanesbær and Selfoss also provide local bus services [169] Public and private bus services are available to and from Keflavik International Airport [170]\n\n\nAir travel\nKeflavík International Airport (KEF) [171] is the largest airport and the main aviation hub for international passenger transport [172] KEF is in the southwest of the country, 49 km (30 mi) [173] from the Reykjavík city centre.\n\n\nSea\nSeveral ferry services provide regular access to various island communities or shorten travel distances The Smyril Line operates the ship Norröna providing an international ferry service from Seyðisfjörður to the Faroe Islands and Denmark [179]\n\n\nEnergy\nRenewable sources—geothermal and hydropower—provide effectively all of Iceland's electricity [181] and around 85% of the nation's total primary energy consumption, [182] with most of the remainder consisting of imported oil products used in transportation and in the fishing fleet [183] [184] Iceland's largest geothermal power plants are Hellisheiði and Nesjavellir, [185] [186] while Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant is the country's largest hydroelectric power station [187] When the Kárahnjúkavirkjun started operating, Iceland became the world's largest electricity producer per capita [188]\n\n\nEducation and science\nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Culture is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines However, playschools, primary schools, and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities The government does allow citizens to home educate their children, however, under a very strict set of demands [198] Students must adhere closely to the government-mandated curriculum, and the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe original population of Iceland was of Norse and Gaelic origin This is evident from literary evidence dating from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as blood type and genetic analyses One such genetic study indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin while the majority of the women were of Gaelic origin, meaning many settlers of Iceland were Norsemen who brought Gaelic slaves with them [211]\n\n\nUrbanisation\nIceland's 10 most populous urban areas:\n\n\n\nLanguage\nIceland's official written and spoken language is Icelandic, a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse In grammar and vocabulary, it has changed less from Old Norse than the other Nordic languages; Icelandic has preserved more verb and noun inflection, and has to a considerable extent developed new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from other languages The puristic tendency in the development of Icelandic vocabulary is to a large degree a result of conscious language planning, in addition to centuries of isolation Icelandic is the only living language to retain the use of the runic letter Þ in Latin script The closest living relative of the Icelandic language is Faroese.\n\n\nHealth\nIceland has a universal health care system that is administered by its Ministry of Welfare (Icelandic: Velferðarráðuneytið) [227] and paid for mostly by taxes (85%) and to a lesser extent by service fees (15%) Unlike most countries, there are no private hospitals, and private insurance is practically nonexistent [228]\n\n\nReligion\nIcelanders have freedom of religion guaranteed under the Constitution, although the Church of Iceland, a Lutheran body, is the state church:\n\n\nCulture\nIcelandic culture has its roots in North Germanic traditions Icelandic literature is popular, in particular the sagas and eddas that were written during the High and Late Middle Ages Centuries of isolation have helped to insulate the country's Nordic culture from external influence; a prominent example is the preservation of the Icelandic language, which remains the closest to Old Norse of all modern Nordic languages [246]\n\n\nLiterature\nIn 2011, Reykjavík was designated a UNESCO City of Literature [256]\n\nArt\nThe distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement for home rule and independence, which was very active in the mid-19th century.\n\n\nMusic\nMuch Icelandic music is related to Nordic music, and includes folk and pop traditions Notable Icelandic music acts include medieval music group Voces Thules, alternative and indie rock acts such as The Sugarcubes, Sóley and Of Monsters and Men, jazz fusion band Mezzoforte, pop singers such as Hafdís Huld, Emilíana Torrini and Björk, solo ballad singers like Bubbi Morthens, and post-rock bands such as Amiina and Sigur Rós Independent music is strong in Iceland, with bands such as múm and solo artists such as Daði Freyr.\n\n\nMedia\nIceland's largest television stations are the state-run Sjónvarpið and the privately owned Stöð 2 and SkjárEinn Smaller stations exist, many of them local Radio is broadcast

popular websites are the news sites Vísir and Mbl.is [265]\n\n\nCuisine\nMuch of Iceland's cuisine is based on fish, lamb, and dairy products, with little to no use of herbs or spices Due to the island's climate, fruits and vegetables are not generally a component of traditional dishes, although the use of greenhouses has made them more common in contemporary food Þorramatur is a selection of traditional cuisine consisting of many dishes and is usually consumed around the month of Þorri, which begins on the first Friday after 19 January Traditional dishes also include skyr (a yogurt-like cheese), hákarl (cured shark), cured ram, singed sheep heads, and black pudding, Flatkaka (flatbread), dried fish and dark rye bread traditionally baked in the ground in geothermal areas [281] Puffin is considered a local delicacy that is often prepared through broiling.\n\n\nSport\nSport is an important part of Icelandic culture, as the population is generally quite active [287] The main traditional sport in Iceland is Glíma, a form of wrestling thought to have originated in medieval times.\n\n\nSee also\n65°N 18°W﻿ / ﻿65°N 18°W﻿ / 65; -18\n\n\nNotes\n65°N 18°W﻿ / ﻿65°N 18°W﻿ / 65;

{"title": "OPEC", "content": "\nOrganization and structure\nIn a series of steps in the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC restructured the global system of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms (the Seven Sisters) Coordination among oil-producing states within OPEC made it easier for them to nationalize oil production and structure oil prices in their favor without incurring punishment by Western governments and firms Prior to the creation of OPEC, individual oil-producing states were punished for taking steps to alter the governing arrangements of oil production within their borders States were coerced militarily (e.g in 1953, the US-UK-sponsored a coup against Mohammad Mosaddegh after he nationalized Iran's oil production) or economically (e.g the Seven Sisters slowed down oil production in one non-compliant state and ramped up oil production elsewhere) when acted contrary to the interests of the Seven Sisters and their governments [7]\n\n\nLeadership and decision-making\nThe OPEC Conference is the supreme authority of the organisation, and consists of delegations normally headed by the oil ministers of member countries The chief executive of the organisation is the OPEC secretary general The conference ordinarily meets at the Vienna headquarters, at least twice a year and in additional extraordinary sessions when necessary It generally operates on the principles of unanimity and \"one member, one vote\", with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget [17] However, since Saudi Arabia is by far the largest and most-profitable oil exporter in the world, with enough capacity to function as the traditional swing producer to balance the global market, it serves as \"OPEC's de facto leader\" [18]\n\n\nInternational cartel\nAt various times, OPEC members have displayed apparent anti-competitive cartel behavior through the organisation's agreements about oil production and price levels [19] Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition, as in this definition from OECD's Glossary of Industrial Organisation Economics and Competition Law: [20]\n\n\nConflicts\nOPEC often has difficulty agreeing on policy decisions because its member countries differ widely in their oil export capacities, production costs, reserves, geological features, population, economic development, budgetary situations, and political circumstances [30] [31] Indeed, over the course of market cycles, oil reserves can themselves become a source of serious conflict, instability and imbalances, in what economists call the \"natural resource curse\" [32] [33] A further complication is that religion-linked conflicts in the Middle East are recurring features of the geopolitical landscape for this oil-rich region [34] [35] Internationally important conflicts in OPEC's history have included the Six-Day War (1967), Yom Kippur War (1973), a hostage siege directed by Palestinian militants (1975), the Iranian Revolution (1979), Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), Iraqi occupation of Kuwait (1990–1991), September 11 attacks (2001), American occupation of Iraq (2003–2011), Conflict in the Niger Delta (2004–present), Arab Spring (2010–2012), Libyan Crisis (2011–present), and international Embargo against Iran (2012–2016) Although events such as these can temporarily disrupt oil supplies and elevate prices, the frequent disputes and instabilities tend to limit OPEC's long-term cohesion and effectiveness [36]\n\n\nHistory and impact\nIn 1949, Venezuela initiated the move towards the establishment of what would become OPEC, by inviting Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to exchange views and explore avenues for more regular and closer communication among petroleum-exporting nations as the world recovered from World War II [37] At the time, some of the world's largest oil fields were just entering production in the Middle East The United States had established the Interstate Oil Compact Commission to join the Texas Railroad Commission in limiting overproduction The US was simultaneously the world's largest producer and consumer of oil; the world market was dominated by a group of multinational companies known as the \"Seven Sisters\", five of which were headquartered in the US following the breakup of John D Rockefeller's original Standard Oil monopoly Oil-exporting countries were eventually motivated to form OPEC as a counterweight to this concentration of political and economic power [38]\n\n\nPost-WWII situation\nIn 1949, Venezuela initiated the move towards the establishment of what would become OPEC, by inviting Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to exchange views and explore avenues for more regular and closer communication among petroleum-exporting nations as the world recovered from World War II [37] At the time, some of the world's largest oil fields were just entering production in the Middle East The United States had established the Interstate Oil Compact Commission to join the Texas Railroad Commission in limiting overproduction The US was simultaneously the world's largest producer and consumer of oil; the world market was dominated by a group of multinational companies known as the \"Seven Sisters\", five of which were headquartered in the US following the breakup of John D Rockefeller's original Standard Oil monopoly Oil-exporting countries were eventually motivated to form OPEC as a counterweight to this concentration of political and economic power [38]\n\n\n1959–1960: Anger from exporting countries\nIn February 1959, as new supplies were becoming available, the multinational oil companies (MOCs) unilaterally reduced their posted prices for Venezuelan and Middle Eastern crude oil by 10 percent Weeks later, the Arab League's first Arab Petroleum Congress convened in Cairo, Egypt, where the influential journalist Wanda Jablonski introduced Saudi Arabia's Abdullah Tariki to Venezuela's observer Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo, representing the two then-largest oil-producing nations outside the United States and the Soviet Union Both oil ministers were angered by the price cuts, and the two led their fellow delegates to establish the Maadi Pact or Gentlemen's Agreement, calling for an \"Oil Consultation Commission\" of exporting countries, to which MOCs should present price-change plans Jablonski reported a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against \"absentee landlordism\" of the MOCs, which at the time controlled all oil operations within the exporting countries and wielded enormous political influence In August 1960, ignoring the warnings, and with the US favoring Canadian and Mexican oil for strategic reasons, the MOCs again unilaterally announced significant cuts in their posted prices for Middle Eastern crude oil [37] [38] [39] [40]\n\n\n1960–1975: Founding and expansion\nThe following month, during 10–14 September 1960, the Baghdad Conference was held at the initiative of Tariki, Pérez Alfonzo, and Iraqi prime minister Abd al-Karim Qasim, whose country had skipped the 1959 congress [41] Government representatives from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela met in Baghdad to discuss ways to increase the price of crude oil produced by their countries, and ways to respond to unilateral actions by the MOCs Despite strong US opposition: \"Together with Arab and non-Arab producers, Saudi Arabia formed the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) to secure the best price available from the major oil corporations.\" [42] The Middle Eastern members originally called for OPEC headquarters to be in Baghdad or Beirut, but Venezuela argued for a neutral location, and so the organization chose Geneva, Switzerland On 1 September 1965, OPEC moved to Vienna, Austria, after Switzerland declined to extend diplomatic privileges [43] At the time, Switzerland was attempting to reduce their foreign population and the OPEC was the first intergovernmental body to leave the country because of restrictions on foreigners [44] Austria was keen to attract international organizations and offered attractive terms to the OPEC [45]\n\n\n1973–1974: Oil embargo\nThe oil market was tight in the early 1970s, which reduced the risks for OPEC members in nationalising their oil production One of the major fears for OPEC members was that nationalisation would cause a steep decline in the price of oil This prompted a wave of nationalisations in countries such as Libya, Algeria, Iraq, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela With greater control over oil production decisions and amid high oil prices, OPEC members unilaterally raised oil prices in 1973, prompting the 1973 oil crisis [53]\n\n\n1975–1980: Special Fund, now the OPEC Fund for International Development\nOPEC's international aid activities date from well before the 1973–1974 oil price surge For example, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development has operated since 1961 [68]\n\n\n1975: Hostage siege\nOn 21 December 1975, Saudi Arabia's Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Iran's Jamshid Amuzegar, and the other OPEC oil ministers were taken hostage at their semi-annual conference in Vienna, Austria The attack, which killed three non-ministers, was orchestrated by a six-person team led by Venezuelan terrorist \"Carlos the Jackal\", and which included Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann and Hans-Joachim Klein The self-named \"Arm of the Arab Revolution\" group declared its goal to be the liberation of Palestine Carlos planned to take over the conference by force and hold for ransom all eleven attending oil ministers, except for Yamani and Amuzegar who were to be executed [74]\n\n\n1979–1980: Oil crisis and 1980s oil glut\nIn response to a wave of oil nationalizations and the high prices of the 1970s, industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on OPEC oil, especially after prices reached new peaks approaching US$40/bbl in 1979–1980 [79] [80] when the Iranian Revolution and Iran–Iraq War disrupted regional stability and oil supplies Electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal, natural gas, or nuclear power; [81] national governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil; [82] [83] and commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, the North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico [84] By 1986, daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5 million barrels, non-OPEC production rose by an even-larger amount, [85] and OPEC's market share sank from approximately 50 percent in 1979 to less than 30 percent in 1985 [49] Illustrating the volatile multi-year timeframes of typical market cycles for natural resources, the result was a six-year decline in the price of oil, which culminated by plunging more than half in 1986 alone [86] As one oil analyst summarized succinctly: \"When the price of something as essential as oil spikes, humanity does two things: finds more of it and finds ways to use less of it.\" [49]\n\n\n1990–2003: Ample supply and modest disruptions\nLeading up to his August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was pushing OPEC to end overproduction and to send oil prices higher, in order to help OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War [96] But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied [97]\n\n\n2003–2011: Volatility\nWidespread insurgency and sabotage occurred during the 2003–2008 height of the American occupation of Iraq, coinciding with rapidly increasing oil demand from China and commodity-hungry investors, recurring violence against the Nigerian oil industry, and dwindling spare capacity as a cushion against potential shortages This combination of forces prompted a sharp rise in oil prices to levels far higher than those previously targeted by OPEC [104] [105] [106] Price volatility reached an extreme in 2008, as WTI crude oil surged to a record US$147/bbl in July and then plunged back to US$32/bbl in December, during the worst global recession since World War II [107] OPEC's annual oil export revenue also set a new record in 2008, estimated around US$1 trillion, and reached similar annual rates in 2011–2014 (along with extensive petrodollar recycling activity) before plunging again [78] By the time of the 2011 Libyan Civil War and Arab Spring, OPEC started issuing explicit statements to counter \"excessive speculation\" in oil futures markets, blaming financial speculators for increasing volatility beyond market fundamentals [108]\n\n\n2008: Production dispute\nThe differing economic needs of OPEC member states often affect the internal debates behind OPEC production quotas Poorer members have pushed for production cuts from fellow members, to increase the price of oil and thus their own revenues [111] These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion [112] Part of the basis for this policy is the Saudi concern that overly expensive oil or unreliable supply will drive industrial nations to conserve energy and develop alternative fuels, curtailing the worldwide demand for oil and eventually leaving unneeded barrels in the ground [113] To this point, Saudi Oil Minister Yamani famously remarked in 1973: \"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.\" [114] To elucidate Saudi Arabia's contemporary approach, in 2024, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman articulated a stance that reflects how the kingdom has adapted to the evolving economic needs within OPEC and the broader international community Emphasizing the need for a balanced and fair global energy transition, he highlighted the importance of diversifying energy sources and noted significant investments in natural gas, petrochemicals, and renewables These efforts support economic development in emerging countries and align with global climate objectives [115] [116] Additionally, he addressed shifting energy security concerns, stating, \"Energy security in the 70s, 80s, and 90s was more dependent on oil Now, you get what happened last year.. It was gas The future problem on energy security will not be oil It will be renewables And the materials, and the mines.\" [116]\n\n\n2014–2017: Oil glut\nDuring 2014–2015, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a slowdown in economic growth At the same time, US oil production nearly doubled from 2008 levels and approached the world-leading \"swing producer\" volumes of Saudi Arabia and Russia, due to the substantial long-term improvement and spread of shale \"fracking\" technology in response to the years of record oil prices These developments led in turn to a plunge in US oil import requirements (moving closer to energy independence), a record volume of worldwide oil inventories, and a collapse in oil prices that continued into early 2016 [117] [119] [120]\n\n\n2017–2020: Production cut and OPEC+\nAs OPEC members grew weary of a multi-year supply-contest with diminishing returns and shrinking financial reserves, the organization finally attempted its first production cut since 2008 Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 million barrels per day was codified by a new quota-agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 – alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale-sector, Libya, Nigeria, spare capacity, and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect Indonesia announced another \"temporary suspension\" of its OPEC membership rather than accepting the organization's requested 5-percent production-cut Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and in May 2017 OPEC decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil-inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then [126] [127] [51] Longtime oil analyst Daniel Yergin \"described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides learning to live with prices that are lower than they would like.\" [128] These production cut deals with non-OPEC countries are generally referred to as OPEC+ [129] [130]\n\n\n2020: Saudi-Russian price war\nIn early March 2020, OPEC officials presented an ultimatum to Russia to cut production by 1.5% of world supply Russia, which foresaw continuing cuts as American shale oil production increased, rejected the demand, ending the three-year partnership between OPEC and major non-OPEC providers [138] Another factor was weakening global demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic [139] This also resulted in 'OPEC plus' failing to extend the agreement cutting 2.1 million barrels per day that was set to expire at the end of March Saudi Arabia, which has absorbed a disproportionate amount of the cuts to convince Russia to stay in the agreement, notified its buyers on 7 March that they would raise output and discount their oil in April This prompted a Brent crude price crash of more than 30% before a slight recovery and widespread turmoil in financial markets [138]\n\n\n2021: Saudi-Emirati dispute\nIn July 2021, OPEC+ member United Arab Emirates rejected a Saudi proposed eight-month extension to oil output curbs which was in place due to COVID-19 and lower oil consumption [147] [148] The previous year, OPEC+ cut the equivalent of about 10% of demand at the time The UAE asked for the maximum amount of oil the group would recognize the country of producing to be raised to 3.8 million barrels a day compared to its previous 3.2 million barrels A compromise deal allowed UAE to increase its maximum oil output to 3.65 million barrels a day [149]\n\n\n2021–present: Global energy crisis\nThe record-high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19, particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia [152] [153] [154] In August 2021, U.S President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan released a statement calling on OPEC+ to boost oil production to \"offset previous production cuts that OPEC+ imposed during the pandemic until well into 2022.\" [155] On 28 September 2021, Sullivan met in Saudi Arabia with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the high oil prices [156] The price of oil was about US$80 by October 2021, [157] [158] [159] the highest since 2014 [160] President Joe Biden and U.S Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm blamed the OPEC+ for rising oil and gas prices [161] [162] [163]\n\n\n2022: Oil production cut\nIn October 2022, OPEC+ led by Saudi Arabia  announced a large cut to its oil output target in order to aid Russia  [168] [169] In response, US President Joe Biden vowed \"consequences\" and said the US government would \"re-evaluate\" the longstanding U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia [170] Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the U.S Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for a freeze on cooperation with and arms sales to Saudi Arabia, accusing the kingdom of helping Russia underwrite its war with Ukraine [171]\n\n\nMembership\nAs of January 2024, OPEC has 12 member countries: five in the Middle East (West Asia), six in Africa, and one in South America [182] According to the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC's combined rate of oil production (including gas condensate) represented 44% of the world's total in 2016, [183] and OPEC accounted for 81.5% of the world's \"proven\" oil reserves Subsequent reports from 2022 indicate that OPEC member countries were then responsible for about 38% of total world crude oil production [4] It is also estimated that these countries hold 79.5% of the globe's proven oil reserves, with the Middle East alone accounting for 67.2% of OPEC's reserves [184] [185]\n\n\nCurrent member countries\nAs of January 2024, OPEC has 12 member countries: five in the Middle East (West Asia), six in Africa, and one in South America [182] According to the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC's combined rate of oil production (including gas condensate) represented 44% of the world's total in 2016, [183] and OPEC accounted for 81.5% of the world's \"proven\" oil reserves Subsequent reports from 2022 indicate that OPEC member countries were then responsible for about 38% of total world crude oil production [4] It is also estimated that these countries hold 79.5% of the globe's proven oil reserves, with the Middle East alone accounting for 67.2% of OPEC's reserves [184] [185]\n\n\nOPEC+\nA number of non-OPEC member countries also participate in the organisation's initiatives such as voluntary supply cuts in order to further bind policy objectives between OPEC and non-OPEC members [13] This loose grouping of countries, known as OPEC+, includes Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brunei, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Russia, South Sudan and Sudan [195] [196]\n\n\nObservers\nSince the 1980s, representatives from Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers This arrangement serves as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies [198]\n\n\nNew members\nUganda and Somaliland with exploration of crude oil may join OPEC in the future, with likely new production dates of 2024-2025, expansion of OPEC with OPEC+ and new country's in exploration, where criteria of OPEC Charter is production of crude oil.\n\n\nLapsed members\nFor countries that export petroleum at relatively low volume, their limited negotiating power as OPEC members would not necessarily justify the burdens imposed by OPEC production quotas and membership costs Ecuador withdrew from OPEC in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2 million membership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under its OPEC quota at the time [98] Ecuador then rejoined in October 2007 before leaving again in January 2020 [202] Ecuador's Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources released an official statement on 2 January 2020 which confirmed that Ecuador had left OPEC [200] Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; [99] it rejoined in July 2016.\n\n\nMarket information\nAs one area in which OPEC members have been able to cooperate productively over the decades, the organisation has significantly improved the quality and quantity of information available about the international oil market This is especially helpful for a natural-resource industry whose smooth functioning requires months and years of careful planning.\n\n\nPublications and research\nIn April 2001, OPEC collaborated with five other international organizations (APEC, Eurostat, IEA, OLADE  [es], UNSD) to improve the availability and reliability of oil data They launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 was joined by IEF and renamed the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI), covering more than 90% of the global oil market GECF joined as an eighth partner in 2014, enabling JODI also to cover nearly 90% of the global market for natural gas [205]\n\n\nCrude oil benchmarks\nA \"crude oil benchmark\" is a standardized petroleum product that serves as a convenient reference price for buyers and sellers of crude oil, including standardized contracts in major futures markets since 1983 Benchmarks are used because oil prices differ (usually by a few dollars per barrel) based on variety, grade, delivery date and location, and other legal requirements [209] [210]\n\n\nSpare capacity\nThe US Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the US Department of Energy, defines spare capacity for crude oil market management \"as the volume of production that can be brought on within 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days .. OPEC spare capacity provides an indicator of the world oil market's ability to respond to potential crises that reduce oil supplies.\" [93]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Organization and Structure**\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is a group of oil-producing countries that have banded together to coordinate their policies and actions in the global oil market. The organization was founded in 1960, and its members are responsible for producing about 40% of the world's total oil output. OPEC's primary goal is to protect the interests of its member countries by stabilizing the global oil market, maintaining prices, and ensuring a fair return on their oil investments.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC underwent significant restructuring, which transformed the global system of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms, known as the Seven Sisters. This transformation gave OPEC the power to nationalize oil production and structure oil prices in their favor without incurring punishment from Western governments and firms. Prior to the creation of OPEC, individual oil-producing states were punished for taking steps to alter the governing arrangements of oil production within their borders.\n\n**Leadership and Decision-Making**\n\nThe OPEC Conference is the supreme authority of the organization and consists of delegations headed by the oil ministers of member countries. The chief executive of the organization is the OPEC Secretary General. The conference meets at least twice a year and in extraordinary sessions when necessary. It operates on the principles of unanimity and \"one member, one vote,\" with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget. Saudi Arabia, being the largest oil exporter, serves as the de facto leader of OPEC.\n\n**International Cartel**\n\nOPEC has been criticized for its apparent anti-competitive cartel behavior through agreements about oil production and price levels. Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition. The organization's agreements have been seen as a way to reduce market competition and stabilize oil prices, but critics argue that they can also lead to higher prices and reduced output.\n\n**Conflicts**\n\nOPEC has difficulty agreeing on policy decisions due to differences among member countries. These differences arise from varying oil export capacities, production costs, reserves, geological features, population, economic development, budgetary situations, and political circumstances. The \"natural resource curse\" can also create conflicts among member countries, as oil reserves can become a source of instability and imbalance. Religion-linked conflicts in the Middle East can also impact OPEC's operations and decisions.\n\n**History and Impact**\n\nOPEC was founded in 1960, and its early years were marked by efforts to stabilize the global oil market and protect the interests of its member countries. The organization's influence grew in the 1970s, particularly after the 1973 oil embargo, which led to a significant increase in oil prices. OPEC's impact on the global oil market has been significant, and its actions have shaped the course of energy policy and oil prices.\n\n**Post-WWII Situation**\n\nIn 1949, Venezuela initiated the move towards the establishment of OPEC, inviting Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia to exchange views and explore avenues for more regular and closer communication among petroleum-exporting nations. The world was recovering from World War II, and some of the world's largest oil fields were just entering production in the Middle East. The United States had established the Interstate Oil Compact Commission to join the Texas Railroad Commission in limiting overproduction.\n\n**1959-1960: Anger from Exporting Countries**\n\nIn February 1959, multinational oil companies unilaterally reduced their posted prices for Venezuelan and Middle Eastern crude oil by 10 percent. This move angered oil-exporting countries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, which led to the establishment of the Maadi Pact or Gentlemen's Agreement. The pact called for an \"Oil Consultation Commission\" of exporting countries, to which MOCs should present price-change plans.\n\n**1960-1975: Founding and Expansion**\n\nThe Baghdad Conference was held in September 1960, where government representatives from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela met to discuss ways to increase the price of crude oil produced by their countries. OPEC was eventually formed in 1960 to secure the best price available from the major oil corporations. The organization's headquarters were initially in Geneva, Switzerland, but were later moved to Vienna, Austria.\n\n**1973-1974: Oil Embargo**\n\nThe oil market was tight in the early 1970s, which reduced the risks for OPEC members in nationalizing their oil production. One of the major fears for OPEC members was that nationalization would cause a steep decline in the price of oil. This prompted a wave of nationalizations in countries such as Libya, Algeria, Iraq, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. With greater control over oil production decisions and amid high oil prices, OPEC members unilaterally raised oil prices in 1973, prompting the 1973 oil crisis.\n\n**1975: Hostage Siege**\n\nOn December 21, 1975, Saudi Arabia's Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Iran's Jamshid Amuzegar, and other OPEC oil ministers were taken hostage at their semi-annual conference in Vienna, Austria. The attack was orchestrated by a six-person team led by Venezuelan terrorist \"Carlos the Jackal\" and resulted in the deaths of three non-ministers.\n\n**1979-1980: Oil Crisis and 1980s Oil Glut**\n\nIn response to a wave of oil nationalizations and high prices, industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on OPEC oil. Electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal, natural gas, or nuclear power, and national governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil. Commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, the North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. By 1986, daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5 million barrels, and non-OPEC production rose by an even-larger amount.\n\n**1990-2003: Ample Supply and Modest Disruptions**\n\nLeading up to his August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was pushing OPEC to end overproduction and send oil prices higher. However, these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions.\n\n**2003-2011: Volatility**\n\nWidespread insurgency and sabotage occurred during the 2003-2008 height of the American occupation of Iraq, coinciding with rapidly increasing oil demand from China and commodity-hungry investors. Recurring violence against the Nigerian oil industry and dwindling spare capacity as a cushion against potential shortages prompted a sharp rise in oil prices to levels far higher than those previously targeted by OPEC.\n\n**2008: Production Dispute**\n\nThe differing economic needs of OPEC member states often affect the internal debates behind OPEC production quotas. Poorer members have pushed for production cuts from fellow members to increase the price of oil and thus their own revenues. These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion.\n\n**2014-2017: Oil Glut**\n\nDuring 2014-2015, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a slowdown in economic growth. At the same time, US oil production nearly doubled from 2008 levels and approached the world-leading \"swing producer\" volumes of Saudi Arabia and Russia, due to the substantial long-term improvement and spread of shale \"fracking\" technology in response to years of record oil prices.\n\n**2017-2020: Production Cut and OPEC+**\n\nAs OPEC members grew weary of a multi-year supply-contest with diminishing returns and shrinking financial reserves, the organization finally attempted its first production cut since 2008. Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 million barrels per day was codified by a new quota-agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference.\n\n**2020: Saudi-Russian Price War**\n\nIn early March 2020, OPEC officials presented an ultimatum to Russia to cut production by 1.5% of world supply. Russia, which foresaw continuing cuts as American shale oil production increased, rejected the demand, ending the three-year partnership between OPEC and major non-OPEC providers.\n\n**2021: Saudi-Emirati Dispute**\n\nIn July 2021, OPEC+ member United Arab Emirates rejected a Saudi proposed eight-month extension to oil output curbs which was in place due to COVID-19 and lower oil consumption.\n\n**2021-2022: Global Energy Crisis**\n\nThe record-high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19, particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia.\n\n**Membership**\n\nAs of January 2024, OPEC has 12 member countries: five in the Middle East (West Asia), six in Africa, and one in South America. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC's combined rate of oil production (including gas condensate) represented 44% of the world's total in 2016, and OPEC accounted for 81.5% of the world's \"proven\" oil reserves.\n\n**OPEC+**\n\nA number of non-OPEC member countries also participate in the organization's initiatives, such as voluntary supply cuts, to further bind policy objectives between OPEC and non-OPEC members. This loose grouping of countries, known as OPEC+, includes Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brunei, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Russia, South Sudan, and Sudan.\n\n**Observers**\n\nSince the 1980s, representatives from Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers. This arrangement serves as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies.\n\n**New Members**\n\nUganda and Somaliland, with exploration of crude oil, may join OPEC in the future, with likely new production dates of 2024-2025.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"OPEC\" following this outline:\n\n\nOrganization and structure\nIn a series of steps in the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC restructured the global system of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms (the Seven Sisters) Coordination among oil-producing states within OPEC made it easier for them to nationalize oil production and structure oil prices in their favor without incurring punishment by Western governments and firms Prior to the creation of OPEC, individual oil-producing states were punished for taking steps to alter the governing arrangements of oil production within their borders States were coerced militarily (e.g in 1953, the US-UK-sponsored a coup against Mohammad Mosaddegh after he nationalized Iran's oil production) or economically (e.g the Seven Sisters slowed down oil production in one non-compliant state and ramped up oil production elsewhere) when acted contrary to the interests of the Seven Sisters and their governments [7]\n\n\nLeadership and decision-making\nThe OPEC Conference is the supreme authority of the organisation, and consists of delegations normally headed by the oil ministers of member countries The chief executive of the organisation is the OPEC secretary general The conference ordinarily meets at the Vienna headquarters, at least twice a year and in additional extraordinary sessions when necessary It generally operates on the principles of unanimity and \"one member, one vote\", with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget [17] However, since Saudi Arabia is by far the largest and most-profitable oil exporter in the world, with enough capacity to function as the traditional swing producer to balance the global market, it serves as \"OPEC's de facto leader\" [18]\n\n\nInternational cartel\nAt various times, OPEC members have displayed apparent anti-competitive cartel behavior through the organisation's agreements about oil production and price levels [19] Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition, as in this definition from OECD's Glossary of Industrial Organisation Economics and Competition Law: [20]\n\n\nConflicts\nOPEC often has difficulty agreeing on policy decisions because its member countries differ widely in their oil export capacities, production costs, reserves, geological features, population, economic development, budgetary situations, and political circumstances [30] [31] Indeed, over the course of market cycles, oil reserves can themselves become a source of serious conflict, instability and imbalances, in what economists call the \"natural resource curse\" [32] [33] A further complication is that religion-linked conflicts in the Middle East are recurring features of the geopolitical landscape for this oil-rich region [34] [35] Internationally important conflicts in OPEC's history have included the Six-Day War (1967), Yom Kippur War (1973), a hostage siege directed by Palestinian militants (1975), the Iranian Revolution (1979), Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), Iraqi occupation of Kuwait (1990–1991), September 11 attacks (2001), American occupation of Iraq (2003–2011), Conflict in the Niger Delta (2004–present), Arab Spring (2010–2012), Libyan Crisis (2011–present), and international Embargo against Iran (2012–2016) Although events such as these can temporarily disrupt oil supplies and elevate prices, the frequent disputes and instabilities tend to limit OPEC's long-term cohesion and effectiveness [36]\n\n\nHistory and impact\nIn 1949, Venezuela initiated the move towards the establishment of what would become OPEC, by inviting Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to exchange views and explore avenues for more regular and closer communication among petroleum-exporting nations as the world recovered from World War II [37] At the time, some of the world's largest oil fields were just entering production in the Middle East The United States had established the Interstate Oil Compact Commission to join the Texas Railroad Commission in limiting overproduction The US was simultaneously the world's largest producer and consumer of oil; the world market was dominated by a group of multinational companies known as the \"Seven Sisters\", five of which were headquartered in the US following the breakup of John D Rockefeller's original Standard Oil monopoly Oil-exporting countries were eventually motivated to form OPEC as a counterweight to this concentration of political and economic power [38]\n\n\nPost-WWII situation\nIn 1949, Venezuela initiated the move towards the establishment of what would become OPEC, by inviting Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to exchange views and explore avenues for more regular and closer communication among petroleum-exporting nations as the world recovered from World War II [37] At the time, some of the world's largest oil fields were just entering production in the Middle East The United States had established the Interstate Oil Compact Commission to join the Texas Railroad Commission in limiting overproduction The US was simultaneously the world's largest producer and consumer of oil;

[81] national governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil; [82] [83] and commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, the North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico [84] By 1986, daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5 million barrels, non-OPEC production rose by an even-larger amount, [85] and OPEC's market share sank from approximately 50 percent in 1979 to less than 30 percent in 1985 [49] Illustrating the volatile multi-year timeframes of typical market cycles for natural resources, the result was a six-year decline in the price of oil, which culminated by plunging more than half in 1986 alone [86] As one oil analyst summarized succinctly: \"When the price of something as essential as oil spikes, humanity does two things: finds more of it and finds ways to use less of it.\" [49]\n\n\n1990–2003: Ample supply and modest disruptions\nLeading up to his August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was pushing OPEC to end overproduction and to send oil prices higher, in order to help OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War [96] But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied [97]\n\n\n2003–2011: Volatility\nWidespread insurgency and sabotage occurred during the 2003–2008 height of the American occupation of Iraq, coinciding with rapidly increasing oil demand from China and commodity-hungry investors, recurring violence against the Nigerian oil industry, and dwindling spare capacity as a cushion against potential shortages This combination of forces prompted a sharp rise in oil prices to levels far higher than those previously targeted by OPEC [104] [105] [106] Price volatility reached an extreme in 2008, as WTI crude oil surged to a record US$147/bbl in July and then plunged back to US$32/bbl in December, during the worst global recession since World War II [107] OPEC's annual oil export revenue also set a new record in 2008, estimated around US$1 trillion, and reached similar annual rates in 2011–2014 (along with extensive petrodollar recycling activity) before plunging again [78] By the time of the 2011 Libyan Civil War and Arab Spring, OPEC started issuing explicit statements to counter \"excessive speculation\" in oil futures markets, blaming financial speculators for increasing volatility beyond market fundamentals [108]\n\n\n2008: Production dispute\nThe differing economic needs of OPEC member states often affect the internal debates behind OPEC production quotas Poorer members have pushed for production cuts from fellow members, to increase the price of oil and thus their own revenues [111] These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion [112] Part of the basis for this policy is the Saudi concern that overly expensive oil or unreliable supply will drive industrial nations to conserve energy and develop alternative fuels, curtailing the worldwide demand for oil and eventually leaving unneeded barrels in the ground [113] To this point, Saudi Oil Minister Yamani famously remarked in 1973: \"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.\" [114] To elucidate Saudi Arabia's contemporary approach, in 2024, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman articulated a stance that reflects how the kingdom has adapted to the evolving economic needs within OPEC and the broader international community Emphasizing the need for a balanced and fair global energy transition, he highlighted the importance of diversifying energy sources and noted significant investments in natural gas, petrochemicals, and renewables These efforts support economic development in emerging countries and align with global climate objectives [115] [116] Additionally, he addressed shifting energy security concerns, stating, \"Energy security in the 70s, 80s, and 90s was more dependent on oil Now, you get what happened last year.. It was gas The future problem on energy security will not be oil It will be renewables And the materials, and the mines.\" [116]\n\n\n2014–2017: Oil glut\nDuring 2014–2015, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a slowdown in economic growth At the same time, US oil production nearly doubled from 2008 levels and approached the world-leading \"swing producer\" volumes of Saudi Arabia and Russia, due to the substantial long-term improvement and spread of shale \"fracking\" technology in response to the years of record oil prices These developments led in turn to a plunge in US oil import requirements (moving closer to energy independence), a record volume of worldwide oil inventories, and a collapse in oil prices that continued into early 2016 [117] [119] [120]\n\n\n2017–2020: Production cut and OPEC+\nAs OPEC members grew weary of a multi-year supply-contest with diminishing returns and shrinking financial reserves, the organization finally attempted its first production cut since 2008 Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 million barrels per day was codified by a new quota-agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 – alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale-sector, Libya, Nigeria, spare capacity, and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect Indonesia announced another \"temporary suspension\" of its OPEC membership rather than accepting the organization's requested 5-percent production-cut Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and in May 2017 OPEC decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil-inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then [126] [127] [51] Longtime oil analyst Daniel Yergin \"described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides learning to live with prices that are lower than they would like.\" [128] These production cut deals with non-OPEC countries are generally referred to as OPEC+ [129] [130]\n\n\n2020: Saudi-Russian price war\nIn early March 2020, OPEC officials presented an ultimatum to Russia to cut production by 1.5% of world supply Russia, which foresaw continuing cuts as American shale oil production increased, rejected the demand, ending the three-year partnership between OPEC and major non-OPEC providers [138] Another factor was weakening global demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic [139] This also resulted in 'OPEC plus' failing to extend the agreement cutting 2.1 million barrels per day that was set to expire at the end of March Saudi Arabia, which has absorbed a disproportionate amount of the cuts to convince Russia to stay in the agreement, notified its buyers on 7 March that they would raise output and discount their oil in April This prompted a Brent crude price crash of more than 30% before a slight recovery and widespread turmoil in financial markets [138]\n\n\n2021: Saudi-Emirati dispute\nIn July 2021, OPEC+ member United Arab Emirates rejected a Saudi proposed eight-month extension to oil output curbs which was in place due to COVID-19 and lower oil consumption [147] [148] The previous year, OPEC+ cut the equivalent of about 10% of demand at the time The UAE asked for the maximum amount of oil the group would recognize the country of producing to be raised to 3.8 million barrels a day compared to its previous 3.2 million barrels A compromise deal allowed UAE to increase its maximum oil output to 3.65 million barrels a day [149]\n\n\n2021–present: Global energy crisis\nThe record-high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19, particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia [152] [153] [154] In August 2021, U.S President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan released a statement calling on OPEC+ to boost oil production to \"offset previous production cuts that OPEC+ imposed during the pandemic until well into 2022.\" [155] On 28 September 2021, Sullivan met in Saudi Arabia with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the high oil prices [156] The price of oil was about US$80 by October 2021, [157] [158] [159] the highest since 2014 [160] President Joe Biden and U.S Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm blamed the OPEC+ for rising oil and gas prices [161] [162] [163]\n\n\n2022: Oil production cut\nIn October 2022, OPEC+ led by Saudi Arabia  announced a large cut to its oil output target in order to aid Russia  [168] [169] In response, US President Joe Biden vowed \"consequences\" and said the US government would \"re-evaluate\" the longstanding U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia [170] Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the U.S Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for a freeze on cooperation with and arms sales to Saudi Arabia, accusing the kingdom of helping Russia underwrite its war with Ukraine [171]\n\n\nMembership\nAs of January 2024, OPEC has 12 member countries: five in the Middle East (West Asia), six in Africa, and one in South America [182] According to the U.S Energy Information

reserves Subsequent reports from 2022 indicate that OPEC member countries were then responsible for about 38% of total world crude oil production [4] It is also estimated that these countries hold 79.5% of the globe's proven oil reserves, with the Middle East alone accounting for 67.2% of OPEC's reserves [184] [185]\n\n\nCurrent member countries\nAs of January 2024, OPEC has 12 member

the future, with likely new production dates of 2024-2025, expansion of OPEC with OPEC+ and new country's in exploration, where criteria of OPEC Charter is production of crude oil.\n\n\nLapsed members\nFor countries that export petroleum at relatively low volume, their limited negotiating power as OPEC members would not necessarily justify the burdens imposed by OPEC production quotas and membership costs Ecuador withdrew from OPEC in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2 million membership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under its OPEC quota at the time [98] Ecuador then rejoined in October 2007 before leaving again in January 2020 [202] Ecuador's Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources released an official statement on 2 January 2020 which confirmed that Ecuador had left OPEC [200] Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; [99] it rejoined in July 2016.\n\n\nMarket information\nAs one area in which OPEC members have been able to cooperate productively over the decades, the organisation has significantly improved the quality and quantity of information available about the international oil market This is especially helpful for a natural-resource industry whose smooth functioning requires months and years of careful planning.\n\n\nPublications and research\nIn April 2001, OPEC collaborated with five other international organizations (APEC, Eurostat, IEA, OLADE  [es], UNSD) to improve the availability and reliability of oil data They launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 was joined by IEF and renamed the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI), covering more than 90% of the global oil market GECF joined as an eighth partner in 2014, enabling JODI also to cover nearly 90% of the global market for natural gas [205]\n\n\nCrude oil benchmarks\nA \"crude oil benchmark\" is a standardized petroleum product that serves as a convenient reference price for buyers and sellers of crude oil, including standardized contracts in major futures markets since 1983 Benchmarks are used because oil prices differ (usually by a few dollars per barrel) based on variety, grade, delivery date and location, and other legal requirements [209] [210]\n\n\nSpare capacity\nThe US Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the US Department of Energy, defines spare capacity for crude oil market management \"as the volume of production that can be brought on within 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days .. OPEC spare capacity provides an indicator of the world oil market's ability to respond to potential crises that reduce oil supplies.\" [93]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Kamala Khan / Ms Marvel [29] Producer Kevin Feige previously said there were plans to introduce Kamala to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following the release of Captain Marvel, because Kamala is inspired by Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel; [30] Iman Vellani was later cast as Kamala for the Disney+ television miniseries Ms Marvel (2022) [31] In March 2019, Feige said Marvel Studios had some

sequel, even if it was set in the present [34]\n\n\nPre-production\nPre-production work began by February 2021, when Zawe Ashton was cast as the film's villain [47] By that time, all of the scripts for Ms Marvel had been written so The Marvels creative team was able to read those to know what happens to Kamala in that series [48] Principal photography was expected to begin at the end of May, [49] though some second unit filming began on April 9 in Jersey City, New Jersey, [50] [51] under the working title Goat Rodeo, [50] [52] to capture aerial footage, establishing shots, and green screen plates [50] [53] In May, Marvel Studios revealed that the sequel would be titled The Marvels [54] Ethan Anderton of /Film noted that the title referred to both Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel, since the film's logo included the same stylized \"S\" from the Ms Marvel series' logo [55] Graeme McMillian at The Hollywood Reporter acknowledged this explanation, but also wondered if there was a connection with the 1994 comics series Marvels—which tells various Marvel Universe events from the perspective of a photographer—or with a project of the same name announced in 2020 He also wondered if \"The Marvels\" referred to a family of heroes, much like DC Comics' Marvel Family (now known as the Shazam Family) [56] Later that month, pre-production work began in the United Kingdom [57]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography was expected to begin on May 31, 2021, [49] but began on July 26, 2021, [19] at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, [19] [49] [62] and at Longcross Studios in Longcross, Surrey, England [19] [65] Sean Bobbitt was the cinematographer [66] Larson confirmed that she had started filming on August 10, [67] and shortly after, Samuel L Jackson revealed that he would reprise his MCU role as Nick Fury, [22] working on it in London at the same time as he was preparing to film Secret Invasion [68] Filming for The Marvels took place in Tropea, Italy, beginning on August 27, including on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea [69] [70] On September 3, Park left for Los Angeles to begin filming [71] Shortly after, Saagar Shaikh, Zenobia Shroff and Mohan Kapur were revealed to be reprising their respective roles as Kamala's older brother Aamir, mother Muneeba, and father Yusuf, from Ms Marvel [21] [8] In October 2021, the film's release was delayed to February 17, 2023 [72] Park shot his scenes for two months, and completed filming in England by November 2 [73] Production designer Cara Brower said the film's scale and scope were massive, contrasting her work with DaCosta on Candyman [74] The production created 54 sets at Pinewood and Longcross Studios for five different planets (including Aladna) and spaceships, the S.A.B.E.R space station, Maria Rambeau's house, and the Khan family's house DaCosta wanted each planet to have a distinct design [19] In April 2022, the film's release was moved to July 28, 2023, swapping places with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, as that film was further along in production [75] [76] Filming of The Marvels wrapped by the middle of the following month [77]\n\n\nPost-production\nJackson revealed in mid-June 2022 that he would return to London in August to work on reshoots for The Marvels, before doing the same for Secret Invasion, [78] and Marvel was preparing for those reshoots by the end of July [79] That month, Larson made a cameo appearance in the last episode of Ms Marvel, \"No Normal\", through footage that DaCosta had filmed for The Marvels DaCosta did not know the footage would be used this way when she filmed it, and its inclusion in Ms Marvel was a surprise to directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah as well [80] Filming for The Marvels occurred in early August in Battery Park in New York City to capture visual effects plates [81] DaCosta was revealed in January 2023 to have also worked on the film's script alongside Elissa Karasik and Zeb Wells, who had respectively served as a writer on Loki and the MCU miniseries She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022), [82] though only DaCosta, McDonnell, and Karasik were credited [83] In February 2023, the film's release was delayed to November 10, 2023, as Disney and Marvel Studios were re-evaluating their content output and costs [84] This allowed more time for post-production [85] [86] Joanna Robinson of The Ringer reported in April that the film was undergoing a \"massive overhaul\" and reshoots, [87] which took place for four weeks to reportedly make the storyline coherent [86]\n\n\nMusic\nIn January 2022, Laura Karpman was hired to compose the score for the film, after previously doing so for the first season of the MCU television series What If...? (2021) and Ms Marvel [94] [95] DaCosta asked Karpman to write a new theme for the titular team rather than focusing on the individual characters, similar to how The Avengers focused on a team theme rather than individual character themes [96] [97] Karpman described the film's main theme, \"Higher Further Faster Together\", as a chosen family theme that combines elements for Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala The theme ends with a choir chanting \"higher, further, faster, together\" in Latin Dar-Benn's \"slithery and jazzy\" theme is mainly played on flutes and was inspired by the music of Herbie Hancock [97] John Ottman's X-Men themes from X2 (2003) and X-Men: Days of Future Past are heard during the mid-credits scene [26]\n\n\nMarketing\nLarson, Parris, and Vellani appeared at the 2022 D23 Expo to promote the film and show exclusive footage [102] A teaser trailer, which featured the song \"Intergalactic\" by Beastie Boys, premiered on Good Morning America on April 11, 2023 [103] Edidiong Mboho of Collider felt the teaser \"delivers on the charm and action the MCU is known for\" [104] Charles Pulliam-Moore at The Verge said the trailer showed that Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala \"are going to end up making quite the team\" and thought the 'place-switching' fight sequences could be the most inventive of the MCU [9] Jackson's appearance in the teaser was considered by some commentators to be a spoiler for the end of Secret Invasion, as it indicated that Fury survives the events of the series despite speculation that the character could die by the end of it [105] [106] Marvel Studios and Bic partnered to create limited-edition pens inspired by the film, as well as the \"Write with Might\" sweepstakes that offered a chance to win a trip to the film's premiere [107] Pita Pit was also partnered with Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Pictures to launch the brand new limited edition smoothie \"Banana Chai\" to promote the film [108] In September 2023, DaCosta expressed concern that she would be promoting the film on her own since the cast were not able to participate in marketing during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike [109] The strike ultimately did not end until after the film's premiere, which was held in Las Vegas on November 7 without the cast [110] Marvel collaborated with software company Autodesk to display a video of Goose, Danvers's cat-like pet Flerken, on the Sphere through November 13 [111] The strike ended on November 9, and Larson was booked to appear on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the next day to promote the film [112]\n\n\nRelease\nThe

Longcross, Surrey, England [19] [65] Sean Bobbitt was the cinematographer [66] Larson confirmed that she had started filming on August 10, [67] and shortly after, Samuel L Jackson revealed that he would reprise his MCU role as Nick Fury, [22] working on it in London at the same time as he was preparing to film Secret Invasion [68] Filming for The Marvels took place in Tropea, Italy, beginning on August 27, including on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea [69] [70] On September 3, Park left for Los Angeles to begin filming [71] Shortly after, Saagar Shaikh, Zenobia Shroff and Mohan Kapur were revealed to be reprising their respective roles as Kamala's older brother Aamir, mother Muneeba, and father Yusuf, from Ms Marvel [21] [8] In October 2021, the film's release was delayed to February 17, 2023 [72] Park shot his scenes for two months, and completed filming in England by November 2 [73] Production designer Cara Brower said the film's scale and scope were massive, contrasting her work with DaCosta on Candyman [74] The production created 54 sets at Pinewood and Longcross Studios for five different planets (including Aladna) and spaceships, the S.A.B.E.R space station, Maria Rambeau's house, and the Khan family's house DaCosta wanted each planet to have a distinct design [19] In April 2022, the film's release was moved to July 28, 2023, swapping places with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, as that film was further along in production [75] [76] Filming of The Marvels wrapped by the middle of the following month [77]\n\n\nPost-production\nJackson revealed in mid-June 2022 that he would return to London in August to work on reshoots for The Marvels, before doing the same for Secret Invasion, [78] and Marvel was preparing for those reshoots by the end of July [79] That month, Larson made a cameo appearance in the last episode of Ms Marvel, \"No Normal\", through footage that DaCosta had filmed for The Marvels DaCosta did not know the footage would be used this way when she filmed it, and its inclusion in Ms Marvel was a surprise to directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah as well [80] Filming for The Marvels occurred in early August in Battery Park in New York City to capture visual effects plates [81] DaCosta was revealed in January 2023 to have also worked on the film's script alongside Elissa Karasik and Zeb Wells, who had respectively served as a writer on Loki and the MCU miniseries She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022), [82] though only DaCosta, McDonnell, and Karasik were credited [83] In February 2023, the film's release was delayed to November 10, 2023, as Disney and Marvel Studios were re-evaluating their content output and costs [84] This allowed more time for post-production [85] [86] Joanna Robinson of The Ringer reported in April that the film was undergoing a \"massive overhaul\" and reshoots, [87] which took place for four weeks to reportedly make the storyline coherent [86]\n\n\nMusic\nIn January 2022, Laura Karpman was hired to compose the score for the film, after previously doing so for the first season of the MCU television series What If...? (2021) and Ms Marvel [94] [95] DaCosta asked Karpman to write a new theme for the titular team rather than focusing on the individual characters, similar to how The Avengers focused on a team theme rather than individual character themes [96] [97] Karpman described the film's main theme, \"Higher Further Faster Together\", as a chosen family theme that combines elements for Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala The theme ends with a choir chanting \"higher, further, faster, together\" in Latin Dar-Benn's \"slithery and jazzy\" theme is mainly played on flutes and was inspired by the music of Herbie Hancock [97] John Ottman's X-Men themes from X2 (2003) and X-Men: Days of Future Past are heard during the mid-credits scene [26]\n\n\nMarketing\nLarson, Parris, and Vellani appeared at the 2022 D23 Expo to promote the film and show exclusive footage [102] A teaser trailer, which featured the song \"Intergalactic\" by Beastie Boys, premiered on Good Morning America on April 11, 2023 [103] Edidiong Mboho of Collider felt the teaser \"delivers on the charm and action the MCU is known for\" [104] Charles Pulliam-Moore at The Verge said the trailer showed that Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala \"are going to end up making quite the team\" and thought the 'place-switching' fight sequences could be the most inventive of the MCU [9] Jackson's appearance in the teaser was considered by some commentators to be a spoiler for the end of Secret Invasion, as it indicated that Fury survives the events of the series despite speculation that the character could die by the end of it [105] [106] Marvel Studios and Bic partnered to create limited-edition pens inspired by the film, as well as the \"Write with Might\" sweepstakes that offered a chance to win a trip to the film's premiere [107] Pita Pit was also partnered with Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Pictures to launch the brand new limited edition smoothie \"Banana Chai\" to promote the film [108] In September 2023, DaCosta expressed concern that she would be promoting the film on her own since the cast were not able to participate in marketing during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike [109] The strike ultimately did not end until after the film's premiere, which was held in Las Vegas on November 7 without the cast [110] Marvel collaborated with software company Autodesk to display a video of Goose, Danvers's cat-like pet Flerken, on the Sphere through November 13 [111] The strike ended on November 9, and Larson was booked to appear on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the next day to promote the film [112]\n\n\nRelease\nThe

[116] IMAX Corporation CEO Richard Gelfond said the company would pivot to showing The Marvels in IMAX should Dune: Part Two be delayed by the SAG-AFTRA strike, [116] and this was confirmed in August when the film was moved to March 2024 [114] [117] Before it was set for the November 2023 release date, The Marvels was scheduled for July 8, 2022, [37] November 11, 2022, [54] February 17, 2023, [72]

He then managed the Dallas Office Building development operations of Trammell Crow Company from 1978 to 1986. During this time, Crow oversaw the development of various office buildings and commercial properties in the Dallas area.

Under his leadership, the company expanded its operations and acquired several new hotels.\n\nIn 1988, Crow assumed responsibility for Crow Holdings, a company founded by his father.

Through his efforts, Crow Holdings became a successful and profitable company, with a diverse portfolio of commercial and residential properties.\n\n**Political Activities**\n\nCrow is a member of the founding committee of the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group that promotes limited government and free market principles.

rink\nRingette games are played on ice rinks either indoors or outdoors Playing area, size, lines and markings for the standard Canadian ringette rink are similar to the average 85-by-200-foot (26 m × 61 m) Canadian ice hockey rink with certain modifications [21] [22] [23] [24] An exception exists for European ice hockey rinks which may be slightly larger in size A ringette rink uses most (but not all) of the standard ice hockey markings used by Hockey Canada but with additional markings: five free pass circles (each with a bisecting line) with two in each end zone and one at centre ice, four free-pass dots in each of the end zones, two free-pass dots in the centre zone, and a line demarcating a larger goal crease area which is shaped in a semi-circular fashion Two additional free-play lines (also known as a \"ringette line\" or \"extended zone line\") are also required, with one in each end zone.\n\n\nEquipment\nRingette uses a blue, rubber, pneumatic ring designed for play on an ice surface The official ring has a diameter of 16.5 cm [citation needed]\n\n\nGoaltenders\nGoalies in ringette use protective equipment that is similar to the equipment used in ice hockey While ice hockey goaltending equipment is used, there are a few differences For example, goalies in ringette wear leg pads and use the same goalie skates and goalie stick as goalies in hockey Nonetheless, goalies are required to wear a combination of a ringette-approved helmet, facemask, and throat protector Moreover, they must also wear genital protection, chest and arm protectors, and pants.\n\n\nVariants\nThere are two off-ice variants of ringette: in-line ringette and gym ringette, played wearing shoes Gym ringette was developed in Canada as a floor variant of ringette in the 1990s, largely by Ringette Canada [citation needed] [9] [10] It is meant to be played as a stand-alone activity or as a form of dry-land training to help players develop skills which are transferable to the ice sport [11] In-line ringette is played as an informal alternative, but a consistent set formal rules have not been codified and sizeable organizing bodies do not exist Ringette does not have any parasport variant.\n\n\nHistory\nRingette was created in Northern Ontario, Canada, as a civic recreation project for girls by its two founders, [31] Sam Jacks from North Bay, Ontario, and Red McCarthy from Espanola, Ontario [32] [33] Jacks is credited with creating the idea for the sport in 1963, following his earlier development of a variant of floor hockey [34] in 1936, [35] [36] which used bladeless sticks and a flat felt disk with a hole in the centre [37] McCarthy was responsible for developing the sport's first rules [38] Ringette was created in the hopes of increasing and maintaining female participation in winter sports under the existing authority of the Society of Directors of Municipal Recreation of Ontario (SDMRO) and the Northern Ontario Recreation Directors Association (NORDA) due to a lack of success in generating interest among the young female population in the winter team sports of girls' broomball and girls' ice hockey [33]

sports and are meant to serve as the female equivalent, rather than being sports developed for females Canadian media and parts of the ringette community increasingly avoid calling ringette a girls' sport in spite of its heritage [33] [109]\n\n\nPopular culture\nCanada Post issued four stamps in a series of sports with Canadian origins: ringette, basketball, five-pin bowling and lacrosse [110]

is a fast-paced and exciting ice sport that is played on ice rinks by two teams of six players each. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by shooting a blue, hollow, rubber ring into the opponent's goal net using a long, straight stick with a tapered end.\n\n## Play\n\nRingette is a unique sport that combines elements of hockey, lacrosse, and soccer. The game is played on an ice rink, with the two teams competing against each other to score goals. Each team consists of six players: a goalie, a crease player, and four other players who can shoot the ring and move around the rink.\n\nThe ring is the most distinctive element of the game, and it is designed to be shot into the opponent's goal net. The ring is made of a hard, blue rubber material and has a diameter of 16.5 cm. The ring is shot using a stick, which is similar to a hockey stick but has a tapered end and a drag-tip.\n\n## Ringette Rink\n\nRingette games are played on ice rinks that are similar to hockey rinks but with some modifications. The standard Canadian ringette rink is 85-by-200 feet (26 m x 61 m) in size, with the goal crease area being shaped in a semi-circular fashion. The rink also has additional markings, including five free pass circles and four free pass dots in each end zone.\n\n## Equipment\n\nRingette players use a variety of equipment, including ice skates, helmets, and sticks. Goalies also wear protective equipment, including a ringette-approved helmet, facemask, and throat protector. The ring is made of a hard, blue rubber material and has a diameter of 16.5 cm.\n\n## Goaltenders\n\nGoalies in ringette use protective equipment that is similar to hockey goaltending equipment.

They must also wear genital protection, chest, and arm protectors, and pants.\n\n## Variants\n\nThere are two off-ice variants of ringette: in-line ringette and gym ringette. In-line ringette is played on a smooth surface using in-line skates, while gym ringette is played on a floor using shoes. Gym ringette was developed in Canada as a floor variant of ringette in the 1990s.\n\n## History\n\nRingette was created in Northern Ontario, Canada, as a civic recreation project for girls by its two founders, Sam Jacks and Red McCarthy.

including a minor effect on men's professional ice hockey and a larger impact on girls' and women's ice hockey.\n\n\nCulture\nRingette remains one of the few organized sports worldwide where most of its elite athletes identify as women rather than men Many women's sports are variants of male-dominated sports and are meant to serve as the female equivalent, rather than being sports developed for females Canadian media and parts of the ringette community increasingly avoid calling ringette a girls' sport in spite of its heritage [33] [109]\n\n\nPopular culture\nCanada Post issued four stamps in a series of sports with Canadian origins: ringette, basketball, five-pin bowling and lacrosse [110] [111] The commemorative stamps were issued on August 10, 2009, and featured well-worn equipment used in each sport with a background line drawing of the appropriate playing surface.\n\n\nMales in ringette\nAlthough mixed teams have appeared, there is a social stigma against males playing

700 men playing ringette in Canada in the 2013–14 season, the number has dropped drastically [citation needed] Some provinces have embraced men in ringette, like Ringette BC, while other provinces

{"title": "George_III", "content": "\nEarly life\nGeorge was born in Norfolk House in St James's Square, London, on 4 June 1738 [c] He was a grandson of King George II and the eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha As he was born two months prematurely, and thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by Thomas Secker, who was both Rector of St James's Church, Piccadilly, and Bishop of Oxford [3] [4] One month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker His godparents were King Frederick I of Sweden (for whom Lord Baltimore stood proxy), his uncle Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha (for whom Lord Carnarvon stood proxy), and his great-aunt Sophia Dorothea, Queen in Prussia (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin stood proxy) [5]\n\n\nAccession and marriage\nIn 1759, George was smitten with Lady Sarah Lennox, sister of Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage \"I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation,\" he wrote, \"and consequently must often act contrary to my passions.\" [15] Nevertheless, George and his mother resisted attempts by the King to marry George to Princess Sophie Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel [16] Sophie Caroline instead married Frederick, Margrave of Bayreuth [17]\n\n\nEarly reign\nGeorge, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.\" [23] He inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain [24] During George III's lengthy reign, Britain was a constitutional monarchy, ruled by his ministerial government and prominent men in Parliament [25] Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, [e] the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War [27] George came to be perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat [1]\n\n\nEarly regnal years\nGeorge, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.\" [23] He inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain [24] During George III's lengthy reign, Britain was a constitutional monarchy, ruled by his ministerial government and prominent men in Parliament [25] Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, [e] the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War [27] George came to be perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat [1]\n\n\nLegislation and politics\nIn May 1762, the incumbent Whig government of Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, was replaced with one led by Lord Bute, a Scottish Tory Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny that he was having an affair with the King's mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish sentiment amongst the English [36] John Wilkes, a member of parliament, published The North Briton, which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons and found guilty in absentia of blasphemy and libel [37] In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power Britain received enormous concessions, including West Florida Britain restored to France lucrative slave-sugar islands in the West Indies, including Guadeloupe and Martinique The treaty also ended French control over nearly all of New France; Canada was ceded to Britain in its entirety, while Louisiana was divided in two, with the eastern half (from the Allegheny Mountains to the Mississippi River) ceded to Britain and the western half, plus the city of New Orleans, ceded to Spain [38]\n\n\nFamily issues and discontent in America\nGeorge was deeply devout and spent hours in prayer, [50] but his piety was not shared by his brothers George was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals In 1770, his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was exposed as an adulterer The following year, Henry married a young widow, Anne Horton The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession [51]\n\n\nAmerican War of Independence\nThe American War of Independence was the culmination of the civil and political American Revolution In the 1760s, a series of acts by Parliament was met with resistance in Britain's Thirteen Colonies in America In particular they rejected new taxes levied by Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation The colonies had previously enjoyed a high level of autonomy in their internal affairs and viewed Parliament's acts as a denial of their rights as Englishmen [57] Armed conflict began between British regulars and colonial militiamen at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775 The Second Continental Congress sent petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament, but the King and Parliament ignored them George declared the American leaders to be traitors and a year of fighting ensued Thomas Paine's book Common Sense referred to George III as \"the Royal Brute of Great Britain\" [58]\n\n\nMid reign\nWith the collapse of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became prime minister for the second time, but died within months The King then appointed Lord Shelburne to replace him Charles James Fox, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland In 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the Fox–North Coalition Portland became prime minister, with Fox and Lord North, as foreign secretary and home secretary respectively [8]\n\n\nGovernment\nWith the collapse of Lord North's ministry in

Fox–North Coalition Portland became prime minister, with Fox and Lord North, as foreign secretary and home secretary respectively [8]\n\n\nIllness\nBy this time, George's health was deteriorating He had a mental illness characterised by acute mania Until the mid-20th century, the King's illness was generally considered to be psychological In 1966, a study by Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter suggested that the illness was physiological, caused by the liver disorder porphyria [91] Although meeting with some contemporary opposition, [92] the view subsequently gained widespread scholarly acceptance [93] A study of samples of George's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a cause of metabolic blood disorders and thus a possible trigger for porphyria The source of the arsenic is not known, but it could have been a component of medicines or cosmetics [94] The theory was also established in the public mind through influential dramatisations, such as Alan Bennett's play The Madness of George III, and in Nicholas Hytner's subsequent film From 2010, this view has been increasingly challenged, and Macalpine and Hunter's study criticised [95] [96] [97] Recent scholarship discounts the porphyria theory and contends that George's illness was psychiatric, most probably bipolar disorder [98]\n\n\nLater reign\nAfter George's recovery, his popularity, and that of Pitt, continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales [106] His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, Margaret Nicholson in 1786 and John Frith in 1790, contributed to his popularity [107] James Hadfield's failed attempt to shoot George in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the apocalyptic delusions of Hadfield and Bannister Truelock George seemed unperturbed by the incident, so much so that he fell asleep in the interval [108]\n\n\nWar in Europe\nAfter George's recovery, his popularity, and that of Pitt, continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales [106] His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, Margaret Nicholson in 1786 and John Frith in 1790, contributed to his popularity [107] James Hadfield's failed attempt to shoot George in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by

(1738-1820) was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover. He ruled the kingdom for nearly 60 years, from 1760 to 1820, and was the longest-reigning British monarch of the 18th century.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGeorge was born on June 4, 1738, at Norfolk House in St James's Square, London, to Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. He was a grandson of King George II and the eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales. George was born two months prematurely and was baptized the same day by Thomas Secker, who was both Rector of St James's Church, Piccadilly, and Bishop of Oxford. One month later, he was publicly baptized at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were King Frederick I of Sweden, his uncle Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha, and his great-aunt Sophia Dorothea, Queen in Prussia.\n\n**Accession and Marriage**\n\nIn 1759, George was smitten with Lady Sarah Lennox, sister of Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage. George and his mother resisted attempts by the King to marry George to Princess Sophie Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Sophie Caroline instead married Frederick, Margrave of Bayreuth.\n\n**Early Reign**\n\nGeorge, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.\" He inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain. During George III's lengthy reign, Britain was a constitutional monarchy, ruled by his ministerial government and prominent men in Parliament. Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War. George came to be perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat.\n\n**Legislation and Politics**\n\nIn May 1762, the incumbent Whig government of Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, was replaced with one led by Lord Bute, a Scottish Tory. Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny that he was having an affair with the King's mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish sentiment amongst the English. John Wilkes, a member of parliament, published The North Briton, which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons and found guilty in absentia of blasphemy and libel. In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power. Britain received enormous concessions, including West Florida. Britain restored to France lucrative slave-sugar islands in the West Indies, including Guadeloupe and Martinique. The treaty also ended French control over nearly all of New France; Canada was ceded to Britain in its entirety, while Louisiana was divided in two, with the eastern half ceded to Britain and the western half, plus the city of New Orleans, ceded to Spain.\n\n**Family Issues and Discontent in America**\n\nGeorge was deeply devout and spent hours in prayer, but his piety was not shared by his brothers. George was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals. In 1770, his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was exposed as an adulterer. The following year, Henry married a young widow, Anne Horton. The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession.\n\n**American War of Independence**\n\nThe American War of Independence was the culmination of the civil and political American Revolution. In the 1760s, a series of acts by Parliament was met with resistance in Britain's Thirteen Colonies in America. In particular, they rejected new taxes levied by Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation. The colonies had previously enjoyed a high level of autonomy in their internal affairs and viewed Parliament's acts as a denial of their rights as Englishmen. Armed conflict began between British regulars and colonial militiamen at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The Second Continental Congress sent petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament, but the King and Parliament ignored them. George declared the American leaders to be traitors and a year of fighting ensued. Thomas Paine's book Common Sense referred to George III as \"the Royal Brute of Great Britain\".\n\n**Mid Reign**\n\nWith the collapse of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became prime minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then appointed Lord Shelburne to replace him. Charles James Fox, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the Fox–North Coalition. Portland became prime minister, with Fox and Lord North, as foreign secretary and home secretary respectively.\n\n**Illness**\n\nBy this time, George's health was deteriorating. He had a mental illness characterised by acute mania. Until the mid-20th century, the King's illness was generally considered to be psychological. In 1966, a study by Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter suggested that the illness was physiological, caused by the liver disorder porphyria. Although meeting with some contemporary opposition, the view subsequently gained widespread scholarly acceptance. A study of samples of George's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a cause of metabolic blood disorders and thus a possible trigger for porphyria. The source of the arsenic is not known, but it could have been a component of medicines or cosmetics. The theory was also established in the public mind through influential dramatisations, such as Alan Bennett's play The Madness of George III, and in Nicholas Hytner's subsequent film. From 2010, this view has been increasingly challenged, and Macalpine and Hunter's study criticised. Recent scholarship discounts the porphyria theory and contends that George's illness was psychiatric, most probably bipolar disorder.\n\n**Later Reign**\n\nAfter George's recovery, his popularity, and that of Pitt, continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales. His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, Margaret Nicholson in 1786 and John Frith in 1790, contributed to his popularity. James Hadfield's failed attempt to shoot George in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the apocalyptic delusions of Hadfield and Bannister Truelock. George seemed unperturbed by the incident, so much so that he fell asleep in the interval.\n\n**War in Europe**\n\nAfter George's recovery, his popularity, and that of Pitt, continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales.

The team is controlled by the Football Association of Serbia, which is a member of UEFA and a part of FIFA.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Football Federation of what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) was founded in Zagreb in 1919 under the name Jugoslavenski nogometni savez (Yugoslavian Football Association). Jovan Ružić was the first Serb to represent the national team in its international debut match, a 7–0 drubbing by Czechoslovakia at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\n**Serbia within Yugoslavia (1920–1992)**\n\nThe Football Federation of what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) was founded in Zagreb in 1919 under the name Jugoslavenski nogometni savez (Yugoslavian Football Association). Jovan Ružić was the first Serb to represent the national team in its international debut match, a 7–0 drubbing by Czechoslovakia at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\n**FR Yugoslavia/Serbia & Montenegro era (1992–2006)**\n\nWhile the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, was formed on 27 April 1992, its teams were banned from all international sporting events, including the national football team as a result of U.N sanctions stemming from the conflict in Yugoslavia. Consequently, the national team did not play its first game as a new country before 23 December 1994, a friendly match played in Porto Alegre and in which Brazil won 2–0. This was the first ever team composed of Serbian and Montenegrin players exclusively, while Slobodan Santrač, a former Yugoslavia national team player, was named the team's first ever manager. The next game was played three days later, this time in Buenos Aires, resulting in a 1–0 loss to Argentina.\n\n**1998 World Cup**\n\nAs FR Yugoslavia joined FIFA and UEFA in 1994, the team was available to participate in the 1998 World Cup qualifiers. Slobodan Santrač was appointed manager for the team. In the qualifiers, Yugoslavia was drawn in Group 6 with Euro 1996 runners-up Czech Republic, Slovakia, Spain, Faroe Islands and Malta. With 23 points, Yugoslavia ended up in second place behind Spain. Yugoslavia qualified for the play-off in which they were drawn to play against Hungary. Winning 12–1 on aggregate, Yugoslavia qualified for the World Cup.\n\n**Euro 2000**\n\nThe draw for the Euro 2000 qualifiers saw first-seeded Yugoslavia drawn in a group with Croatia, thus marking the first games between the two teams after the breakup of Yugoslavia. The other teams in the group were the Republic of Ireland, Macedonia, and Malta. Milan Živadinović was dismissed and was replaced by Vujadin Boškov.\n\n**2002 World Cup campaign**\n\nIlija Petković replaced Boškov as head coach in July 2000. For the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, Yugoslavia was drawn in Group 1 with Russia, Slovenia, Switzerland, the Faroe Islands and Luxembourg. After winning against Luxembourg, Petković was sacked and replaced with a three-pieced team which consisted of Boškov, Dejan Savićević and Ivan Ćurković. Despite winning both games against Luxembourg and Faroe Islands as well and away game against Switzerland, Yugoslavia managed to suffer a home loss and away draw against Russia, a home draw against Switzerland and both draw games against Slovenia. Yugoslavia ended the qualifying campaign in the third place of the group just one point behind second-placed Slovenia.\n\n**Euro 2004 campaign**\n\nSavićević was appointed as coach in July 2002. For the Euro 2004 qualifiers Yugoslavia was drawn in Group 9 with Italy, Wales, Finland and Azerbaijan. During qualifying, the country went under a political transformation, and the newly named Serbia and Montenegro appeared for the first time in a game against Azerbaijan in February 2003. In June, after a 2–1 loss to Azerbaijan, Savićević resigned and was replaced by Ilija Petković. Despite drawing both games against eventual group winners Italy and winning both games against runners-up Wales, Serbia and Montenegro failed to qualify, mostly due to a 2–2 home draw, the 2–1 loss to Azerbaijan, as well as a 3–0 away loss to Finland.\n\n**2006 World Cup**\n\nPetković remained as manager for the team. Qualifying for the 2006 World Cup resulted in six wins and four draws, with Serbia and Montenegro ending up first in the group with an undefeated record in their qualification group ahead of Spain, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania and San Marino. The Serbia and Montenegro team also allowed only one goal in the ten matches, the best defensive record of all 51 teams participating in qualification.\n\n**Independent Serbia (2006–present)**\n\nJavier Clemente, Serbia's first-ever foreign coach, was appointed to lead the team for the 2008 Euro campaign. After Montenegro declared independence, Serbia marked their split from Montenegro with a 3–1 win over the Czech Republic. For the Euro 2008 qualifiers, Serbia was drawn in Group A along with Poland, Portugal, Belgium, Finland, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan. A strong start in qualification was overshadowed by the final hurdle of matches where inconsistency took over, the side dropping points against the likes of Finland, Belgium, Armenia and Kazakhstan. They eventually finished third, three points behind runners-up Portugal and Group A winners Poland. Clemente was sacked after the team's failure to qualify.\n\n**Euro 2008 campaign**\n\nJavier Clemente, Serbia's first-ever foreign coach, was appointed to lead the team for the 2008 Euro campaign.

The region that is now Pakistan has been home to several major civilizations, including the Indus Valley Civilization, the Gandhara Civilization, and the Mughal Empire.\n\n**Lower Paleolithic**\n\nThe earliest human habitation in the region that is now Pakistan dates back to the Lower Paleolithic era, approximately 1.9 million years ago. The pebble stones from the archaeological site of Riwat, Murree have been discovered, dating back to this period. These early humans likely lived in the region due to its proximity to the Indus River, which provided a reliable source of water and food.\n\n**Middle Paleolithic**\n\nDuring the Middle Paleolithic era, human habitation in the region increased. Flake tools, microliths, and other chopping tools have been found in the Soan Valley, which were composed of metamorphic quartzite rocks. These stone tool artifacts are identified as part of the second inter-pluvial period in Pakistan.\n\n**Upper Paleolithic**\n\nIn the Upper Paleolithic era, human habitation in the region continued to grow. The Riwat 55 site contains a structure that includes a low wall footing, a pit, and a stone-lined niche, all associated with a freshly flaked stone assemblage that included blades. This suggests that early humans in the region were capable of creating complex structures and tools.\n\n**Indus Valley Civilization (35th century BCE - 19th century BCE)**\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, was a major civilization that flourished in the region that is now Pakistan and northwestern India. Over the course of 1,500 years, the inhabitants of this civilization developed new techniques in handicraft, such as carnelian products and seal carving, and metallurgy, including copper, bronze, lead, and tin. They also had elaborate urban planning, baked brick houses, efficient drainage systems, water supply systems, and clusters of large non-residential buildings. The civilization depended significantly on trade and was the first civilization to use wheeled transport in the form of bullock carts and boats.\n\n**Gandhara Civilization (27th century BCE - 6th century CE)**\n\nThe Gandhara Civilization was a major civilization that flourished in the region that is now Pakistan and northwestern India. It was a major center of Buddhism and was known for its beautiful art and architecture. Taxila became a major center of the Gandhara Civilization and was a major hub of Buddhist learning and culture.\n\n**Mughal Empire (16th century CE - 19th century CE)**\n\nThe Mughal Empire was a major empire that flourished in the region that is now Pakistan and India. It was founded by Babur in 1526 and was known for its beautiful art, architecture, and literature. The Mughal Empire was a major center of Islamic learning and culture and was known for its tolerant and inclusive policies.\n\n**British Rule (19th century CE - 1947 CE)**\n\nThe British East India Company was established in India in the early 17th century and gradually expanded its control over the region that is now Pakistan. The British Raj was established in 1858 and lasted until the Partition of India in 1947. During this period, the region was heavily influenced by British culture and was a major center of trade and commerce.\n\n**Post-Independence (1947 CE - present)**\n\nAfter the Partition of India in 1947, Pakistan was established as a separate country. The country has since been a major center of Islamic learning and culture and has played a significant role in international affairs. Pakistan has faced several challenges, including economic instability, political unrest, and terrorism. However, the country has also made significant progress in various fields, including education, healthcare, and technology.\n\n**Modern Pakistan (1950s CE - present)**\n\nIn the 1950s, Pakistan began to develop its economy and infrastructure. The country established its own currency, the rupee, and began to import goods from other countries. Pakistan also began to develop its education system and established several universities and colleges. The country has since continued to develop its economy and infrastructure and has become a major player in international affairs.\n\n**Contemporary Pakistan (1980s CE - present)**\n\nIn the 1980s, Pakistan began to experience significant economic growth and development. The country established its own space program and began to develop its nuclear capabilities. Pakistan also began to play a significant role in international affairs, particularly in the Middle East. The country has since continued to develop its economy and infrastructure and has become a major player in regional and global affairs.\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of Pakistan\n* Timeline of Indian history\n* Indus Valley Civilization\n* Gandhara Civilization\n* Mughal Empire\n* British Raj\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is based on various sources, including:\n* Pakistan: A Modern History by Ian Talbot\n* A History of Pakistan by Francis Robinson\n* The Indus Valley Civilization by George F.

The film tells the story of a young woman's journey to self-discovery in 1960s London.\n\nIn 2010, Norton was an original cast member of \"Posh\" at the Royal Court Theatre. The play explores the lives of privileged students at a private school and their experiences with class, privilege, and social status. Norton's performance in the play received positive reviews, with critics praising his portrayal of the complex and nuanced characters.\n\nNorton's next major role was in the First World War drama \"Journey's End,\" where he played the role of Captain Stanhope. The play follows the lives of a group of soldiers in the trenches and explores the psychological and emotional toll of war. The production toured the UK from March to June and transferred to the Duke of York's Theatre in the West End from July to September.\n\nIn 2012, Norton took on the role of Geoffrey in \"The Lion in Winter\" at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, directed by Trevor Nunn. The play tells the story of the complex relationships between the Plantagenet family, including King Henry II, his wife Eleanor, and their three sons. Norton's performance in the play received positive reviews, with critics praising his portrayal of the complex and nuanced characters.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nWhen asked about his relationship with religion, Norton stated that he has a connection to it due to his Catholic upbringing and studies in theology. However, he emphasized that he cannot call himself religious, but rather is fascinated by the subject. Norton's interest in religion and his experiences with it have likely influenced his portrayal of characters in various productions, including his role as a vicar in the TV series \"Grantchester.\"\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **Film**\n\t+ \"An Education\" (2009)\n\t+ \"Another Me\" (2013)\n\t+ \"Brighton Rock\" (2010)\n\t+ \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" (2016)\n\t+ \"Locke\" (2013)\n\t+ \"Mr. Holmes\" (2015)\n\t+ \"Brooklyn\" (2015)\n\t+ \"The Exception\" (2016)\n\t+ \"Howards End\" (2017)\n\t+ \"Seberg\" (2019)\n* **Television**\n\t+ \"Grantchester\" (TV series, 2014-2019)\n\t+ \"The Line of Duty\" (TV series, 2016-2017)\n\t+ \"War & Peace\" (TV miniseries, 2016)\n* **Video Games**\n\t+ \"Assassin's Creed: Odyssey\" (2018)\n* **Theatre**\n\t+ \"An Ideal Husband\" (play, 2009)\n\t+ \"An Education\" (play, 2009)\n\t+ \"Posh\" (play, 2010)\n\t+ \"Journey's End\" (play, 2011)\n\t+ \"The Lion in Winter\" (play, 2012)\n\t+ \"Wolf Hall\" (play, 2013)\n\t+ \"Coriolanus\" (play, 2014)\n\t+ \"A View from the Bridge\" (play, 2015)\n\t+ \"Othello\" (play, 2016)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nNorton has been nominated for several awards, including a BAFTA TV Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in \"Grantchester.\" He has also been nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor for his performance in \"Journey's End.\"\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**External Links**\n\n* James Norton on IMDb\n* James Norton on Twitter\n* James Norton on Instagram", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Norton_(actor)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nNorton was born in Lambeth, London, [1] the son of Hugh Biddulph Norton and Lavinia Jane Norman [3] His parents were both teachers; his father, who was born in Tanzania, was a lecturer at Hull School of Art and Design [4] [5] Though originally from London, Norton's family lived in the town of Malton in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire [6] [7] Norton, who grew up at the edge of the Howardian Hills in North Yorkshire, has described his childhood as \"idyllic\" [8] His grandfather, Ian Norton MBE (1923–2003), a colonial official in Tanganyika, [9] was son of Hugh Ross Norton OBE, Archdeacon of Sudbury from 1945 to 1962; Ian's wife, Jean (1923–2016), was daughter of Colonel Francis John Biddulph, of the Royal Engineers The Biddulphs were a branch of an Irish landed gentry family [10]\n\n\nCareer\nNorton appeared as a classmate of Jenn in the film An Education, starring Carey Mulligan, in 2009 [16] In 2010 he was an original cast member of Posh at the Royal Court Theatre [17] At the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield in 2010, Norton starred in That Face as Henry, an 18-year-old who has dropped out of school to care for his mentally disturbed and drug-dependent mother, played by Frances Barber Lynne Walker of The Independent wrote of his performance: \"At the centre of it all is Henry who, in James Norton's striking portrayal, is like a young caged animal.\" [18] In 2011, Norton starred as Captain Stanhope in the First World War drama Journey's End [19] The production toured the UK from March to June and transferred to the Duke of York's Theatre in the West End from July to September [7] Norton then took the role of Geoffrey in The Lion in Winter at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket directed by Trevor Nunn, with whom Norton had worked at Cambridge in Cymbeline [16]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhen asked if he was religious, in the context of portraying a vicar in Grantchester, Norton said: \"Obviously I have a relationship with religion, because I went to a Catholic school and studied theology I can't call myself religious, but I'm definitely fascinated by it\" [15]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nTheatre\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Lawrence's novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" is a highly acclaimed and influential work of modernist literature, first published in 1928. The novel tells the story of Constance Chatterley, a young woman trapped in a loveless marriage with a wealthy and aristocratic husband, and her subsequent affair with the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. The novel explores themes of love, class, and the human condition, and has been the subject of much controversy and censorship throughout its history.\n\n**Background**\n\nLawrence's life, including his wife, Frieda, and his childhood in Nottinghamshire, influenced the novel. According to some critics, the fling of Lady Ottoline Morrell with \"Tiger\", a young stonemason who came to carve plinths for her garden statues, also influenced the story. Lawrence, who had once considered calling the novel \"John Thomas and Lady Jane\" in reference to the male and female sex organs, made significant alterations to the text and story in the process of its composition.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story concerns a young married woman, the former Constance Reid (Lady Chatterley), whose upper-class baronet husband, Sir Clifford Chatterley, described as a handsome, well-built man, is paralysed from the waist down because of a Great War injury. Constance has an affair with the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. The class difference between the couple highlights a major motif of the novel. The central theme is Constance's realisation that she cannot live with the mind alone. This realisation stems from a heightened sexual experience that Constance has felt only with Mellors, suggesting that love requires the elements of both body and mind.\n\n**Characters**\n\nLady Chatterley (Connie) is the main character of the novel. Connie, who is an intellectual and socially progressive, distances herself from her cold and passionless husband after marrying Clifford Chatterley. She falls in love with the gamekeeper Oliver Mellors and establishes a sexual bond with him. She matures as a sensual being and eventually leaves her husband.\n\nOliver Mellors is the gamekeeper who becomes Connie's lover. He is a working-class man who is in touch with nature and has a deep sense of spirituality. He is the opposite of Clifford, who is a wealthy and aristocratic man who is out of touch with nature.\n\n**Themes**\n\nRichard Hoggart argues that the main subject of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" is not the explicit sexuality, which was the subject of much debate, but the search for integrity and wholeness. Key to this integrity is cohesion between the mind and the body, for \"body without mind is brutish; mind without body.. is a running away from our double being\". The novel focuses on the incoherence of living a life that is \"all mind\", which Lawrence found to be particularly true among the young members of the aristocratic classes.\n\n**Class**\n\nThe novel also presents some views on the early-20th-century British social context. That is most evidently seen in the plot on the affair of an aristocratic woman (Connie) with a working-class man (Mellors). This is heightened when Mellors adopts the local broad Derbyshire dialect, something he can slip into and out of. The critic and writer Mark Schorer writes of the forbidden love of a woman of relatively superior social situation who is drawn to an \"outsider\", a man of a lower social rank or a foreigner.\n\n**Industrialisation and nature**\n\nAs in much of the rest of Lawrence's fiction, a key theme is the contrast between the vitality of nature and the mechanised monotony of mining and industrialism. Clifford wants to reinvigorate the mines with new technology and is out of touch with the natural world. In contrast, Connie often appreciates the beauty of nature and sees the ugliness of the mines in Uthwaite. Her heightened sensual appreciation applies to both nature and her sexual relationship with Mellors.\n\n**Censorship**\n\nA publisher's note in the 2001 Random House Inc edition of the novel states that Lawrence \"was unable to secure a commercial publication  [of] the novel in its unexpurgated form\". The author privately published the novel in 2000 copies to his subscribers in England, the United States and France in 1928. Later that same year, the second edition was privately published in 200 copies. Then, pirated copies of the novel were made.\n\n**British obscenity trial**\n\nIn November 1960, the full unexpurgated edition, the last of three versions written by Lawrence, was published by Penguin Books in Britain, selling its first print run of 200,000 copies on the first day of publication.\n\n**Australia**\n\nThe book was banned in Australia, and a book describing the British trial, \"The Trial of Lady Chatterley\", was also banned. In 1965, a copy of the British edition was smuggled into the country by Alexander William Sheppard, Leon Fink, and Ken Buckley, and then a run of 10,000 copies was printed and sold nationwide. The fallout from that event eventually led to the easing of censorship of books in the country.\n\n**Canada**\n\nIn 1962, McGill University Professor of Law and Canadian modernist poet F R Scott appeared before the Supreme Court of Canada to defend \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" from censorship. Scott represented the appellants, who were booksellers who had been offering the book for sale.\n\n**United States**\n\n\" Lady Chatterley's Lover\" was banned for obscenity in the United States in 1929. In 1930, Senator Bronson Cutting proposed an amendment to the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, which was being debated, to end the practice of having U.S Customs censor allegedly obscene imported books. Senator Reed Smoot vigorously opposed such an amendment and threatened to read indecent passages of imported books publicly in front of the Senate.\n\n**Japan**\n\nThe publication of a full translation of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" by Sei Itō in 1950 led to a famous obscenity trial in Japan that extended from 8 May 1951 to 18 January 1952, with appeals lasting to 13 March 1957. Several notable literary figures testified for the defence. The trial ultimately ended in a guilty verdict with a ¥100,000 fine for Ito and a ¥250,000 fine for his publisher.\n\n**India**\n\nIn 1964, the bookseller Ranjit Udeshi in Bombay was prosecuted under Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code (sale of obscene books) for selling an unexpurgated copy of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\".\n\n**Cultural influence**\n\nIn the United States, the full publication of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" was a significant event in the \"sexual revolution\". The book was then a topic of widespread discussion and a byword of sorts. In 1965, Tom Lehrer recorded a satirical song, \"Smut\", in which the speaker in the song lyrics cheerfully acknowledges his enjoyment of such material; \"Who needs a hobby like tennis or philately? /I've got a hobby: rereading Lady Chatterley\".\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n\" Lady Chatterley's Lover\" was re-imagined as a love triangle set in contemporary Silicon Valley, California in the novel \"Miss Chatterley\" by Logan Belle (the pseudonym for American author Jamie Brenner) published by Pocket Star/Simon & Schuster, May 2013.\n\n**Editions**\n\n\" Lady Chatterley's Lover\" has been published in numerous editions, including the original 1928 edition, the 1960 Penguin edition, and the 2001 Random House Inc edition.\n\n**Adaptations**\n\n\" Lady Chatterley's Lover\" has been adapted for film and television several times, including the 1968 film directed by Just Jaeckin, and the 1993 film directed by Ken Russell.\n\n**Radio**\n\n\" Lady Chatterley's Lover\" has been adapted for BBC Radio 4 by Michelene Wandor and was first broadcast in September 2006.\n\n**Theatre**\n\nLawrence's novel was successfully dramatised for the stage in a three-act play by British playwright John Harte. Although produced at the Arts Theatre in London in 1961 (and elsewhere later on), his play was written in 1953. It was the only D.H Lawrence novel ever to be staged, and his dramatisation was the only one to be read and approved by Lawrence's widow, Frieda.\n\n**Parody**\n\nMAD Magazine published in 1963 a spoof called \"Lady Chatterley's Chopped Liver And Other Recipes\".", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lady_Chatterley's_Lover\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nLawrence's life, including his wife, Frieda, and his childhood in Nottinghamshire, influenced the novel [4] According to some critics, the fling of Lady Ottoline Morrell with \"Tiger\", a young stonemason who came to carve plinths for her garden statues, also influenced the story [5] Lawrence, who had once considered calling the novel John Thomas and Lady Jane in reference to the male and the female sex organs, made significant alterations to the text and story in the process of its composition [6]\n\n\nPlot\nThe story concerns a young married woman, the former Constance Reid (Lady Chatterley), whose upper-class baronet husband, Sir Clifford Chatterley, described as a handsome, well-built man, is paralysed from the waist down because of a Great War injury Constance has an affair with the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors The class difference between the couple highlights a major motif of the novel The central theme is Constance's realisation that she cannot live with the mind alone That realisation stems from a heightened sexual experience that Constance has felt only with Mellors, suggesting that love requires the elements of both body and mind \n\n\nCharacters\nLady Chatterley (Connie): The main character of the novel Connie, who is an intellectual and socially progressive, distances herself from her cold and passionless husband after marrying Clifford Chatterley She falls in love with the gamekeeper Oliver Mellors and establishes a sexual bond with him She matures as a sensual being and eventually leaves her husband.\n\n\nThemes\nRichard Hoggart argues that the main subject of Lady Chatterley's Lover is not the explicit sexuality, which was the subject of much debate, but the search for integrity and wholeness [9] Key to this integrity is cohesion between the mind and the body, for \"body without mind is brutish;

{"title": "Tiger", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe Old English tigras derives from Old French tigre, from Latin tigris, which was a borrowing from Classical Greek τίγρις 'tigris' [4]\nSince ancient times, the word tigris has been suggested to originate from the Armenian or Persian word for 'arrow', which may also be the origin of the name for the river Tigris [5] [6] However, today, the names are thought to be homonyms, and the connection between the tiger and the river is doubted [6]\n\n\nTaxonomy\nIn 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris, as the genus Felis was being used for all cats at the time His scientific description was based on descriptions by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi [2] In 1929, Reginald Innes Pocock placed the species in the genus Panthera using the scientific name Panthera tigris [7] [8]\n\n\nSubspecies\n\nNine recent tiger subspecies have been proposed between the early 19th and early 21st centuries, namely the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian, Caspian, Javan, Bali and Sumatran tigers [9] [10] The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999 as most putative subspecies were distinguished on the basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size of specimens in natural history museum collections that are not necessarily representative for the entire population It was proposed to recognise only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P t tigris in mainland Asia and the smaller P t sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands [11]\n\n\nEvolution\nSnow leopard \n\n\nHybrids\nTigers can interbreed with other Panthera cats and have done so in captivity The liger is the offspring of a female tiger and a male lion and the tigon the offspring of a male tiger and a female lion [45] The lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, so that ligers grow far larger than either parent species By contrast, the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene while the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene; hence, tigons are around the same size as their parents [46] Since they often develop life threatening birth defects and can easily become obese, breeding these hybrids is regarded as unethical [45]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe tiger has a typical felid morphology, with a muscular body, shortened legs, strong forelimbs with wide front paws, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of the rest of its body [47] [48] It has five digits, including a dewclaw, on the front feet and four on the back, all of which have retractile claws that are compact and curved, and can reach 10 cm (3.9 in) long [47] [49] The ears are rounded and the eyes have a round pupil [47] The snout ends in a triangular, pink tip with small black dots, the number of which increase with age [50] The tiger's skull is robust, with a constricted front region, proportionally small, elliptical orbits, long nasal bones and a lengthened cranium with a large sagittal crest [51] [47] It resembles a lion's skull, but differs from it in the concave or flattened underside of the lower jaw and in its longer nasals [51] [43] The tiger has 30 fairly robust teeth and its somewhat curved canines are the longest in the cat family at 6.4–7.6 cm (2.5–3.0 in) [47] [52]\n\n\nCoat\nThe tiger's coat usually has short hairs, reaching up to 35 mm (1.4 in), though the hairs of the northern-living Siberian tiger can reach 105 mm (4.1 in) Belly hairs tend to be longer than back hairs The density of their fur is usually thin, though the Siberian tiger develops a particularly thick winter coat The tiger has lines of fur around the face and long whiskers, especially in males [47] It has an orange colouration that varies from yellowish to reddish [55] White fur covers the underside, from head to tail, along with the inner surface of the legs and parts of the face [47] [56] On the back of the ears, it has a prominent white spot, which is surrounded by black [47] The tiger is marked with distinctive black or dark brown stripes, which are uniquely patterned in each individual [47] [57] The stripes are mostly vertical, but those on the limbs and forehead are horizontal They are more concentrated towards the back and those on the trunk may reach under the belly The tips of stripes are generally sharp and some may split up or split and fuse again Tail stripes are thick bands and a black tip marks the end [56]\n\n\nColour variations\nThe three colour variants of Bengal tigers – nearly stripeless snow-white, white and golden – are now virtually non-existent in the wild due to the reduction of wild tiger populations but continue in captive populations The white tiger has a white background colour with sepia-brown stripes The golden tiger is pale golden with reddish-brown stripes The snow-white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale sepia-brown ringed tail White and golden morphs are the result of an autosomal recessive trait with a white locus and a wideband locus, respectively The snow-white variation is caused by polygenes with both white and wideband loci [62] The breeding of white tigers is controversial, as they have no use for conservation Only 0.001% of wild tigers have the genes for this colour morph and the overrepresentation of white tigers in captivity is the result of inbreeding Hence, their continued breeding will risk both inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability in captive tigers [63]\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey, northern Iran and Afghanistan to Central Asia and from northern Pakistan through the Indian subcontinent and Indochina to southeastern Siberia, Sumatra, Java and Bali [47] As of 2022, it inhabits less than 7% of its historical distribution and has a scattered range in the Indian subcontinent, the Indochinese Peninsula, Sumatra, northeastern China and the Russian Far East [1] As of 2020, India had the largest extent of global tiger habitat with 300,508 km2 (116,027 sq mi), followed by Russia with 195,819 km2 (75,606 sq mi) [65]\n\n\nPopulation density\nCamera trapping during 2010–2015 in the deciduous and subtropical pine forest of Jim Corbett National Park, northern India revealed a stable tiger population density of 12–17 individuals per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) in an area of 521 km2 (201 sq mi) [74]\nIn northern Myanmar, the population density in a sampled area of roughly 3,250 km2 (1,250 sq mi) in a mosaic of tropical broadleaf forest and grassland was estimated to be 0.21–0.44 tigers per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) as of 2009 [75]\nPopulation density in mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forests of Thailand's Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary was estimated at 2.01 tigers per 100 km2 (39 sq mi); during the 1970s and 1980s, logging and poaching had occurred in the adjacent Mae Wong and Khlong Lan National Parks, where population density was much lower, estimated at only 0.359 tigers per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) as of 2016 [76]\nPopulation density in dipterocarp and montane forests in northern Malaysia was estimated at 1.47–2.43 adult tigers per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) in Royal Belum State Park, but 0.3–0.92 adult tigers per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) in the unprotected selectively logged Temengor Forest Reserve [77]\n\n\nBehaviour and ecology\nCamera trap data show that tigers in Chitwan National Park avoided locations frequented by people and were more active at night than during day [78]\nIn Sundarbans National Park, six radio-collared tigers were most active from dawn to early morning and reached their zenith around 7:00 o'clock in the morning [79]\nA three-year-long camera trap survey in Shuklaphanta National Park revealed that tigers were most active from dusk until midnight [80]\nIn northeastern China, tigers were crepuscular and active at night with activity peaking at dawn and dusk; they were largely active at the same time as their prey [81]\n\n\nSocial spacing\nAdult tigers lead largely solitary lives within home ranges or territories, the size of which mainly depends on prey abundance, geographic area and sex of the individual Males and females defend their home ranges from those of the same sex and the home range of a male encompasses that of multiple females [47] [57] Two females in the Sundarbans had home ranges of 10.6 and 14.1 km2 (4.1 and 5.4 sq mi) [83]\nIn Panna Tiger Reserve, the home ranges of five reintroduced females varied from 53–67 km2 (20–26 sq mi) in winter to 55–60 km2 (21–23 sq mi) in summer and to 46–94 km2 (18–36 sq mi) during the monsoon; three males had 84–147 km2 (32–57 sq mi) large home ranges in winter, 82–98 km2 (32–38 sq mi) in summer and 81–118 km2 (31–46 sq mi) during monsoon seasons [84]\nIn Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve, 14 females had home ranges 248–520 km2 (96–201 sq mi) and five resident males of 847–1,923 km2 (327–742 sq mi) that overlapped with those of up to five females [85] When tigresses in the same reserve had cubs of up to four months of age, they reduced their home ranges to stay near their young and steadily enlarged them until their offspring were 13–18 months old [86]\n\n\nCommunication\nDuring friendly encounters and bonding, tigers rub against each other's bodies [97] Facial expressions include the \"defence threat\", which involves a wrinkled face, bared teeth, pulled-back ears and widened pupils [98] [47] Both males and females show a flehmen response, a characteristic curled-lip grimace, when smelling urine markings Males also use the flehmen to detect the markings made by tigresses in oestrus [47] Tigers will move their ears around to display the white spots, particularly during aggressive encounters and between mothers and cubs [99] They also use their tails to signal their mood To show cordiality, the tail sticks up and sways slowly, while an apprehensive tiger lowers its tail or wags it side-to-side When calm, the tail hangs low [100]\n\n\nHunting and diet\nThe tiger is a carnivore and an apex predator feeding mainly on large and medium-sized ungulates, with a preference for sambar deer, Manchurian wapiti, barasingha, gaur and wild boar [109] [110] [111]\nAbundance and body weight of prey species are assumed to be the main criteria for the tiger's prey selection, both inside and outside protected areas [112]\nIt also preys opportunistically on smaller species like monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, porcupines and fish [47] [57] Occasional attacks on Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceroses have also been reported [113]\nMore often, tigers take the more vulnerable calves [114]\nThey sometimes prey on livestock and dogs in close proximity to settlements [47] Tigers occasionally consume vegetation, fruit and minerals for dietary fibre and supplements [115]\n\n\nCompetitors\nIn much of their range, tigers share habitat with leopards and dholes They typically dominate both of them, though with dholes it depends on their pack size Interactions between the three predators involve chasing, stealing kills and direct killing [132] Large dhole packs may kill tigers [133] Tigers, leopards and dholes coexist by hunting different sized prey [134] In Nagarhole National Park, the average weight for tiger kills was found to be 91.5 kg (202 lb), compared to 37.6 kg (83 lb) for leopards and 43.4 kg (96 lb) for dholes [135] In Kui Buri National Park, following a reduction in prey numbers, tigers continued to kill favoured prey while leopards and dholes increased their consumption of small prey [110]\n\n\nReproduction and life cycle\n\n\n\nHealth and diseases\nTigers are recorded as hosts for various parasites including tapeworms like Diphyllobothrium erinacei, Taenia pisiformis in India and nematodes like Toxocara species in India and Physaloptera preputialis, Dirofilaria ursi and Uiteinarta species in Siberia [47] Canine distemper is known to occur in Siberian tigers [164] A morbillivirus infection was the likely cause of death of a tigress in the Russian Far East that was also tested positive for feline panleukopenia and feline coronavirus [165]\nBlood samples from 11 adult tigers in Nepal showed antibodies for canine parvovirus-2, feline herpesvirus, feline coronavirus, leptospirosis and Toxoplasma gondii [166]\n\n\nThreats\nThe tiger has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986 and the global tiger population is thought to have continuously declined from an estimated population of 5,000–8,262 tigers in the late 1990s to 3,726–5,578 individuals estimated as of 2022 [1] During 2001–2020, landscapes where tigers live declined from 1,025,488 km2 (395,943 sq mi) to 911,901 km2 (352,087 sq mi) [65] Habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching for fur and body parts are the major threats that contributed to the decrease of tiger populations in all range countries [1]\n\n\nConservation\nInternationally, the tiger is protected under CITES Appendix I, banning trade of live tigers and their body parts [1]\nIn Russia, hunting the tiger has been banned since 1952 [200]\nIn Bhutan, it has been protected since 1969 and enlisted as totally protected since 1995 [201] Since 1972, it has been afforded the highest protection level under India's Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 [202]\nIn Nepal and Bangladesh, it has been protected since 1973 [202] [187]\nSince 1976, it has been totally protected under Malaysia's Protection of Wild Life Act, [203] and the country's Wildlife Conservation Act enacted in 2010 increased punishments for wildlife-related crimes [196]\nIn Indonesia, it has been protected since 1990 [204]\nIn China, the trade in tiger body parts was banned in 1993 [205]\nThe Thai Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act was enacted in 2019 to combat poaching and trading of body parts [206]\n\n\nRelationship with humans\nTigers have been hunted by humans for millennia, as indicated by a painting on the Bhimbetka rock shelters in India that is dated to 5,000–6,000 years ago They were hunted throughout their range in Asia, chased on horseback, elephant-back or even with sled dogs and killed with spears and later firearms Such hunts were conducted both by native governments and empires like the Mughal Empire, as well as European colonists Tigers were often hunted as trophies and because of their perceived danger [224] An estimated 80,000 tigers were killed between 1875 and 1925 [225] [226]\n\n\nHunting\nTigers have been hunted by humans for millennia, as indicated by a painting on the Bhimbetka rock shelters in India that is

are more likely to occur in edge habitats between wild and agricultural areas [227] Most attacks on humans are defensive, including protection of young; however, tigers do sometimes see people as prey [228] Man-eating tigers tend to be old and disabled [57] Tigers driven from their home ranges are also at risk of turning to man-eating [229]\n\n\nCaptivity\nTigers have been kept in captivity since ancient times In ancient Rome, tigers were displayed in amphitheatres; they were slaughtered in venatio hunts and used to kill criminals [236] The Mongol ruler Kublai Khan is reported to have kept tigers in the 13th century Starting in the Middle Ages, tigers were being kept in European menageries [237] Tigers and other exotic animals were mainly used for the entertainment of elites but from the 19th century onward, they were exhibited more to the public Tigers were particularly big attractions and their captive population soared [238] In 2020, there were over 8,000 captive tigers in Asia, over 5,000 in the US and no less than 850 in Europe [239] There are more tigers in captivity than in the wild [223] Captive tigers may display stereotypical behaviours such as pacing or inactivity Modern zoos are able to reduce such behaviours with exhibits designed so the animals can move between separate but connected enclosures [240] Enrichment items are also important for the cat's welfare and the stimulation of its natural behaviours [241]\n\n\nCultural significance\nThe tiger is among the most famous of the charismatic megafauna Kailash Sankhala has called it \"a rare combination of courage, ferocity and brilliant colour\", [143] while Candy d'Sa calls it \"fierce and commanding on the outside, but noble and discerning on the inside\" In a 2004 online poll involving more than 50,000 people from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog [249] Similarly, a 2018 study found the tiger to be the most popular wild animal based on surveys, as well as appearances on websites of major zoos and posters of some animated movies [250]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Tiger is a large, carnivorous mammal belonging to the family Felidae and the genus Panthera. It is one of the most recognizable and iconic animals in the world, with a rich history and cultural significance that spans thousands of years.\n\nEtymology\nThe origin of the word \"tiger\" is unclear, but it is believed to have come from the Old French word \"tigre,\" which was derived from the Latin word \"tigris.\" The Latin word was, in turn, borrowed from the Greek word \"τίγρις\" (tigris), which referred to the river Tigris in Mesopotamia. Some etymologists suggest that the word \"tiger\" may be related to the Armenian or Persian word for \"arrow,\" which was also used to refer to the river.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe tiger was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his work Systema Naturae in 1758. At the time, Linnaeus placed the tiger in the genus Felis, which was a catch-all term for all cats. However, in 1929, Reginald Innes Pocock reclassified the tiger as a member of the genus Panthera, which is a group of large, carnivorous cats that includes lions, leopards, and jaguars.\n\nSubspecies\nThere are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian, Caspian, Javan, Bali, and Sumatran tigers. However, some taxonomists question the validity of these subspecies, arguing that they are based on minor differences in coat coloration and other characteristics that do not necessarily indicate distinct evolutionary lineages.\n\nEvolution\nThe tiger is a member of the Pantherinae subfamily, which is a group of large, carnivorous cats that evolved from a common ancestor with the big cats of Africa and Asia. The earliest known ancestors of the tiger date back to the Pliocene epoch, around 2.5 million years ago. During this time, the ancestors of the tiger were likely small, weasel-like creatures that fed on small mammals and birds. Over time, these early tigers evolved into larger, more powerful predators that were capable of taking down larger prey.\n\nHybrids\nTigers can interbreed with other members of the Pantherinae subfamily, including lions, leopards, and jaguars. However, these hybrids are relatively rare and often have difficulty surviving in the wild. One of the most well-known hybrids is the liger, which is the offspring of a female tiger and a male lion. Ligers are larger than either parent species and can weigh up to 900 pounds. However, they are also more prone to health problems and often have difficulty reproducing.\n\nCharacteristics\nThe tiger is a large, muscular animal with a distinctive orange and black coat. It has a broad, flat head with a short, rounded snout and a pair of prominent canine teeth. The tiger's eyes are yellow or green, and its ears are rounded and relatively small. The tiger's body is covered in a thick, soft fur that is longer on the belly and shorter on the back. The tiger's legs are relatively short, but its paws are large and powerful, with retractable claws.\n\nCoat\nThe tiger's coat is one of its most distinctive features. It is typically orange or yellow in color, with black stripes that run along the back, legs, and face. The stripes are relatively narrow and can vary in width and intensity depending on the individual animal. Some tigers may have white or gray stripes, while others may have darker or more intense stripes. The tiger's coat is also longer on the belly and shorter on the back, which can help to distinguish it from other big cats.\n\nColour Variations\nThere are several color variations of the tiger, including the white, golden, and snow-white morphs. The white morph is caused by an autosomal recessive trait that results in a white background color with sepia-brown stripes. The golden morph is caused by a wideband locus that results in a pale golden color with reddish-brown stripes. The snow-white morph is caused by polygenes that result in a pale sepia-brown ringed tail.\n\nDistribution and Habitat\nThe tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey, northern Iran, and Afghanistan to Central Asia and from northern Pakistan through the Indian subcontinent and Indochina to southeastern Siberia, Sumatra, Java, and Bali. However, due to habitat loss and poaching, the tiger's range has been significantly reduced, and it now inhabits less than 7% of its historical range.\n\nPopulation Density\nCamera trapping data from India, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia have provided estimates of tiger population density in different habitats. In the deciduous and subtropical pine forest of Jim Corbett National Park, northern India, a stable tiger population density of 12-17 individuals per 100 square kilometers was found. In northern Myanmar, the population density was estimated to be 0.21-0.44 tigers per 100 square kilometers. In Thailand's Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, the population density was estimated to be 2.01 tigers per 100 square kilometers.\n\nBehaviour and Ecology\nCamera trap data from Chitwan National Park, Nepal, and Sundarbans National Park, India, have shown that tigers are crepuscular and active at night, with activity peaking at dawn and dusk. They are also largely active at the same time as their prey. In the Sundarbans, six radio-collared tigers were most active from dawn to early morning and reached their zenith around 7:00 o'clock in the morning.\n\nSocial Spacing\nAdult tigers lead largely solitary lives within home ranges or territories, which mainly depend on prey abundance, geographic area, and sex of the individual. Males and females defend their home ranges from those of the same sex, and the home range of a male encompasses that of multiple females. In Panna Tiger Reserve, the home ranges of five reintroduced females varied from 53-67 square kilometers in winter to 55-60 square kilometers in summer and to 46-94 square kilometers during the monsoon.\n\nCommunication\nTigers use various forms of communication, including vocalizations, body language, and scent marking. During friendly encounters and bonding, tigers rub against each other's bodies, while facial expressions such as the \"defence threat\" involve a wrinkled face, bared teeth, pulled-back ears, and widened pupils. Both males and females show a flehmen response, a characteristic curled-lip grimace, when smelling urine markings.\n\nHunting and Diet\nThe tiger is a carnivore and an apex predator, feeding mainly on large and medium-sized ungulates, with a preference for sambar deer, Manchurian wapiti, barasingha, gaur, and wild boar. Abundance and body weight of prey species are assumed to be the main criteria for the tiger's prey selection, both inside and outside protected areas. They also prey opportunistically on smaller species such as monkeys, peafowl, and other ground-based birds, porcupines, and fish.\n\nCompetitors\nIn much of their range, tigers share habitat with leopards and dholes. They typically dominate both of them, though with dholes it depends on their pack size. Interactions between the three predators involve chasing, stealing kills, and direct killing. Large dhole packs may kill tigers.\n\nReproduction and Life Cycle\nThe reproductive cycle of the tiger is relatively well understood. Female tigers typically breed every 2-3 years, and the gestation period is around 100 days. The litter size is typically 2-4 cubs, which are born blind and helpless. The cubs are nursed for about 6 months, after which they begin to accompany their mother on hunts. They are weaned at around 1 year of age, and become independent at around 2 years of age.\n\nHealth and Diseases\nTigers are recorded as hosts for various parasites, including tapeworms, nematodes, and other pathogens. Canine distemper is known to occur in Siberian tigers, while a morbillivirus infection was the likely cause of death of a tigress in the Russian Far East. Blood samples from 11 adult tigers in Nepal showed antibodies for various pathogens, including canine parvovirus-2, feline herpesvirus, feline coronavirus, leptospirosis, and Toxoplasma gondii.\n\nThreats\nThe tiger has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986, and the global tiger population is thought to have continuously declined from an estimated population of 5,000-8,262 tigers in the late 1990s to 3,726-5,578 individuals estimated as of 2022. Habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation, and poaching for fur and body parts are the major threats that contributed to the decrease of tiger populations in all range countries.\n\nConservation\nInternationally, the tiger is protected under CITES Appendix I, banning trade of live tigers and their body parts.

complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tiger\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe Old English tigras derives from Old French tigre, from Latin tigris, which was a borrowing from Classical Greek τίγρις 'tigris' [4]\nSince ancient times, the word tigris has been suggested to originate from the Armenian or Persian word for 'arrow', which may also be the origin of the name for the river Tigris [5] [6] However, today, the names are thought to be homonyms, and the connection between the tiger and the river is doubted [6]\n\n\nTaxonomy\nIn 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris, as the genus Felis was being used for all cats at the time His scientific description was based on descriptions by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi [2] In 1929, Reginald Innes Pocock placed the species in the genus Panthera using the scientific name Panthera tigris [7] [8]\n\n\nSubspecies\n\nNine recent tiger subspecies have been proposed between the early 19th and early 21st centuries, namely the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian, Caspian, Javan, Bali and Sumatran tigers [9] [10] The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999 as most putative subspecies were distinguished on the basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size of specimens in natural history museum collections that are not necessarily representative for the entire population It was proposed to recognise only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P t tigris in mainland Asia and the smaller P t sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands [11]\n\n\nEvolution\nSnow leopard \n\n\nHybrids\nTigers can interbreed with other Panthera cats and have done so in captivity The liger is the offspring of a female tiger and a male lion and the tigon the offspring of a male tiger and a female lion [45] The lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, so that ligers grow far larger than either parent species By contrast, the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene while the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene; hence, tigons are around the same size as their parents [46] Since they often develop life threatening birth defects and can easily become obese, breeding these hybrids is regarded as unethical [45]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe tiger has a typical felid morphology, with a muscular body, shortened legs, strong forelimbs with wide front paws, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of the rest of its body [47] [48] It has five digits, including a dewclaw, on the front feet and four on the back, all of which have retractile claws that are compact and curved, and can reach 10 cm (3.9 in) long [47] [49] The ears are rounded and the eyes have a round pupil [47] The snout ends in a triangular, pink tip with small black dots, the number of which increase with age [50] The tiger's skull is robust, with a constricted front region, proportionally small, elliptical orbits, long nasal bones and a lengthened cranium with a large sagittal crest [51] [47] It resembles a lion's skull, but differs from it in the concave or flattened underside of the lower jaw and in its longer nasals [51] [43] The tiger has 30 fairly robust teeth and its somewhat curved canines are the longest in the cat family at 6.4–7.6 cm (2.5–3.0 in) [47] [52]\n\n\nCoat\nThe tiger's coat usually has short hairs, reaching up to 35 mm (1.4 in), though the hairs of the northern-living Siberian tiger can reach 105 mm (4.1 in) Belly hairs tend to be longer than back hairs The density of their fur is usually thin, though the Siberian tiger develops a particularly thick winter coat The tiger has lines of fur around the face and long whiskers, especially in males [47] It has an orange colouration that varies from yellowish to reddish [55] White fur covers the underside, from head to tail, along with the inner surface of the legs and parts of the face [47] [56] On the back of the ears, it has a prominent white spot, which is surrounded by black [47] The tiger is marked with distinctive black or dark brown stripes, which are uniquely patterned in each individual [47] [57] The stripes are mostly vertical, but those on the limbs and forehead are horizontal They are more concentrated towards the back and those on the trunk may reach under the belly The tips of stripes are generally sharp and some may split up or split and fuse again Tail stripes are thick bands and a black tip marks the end [56]\n\n\nColour variations\nThe three colour variants of Bengal tigers – nearly stripeless snow-white, white and golden – are now virtually non-existent in the wild due to the reduction of wild tiger populations but continue in captive populations The white tiger has a white background colour with sepia-brown stripes The golden tiger is pale golden with reddish-brown stripes The snow-white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale sepia-brown ringed tail White and golden morphs are the result of an autosomal recessive trait with a white locus and a wideband locus, respectively The snow-white variation is caused by polygenes with both white and wideband loci [62] The breeding of white tigers is controversial, as they have no use for conservation Only 0.001% of wild tigers have the genes for this colour morph and the overrepresentation of white tigers in captivity is the result of inbreeding Hence, their continued breeding will risk both inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability in captive tigers [63]\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey, northern Iran and Afghanistan to Central Asia and from northern Pakistan through the Indian subcontinent and Indochina to southeastern Siberia, Sumatra, Java and Bali [47] As of 2022, it inhabits less than 7% of its historical distribution and has a scattered range in the Indian subcontinent, the Indochinese Peninsula, Sumatra, northeastern China and the Russian Far East [1] As of 2020, India had the largest extent of global tiger habitat with 300,508 km2 (116,027 sq mi), followed by Russia with 195,819 km2 (75,606 sq mi) [65]\n\n\nPopulation density\nCamera trapping during 2010–2015 in the deciduous and subtropical pine forest of Jim Corbett National Park, northern India revealed a stable tiger population density of 12–17 individuals per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) in an area of 521 km2 (201 sq mi) [74]\nIn northern Myanmar, the population density in a sampled area of roughly 3,250 km2 (1,250 sq mi) in a mosaic of tropical broadleaf forest and grassland was estimated to be 0.21–0.44 tigers per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) as of 2009 [75]\nPopulation density in mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forests of Thailand's Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary was estimated at 2.01 tigers per 100 km2 (39 sq mi); during the 1970s and 1980s, logging and poaching had occurred in the adjacent Mae Wong and Khlong Lan National Parks, where population density was much lower, estimated at only 0.359 tigers per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) as of 2016 [76]\nPopulation density in dipterocarp and montane forests in northern Malaysia was estimated at 1.47–2.43 adult tigers per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) in Royal Belum State Park, but 0.3–0.92 adult tigers per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) in the unprotected selectively logged Temengor Forest Reserve [77]\n\n\nBehaviour and ecology\nCamera trap data show that tigers in Chitwan National Park avoided locations frequented by people and were more active at night than during day [78]\nIn Sundarbans National Park, six radio-collared tigers were most active from dawn to early morning and reached their zenith around 7:00 o'clock in the morning [79]\nA three-year-long camera trap survey in Shuklaphanta National Park revealed that tigers were most active from dusk until midnight [80]\nIn northeastern China, tigers were crepuscular and active at night with activity peaking at dawn and dusk; they were largely active at the same time as their prey [81]\n\n\nSocial spacing\nAdult tigers lead largely solitary lives within home ranges or territories, the size of which mainly depends on prey abundance, geographic area and sex of the individual Males and females defend their home ranges from those of the same sex and the home range of a male encompasses that of multiple females [47] [57] Two females in the Sundarbans had home ranges of 10.6 and 14.1 km2 (4.1 and 5.4 sq mi) [83]\nIn Panna Tiger Reserve, the home ranges of five reintroduced females varied from 53–67 km2 (20–26 sq mi) in winter to 55–60 km2 (21–23 sq mi) in summer and to 46–94 km2 (18–36 sq mi) during the monsoon; three males had 84–147 km2 (32–57 sq mi) large home ranges in winter, 82–98 km2 (32–38 sq mi) in summer and 81–118 km2 (31–46 sq mi) during monsoon seasons [84]\nIn Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve, 14 females had home ranges 248–520 km2 (96–201 sq mi) and five resident males of 847–1,923 km2 (327–742 sq mi) that overlapped with those of up to five females [85] When tigresses in the same reserve had cubs of up to four months of age, they reduced their home ranges to stay near their young and steadily enlarged them until their offspring were 13–18 months old [86]\n\n\nCommunication\nDuring friendly encounters and bonding, tigers rub against each other's bodies [97] Facial expressions include the \"defence threat\", which involves a wrinkled face, bared teeth, pulled-back ears and widened pupils [98] [47] Both males and females show a flehmen response, a characteristic curled-lip grimace, when smelling urine markings Males also use the flehmen to detect the markings made by tigresses in oestrus [47] Tigers will move their ears around to display the white spots, particularly during aggressive encounters and between mothers and cubs [99] They also use their tails to signal their mood To show cordiality, the tail sticks up and sways slowly, while an apprehensive tiger lowers its tail or wags it side-to-side When calm, the tail hangs low [100]\n\n\nHunting and diet\nThe tiger is a carnivore and an apex predator feeding mainly on large and medium-sized ungulates, with a preference for sambar deer, Manchurian wapiti, barasingha, gaur and wild boar [109] [110] [111]\nAbundance and body weight of prey species are assumed to be the main criteria for the tiger's prey selection, both inside and outside protected areas [112]\nIt also preys opportunistically on smaller species like monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, porcupines and fish [47] [57] Occasional attacks on Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceroses have also been reported [113]\nMore often, tigers take the more vulnerable calves [114]\nThey sometimes prey on livestock and dogs in close proximity to settlements [47] Tigers occasionally consume vegetation, fruit and minerals for dietary fibre and supplements [115]\n\n\nCompetitors\nIn much of their range, tigers share habitat with leopards and dholes They typically dominate both of them, though with dholes it depends on their pack size Interactions between the three predators involve chasing, stealing kills and direct killing [132] Large dhole packs may kill tigers [133] Tigers, leopards and dholes coexist by hunting different sized prey [134] In Nagarhole National Park, the average weight for tiger kills was found to be 91.5 kg (202 lb), compared to 37.6 kg (83 lb) for leopards and 43.4 kg (96 lb) for dholes [135] In Kui Buri National Park, following a reduction in prey numbers, tigers continued to kill favoured prey while leopards and dholes increased their consumption of small prey [110]\n\n\nReproduction and life cycle\n\n\n\nHealth and diseases\nTigers are recorded as hosts for various parasites including tapeworms like Diphyllobothrium erinacei, Taenia pisiformis in India and nematodes like Toxocara species in India and Physaloptera preputialis, Dirofilaria ursi and Uiteinarta species in Siberia [47] Canine distemper is known to occur in Siberian tigers [164] A morbillivirus infection was the likely cause of death of a tigress in the Russian Far East that was also tested positive for feline panleukopenia and feline coronavirus [165]\nBlood samples from 11 adult tigers in Nepal showed antibodies for canine parvovirus-2, feline herpesvirus, feline coronavirus, leptospirosis and Toxoplasma gondii [166]\n\n\nThreats\nThe tiger has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986 and the global tiger population is thought to have continuously declined from an estimated population of 5,000–8,262 tigers in the late 1990s to 3,726–5,578 individuals estimated as of 2022 [1] During 2001–2020, landscapes where tigers live declined from 1,025,488 km2 (395,943 sq mi) to 911,901 km2 (352,087 sq mi) [65] Habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching for fur and body parts are the major threats that contributed to the decrease of tiger populations in all range countries [1]\n\n\nConservation\nInternationally, the tiger is protected under CITES Appendix I, banning trade of live tigers and their body parts [1]\nIn Russia, hunting the tiger has been banned since 1952 [200]\nIn Bhutan, it has been protected since 1969 and enlisted as totally protected since 1995 [201] Since 1972, it has been afforded the highest protection level under India's Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 [202]\nIn Nepal and Bangladesh, it has been protected since 1973 [202] [187]\nSince 1976, it has been totally protected under Malaysia's Protection of Wild Life Act, [203] and the country's Wildlife Conservation Act enacted in 2010 increased punishments for wildlife-related crimes [196]\nIn Indonesia, it has been protected since 1990 [204]\nIn China, the trade in tiger body parts was banned in 1993 [205]\nThe Thai Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act was enacted in 2019 to combat poaching and trading of body parts [206]\n\n\nRelationship with humans\nTigers have been hunted by humans for millennia, as indicated by a painting on the Bhimbetka rock shelters in India that is dated to 5,000–6,000 years ago They were hunted throughout their range in Asia, chased on horseback, elephant-back or even with sled dogs and killed with spears and later firearms Such hunts were conducted both by native governments and empires like the Mughal Empire, as well as European colonists Tigers were often hunted as trophies and because of their perceived danger [224] An estimated 80,000 tigers were killed between 1875 and 1925 [225] [226]\n\n\nHunting\nTigers have been hunted by humans for millennia, as indicated by a painting on the

their perceived danger [224] An estimated 80,000 tigers were killed between 1875 and 1925 [225] [226]\n\n\nAttacks\nIn most areas, tigers avoid humans, but attacks are a risk wherever people coexist with them [227] [228] Dangerous encounters are more likely to occur in edge habitats between wild and agricultural areas [227] Most attacks on humans are defensive, including protection of young; however, tigers do sometimes see people as prey [228] Man-eating tigers tend to be old and disabled [57] Tigers driven from their home ranges are also at risk of turning to man-eating [229]\n\n\nCaptivity\nTigers have been kept in captivity since ancient times In ancient Rome, tigers were displayed in amphitheatres; they were slaughtered in venatio hunts and used to kill criminals [236] The Mongol ruler Kublai Khan is reported to have kept tigers in the 13th century Starting in the Middle Ages, tigers were being kept in European menageries [237] Tigers and other exotic animals were mainly used for the entertainment of elites but from the 19th century onward, they were exhibited more to the public Tigers were particularly big attractions and their captive population soared [238] In 2020, there were over 8,000 captive tigers in Asia, over 5,000 in the US and no less than 850 in Europe [239] There are more tigers in captivity than in the wild [223] Captive tigers may display stereotypical behaviours such as pacing or inactivity Modern zoos are able to reduce such behaviours with exhibits designed so the animals can move between separate but connected enclosures [240] Enrichment items are also important for the cat's welfare and the stimulation of its natural behaviours [241]\n\n\nCultural significance\nThe tiger is among the most famous of the charismatic megafauna Kailash Sankhala has called it \"a rare combination of courage, ferocity and brilliant colour\", [143] while Candy d'Sa calls it \"fierce and commanding on the outside, but noble and discerning on the inside\" In a 2004 online poll involving more than 50,000 people from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog [249] Similarly, a 2018 study found the tiger to be the most popular wild animal based on surveys, as well as appearances on websites of major zoos and posters of some animated movies [250]\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Dianne_Feinstein", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nFeinstein was born Dianne Emiel Goldman [3] on June 22, 1933, [24] in San Francisco to Leon Goldman, a prominent surgeon, [25] and his wife, Betty (née Rosenburg), a former model Her paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Poland Her maternal grandparents, the Rosenburgs, were from Saint Petersburg, Russia [26] Although they were of German-Jewish ancestry, [27] they practiced the Russian Orthodox (Christian) faith, as was required of Jews in Saint Petersburg [26] [28] Christianity was passed down to Feinstein's mother, who insisted on her transfer from a Jewish day school to a prestigious local Catholic school, but Feinstein listed her religion as Judaism [29]\n\n\nEarly political career\nFrom 1955 to 1956, Feinstein was a fellow at the Coro Foundation in San Francisco, an organization that provides young people with political experience [33] Governor Pat Brown appointed her to the California Women's Parole Board in 1960 She served on the board until 1966 [34]\n\n\nSan Francisco Board of Supervisors and assassination attempt\nFeinstein was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969 [35] [36] She remained on the board for nine years, serving as its first female president from 1970 to 1971, with additional tenures from 1974 to 1975 and January to December 1978 [37] [38] [39]\n\n\nMayor of San Francisco\nAfter San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated by former Supervisor Dan White on November 27, 1978, Feinstein became acting mayor, as she was president of the Board of Supervisors [43] Supervisors John Molinari, Ella Hill Hutch, Ron Pelosi, Robert Gonzales, and Gordon Lau endorsed her for an appointment as mayor by the Board of Supervisors Gonzales initially ran to be appointed by the Board of Supervisors as mayor, but dropped out [44] The Board of Supervisors voted six to two to appoint Feinstein as mayor [45] She was inaugurated by Chief Justice Rose Bird of the Supreme Court of California on December 4, 1978, becoming San Francisco's first female mayor [46] Molinari was selected to replace Feinstein as president of the Board of Supervisors by a vote of eight to two [47]\n\n\nGubernatorial election\nFeinstein made an unsuccessful bid for governor of California in 1990 She won the Democratic nomination, but lost the general election to U.S Senator Pete Wilson, who resigned from the Senate to assume the governorship In 1992, Feinstein was fined $190,000 for failure to properly report campaign contributions and expenditures in that campaign [59]\n\n\nU.S. Senate\nIn 1991, Wilson resigned from the Senate to take office as governor of California [60] Feinstein ran for U.S Senate in a 1992 special election to complete Wilson's term [61] In the Democratic primary, she defeated Joseph Alioto and California State Controller Gray Davis [62] In November, she faced Republican John Seymour, whom Wilson had appointed to the Senate the previous year [63] [60] Feinstein won the November 3 special election, 54.3%–38% [64] [65]\n\n\nElections\nIn 1991, Wilson resigned from the Senate to take office as governor of California [60] Feinstein ran for U.S Senate in a 1992 special election to complete Wilson's term [61] In the Democratic primary, she defeated Joseph Alioto and California State Controller Gray Davis [62] In November, she faced Republican John Seymour, whom Wilson had appointed to the Senate the previous year [63] [60] Feinstein won the November 3 special election, 54.3%–38% [64] [65]\n\n\nTenure\nFeinstein has been described as \"a titan of US political history who notched countless legislative achievements\" in her Senate career [76] She was known for her work on gun control issues In 1994, she spearheaded the passage of a federal assault weapons ban [77] [78] In the 2000s and 2010s, she investigated \"the Central Intelligence Agency's program of detention and interrogation after the Sept 11 attacks\" [77]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nFeinstein was the first woman to chair the Senate Rules Committee (2007–2009) and the first to chair the Select Committee on Intelligence (2009–2015) [80] [105] She became the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017, and was the first woman to hold that position [81] Her committee assignments for the 118th Congress were as follows: [106]\n\n\nCaucus memberships\nIn 2018, the Los Angeles Times wrote that Feinstein had emphasized her centrism when she first ran for statewide offices in the 1990s (when California was more conservative than it became during Feinstein's later career) Over time, she moved leftward as California became one of the most Democratic states in the nation [111] [112] [113] In 2013, The New York Times called her a \"liberal lioness\" [114] Feinstein was known for her advocacy of gun control, [77] abortion access, [115] environmental protection, [116] and a strong national defense [117] [118] [119]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nIn 2018, the Los Angeles Times wrote that Feinstein had emphasized her centrism when she first ran for statewide offices in the 1990s (when California was more conservative than it became during Feinstein's later career) Over time, she moved leftward as California became one of the most Democratic states in the nation

and a strong national defense [117] [118] [119]\n\n\nAbortion\nFeinstein supported abortion rights during her Senate career [115] In 2003, she voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a proposal to ban intact dilation and extraction, although the proposal eventually became law [120] [121] After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, Feinstein called for congressional action to protect abortion rights [122] and stated her support for lifting the Senate filibuster rule to allow such legislation to pass with a simple majority [123]\n\n\nCapital punishment\nWhen Feinstein first ran for statewide office in 1990, she supported capital punishment [111] In 2004, she called for the death penalty in the case of San Francisco police officer Isaac Espinoza, who was killed while on duty [124] By 2018, she opposed capital punishment [111] [112]\n\n\nEnergy and environment\nIn 2007, Feinstein led a bipartisan effort as part of the wider Energy Independence and Security Act to significantly reduce automotive greenhouse gas emissions, which accounted for 26 percent of total U.S emissions at the time [125] [126] [127] Her legislation, the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, raised corporate average fuel economy standards for America's fleet of vehicles by at least 10 miles per gallon between 2010 and 2020 - the largest increase in fuel efficiency in almost three decades Thereafter, said CAFE standards became subject to periodic adjustments by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under the Administrative Procedure Act [128] [h] As a result of Feinstein's legislation, average fleet fuel economy for new automobiles will climb to approximately 60 miles per gallon by 2032, cutting greenhouse gas emissions from passenger and commercial vehicles in half without impeding automotive performance or degrading traffic safety [129] [130]\n\n\nClimate change mitigation\nIn 2007, Feinstein led a bipartisan effort as part of the wider Energy Independence and Security Act to significantly reduce automotive greenhouse gas emissions, which accounted for 26 percent of total U.S emissions at the time [125] [126] [127] Her legislation, the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, raised corporate average fuel economy standards for America's fleet of vehicles by at least 10 miles per gallon between 2010 and 2020 - the largest increase in fuel efficiency in almost

of Feinstein's legislation, average fleet fuel economy for new automobiles will climb to approximately 60 miles per gallon by 2032, cutting greenhouse gas emissions from passenger and commercial vehicles in half without impeding automotive performance or degrading traffic safety [129] [130]\n\n\nLake Tahoe\nFeinstein, who spent her childhood visiting the lake, regarded Lake Tahoe as \"a national treasure\" and \"the Jewel of the High Sierra\" [147] [148] She founded the Lake Tahoe Summit in 1997 and successfully authored the landmark Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2000 [149] [150] This act of Congress formally created the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit within the National Forest System and authorized $900 million in federal spending over ten years for invasive species control, stormwater management, environmental protection, and fire risk mitigation projects throughout the Lake Tahoe watershed [151] Later in 2016, Feinstein co-sponsored with senators Barbara Boxer, Harry Reid, and Dean Heller a bipartisan seven-year extension of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, authorizing another $415 million to combat invasive species, improve water quality and forest health, restore habitat for fish and wildlife, and reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires [152] [153] She co-sponsored a second bipartisan, bicameral reauthorization of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act's activities with senators Catherine Cortez Masto, Jacky Rosen, and Alex Padilla on March 1, 2023 – six months before her death [154]\n\n\nPublic lands\nFeinstein co-sponsored legislation in 2006 with Barbara Boxer that permanently protected approximately 300,000 acres of wilderness in Northern California, namely the King Range, Yolla-Bolly Middle Eel, and Trinity Alps wilderness areas, along with 21 miles of the Black Butte River in Mendocino County [155] The King Range Wilderness, part of the King Range National Conservation Area, has the longest stretch of undeveloped coastline anywhere in the lower 48 states; its Lost Coast is often considered the \"crown jewel\" in the National Landscape Conservation System [156] [157] The Yolla-Bolly Middle Eel Wilderness, which surrounds the Middle Fork Eel River, hosts roughly half of California's summer-run steelhead population The river is the largest remaining wild run of these fish in the lower 48 states [158] [159] The Trinity Alps Wilderness encompasses rugged mountains, alpine meadows, myriad pristine lakes and streams, 550 miles of maintained hiking trails, and California's third-largest swath of previously unprotected old-growth, predominantly Douglas-fir forest [160]\n\n\nForeign policy\nFeinstein supported a conciliatory approach between China and Taiwan and fostered increased dialogue between high-level Chinese representatives and U.S senators during her first term as senator [171] When asked about her relation with Beijing, Feinstein said, \"I sometimes say that in my last life maybe I was Chinese.\" [171]\n\n\nChina\nFeinstein supported a conciliatory approach between China and Taiwan and fostered increased dialogue between high-level Chinese representatives and U.S senators during her first term as senator [171] When asked about her relation with Beijing, Feinstein said, \"I sometimes say that in my last life maybe I was Chinese.\" [171]\n\n\nIran\nFeinstein supported the Iran nuclear deal framework in July 2015, saying that it would usher in \"unprecedented & intrusive inspections to verify cooperation\" by Iran [176]\n\n\nIraq\nFeinstein voted for the Iraq War and later said she regretted it [178]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn September 2016—in advance of UN Security Council resolution 2334 condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories—Feinstein signed an AIPAC-sponsored letter urging Obama to veto \"one-sided\" resolutions against Israel [179]\n\n\nNorth Korea\nDuring a July 2017 appearance on Face the Nation after North Korea conducted a second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, Feinstein said the country had proven itself a danger to the U.S She also expressed her disappointment with China's lack of response [181]\n\n\nGun control\nFeinstein introduced the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which became law in 1994 and expired in 2004 [184] In January 2013, about a month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, she and Representative Carolyn McCarthy proposed a bill that would \"ban the sale, transfer, manufacturing or importation of 150 specific firearms including semiautomatic rifles or pistols that can be used with a detachable or fixed ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and have specific military-style features, including pistol grips, grenade launchers or rocket launchers\" The bill would have exempted 900 models of guns used for sport and hunting [184] [185] Feinstein said of the bill, \"The common thread in each of these shootings is the gunman used a semi-automatic assault weapon or large-capacity ammunition magazines Military assault weapons only have one purpose, and in my opinion, it's for the military.\" [186] The bill failed on a Senate vote of 60 to 40 [187]\n\n\nHealth care\nFeinstein supported the Affordable Care Act, repeatedly voting to defeat initiatives aimed against it [188] She voted to regulate tobacco as a drug; expand the Children's Health Insurance Program; override the president's veto of adding 2 to 4 million children to SCHIP eligibility; increase Medicaid rebate for producing generic drugs; negotiate bulk purchases for Medicare prescription drugs; allow re-importation of prescription drugs from Canada; allow patients to sue HMOs and collect punitive damages; cover prescription drugs under Medicare, and means-test Medicare She voted against the Paul Ryan Budget's Medicare choice, tax and spending cuts; and allowing tribal Indians to opt out of federal healthcare [189] Feinstein also favored the creation of a public option to achieve universal healthcare, co-sponsoring a bill with that aim [190] [191] Feinstein's congressional voting record was rated as 88% by the American Public Health Association (APHA), the figure ostensibly reflecting the percentage of time the representative voted the organization's preferred position [192]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn September 2017, after Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Feinstein admitted the legality of the program was questionable while citing this as a reason for why a law should be passed [196] In her opening remarks at a January 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, she said she was concerned the Trump administration's decision to terminate temporary protected status might be racially motivated, based on comments Trump made denigrating African countries, Haiti, and El Salvador [197]\n\n\nLGBTQ+ rights\nIn 1996, Feinstein was one of only 14 senators to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as an opposite-sex union for purposes of federal law [198] In 2011, she introduced a bill to repeal DOMA [199] In 2022, she was the lead Senate sponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed DOMA and required the federal government and all state governments to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages [200]\n\n\nMarijuana\nFeinstein opposed a number of reforms to cannabis laws at the state and federal level In 2016 she opposed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, to legalize recreational cannabis in California [201] In 1996 she opposed Proposition 215 to legalize the medical use of cannabis in California [202] In 2015 she was the only Democrat at a Senate hearing to vote against the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment, legislation that limits the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized medical cannabis [202] Feinstein cited her belief that cannabis is a gateway drug in voting against the amendment [202]\n\n\nNational security\nWhile delivering the commencement address at Stanford Stadium on June 13, 1994, Feinstein said:\n\n\nDefense policy\nWhile delivering the commencement address at Stanford Stadium on June 13, 1994, Feinstein said:\n\n\nMass surveillance and citizens' privacy\nFeinstein co-sponsored PIPA on May 12, 2011 [210] She met with representatives of technology companies, including Google and Facebook, in January 2012 A Feinstein spokesperson said she \"is doing all she can to ensure that the bill is balanced and protects the intellectual property concerns of the content community without unfairly burdening legitimate businesses such as Internet search engines\" [211]\n\n\nTorture\nFeinstein served on the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence, her time on the committee coinciding with the Senate Report on Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq and the debates on the torture/\"enhanced interrogation\" of terrorists and alleged terrorists On the Senate floor on December 9, 2014, the day parts of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture were released to the public, Feinstein called the government's detention and interrogation program a \"stain on our values and on our history\" [229]\n\n\nPresidential politics\nDuring the 1980 presidential election, Feinstein served on President Jimmy Carter's steering committee in California and as a Carter delegate to the Democratic National Convention [230] [231] She was selected to serve as one of the four chairs of the 1980 Democratic National Convention [232]\n\n\nSupreme Court

1992 to 2023. She was a member of the Democratic Party and was known for her work on gun control, abortion rights, and environmental protection. Feinstein was also a strong advocate for a national defense and was a key player in the passage of several significant pieces of legislation during her time in the Senate.\n\nEarly Life and Education\nDianne Feinstein was born on June 22, 1933, in San Francisco, California, to Leon Goldman, a prominent surgeon, and his wife, Betty (née Rosenburg), a former model. Her paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Poland, while her maternal grandparents, the Rosenburgs, were from Saint Petersburg, Russia. Although they were of German-Jewish ancestry, they practiced the Russian Orthodox (Christian) faith. Christianity was passed down to Feinstein's mother, who insisted on her transfer from a Jewish day school to a prestigious local Catholic school. However, Feinstein listed her religion as Judaism.\n\nFeinstein's childhood was marked by a strong sense of social responsibility and a commitment to public service. She was a student leader and was involved in various community organizations throughout her youth. After graduating from high school, Feinstein attended Stanford University, where she studied history and was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. She graduated in 1955 and later earned a law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law.\n\nEarly Political Career\nFeinstein's entry into politics began in 1955 when she was selected as a fellow at the Coro Foundation in San Francisco. The Coro Foundation is an organization that provides young people with political experience and training. As a fellow, Feinstein worked on various political campaigns and gained valuable experience in grassroots politics. In 1960, Governor Pat Brown appointed her to the California Women's Parole Board, where she served until 1966.\n\nIn 1969, Feinstein was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, where she served for nine years. During her time on the board, she was known for her advocacy on issues related to women's rights, education, and the environment.

As the president of the Board of Supervisors, Feinstein became acting mayor, pending an election or appointment by the board. In a special election, Feinstein was appointed as mayor by the board, with a vote of six to two. She was inaugurated on December 4, 1978, becoming the first female mayor of San Francisco.\n\nGubernatorial Election\nIn 1990, Feinstein made an unsuccessful bid for governor of California.

In 1992, Feinstein was fined $190,000 for failure to properly report campaign contributions and expenditures in that campaign.\n\nU.S. Senate\nIn 1991, Wilson resigned from the Senate to take office as governor of California. Feinstein ran for U.S. Senate in a 1992 special election to complete Wilson's term. She won the Democratic primary, defeating Joseph Alioto and California State Controller Gray Davis. In the general election, she faced Republican John Seymour, whom Wilson had appointed to the Senate the previous year. Feinstein won the November 3 special election, 54.3%–38%.\n\nTenure\nFeinstein's tenure in the Senate was marked by significant legislative achievements. She was known for her work on gun control issues, including the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 1994. She also led a bipartisan effort to reduce automotive greenhouse gas emissions, which accounted for 26 percent of total U.S. emissions at the time. Her legislation, the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, raised corporate average fuel economy standards for America's fleet of vehicles by at least 10 miles per gallon between 2010 and 2020.\n\nCommittee Assignments\nFeinstein served as the chair of the Senate Rules Committee from 2007 to 2009 and the first woman to chair the Select Committee on Intelligence from 2009 to 2015.

She was also a strong advocate for a national defense and was a key player in the passage of several significant pieces of legislation during her time in the Senate.\n\nAbortion\nFeinstein supported abortion rights during her Senate career. In 2003, she voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a proposal to ban intact dilation and extraction. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, Feinstein called for congressional action to protect abortion rights and stated her support for lifting the Senate filibuster rule to allow such legislation to pass with a simple majority.\n\nCapital Punishment\nWhen Feinstein first ran for statewide office in 1990, she supported capital punishment. However, by 2018, she opposed capital punishment.\n\nEnergy and Environment\nIn 2007, Feinstein led a bipartisan effort to reduce automotive greenhouse gas emissions, which accounted for 26 percent of total U.S. emissions at the time.

{"title": "Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant_–_Khorasan_Province", "content": "\nName\nDue in part to the contentious and fluid naming pattern of the larger Islamic State organization, ISIS–K is referred to by a number of name variants [31] [32] [33] The larger organization has shifted between names such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Islamic State of Iraq and as-Sham (ISIS), and later simply the Islamic State (IS) [32] Added to the larger organization's name, 'Khorasan Province' varies in abbreviation between 'K' and 'KP' Thus, commonly used English abbreviations for the group include ISIS–K, ISIL–K, IS–K, ISIS–KP, ISIL–KP, IS–KP, ISISK, ISK, and ISKP.\n\n\nHistory\nPrior to the official establishment of ISIS–K in 2015, a number of Islamic militant jihadist groups operated in South and Central Asia, seeking to supplant existing governments with a more fundamentalist, Islamist government These groups fought against the governments of Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, and China, most with support from al-Qaeda which had operated with a base of operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan since 1988 In response to failed negotiations with the Taliban following the September 11th 2001 attacks by al-Qaeda against the United States, the U.S overthrew the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and launched a military campaign against al-Qaeda and Taliban militants who fought to reclaim the country The insurgent conflict became a focal point for jihadism in the Khorasan region with nearly every jihadist group in the region taking part to varying degrees [28]\n\n\nBackground\nPrior to the official establishment of ISIS–K in 2015, a number of Islamic militant jihadist groups operated in South

fought to reclaim the country The insurgent conflict became a focal point for jihadism in the Khorasan region with nearly every jihadist group in the region taking part to varying degrees [28]\n\n\nFormation\nOn 14 July 2012, Hafiz Saeed Khan, a prominent Pakistani Taliban (TTP) leader, agreed to rapidly assemble a group of 143 Afghan and Pakistani volunteer fighters for al-Qaeda to dispatch to join the al-Nusra Front in Syria Similarly, as the Taliban's Quetta Shura and leadership council (Rahbari Shura) refused to send fighters to Syria, the Taliban's Peshawar Shura and semi-autonomous Miran Shah Shura (better known as the Haqqani network) arranged a deal between Sirajuddin Haqqani and ISIS-leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to deploy Afghan and Pakistani jihadists to the Syrian conflict on salaries of $800 a month, four times that of Taliban fighters Most importantly, these jihadist units fought as organized groups and would eventually be brought back to Afghanistan and Pakistan, unlike previous groups which were assimilated into local jihadist groups fighting in Syria Deployments of groups by al-Qaeda in South Asia and by parts of the Taliban quickly made a remarkable impact on the Syrian conflict From 2012 through 2014, the ranks of Afghans and Pakistanis in ISIS grew massively with at least 1,000 volunteers deployed by TTP alone [28]\n\n\nExpansion\nThough ISIS–K, when it was officially declared in January 2015, was the product of the merger of Tehrik-e Khilafat Khorasan (TKK), Khilafat Afghan, Muslim Dost's group, Azizullah Haqqani's group, and Tehrik-e Khilafat Pakistan (TKP), the organization's expansion attracted various other militant groups, including many from Afghanistan's geographic periphery Notable among these are the Omar Ghazi Group, Shamali Khilafat, Gansu Hui Group, [45] Harakat Khilafat Baluch, Jaysh ul Islam, Mullah Bakhtwar's group, the Shamsatoo group, and radical student groups in Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan [28]\nBeyond the incorporation of smaller militant groups, the newly ordained ISIS–K forged significant alliances with other Sunni jihadist movements in the region to include the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), Islamic Movement of Turkmenistan (IMT), Uyghur East Turkestan Islamic Party (ETIP), Jamaat Ansarullah, Harakat Islami Tajikistan, and the Islamic Jihad Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IJRPT), Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, and Baluchi militant groups including the Pakistani and Iranian Jundullah movements, which ISIS–K united These groups shared with ISIS–K a violent opposition to Shia Muslims and the desire to replace existing secular and democratic institutions in the region with a powerful Islamic state Many of these groups, prior to the establishment of ISIS–K, relied on limited support from al-Qaeda, which by the time of ISIS–K's founding had been dismissed as too focused and engaged in the struggle against NATO forces in Afghanistan and not on other Central Asian jihadist movements ISIS–K's perceived influence in Central Asian nations was an important driver for many Sunni Muslim donors in the Arabian Gulf who financially supported ISIS–K as a counterbalance to the threat of Russian anti-Islamic influence in the former Soviet Central Asian states [28]\n\n\nOperations\nOn 24 January 2018, militants launched a bomb and gun attack on a Save the Children office in Jalalabad, killing six people and injuring 27 ISIS–K claimed responsibility, saying it was targeting Western institutions In the aftermath of the attack, Save the Children suspended its operations in Afghanistan [49]\n\n\nExternal operations\nThe majority of ISIS–K attacks have been based in Afghanistan, traditionally the group's primary base of operations Since the close of the NATO presence in Afghanistan and the subsequent military takeover by the Taliban, the group has increased its presence across the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK), where it has launched an increasing share of its attacks.\n\n\nOperations by opponents\nOn 4 April 2020, the National Directorate of Security announced the arrest of the head of IS Aslam Farooqi by the Afghan military forces who took him into custody along with 20 other commanders [76]\n\n\nFunding\nISIS–K sustains its operations through a complex financing structure that draws on diverse sources [28]\n\n\nAnalysis\nSince the Taliban took control of the Afghan central government following the United States withdrawal and collapse of the Afghan National Army (ANA) in August 2021, the Taliban has been locked in a violent counterinsurgency struggle against ISIS–K [93] The Taliban-led Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has sought international legitimacy by demonstrating its efforts to curb terrorism and secure national sovereignty over Afghan territory, namely for prospects of international investment to reverse Afghanistan's increasing poverty [94] [95]\n\n\nTaliban - ISIS-K relations\nSince the Taliban took control of the Afghan central government following the United States withdrawal and collapse of the Afghan National Army (ANA) in August 2021, the Taliban has been locked in a violent counterinsurgency struggle against ISIS–K [93] The Taliban-led Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has sought international legitimacy by demonstrating its efforts to curb terrorism and secure national sovereignty over Afghan territory, namely for prospects of international investment to reverse Afghanistan's increasing poverty [94] [95]\n\n\nMembership\nAccording to a UN report, up to 70 IS fighters arrived from Iraq and Syria to form the initial core of the group in Afghanistan [103] Most of the group's membership growth has come from recruiting Afghan defectors from the Taliban [104] In Afghanistan, IS has not only been recruiting from the villages but also the urban middle class and specifically targeting the universities, as lecturers in Islamic law as well as students at Kabul University have pledged allegiance to the group [105]\n\n\nLeaders\nIn line with the Islamic State's overall aims to re-establish an Islamic caliphate, like those of the Rashidun Caliphate ruled by Muhammad's successors, Caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali, the Islamic State and ISIS–K use the same historic titles for leaders The head of the Islamic State's envisioned caliphate, with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (29 June 2014 – 27 October 2019) the longest serving, is known as the 'Caliph' (خَلِيفَةْ) to all members of the organization Leaders of the Islamic State's regional provinces ('Wilayah') such as ISIS–K and ISWAP, are referred to as 'Wali' (Arabic: والي), often translated as 'governor' As an example, during the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750 CE) Nasr ibn Sayyar served as the last Wali (governor) of Khurasan Province, appointed under Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik and serving under the final five caliphs of the Umayyad Caliphate until he was ejected into Persia by forces of the new Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258 CE) Leaders at every level are referred to as 'emir' (Arabic: أمير) which has been variously translated as 'commander' or 'chief' Emirs serve at various levels to include functional emirs (e.g external operations emir), organizational emirs (e.g finance commission emir), or territorial emirs (e.g provincial emir, district emir) \n\n\nFoothold and strategy\nWhile the group has managed to establish a foothold in Afghanistan, it has largely carried out isolated, smaller-scale attacks in Pakistan [118] The group has also failed to establish a foothold in Pakistan because of anti-terrorism operations conducted by Pakistan's law enforcement agencies against the group A series of successful operations by US, Afghan and coalition forces in Afghanistan against the group has also crippled the group's ability to operate in the region [119]\n\n\nDesignation as a terrorist organization\nMany nations effectively designate ISIS–K as a terrorist organization as a subordinate element of the larger Islamic State, though not listing it separately On 14 May 2019, the United Nations Security Council's (UNSC) ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee listed \"The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan\" as designated entity QDe.161, the first ISIS affiliate to be individually designated by the United Nations [120] Immediately following, some states automatically adopted the UN designation of ISIS–K \n\n\nMedia\nISIS–K is a prolific producer of propaganda, outdone only by the Islamic State's core in Iraq and Syria ISIS–K publishes and circulates a variety of materials through the al-Azaim Media Foundation (Arabic: مؤسسة العزائم, romanized: Muasasat al-A'zayim) for Media Production, whose status as an official element of ISIS–K experts disagree on as the group has yet to claim or disclaim them Notably, the al-Azaim Foundation has been known to issue claims of attacks before al-Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State's foremost source for claims of attacks by any Islamic State affiliate Al-Azaim, which publishes nearly all ISIS–K propaganda, appeared publicly in August 2021 as the US withdrew its forces and the Taliban took power in Kabul [130] Prior to the Taliban takeover, ISIS–K propaganda was produced and distributed by multiple organizations including Khalid Media (responsible for video statements) and Black Flags (audio and text statements), until their 2021 consolidation into al-Azaim Content for al-Azaim is often written and submitted by sympathizers and supporters in the region, about 70% of which is originally published in Pashto, however many supporters provide translation services of al-Azaim's content and that of the Islamic State's publications into Pashto, Dari, Urdu, Tajik, Bengali, Hindi, Russian, and sometimes Arabic, Tamil, Malayalam, and Uyghur Al-Azaim primarily disseminates its content through Telegram, X (formerly Twitter), Rocket.chat, and others In 2022, amidst raids by the Taliban General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) against ISIS–K targets, GDI had infiltrated a number of ISIS–K channels which had temporarily disrupted content distribution [131]

ejected into Persia by forces of the new Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258 CE) Leaders at every level are referred to as 'emir' (Arabic: أمير) which has been variously translated as 'commander' or 'chief' Emirs serve at various levels to include functional emirs (e.g external operations emir), organizational emirs (e.g finance commission emir), or territorial emirs (e.g provincial emir, district emir) \n\n\nFoothold and strategy\nWhile the group has managed to establish a foothold in Afghanistan, it has largely carried out isolated, smaller-scale attacks in Pakistan [118] The group has also failed to establish a foothold in Pakistan because of anti-terrorism operations conducted by Pakistan's law enforcement agencies against the group A series of successful operations by US, Afghan and coalition forces in Afghanistan against the group has also crippled the group's ability to operate in the region [119]\n\n\nDesignation as a terrorist organization\nMany nations effectively designate ISIS–K as a terrorist organization as a subordinate element of the larger Islamic State, though not listing it separately On 14 May 2019, the United Nations Security Council's (UNSC) ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee listed \"The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan\" as designated entity QDe.161, the first ISIS affiliate to be individually designated by the United Nations [120] Immediately following, some states automatically adopted the UN designation of ISIS–K \n\n\nMedia\nISIS–K is a prolific producer of propaganda, outdone only by the Islamic State's core in Iraq and Syria ISIS–K publishes and circulates a variety of materials through the al-Azaim Media Foundation (Arabic: مؤسسة العزائم, romanized: Muasasat al-A'zayim) for Media Production, whose status as an official element of ISIS–K experts disagree on as the group has yet to claim or disclaim them Notably, the al-Azaim Foundation has been known to issue claims of attacks before al-Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State's foremost source for claims of attacks by any Islamic State affiliate Al-Azaim, which publishes nearly all ISIS–K propaganda, appeared publicly in August 2021 as the US withdrew its forces and the Taliban took power in Kabul [130] Prior to the Taliban takeover, ISIS–K propaganda was produced and distributed by multiple organizations including Khalid Media (responsible for video statements) and Black Flags (audio and text statements), until their 2021 consolidation into al-Azaim Content for al-Azaim is often written and submitted by sympathizers and supporters in the region, about 70% of which is originally published in Pashto, however many supporters provide translation services of al-Azaim's content and that of the Islamic State's publications into Pashto, Dari, Urdu, Tajik, Bengali, Hindi, Russian, and sometimes Arabic, Tamil, Malayalam, and Uyghur Al-Azaim primarily disseminates its content through Telegram, X (formerly Twitter), Rocket.chat, and others In 2022, amidst raids by the Taliban General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) against ISIS–K targets, GDI had infiltrated a number of ISIS–K channels which had temporarily disrupted content distribution [131]

He is the second child of Don and Joann Hurley. His family moved to Birdsboro, Pennsylvania, where he spent most of his childhood. Hurley has an older sister, Heather, and a younger brother, Brent. His parents were both high school sweethearts, and his father was a self-employed contractor.\n\nGrowing up in a close-knit family, Hurley developed a strong sense of values and a passion for technology. His parents encouraged his interest in computers and programming, and he spent countless hours experimenting with coding and building his own websites.\n\nHurley attended Wilson High School in West Lawn, Pennsylvania, where he was an average student but excelled in mathematics and science. He was also an active member of the school's debate team and played on the basketball team.\n\nAfter high school, Hurley attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in fine arts. During his college years, he became interested in web design and development, and he began to build websites for local businesses.\n\n**Career**\n\nHurley's career in technology began in the late 1990s, when he worked as a web developer for a small firm in Philadelphia. He soon moved to San Francisco to join the team at PayPal, where he worked as a product designer and developed the company's first website.\n\nIn 2005, Hurley co-founded YouTube with Steve Chen and Jawed Karim. The idea for the site was born out of a difficulty in finding and sharing videos online. The three founders developed a platform that would allow users to upload, share, and view videos, and YouTube quickly gained popularity.\n\nOn October 16, 2006, Chen and Hurley sold YouTube to Google Inc (now Google LLC) for $1.65 billion. Hurley's share of the sale was estimated to be around $345.6 million, based on Google's stock price at the time.\n\n**YouTube**\n\nYouTube was founded in February 2005 by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim. The site was initially designed to allow users to share and view videos, and it quickly gained popularity. In the first year, the site saw a massive increase in traffic, and by the end of 2006, it had become one of the most popular websites in the world.\n\nHurley served as the CEO of YouTube until 2010, when he stepped down and was replaced by Salar Kamangar. During his tenure, Hurley oversaw the site's rapid growth and expansion, and he played a key role in developing the site's features and user interface.\n\n**MixBit**\n\nIn August 2013, Hurley launched MixBit, a video editing app for smartphones. The app allows users to create and share short videos, and it features a range of editing tools and effects. MixBit was developed by Hurley and his team at Avos, a company he founded in 2012.\n\nAccording to Steve Chen, Hurley's idea to develop MixBit was born out of a desire to create a platform that would allow users to easily create and share short-form videos. The app has gained popularity, and it has become a popular alternative to traditional video editing software.\n\n**Formula One**\n\nHurley was involved as a major investor in the US F1 Team, a new entrant in the Formula One automobile racing for the 2010 season. The team was founded by Ken Anderson, and it was backed by a number of investors, including Hurley.\n\nHowever, the team struggled to make an impact in its first season, and it was eventually shut down. Neither Hurley nor the team's management would comment on the reasons behind the team's failure.\n\n**Investments**\n\nHurley has made a number of investments in various companies and ventures. He is a minority owner of the NBA's Golden State Warriors and the MLS' Los Angeles Football Club.\n\nHurley's investments are focused on technology and sports, and he has a reputation for being a shrewd and savvy investor. His involvement with the Warriors and the LAFC has helped to promote the teams and increase their visibility.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nHurley was previously married to Kathy Clark, the daughter of Silicon Valley entrepreneur James H Clark. The couple met while working at PayPal, and they were married in 2006. However, they divorced in 2012.\n\nHurley has been open about his struggles with marriage and relationships, and he has spoken publicly about the challenges he faced in his marriage. He has since remarried to Elise Walden, and the couple has been together since 2020.\n\nHurley is known for his love of technology and innovation, and he has been involved in various charitable initiatives and causes. He has also been a vocal advocate for social justice and human rights.\n\nOverall, Chad Hurley is a successful entrepreneur and investor who has made a significant impact in the world of technology and sports. His achievements and experiences have inspired countless people, and he continues to be a prominent figure in the business and philanthropic communities.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chad_Hurley\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nHurley was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, the second child of Don and Joann Hurley, and grew up near Birdsboro, Pennsylvania [7] He has an older sister, Heather, and a younger brother, Brent [8]\n\n\nCareer\nHurley founded YouTube in 2005 with Steve Chen and Jawed Karim On October 16, 2006, Chen and Hurley sold YouTube to Google Inc (now Google LLC) for $1.65 billion It was reported in The Wall Street Journal that Hurley's share was $345.6M at Google's February 7, 2007, closing stock price of $470.01 He received 694,087 Google shares directly and another 41,232 shares in a trust [citation needed]\n\n\nYouTube\nHurley founded YouTube in 2005 with Steve Chen and Jawed Karim On October 16, 2006, Chen and Hurley sold YouTube to Google Inc (now Google LLC) for $1.65 billion It was reported in The Wall Street Journal that Hurley's share was $345.6M at Google's February 7, 2007, closing stock price of $470.01 He received 694,087 Google shares directly and another 41,232 shares in a trust [citation needed]\n\n\nMixBit\nIn August 2013, Hurley launched another company called MixBit which does video editing using smartphones [1] According to Steve Chen, it was Chad's idea to turn Avos into MixBit even before the inception of YouTube [12]\n\n\nFormula One\nHurley was involved as a major investor with US F1 Team, one of the new entrants in Formula One automobile racing for the 2010 season On March 2, 2010, the team's personnel were dismissed from their duties and the team was unofficially shut down Neither Hurley, team principal Ken Anderson nor sporting director Peter Windsor would comment on the team's failure to make it to the grid [14]\n\n\nInvestments\nHurley has made several investments He is a minority owner of the NBA's Golden State Warriors and the MLS' Los Angeles Football Club [15]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHurley was formerly married to Kathy Clark, the daughter of Silicon Valley entrepreneur James H Clark [18] They divorced in 2012 [19] Hurley remarried in 2020 to Elise Walden [20]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d'Or, the festival's top award. The film follows the story of Alexia, a young woman with a titanium plate in her head, who embarks on a journey of self-discovery and transformation.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a dramatic car accident, in which a young girl named Alexia suffers a severe head injury and undergoes surgery to have a titanium plate inserted into her skull. As she recovers from her injuries, Alexia shuns her parents and becomes fixated on their car, which she had been riding in when the accident occurred. The car becomes a symbol of her newfound independence and freedom.\n\nAs Alexia grows older, she undergoes a series of transformations, both physical and emotional, that blur the lines between human and machine. She begins to identify as a car, donning a bodysuit that mimics the shape and contours of a vehicle. Her transformation is marked by a series of bizarre and unsettling incidents, including a confrontation with a group of raccoons and a series of violent outbursts.\n\nDespite its dark and unsettling subject matter, the film is also a poignant exploration of identity, community, and the human condition. Through Alexia's journey, the film raises important questions about what it means to be alive, and how we define ourselves in relation to others.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast of actors, including Agathe Rousselle, Vincent Lindon, and Myriem Akheddiine. Agathe Rousselle plays the lead role of Alexia, bringing a depth and nuance to the character that is both captivating and unsettling. Vincent Lindon plays the role of Vincent, a grieving father who is struggling to come to terms with his daughter's transformation.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was shot on location in France and Belgium, using a combination of digital and 35mm film. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the beauty and brutality of the natural world.

He is best known for his work in film sound post-production and his pioneering efforts in adopting the Dolby 5.1 channel for film sound in Korea. Choi has collaborated with renowned director Bong Joon-ho on several critically acclaimed films, including Snowpiercer, Okja, and Parasite.\n\n## Early Life\n\nChoi Tae-young first developed an interest in music during his high school years. He pursued a career as a recording engineer and even joined a band, but the band disbanded in 1994 before releasing an album. Following the disbandment, Choi furthered his studies in recording engineering at the Los Angeles Recording School in Los Angeles, California. He then took courses in music business and recording engineering at UCLA Extension.\n\nIt was during this time that he discovered the potential of a career in film sound post-production. However, Choi initially majored in sound, but did not specifically study sound engineering for film. This lack of specialized knowledge would later become a challenge for him in the film industry.\n\n## Career\n\nAfter returning to South Korea, Choi co-founded Livetone, a startup sound production studio in 1996. Initially, Choi handled all aspects of sound post-production at the studio. As the company expanded, he shifted his focus to sound mixing. Livetone was a pioneer in Korea, being the first to adopt the Dolby 5.1 channel for film's sound, with their debut feature film Beat in 1997.\n\n## Establishment of Livetone\n\nAfter returning to South Korea, Choi, a 27-year-old technical director at the time, co-founded Livetone, a startup sound production studio in 1996.

Livetone was a pioneer in Korea, being the first to adopt the Dolby 5.1 channel for film's sound, with their debut feature film Beat in 1997.\n\n## Choi's Early Challenges in Film Sound\n\nChoi initially encountered significant challenges when he entered the film industry in the early 2000s. These difficulties stemmed from his limited understanding of how sound functions within the context of film. Choi viewed sound in a simplistic manner: sound is just sound, without considering the mise-en-scène or the director's intentions. His approach focused solely on the technical aspects of sound, rather than its integration into the overall cinematic experience.\n\n## Working with Bong Joon-ho\n\nChoi is well-known for his extensive collaborations with acclaimed director Bong Joon-ho. He has contributed to Bong's entire filmography, starting from his first feature Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000) to his critically acclaimed works like Snowpiercer, Okja, and Parasite. Choi's work with Bong Joon-ho has been instrumental in shaping the sound of Bong's films and has helped to establish him as one of the leading sound engineers in Korea.\n\n## OTT Series\n\nChoi discussed the unique approach to zombies in the popular Korean series Kingdom. He explained that unlike the slow-moving zombies often depicted in Western cinema, zombies in Kingdom series were characterized by their speed and agility, creating a distinct and thrilling cinematic experience.\n\n## Recent Works\n\nIn 2018, Choi, on behalf of Dexter Livetone, and Ryu Jae-rim, director of the Korean Film Archive, signed a business agreement at the 'Sound Master Data Donation Ceremony' held at the Korean Film Archive in Mapo-gu, Seoul. Through the agreement, Dexter Livetone will donate over 200 original analog and digital sound pieces it owns to the Korea Film Archive.

Israel and their intervention in the Middle East The attacks were given the go ahead by bin Laden in late 1998 or early 1999 The World Trade Center was chosen as one of the targets due to it being a prominent American symbol that represented economic prowess [2]\n\n\nAttacks\nThe flight was hijacked as part of the September 11 attacks The team was assembled by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who

Israel and their intervention in the Middle East The attacks were given the go ahead by bin Laden in late 1998 or early 1999 The World Trade Center was chosen as one of the targets due to it being a prominent American symbol that represented economic prowess [2]\n\n\nHijackers\nThe team of hijackers on United Airlines Flight 175 was led by Marwan al-Shehhi, originally from the United Arab Emirates with a stint in Hamburg, Germany, as a student By January 2001, the pilot hijackers had completed their training; Shehhi obtained a commercial pilot license while training in South Florida, [2] along with American Airlines Flight 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta and Flight 93 hijacker Ziad Jarrah The hijackers on Flight 175 included Fayez Banihammad, also from the UAE, and three Saudis: brothers Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi, as well as Mohand al-Shehri [4] [5]\n\n\nFlight\nThe flight was operated by a Boeing 767-200, registration number N612UA [8] It had a capacity of 168 passengers (10 in first class, 32 in business class, and 126 in economy class) On the day of the attacks, the flight carried only 56 passengers and 9 crew, which represented a 33 percent load factor – well below the average load factor of 49 percent in the three months preceding September 11 [5] Out of the 60 occupants (excluding the five hijackers), there were 50 Americans, 3 Germans, 2 Britons and one each originating from Iran, Israel, Indonesia, Ireland, and Canada The youngest person on Flight 175 was Christine Hanson, aged two and a half; [9] the oldest 82-year-old Dorothy DeAraujo of Long Beach, California [10] Among the other passengers were hockey scout Garnet Bailey, and former athlete Mark Bavis The pilot in command was 51-year-old Victor Saracini, a former Navy fighter pilot who had worked for United Airlines since 1985 [11] The airplane was co-piloted by First Officer Michael Horrocks, 38, who had previously served as a fighter pilot in the Marine Corps [12] [13] The cabin crew consisted of purser Kathryn Laborie as well as flight attendants Amy Jarret, Alfred Marchand, Alicia Titus, Amy King, Michael Tarrou and Robert Fangman [14]\n\n\nBoarding\nTwo hours before boarding, al-Shehhi took a phone call from Ziad Jarrah at 05:01 Jarrah was set to hijack Flight 93 out of Newark, New Jersey, not far from the Twin Towers The purpose of the call was to confirm they were all set to carry out the attacks [15] Hamza al-Ghamdi and Ahmed al-Ghamdi checked out of their hotel and called a taxi to take them to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts [16] They arrived at the United Airlines counter in Terminal C at 06:20 Eastern Time and Ahmed al-Ghamdi checked two bags Both hijackers indicated they wanted to purchase tickets, even though they already had paper tickets, which were purchased approximately two weeks before the attacks [2] They had trouble answering the standard security questions, so the counter agent repeated the questions very slowly until satisfied with their responses [5] [17] Hijacker pilot Marwan al-Shehhi checked a single bag at 06:45, and the other remaining hijackers, Fayez Banihammad and Mohand al-Shehri, checked in at 06:53; Banihammad checked two bags [5] None of the Flight 175 hijackers were selected for extra scrutiny by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) [18] In the meantime, al-Shehhi approached a payphone and called Mohamed Atta's cellphone Atta was preparing to board American Airlines Flight 11 from another terminal in Logan, and would fly the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center 17 minutes before al-Shehhi crashed into the South Tower Like the earlier conversation with Jarrah, the intent of this final communication was to confirm that they were both ready to go ahead with the attacks [19]\n\n\nHijacking\nThe hijackers launched their assault seconds later at 08:42, and were in full control of the plane by 08:46, the same minute Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower [24] Investigators believe that the al-Ghamdi brothers forced the passengers and crew to the aft of the plane by terrorizing them with knives and bomb threats, while also spraying mace into the confines of the cabin [20] Several flight attendants were stabbed or slashed, and both pilots were murdered by Fayez Banihammad and Mohand al-Shehri when they breached the cockpit, allowing Marwan al-Shehhi to commandeer the flight controls [20] [25] The first operational evidence that something was abnormal on Flight 175 came seconds after the North Tower was struck, when the plane's transponder signal changed twice within the span of one minute, and the aircraft began deviating from its assigned course [20] [25] However, Bottiglia did not notice until minutes later at 08:51 [5] Unlike Flight 11, which had turned its transponder off, Flight 175's flight data could still be properly monitored [25] Also, at 08:51, Flight 175 changed altitude Over the next three minutes, the controller made five unsuccessful attempts to contact Flight 175 and worked to move other aircraft in the vicinity away from Flight 175 [5] At 08:55, a supervisor at the New York Air Traffic Control Center notified the center's operations manager of the Flight 175 hijacking Now tasked with handling Flight 175, Bottiglia remarked, \"We might have a hijack over here, two of them.\" [5]\n\n\nNear misses\nAround this time, the flight had a near midair collision with Delta Air Lines Flight 2315 flying from Hartford to Tampa, reportedly missing the plane by only 300 feet (90 m) [26] [27] [28] Bottiglia yelled at the Delta pilot to make collision avoidance maneuvers, adding, \"I think  [Flight 175] has been hijacked I don't know his intentions Take any evasive action necessary.\" [26] [27] It is likely that the TCAS system was sounding in the cockpit as Flight 175 briefly stopped descending at 28,000 feet (8,530 m) and climbed 300 feet (90 m) and started descending again as soon as they passed the Delta plane [29] A few moments later, Flight 175 had another near midair collision with TWA Flight 3 flying from JFK to St Louis missing its tail by around 500 feet (150 m) [30] Moments before Flight 175 crashed, it also narrowly avoided colliding with Midwest Express Flight 7, which was flying from Milwaukee to New York [31]\n\n\nCalls\nFlight attendant Robert Fangman and passengers Peter Hanson and Brian David Sweeney made phone calls from GTE airphones in the rear of the aircraft Airphone records also indicate that passenger Garnet Bailey attempted to call his wife four times [32] [33]\n\n\nCrash\nAt 08:58, Flight 175 was over New Jersey at 28,500 feet (8,700 m), by which point al-Shehhi would have seen the smoke pouring from the North Tower in the distance [38] The airplane was in a sustained power dive of more than 24,000 feet (7,300 m) in the 5 minutes and 4 seconds between approximately 08:58 and the moment of impact, at an average rate of over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) per minute [25] Bottiglia later said that he and his colleagues \"were counting down the altitudes, and they were descending, right at the end, at 10,000 feet per minute That is absolutely unheard of for a commercial jet.\" [27]\n\n\nAftermath\nFlight 175's crash into the South Tower was faster and lower down than that of the North Tower, impacting close to a corner rather than midway into the structure, compromising its structural integrity more Thus, there was far more structural weight pressing down on an unbalanced, damaged section of the building on fire [69] The South Tower collapsed at 9:59 A.M., [65]: 80  [70]: 322  after burning for 56 minutes, [g] Flight 175's impact did not directly cause the collapse of the south tower, but rather the fires caused by the aircraft's jet fuel were the reason for the collapse, [71] the South Tower was the first of the two skyscrapers to collapse despite being the second to be hit, and only burning for around half the amount of time as the North Tower did before it fell Nobody who was in the South Tower at the time of its collapse survived [72]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee

passenger flight that was hijacked by five al-Qaeda terrorists on September 11, 2001, as part of the September 11 attacks. The flight was operated by a Boeing 767-200 aircraft, registration number N612UA, and departed from Boston's Logan International Airport at 8:14 a.m. bound for Los Angeles International Airport. The flight was hijacked 28 minutes after takeoff, and crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City at 9:03 a.m., resulting in the deaths of all 65 people on board, as well as thousands of people in the building.\n\n## Background\n\nThe 9/11 attacks were planned and executed by al-Qaeda, an Islamic extremist group led by Osama bin Laden. The team was assembled by bin Laden, who also provided the financial and logistical support, and was led by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who devised the plot. Bin Laden and Mohammed, along with the hijackers, were motivated by the US's support for Israel and their intervention in the Middle East. The attacks were given the go-ahead by bin Laden in late 1998 or early 1999.

prominent American symbol that represented economic prowess [2]\n\n\nHijackers\nThe team of hijackers on United Airlines Flight 175 was led by Marwan al-Shehhi, originally from the United Arab Emirates with a stint in Hamburg, Germany, as a student By January 2001, the pilot hijackers had completed their training; Shehhi obtained a commercial pilot license while training in South Florida, [2] along with American Airlines Flight 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta and Flight 93 hijacker Ziad Jarrah The hijackers on Flight 175 included Fayez Banihammad, also from the UAE, and three Saudis: brothers Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi, as well as Mohand al-Shehri [4] [5]\n\n\nFlight\nThe flight was operated by a Boeing 767-200, registration number N612UA [8] It had a capacity of 168 passengers (10 in first class, 32 in business class, and 126 in economy class) On the day of the attacks, the flight carried only 56 passengers and 9 crew, which represented a 33 percent load factor – well below the average load factor of 49 percent in the three months preceding September 11 [5] Out of the 60 occupants (excluding the five hijackers), there were 50 Americans, 3 Germans, 2 Britons and one each originating from Iran, Israel, Indonesia, Ireland, and Canada The youngest person on Flight 175 was Christine Hanson, aged two and a half; [9] the oldest 82-year-old Dorothy DeAraujo of Long Beach, California [10] Among the other passengers were hockey scout Garnet Bailey, and former athlete Mark Bavis The pilot in command was 51-year-old Victor Saracini, a former Navy fighter pilot who had worked for United Airlines since 1985 [11] The airplane was co-piloted by First Officer Michael Horrocks, 38, who had previously served as a fighter pilot in the Marine Corps [12] [13] The cabin crew consisted of purser Kathryn Laborie as well as flight attendants Amy Jarret, Alfred Marchand, Alicia Titus, Amy King, Michael Tarrou and Robert Fangman [14]\n\n\nBoarding\nTwo hours before boarding, al-Shehhi took a phone call from Ziad Jarrah at 05:01 Jarrah was set to hijack Flight 93 out of Newark, New Jersey, not far from the Twin Towers The purpose of the call was to confirm they were all set to carry out the attacks [15] Hamza al-Ghamdi and Ahmed al-Ghamdi checked out of their hotel and called a taxi to take them to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts [16] They arrived at the United Airlines counter in Terminal C at 06:20 Eastern Time and Ahmed al-Ghamdi checked two bags Both hijackers indicated they wanted to purchase tickets, even though they already had paper tickets, which were purchased approximately two weeks before the attacks [2] They had trouble answering the standard security questions, so the counter agent repeated the questions very slowly until satisfied with their responses [5] [17] Hijacker pilot Marwan al-Shehhi checked a single bag at 06:45, and the other remaining hijackers, Fayez Banihammad and Mohand al-Shehri, checked in at 06:53; Banihammad checked two bags [5] None of the Flight 175 hijackers were selected for extra scrutiny by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) [18] In the meantime, al-Shehhi approached a payphone and called Mohamed Atta's cellphone Atta was preparing to board American Airlines Flight 11 from another terminal in Logan, and would fly the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center 17 minutes before al-Shehhi crashed into the South Tower Like the earlier conversation with Jarrah, the intent of this final communication was to confirm that they were both ready to go ahead with the attacks [19]\n\n\nHijacking\nThe hijackers launched their assault seconds later at 08:42, and were in full control of the plane by 08:46, the same minute Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower [24] Investigators believe that the al-Ghamdi brothers forced the passengers and crew to the aft of the plane by terrorizing them with knives and bomb threats, while also spraying mace into the confines of the cabin [20] Several flight attendants were stabbed or slashed, and both pilots were murdered by Fayez Banihammad and Mohand al-Shehri when they breached the cockpit, allowing Marwan al-Shehhi to commandeer the flight controls [20] [25] The first operational evidence that something was abnormal on Flight 175 came seconds after the North Tower was struck, when the plane's transponder signal changed twice within the span of one minute, and the aircraft began deviating from its assigned course [20] [25] However, Bottiglia did not notice until minutes later at 08:51 [5] Unlike Flight 11, which had turned its transponder off, Flight 175's flight data could still be properly monitored [25] Also, at 08:51, Flight 175 changed altitude Over the next three minutes, the controller made five unsuccessful attempts to contact Flight 175 and worked to move other aircraft in the vicinity away from Flight 175 [5] At 08:55, a supervisor at the New York Air Traffic Control Center notified the center's operations manager of the Flight 175 hijacking Now tasked with handling Flight 175, Bottiglia remarked, \"We might have a hijack over here, two of them.\" [5]\n\n\nNear misses\nAround this time, the flight had a near midair collision with Delta Air Lines Flight 2315 flying from Hartford to Tampa, reportedly missing the plane by only 300 feet (90 m) [26] [27] [28] Bottiglia yelled at the Delta pilot to make collision avoidance maneuvers, adding, \"I think  [Flight 175] has been hijacked I don't know his intentions Take any evasive action necessary.\" [26] [27] It is likely that the TCAS system was sounding in the cockpit as Flight 175 briefly stopped descending at 28,000 feet (8,530 m) and climbed 300 feet (90 m) and started descending again as soon as they passed the Delta plane [29] A few moments later, Flight 175 had another near midair collision with TWA Flight 3 flying from JFK to St Louis missing its tail by around 500 feet (150 m) [30] Moments before Flight 175 crashed, it also narrowly avoided colliding with Midwest Express Flight 7, which was flying from Milwaukee to New York [31]\n\n\nCalls\nFlight attendant Robert Fangman and passengers Peter Hanson and Brian David Sweeney made phone calls from GTE airphones in the rear of the aircraft Airphone records also indicate that passenger Garnet Bailey attempted to call his wife four times [32] [33]\n\n\nCrash\nAt 08:58, Flight 175 was over New Jersey at 28,500 feet (8,700 m), by which point al-Shehhi would have seen the smoke pouring from the North Tower in the distance [38] The airplane was in a sustained power dive of more than 24,000 feet (7,300 m) in the 5 minutes and 4 seconds between approximately 08:58 and the moment of impact, at an average rate of over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) per minute [25] Bottiglia later said that he and his colleagues \"were counting down the altitudes, and they were descending, right at the end, at 10,000 feet per minute That is absolutely unheard of for a commercial jet.\" [27]\n\n\nAftermath\nFlight 175's crash into the South Tower was faster and lower down than that of the North Tower, impacting close to a corner rather than midway into the structure, compromising its structural integrity more Thus, there was far more structural weight pressing down on an unbalanced, damaged section of the building on fire [69] The South Tower collapsed at 9:59 A.M., [65]: 80  [70]: 322  after burning for 56 minutes, [g] Flight 175's impact did not directly cause the collapse of the south tower, but rather the fires caused by the aircraft's jet fuel were the reason for the collapse, [71] the South Tower was the first of the two skyscrapers to collapse despite being the second to be hit, and only burning for around half the amount of time as the North Tower did before it fell Nobody who was in the South Tower at the time of its collapse survived [72]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee

The country has a rich history, diverse culture, and a unique geography that sets it apart from other nations. The Philippines is known for its beautiful beaches, lush rainforests, and vibrant cities, making it a popular tourist destination.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe Philippines was named after Prince Philip of Asturias, later King Philip II of Spain, by Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos in 1542. The name \"Las Islas Filipinas\" was used to refer to the Spanish possessions in the archipelago. Other names, such as \"Islas del Poniente\" (Western Islands) and \"Islas del Oriente\" (Eastern Islands), were used by the Spanish to refer to islands in the region before Spanish rule was established.\n\n# History\n\nThe Philippines has a rich and diverse history that spans over 5,000 years. The earliest known human presence in the archipelago dates back to 709,000 years ago, with the discovery of fossil remains in Callao Cave. The country has been inhabited by various cultures, including the Negritos, who are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of the Philippines. The Tabon Man, who lived in the Tabon Caves of Palawan, is one of the oldest known human remains in the Philippines, dating back to 47,000 years ago.\n\n## Prehistory (pre-900)\n\nThe Philippines has a long and complex prehistory, with various cultures emerging and evolving over time. The Negritos, who are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of the Philippines, were hunter-gatherers who lived in the islands for thousands of years. The Austronesian peoples, who arrived in the Philippines around 2000 BCE, brought with them new technologies, languages, and cultural practices. The Austronesians developed a complex society, with a system of governance, trade, and agriculture.\n\n## Early States (900-1565)\n\nThe early states in the Philippines were influenced by the Indianized Hindu Majapahit Empire, which expanded its territories to include the Philippines in the 14th century. The Islamization of the Philippines began in the 13th century, with the arrival of Muslim traders and missionaries. The Sulu Archipelago was an important center of Islam in the Philippines, with the Sultanate of Sulu playing a significant role in the region's history.\n\n## Spanish and American Colonial Rule (1565-1934)\n\nThe Spanish colonization of the Philippines began in 1565, when Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi arrived from New Spain. The Spanish established their rule over the islands, introducing Christianity, the Spanish language, and European customs. The Philippines became a Spanish colony, with Manila serving as the capital. The Spanish colonizers exploited the natural resources of the Philippines, establishing plantations and mines. The Philippines was also a major center of trade, with the Spanish trading with China, Japan, and other Asian countries.\n\n## Commonwealth and World War II (1935-1946)\n\nThe Philippines was granted commonwealth status in 1935, with Manuel Quezon serving as the country's first president. The country's economy was growing, with the development of industries such as textiles and manufacturing. However, the Philippines was also faced with the challenges of poverty, inequality, and social injustice. The country was invaded by Japan during World War II, with the Japanese occupying the islands from 1942 to 1945. The Philippines suffered greatly during the war, with many Filipinos killed or imprisoned.\n\n## Independence (1946-Present)\n\nThe Philippines gained independence from the United States on July 4, 1946. The country's first president was Manuel Roxas, who served from 1946 to 1948. The Philippines has since become a democratic country, with a president serving as the head of state and government. The country has faced various challenges, including poverty, corruption, and social injustice.

According to the Hindu epic Ramayana, Rama was born in Ayodhya [31] Ayodhya is among seven most sacred cities to Hindus [32]\n\n\nSignificance of Rama\nRama is a prominent Hindu deity who is regarded

sacred cities to Hindus [32]\n\n\nPilgrim site\nThree places in Ayodhya are considered as prominent puṇya kṣētra (lit. 'virtued pilgrimage site') by Hindus They are Janmasthāna (lit. 'The birthplace'), Svargadvāra (lit. 'The gateway to Heaven') and Yajñasthala (lit. 'Place where holy sacrifice was performed') Temples commemorating these events used to exist in olden days as Janmasthān temple, Svargadvār temple and Trētā-kā-Thākūr temple respectively However, they were destroyed during Islamic rule in the medieval ages and mosques were built [33] [34] While Marxist historians like Irfan Habib agree about the fate of Svargadvar and Treta-ka-Thakur temples, there is some lack of consensus among scholars whether Janmasthan temple was destroyed or not during Medieval rule which eventually led to Ayodhya dispute that was resolved legally [35] The Trayōdaśakṣarī maṁtra (lit. '13-character mantra') also known as Śrī Rāma Tāraka Mantra (lit. 'The Rama mantra for Salvation') is Śrī Rāma Jaya Rāma Jaya Jaya Rāma and many Hindus believe that chanting it repeatedly lead to salvation [36] [37] Tāraka means something that carries or helps a Jīva (lit. 'a living being') cross the ocean of samsara Devotees of Rama such as Valmiki, Tulsidas, Bhadrachala Ramadasu, Samartha Ramadas, Tyagaraja, Purandara Dasa, Gondavalekar Maharaj and Mahatma Gandhi popularised this mantra [38]\n\n\nDeity\nRam Mandir is being built to commemorate the birth of Rama at his Janmasthan Therefore, the presiding deity of the temple is supposed to be the infant form of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu Rama in that infant form was referred as  Ram Lalla (lit. 'Child Rama') by Tulsidas However, the idol of Rama that was placed in 1949 referred to as Ram Lalla Virajman (lit. 'Installed Child Rama') by local Hindus [39] Ram Lalla was a litigant in the court case over the disputed site in 1989, being considered a \"juristic person\" by the law [3] He was represented by Triloki Nath Pandey, a senior VHP leader who was considered Ram Lalla's closest 'human' friend [39] As a new idol of the deity got installed in the sanctum sanctorum as the Mūlavirāt mūrti (lit The main presiding deity), [f] the Mandir Trust has informed that the Ram Lalla Virajman idol of 1949 shall henceforth be used as Utsava mūrti (lit idol for festivals) [42]\n\n\nHistory\nThe site is the former location of the Babri Masjid, which was built in the 16th century The mosque was attacked and demolished in 1992 [13] [14] [15] In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for the construction of a temple, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque [43]\n\n\nMedieval\nIn 1528, the commander of the Mughal Empire, Mir Baqi, constructed the Babri Masjid mosque, under the order of Babur, on the site of the Ram Janmabhoomi, the mythical birthplace of Rama [44] [page needed] [c] The earliest record of the mosque may be traced back to 1767, in the Latin book Descriptio Indiae, authored by the Jesuit missionary Joseph Tiefenthaler According to him, the local population believed that the mosque was constructed by destroying the Ramkot temple, believed to be the fortress of Rama in Ayodhya, and the Bedi, where the birthplace of Rama is situated [45] [46]\n\n\nModern\nThe first instance of religious violence was documented in 1853 [47] In December 1858, the British administration prohibited Hindus from conducting puja (rituals) at the contested site A platform was created for conducting rituals outside the mosque

at the site involving 150,000 volunteers, known as karsevaks The rally turned violent, the crowd overwhelmed the security forces and tore down the mosque [52] [53]\n\n\nASI excavations\nReports on two archaeological excavations in 1978 and 2003 conducted by the ASI claimed to have found evidence indicating that a temple existed on the site [57] [58] The claims were heavily disputed by critics as contradictory and unreliable [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] Archaeologist K K Muhammed maintained that remains of a Hindu temple were found in 1978, and accused several historians of averting a settlement for the dispute [64]\n\n\nCourt rulings\nOver the years, various title and legal disputes took place, such as the passage of the Acquisition of Certain Areas at Ayodhya Act in 1993 In 2010, the Allahabad High Court ruled that the 1.12 hectares (2.77 acres) of disputed land be divided into three parts, one going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Rama, represented by the Hindu Mahasabha for the construction of the Ram temple, one going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board, and one going to Hindu religious denomination Nirmohi Akhara [8] [65] All  three parties involved appealed against the division of disputed land to the Supreme Court [66] [67]\n\n\nTrust formation and start of construction\nThe trust was eventually formed under the name of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra On 5

chief architect of the temple was Chandrakant Sompura, assisted by his two sons, Nikhil Sompura and Ashish Sompura, who are also architects [76]\n\n\nFundraising\nThe Ram Mandir was built with funds gained through international fundraising drives, involving nearly two million volunteers Ramnath Kovind was the first to contribute, donating ₹500,000 on 14 January 2021, during his tenure as the 14th president of India [93] [94] Over 127 million donations amounting to approximately ₹50 billion were received by the temple [95] [94] [96] [97] Some media outlets in India claimed that the construction of the Ram mandir was one of the worlds biggest crowd funded projects [98] Fundraising by the Mandir trust has ended on 27 February 2021 [99]\n\n\nConstruction\nThe Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust began the first phase of construction of the Ram Mandir in March 2020 [103] [104] The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India caused a temporary suspension of the construction [105] [106] On 25 March 2020, Ram's idol was moved to a temporary location in the presence of the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath [107] In preparation for the temple's construction, the Vishwa Hindu

This was said to ensure \"victory over hurdles\" in constructing the temple [108]\n\n\nBhumi Pujan ceremony\n On the occasion of Bhumi Pujan, the Ram Lalla's dress was stitched by tailors Bhagwat Prasad and Shankar Lal, a fourth generation tailor to Rama's idol [115]\n\n\n2021–present\nThe temple trust decided to launch a nationwide \"mass contact and contribution campaign\" aimed at reaching

station, and township development\", fostering multiple hotel development projects and stimulating various economic activities [171] [172] As Hindu devotees all over the world throng to have a darśana (auspicious viewing) of this deity, the subsequent economic impact has been estimated to further enrich the state by the end of the year 2024 by four trillion Indian rupees (equivalent to 48 billion US dollars) [173]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDuring the 2021 Republic Day parade on Rajpath, Uttar Pradesh's tableau showcased a replica of the Ram Mandir [181] In October 2023, Durga Puja celebrations
