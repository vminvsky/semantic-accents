They are known for their rich cultural heritage, significant historical achievements, and distinct traditions. This article provides an overview of the origins, history, culture, and notable aspects of the Bugis people.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Bugis are a prominent ethnic group in Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 7 million people. They inhabit the southwestern region of the island, particularly in the provinces of South Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, and Southeast Sulawesi. The Bugis have a long and complex history, with evidence of their existence dating back to the pre-Austronesian era. Their distinct culture, language, and traditions have been shaped by their unique geography, cultural interactions, and historical events.\n\n**Origins and Antecedents**\n\n### **Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi**\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of Sulawesi were the Toalean people, who lived in the region before the arrival of Austronesian-speaking peoples. The Toalean culture is characterized by their distinctive stone tools, pottery, and burial sites. Although the Toaleans are no longer a distinct ethnic group, their legacy can be seen in the cultural practices and traditions of the Bugis people.\n\n### **The Arrival of Austronesians**\n\nAround 2000 BCE, Austronesian-speaking peoples migrated to Sulawesi from the islands of the Philippines and the Indonesian archipelago. These newcomers brought with them new farming techniques, tools, and social structures, which gradually replaced the existing Toalean culture. The Austronesians established themselves along the coastlines and established trade networks with neighboring islands.\n\n### **Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis**\n\nTana Ogi, which translates to \"Land of the Bugis,\" is the traditional homeland of the Bugis people. Located on the southwestern coast of Sulawesi, Tana Ogi is a fertile region with abundant resources, making it an ideal place for farming and trade. The Bugis people have a deep connection to this land, which is reflected in their cultural practices, traditions, and history.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Early Society**\n\nThe early Bugis society was characterized by a complex system of kinship, with a strong emphasis on family and community ties. They lived in small villages, relying on subsistence farming, fishing, and trade for their livelihood. The Bugis people developed a distinct social hierarchy, with a strong emphasis on nobility and the aristocracy.\n\n### **The Growth of Bugis Kingdoms**\n\nAs the Bugis people expanded their territory, they established a number of kingdoms, each with its own distinct culture and traditions. The most notable of these kingdoms was the kingdom of Wajo', which emerged as a major power in the 15th century. Other notable kingdoms included the kingdoms of Bone, Soppeng, and Gowa.\n\n### **Emergence of New Political Strengths over the Peninsula**\n\nIn the 16th century, new political strengths emerged over the peninsula, with the kingdoms of Makassar and Mandar gaining prominence. The kingdom of Gowa, in particular, became a major power, with a strong emphasis on trade and maritime activities. The Bugis people developed a distinct maritime culture, with a strong emphasis on sailing, shipbuilding, and trade.\n\n### **Bugis-Makassar Society in the 16th Century**\n\nThe Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century was characterized by a complex system of relationships between the Bugis kingdoms and the Makassar kingdom. The Bugis kingdoms were subject to the rule of the Makassar kingdom, but they maintained a significant degree of autonomy. This period saw the emergence of a distinct Bugis-Makassar culture, with a strong emphasis on trade, maritime activities, and cultural exchange.\n\n### **Early Attempts to Christianize the Bugis States**\n\nIn the 16th century, European missionaries attempted to Christianize the Bugis states, but their efforts were met with resistance. The Bugis people had a strong emphasis on their traditional culture and traditions, and they were skeptical of foreign influences. Despite these efforts, the Bugis people maintained their distinct cultural identity.\n\n### **Quest for Prestige, Influence and Powers over the Peninsula**\n\nIn the 17th century, the Bugis people began to assert their independence and pursue a quest for prestige, influence, and power over the peninsula. They established a number of new kingdoms and expanded their territories, leading to a period of significant cultural and economic growth.\n\n### **The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar**\n\nIn the 17th century, Islam began to spread among the Bugis people, particularly in the kingdoms of Makassar and Mandar. The Islamisation of the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar region had a significant impact on their culture and traditions, leading to a blending of Islamic and traditional practices.\n\n### **The Twilight of Dominance**\n\nIn the 19th century, the Bugis kingdoms began to decline, and their dominance over the peninsula came to an end. The kingdoms were subject to Dutch colonial rule, and their traditional way of life was disrupted. This period marked the twilight of Bugis dominance over the peninsula.\n\n### **A New Golden Age**\n\nIn the 20th century, the Bugis people experienced a new golden age, marked by significant cultural, economic, and social growth. The Bugis people began to assert their national identity and pursue a path of development and progress. This period saw the emergence of a distinct Bugis culture, with a strong emphasis on tradition, heritage, and innovation.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### **Language and Dialects**\n\nThe Bugis language is a member of the Austronesian language family and is spoken by the Bugis people in Sulawesi. The language has a number of distinct dialects, which are spoken in different regions of the island. The Bugis language is known for its unique grammar and vocabulary, which reflect the cultural and historical heritage of the Bugis people.\n\n### **Philosophy**\n\nThe Bugis people have a distinct philosophy, which is reflected in their traditional culture and practices.

The event was scheduled to be held at the Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, but due to logistical issues, it was relocated to the Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. This was the first time SummerSlam was held in Tennessee.\n\n##Storylines\n\nThe event featured a series of matches that were primarily contested for championships and prestige in the WWE universe. The build-up to the event began on the Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown television shows, with a series of matches and storylines being played out over several weeks.\n\nOne of the main storylines heading into the event was the feud between Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. Lesnar had been making claims that he was the \"best in the world,\" which Reigns took exception to. The two men engaged in a series of confrontations on Raw, with Lesnar ultimately challenging Reigns to a match at SummerSlam.\n\nAnother prominent storyline was the rivalry between Seth Rollins and Finn Bálor for the World Heavyweight Championship. Bálor had been on a tear, winning several high-profile matches and earning the respect of his peers. Rollins, who had been struggling to find his footing in the WWE, saw an opportunity to regain his status as a top contender and challenged Bálor to a match at SummerSlam.\n\n#Event\n\n##Preliminary matches\n\nThe event began with a series of preliminary matches that set the tone for the evening. The first match saw Ronda Rousey team up with Shayna Baszler to take on Raquel Rodríguez and Natalya in a tag team match. Rousey and Baszler emerged victorious, with Rousey delivering a vicious armbar to Rodríguez to secure the win.\n\nNext up was a match between Austin Theory and Dominik Mysterio for the United States Championship. Theory was looking to make a statement and prove himself as a top contender, but Mysterio had other plans. Mysterio managed to outmaneuver Theory and secure the win, solidifying his position as a top star in the WWE.\n\n##Main event\n\nThe main event of the evening saw Roman Reigns put his Undisputed WWE Universal Championship on the line against Brock Lesnar. The two men had been building up to this moment for weeks, and the crowd was electric as they made their way to the ring.\n\nThe match was intense from the opening bell, with both men trading blows and showing off their incredible athleticism. Lesnar used his size and strength to try and overpower Reigns, but Reigns was able to use his quickness and agility to evade the attacks.\n\nAs the match wore on, the action spilled outside the ring, with both men using the steel steps and the commentary table to gain an advantage. In the end, it was Reigns who emerged victorious, delivering a devastating spear to Lesnar to secure the win.\n\n#Reception\n\nThe event received widespread critical acclaim from fans and critics alike. Many praised the performances of the wrestlers, particularly Reigns and Lesnar, who delivered a thrilling main event. The crowd was also highly praised, with many commenting on the electric atmosphere and the sheer energy of the audience.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Raw\n\nThe aftermath of the event saw a series of developments on Monday Night Raw. Roman Reigns continued his reign as Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, while Brock Lesnar vowed to return and challenge Reigns for the title.\n\nMeanwhile, Seth Rollins and Finn Bálor continued their rivalry, with Rollins emerging victorious in a match against Bálor. Rollins used the momentum from his win to challenge Bálor for the World Heavyweight Championship, setting up a potential rematch between the two men.\n\n##SmackDown\n\nOn Friday Night SmackDown, the focus was on the tag team division, with Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler emerging victorious in a match against Raquel Rodríguez and Natalya. The win solidified Rousey's position as a top star in the WWE, while Rodríguez and Natalya vowed to regroup and come back stronger.\n\n#Results\n\n* Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler defeated Raquel Rodríguez and Natalya in a tag team match\n* Austin Theory defeated Dominik Mysterio for the United States Championship\n* Roman Reigns defeated Brock Lesnar for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship\n\n#References\n\n#External links\n\nSummerSlam (2023) on WWE.com", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"SummerSlam_(2023)\" following this outline:\n\n#Production\n##Background\n##Storylines\n#Event\n##Preliminary matches\n##Main event\n#Reception\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Shia Islam is a branch of Islam that emerged in the 7th century, and its followers are found in various parts of the world, including the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe Shia branch of Islam originated in the 7th century, following a dispute over the succession of the Prophet Muhammad. The Shia believed that the leadership of the Muslim community should have passed to Ali ibn Abi Talib, the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, while the majority of Muslims recognized Abu Bakr as the first caliph. This disagreement led to the separation of the Shia from the Sunni branch of Islam.\n\n### Early Islamic period\n\nDuring the early Islamic period, Shia Muslims were a minority group in the Islamic world. They were persecuted and discriminated against by the Sunni caliphs, who considered them to be heretics. Despite this, Shia Islam continued to spread and develop, with its own distinct theological and juridical traditions.\n\n### Mamluk period\n\nThe Mamluk period, which lasted from the 13th to the 16th century, saw a significant increase in Shia influence in the Middle East. The Mamluk sultans, who were of Circassian and Turkish origin, adopted Shia Islam and promoted its spread throughout their territories. This led to a significant growth in Shia population in Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon.\n\n### Under Ottoman rule\n\nWhen the Ottoman Empire conquered Syria and Lebanon in the 16th century, Shia Muslims continued to thrive. The Ottomans, who were Sunni Muslims, allowed Shia Muslims to practice their faith freely, and even appointed Shia judges and officials in their administration.\n\n### Relations with Safavid Iran\n\nDuring the Safavid dynasty in Iran, which ruled from the 16th to the 18th century, Shia Islam became the official state religion. The Safavid shahs, who were Shia Muslims themselves, promoted the spread of Shia Islam throughout their territories, including Lebanon and Syria. This led to a significant increase in Shia population in these regions.\n\n### French mandate period\n\nDuring the French mandate period in Lebanon, which lasted from 1920 to 1946, Shia Muslims experienced significant social and economic changes. The French colonial authorities promoted education and economic development, which led to an increase in Shia representation in the Lebanese government and economy.\n\n### Education\n\nEducation played a significant role in the development of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. The French colonial authorities established schools and universities, which were attended by Shia students. This led to an increase in Shia representation in the Lebanese government and economy.\n\n### Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n\nThe Ja'fari shar'ia courts, which were established during the Ottoman period, continued to function during the French mandate period. These courts were responsible for applying Shia law in personal matters, such as marriage and inheritance.\n\n**Sub-groups**\n\n### Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n\nThe Shia Twelvers, also known as Metouali, are a sub-group of Shia Muslims who believe in the imamate of the 12 imams. They are the largest sub-group of Shia Muslims in Lebanon and make up approximately 70% of the Shia population.\n\n### Alawites\n\nThe Alawites, also known as Nusayris, are a sub-group of Shia Muslims who originated in Syria. They are a minority group in Lebanon and make up approximately 10% of the Shia population.\n\n### Isma'ilis\n\nThe Isma'ilis, also known as Sevener Shia, are a sub-group of Shia Muslims who originated in the 8th century. They are a minority group in Lebanon and make up approximately 10% of the Shia population.\n\n**Geographic distribution within Lebanon**\n\nShia Muslims are concentrated in the following regions of Lebanon:\n\n* The Bekaa Valley, which is the largest Shia-majority region in Lebanon.\n* The southern suburbs of Beirut, which include the Dahieh and Borj Hammoud neighborhoods.\n* The city of Sidon, which has a significant Shia population.\n* The city of Tyre, which has a significant Shia population.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAccording to the 2019 estimates, the Shia Muslim population in Lebanon is approximately 1.8 million people, which makes up approximately 35% of the country's population.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nStudies have shown that Shia Muslims in Lebanon have a distinct genetic profile, which is different from that of Sunni Muslims and Christians in the country. The Shia population in Lebanon is thought to have originated from a mixture of Arab and Persian populations.\n\n**Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims**\n\n### Religious figures\n\n* Ayatollah Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, a prominent Shia cleric and theologian who was the spiritual leader of the Lebanese Shia community.\n* Ayatollah Muhammad Mahdi Shamseddine, a prominent Shia cleric and theologian who was a leading figure in the Lebanese Shia community.\n* Grand Ayatollah Husaini, a prominent Shia cleric and theologian who was a leading figure in the Lebanese Shia community.\n\n### Political figures\n\n* Ammar al-Hassan, a Lebanese politician who served as a minister in the Lebanese government.\n* Ali Khalil, a Lebanese politician who served as a minister in the Lebanese government.\n* Saleh Gharib, a Lebanese politician who served as a member of the Lebanese parliament.\n\n### Academics\n\n* Muhammad Jawad Chirri, a Lebanese academic and historian who was a prominent figure in the study of Shia Islam.\n* Ali Khalil, a Lebanese academic and historian who was a prominent figure in the study of Shia Islam.\n* Muhammad Mahdi Shamseddine, a Lebanese academic and historian who was a prominent figure in the study of Shia Islam.\n\n### Artists, singers and journalists\n\n* Fadel Shaker, a Lebanese singer and musician who is known for his hit songs in the Lebanese music scene.\n* Wael Kfoury, a Lebanese singer and musician who is known for his hit songs in the Lebanese music scene.\n* Ali Jaber, a Lebanese journalist and writer who is known for his articles and books on politics and social issues.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Shia Islam\n* Lebanon\n* Islam in Lebanon\n* Shia Muslims in the Middle East\n\n**References**\n\n* \n\n**External links**\n\n* Shia Islamic Center in Lebanon\n* Lebanese Shia Muslims official website\n* Shia Muslims in Lebanon on Facebook", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lebanese_Shia_Muslims\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Origins\n##Early Islamic period\n##Mamluk period\n##Under Ottoman rule\n###Relations with Safavid Iran\n##French mandate period\n###Education\n###Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n#Sub-groups\n##Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n##Alawites\n##Isma'ilis\n#Geographic distribution within Lebanon\n#Demographics\n#Genetics\n#Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n##Religious figures\n##Political figures\n##Academics\n##Artists, singers and journalists\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm was the 14th named storm and the 7th hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season. Nicole made landfall in Florida as a hurricane, causing widespread damage and power outages across the state.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Nicole formed on November 7, 2022, from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa two days earlier. Initially, the system was a tropical depression, but it quickly strengthened into a tropical storm as it moved westward across the tropical Atlantic. The storm's name, Nicole, was chosen from the list of names provided by the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAs Nicole moved westward, it encountered favorable conditions for intensification, including warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. The storm rapidly intensified, becoming a hurricane on November 9, 2022. At its peak, Nicole reached maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 953 mbar (28.14 inHg).\n\n## Track and intensity\n\nNicole's track was influenced by the subtropical high-pressure belt, which steered the storm westward across the Atlantic. The storm's intensity fluctuated throughout its life cycle, with periods of rapid intensification and weakening. Nicole's closest approach to land was to the north of the Bahamas, where it caused significant damage and flooding.\n\n## Classification and naming\n\nNicole was classified as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The storm's maximum sustained winds and central pressure classified it as a hurricane, and its wind speed and forward speed classified it as a Category 3.\n\n## Other notable features\n\nNicole's storm surge caused significant coastal flooding in the Bahamas and the southeastern United States. The storm's rainfall totals were also significant, with reports of over 10 inches (254 mm) in some areas.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Bahamas\n\nThe Bahamas was placed under a hurricane warning on November 8, 2022, as Nicole approached the island chain. The government of the Bahamas issued a state of emergency, and residents were advised to evacuate to higher ground. The storm's impact was exacerbated by the country's vulnerable infrastructure, which was still recovering from the damage caused by Hurricane Dorian in 2019.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was also placed under a hurricane warning as Nicole approached the southeastern coast. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a hurricane watch for the Florida Keys, and a tropical storm warning for the rest of the state. Residents were advised to stock up on supplies, including food, water, and batteries, and to have a plan in place in case of an evacuation.\n\n### Florida\n\nFlorida was the most affected state by Nicole, with the storm making landfall in the northern part of the state on November 9, 2022. The storm's impact was widespread, with reports of power outages, flooding, and property damage. The city of Jacksonville was particularly hard hit, with over 100,000 residents losing power.\n\n### Neighboring states\n\nNeighboring states, including Georgia and Alabama, also experienced the effects of Nicole, although to a lesser extent. Residents in these states were advised to be prepared for the storm's impact, including flooding and power outages.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Lesser Antilles\n\nThe Lesser Antilles was affected by the outer rain bands of Nicole, although the storm's impact was relatively minor compared to other areas. Residents in the island chain reported rainfall totals of up to 4 inches (102 mm), although no significant damage or flooding was reported.\n\n## Greater Antilles\n\nThe Greater Antilles, which includes Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, experienced a significant impact from Nicole's outer rain bands. Residents in these islands reported heavy rainfall and strong winds, although the storm's impact was relatively minor compared to other areas.\n\n## Bahamas\n\nThe Bahamas was severely affected by Nicole, with the storm making landfall on the island of Great Abaco. The storm's impact was exacerbated by the country's vulnerable infrastructure, which was still recovering from the damage caused by Hurricane Dorian in 2019. Residents reported significant damage to homes and businesses, as well as widespread power outages and flooding.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was severely affected by Nicole, with the storm making landfall in Florida on November 9, 2022. The storm's impact was widespread, with reports of power outages, flooding, and property damage. The city of Jacksonville was particularly hard hit, with over 100,000 residents losing power.\n\n### Florida\n\nFlorida was the most affected state by Nicole, with the storm making landfall in the northern part of the state on November 9, 2022. The storm's impact was widespread, with reports of power outages, flooding, and property damage. The city of Jacksonville was particularly hard hit, with over 100,000 residents losing power.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nElsewhere in the United States, residents in neighboring states, including Georgia and Alabama, experienced the effects of Nicole, although to a lesser extent. Residents in these states were advised to be prepared for the storm's impact, including flooding and power outages.\n\n## Canada\n\nThe Canadian province of Nova Scotia was also affected by the outer rain bands of Nicole, although the storm's impact was relatively minor compared to other areas. Residents in the province reported rainfall totals of up to 2 inches (51 mm), although no significant damage or flooding was reported.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Nicole was significant, with widespread damage and power outages reported across the affected areas. Residents were left to deal with the aftermath of the storm, including cleaning up debris and repairing damaged homes and businesses.\n\nThe storm's impact was also felt in the economic sector, with estimates suggesting that the storm caused over $1 billion in damages. The storm's impact on the environment was also significant, with reports of widespread flooding and storm surge affecting coastal ecosystems.\n\n# See also\n\nHurricane Nicole (2022) was part of a larger cluster of storms that affected the Caribbean and the southeastern United States in November 2022. Other notable storms that affected the region during this time included Hurricane Ian and Tropical Storm Nicole.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n# External links\n\nThis article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Nicole_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Neighboring states\n#Impact\n##Lesser Antilles\n##Greater Antilles\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Elsewhere\n##Canada\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, I can provide a fictional article about a hypothetical Scottish National Party leadership election in 2023. \n\nHere is a complete Wikipedia-style article in English:\n\n**2023 Scottish National Party leadership election**\n\nThe 2023 Scottish National Party (SNP) leadership election was a contest for the leadership of the Scottish National Party, a centre-left Scottish nationalist party. The election took place in 2023 after the resignation of the incumbent leader, Nicola Sturgeon, who had led the party since 2014.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP) was founded in 1934 and has been the dominant force in Scottish politics since the 1990s. The party has been led by Nicola Sturgeon since 2014, during which time it has achieved significant electoral successes, including winning a majority of seats in the Scottish Parliament and securing a second independence referendum.\n\nHowever, Sturgeon announced her resignation as leader in March 2023, citing a desire to focus on her personal life and pass on the leadership to a new generation of SNP politicians. The party began the process of electing a new leader, with nominations opening in April 2023.\n\n**Issues**\n\nThe SNP leadership election was fought on a range of issues, including:\n\n### Economics\n\nThe SNP has traditionally campaigned on a platform of reducing poverty and inequality in Scotland. Candidates in the leadership election pledged to continue this work, with a focus on increasing investment in public services, such as healthcare and education. Kate Forbes, a candidate in the election, proposed a range of economic policies, including increasing taxes on the wealthy and introducing a wealth tax.\n\n### Independence\n\nThe SNP's core policy is Scottish independence, and candidates in the leadership election were keen to stress their commitment to this goal.

Regan proposed a range of measures to advance the case for independence, including increasing engagement with the Scottish public and building a stronger international coalition in support of Scotland's independence.\n\n### Humza Yousaf\n\nHumza Yousaf, the Health Secretary in the Scottish Government, announced his candidacy on 24 April 2023. Yousaf proposed a range of measures to advance the rights of trans people in Scotland, including introducing a self-declaration system for gender recognition.\n\n### Hustings\n\nThe hustings were a series of public events where candidates outlined their policies and visions for the party. The hustings were broadcast on the BBC and other media outlets, and were attended by thousands of SNP members.\n\n### Row about membership numbers\n\nDuring the campaign, there was a row over the number of SNP members who were eligible to vote in the leadership election. The party's membership is currently estimated to be around 100,000, but some candidates questioned the accuracy of this figure. The row was eventually resolved after the party clarified its rules on membership eligibility.\n\n**Election process**\n\nThe SNP leadership election is run by the party's national executive committee (NEC). The NEC is responsible for ensuring that the election is fair and proportional, and for resolving any disputes that may arise during the campaign.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nThe following candidates have declared their candidacy in the SNP leadership election:\n\n* Kate Forbes\n* Ash Regan\n* Humza Yousaf\n\n### Declared\n\nThese candidates have officially declared their candidacy and are standing in the election.\n\n### Declined\n\nThe following candidates have declined to stand in the election:\n\n* Nicola Sturgeon (incumbent leader)\n* Angus Robertson (former leader)\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nThe following candidates have received endorsements from other SNP politicians:\n\n* Kate Forbes: supported by Angus Macpherson, a regional MSP.\n* Ash Regan: supported by Mairi Gougeon, a Cabinet Secretary.\n* Humza Yousaf: supported by Richard Lochhead, a regional MSP.\n\n### Declined to endorse\n\nThe following candidates have declined to endorse any of the candidates:\n\n* Nicola Sturgeon (incumbent leader)\n* Angus Robertson (former leader)\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe debates were a series of public events where candidates outlined their policies and visions for the party.

The film explores the life of Elvis Presley, from his early days as a young musician to his rise to fame and his subsequent struggles with fame, family, and personal demons.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the life of Elvis Presley (Austin Butler), a young musician from Tupelo, Mississippi, who moves to Memphis to pursue a career in music. With the help of his manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks), Elvis becomes a sensation in the music industry, but his success comes at a cost. He struggles with his family, particularly his mother, Gladys (Kelly J. Baker), and his wife, Priscilla (Olivia DeJonge). As Elvis's fame grows, so does his dependency on prescription medication and his desire to escape the pressures of fame.\n\nMeanwhile, Elvis becomes embroiled in the tumultuous world of 1950s rock 'n' roll, befriending other musicians such as Johnny Cash (Luke Treadaway) and Carl Perkins (Darrell Britt-Gibson). However, his relationship with Colonel Parker becomes increasingly strained as Elvis becomes more and more reclusive.\n\nThe film also explores Elvis's romantic relationships, including his marriage to Priscilla and his affairs with other women.

This article provides an overview of the key aspects of testate succession in South Africa, including the freedom of testation, testamentary capacity, formalities for executing a will, condonation, invalid wills, alteration or variation, incorporation by reference, and more.\n\n**Freedom of Testation**\n\nThe freedom of testation is a fundamental principle in South African law, which allows testators to dispose of their property as they see fit. However, this freedom is not absolute and is subject to certain limitations.\n\n### Limitations\n\n#### Illegal dispositions and those against public policy\n\nTestators cannot make dispositions that are illegal or go against public policy. For example, a testator cannot leave their property to a person who is not a citizen of South Africa or who is under a certain age.\n\n#### Subdivision of agricultural land\n\nThe subdivision of agricultural land is subject to certain restrictions. A testator cannot divide their agricultural land into smaller plots without the permission of the Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform, and Rural Development.\n\n#### Subdivision of mineral rights\n\nThe subdivision of mineral rights is also subject to certain restrictions. A testator cannot divide their mineral rights without the permission of the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy.\n\n#### Fideicommissum multiplex\n\nA fideicommissum multiplex is a type of disposition that is subject to certain restrictions. It is a disposition that is made in favor of a person who is under a certain age or who is not a citizen of South Africa.\n\n#### Maintenance of surviving spouse\n\nA testator has a duty to maintain their surviving spouse. This means that the testator cannot leave their property to someone else without making provision for their spouse's maintenance.\n\n#### Maintenance and education of minor children\n\nA testator has a duty to maintain and educate their minor children. This means that the testator cannot leave their property to someone else without making provision for their children's maintenance and education.\n\n#### Pension funds\n\nPension funds are subject to certain restrictions. A testator cannot leave their pension funds to someone else without the permission of the pension fund administrator.\n\n### Delegation\n\nA testator can delegate the administration of their estate to a person of their choice. This person is known as the executor.\n\n### Customary law\n\nCustomary law plays an important role in South African law, particularly in the context of testate succession. The rules of customary law apply to the property of the testator and the distribution of the estate.\n\n**Testamentary Capacity**\n\nTestamentary capacity refers to the mental ability of the testator to make a valid will. This means that the testator must have the capacity to understand the nature and extent of their property, the consequences of their dispositions, and the effect of the will on the distribution of their estate.\n\n### Mental ability of the testator\n\nThe testator must have the mental ability to understand the nature and extent of their property. This means that the testator must be able to understand the value and nature of their assets and liabilities.\n\n### Undue influence on the testator\n\nThe testator must not be subject to undue influence. This means that the testator must not be coerced or persuaded into making a disposition that is not in their best interests.\n\n**Capacity to Witness a Will**\n\nA person who is not under a certain age or who is not a citizen of South Africa cannot witness a will. In addition, a person who is mentally incapacitated or who has a conflict of interest cannot witness a will.\n\n**Formalities for Execution of a Will**\n\nThe formalities for executing a will are set out in the Wills Act.

If the testator is unable to sign the will, the will can be signed by a medical practitioner or a notary public.\n\n### Certificate\n\nA certificate must be attached to the will. The certificate must be signed by the testator and two witnesses.\n\n### Witnesses\n\nTwo witnesses must sign the will. The witnesses must be present when the testator signs the will.\n\n**Condonation**\n\nCondonation is a process that allows a person who has been excluded from a will to apply to the court for a share of the estate. The court will consider the following factors when deciding whether to grant condonation:\n\n*   The relationship between the excluded person and the testator.\n*   The reason for the exclusion.\n*   The effect of the exclusion on the excluded person.\n\n**Invalid Wills**\n\nAn invalid will is a will that does not meet the formalities for executing a will. An invalid will can be challenged in court.\n\n### Revocation\n\nA will can be revoked in the following ways:\n\n*   A later will or codicil can revoke an earlier will.\n*   Physical or symbolic destruction of the will can revoke the will.\n*   Ademption can revoke the will.\n*   Other means of revocation can revoke the will.\n\n### Right of Revocation\n\nA testator has the right to revoke their will at any time.

For example, a will that is made in contemplation of marriage cannot be revoked if the marriage does not take place.\n\n### Revival of a Revoked Will\n\nA revoked will can be revived in the following ways:\n\n*   A later will or codicil can revive an earlier will.\n*   Physical or symbolic destruction of the will can revive the will.\n*   Ademption can revive the will.\n*   Other means of revocation can revive the will.\n\n**Alteration or Variation**\n\nAn alteration or variation to a will can be made in the following ways:\n\n*   An amendment by the testator can be made to the will.\n*   A rectification by the court can be made to the will.\n*   An alteration or variation by the court can be made to the will.\n\n### Amendment by Testator\n\nA testator can amend their will at any time. This means that the testator can change their mind and make a new will.\n\n### Rectification by Court\n\nA court can rectify a will if the testator did not have the capacity to make the will or if the will is ambiguous.\n\n### Alteration or Variation by the Court\n\nA court can alter or vary a will if the testator did not have the capacity to make the will or if the will is ambiguous.\n\n**Incorporation by Reference**\n\nA will can incorporate by reference another document or instrument. This means that the will can refer to another document or instrument that sets out the testator's wishes.\n\n**Obsolete and Provincial Wills**\n\nObsolete and provincial wills are wills that are no longer valid. A will can be declared obsolete if it is no longer valid or if it is no longer in effect.\n\n**Joint or Mutual Wills**\n\nJoint or mutual wills are wills that are made by two or more people. A joint or mutual will can be made by two or more people who are married or who are in a civil union.\n\n**Probate of Wills**\n\nProbate of a will is the process of proving the validity of a will in court. Probate is required before the estate can be distributed.\n\n### Lost Wills\n\nA lost will can be probated if the testator can prove that the will existed and if the will can be found.\n\n**Content of Wills**\n\nThe content of a will is the specific wishes and instructions of the testator. The content of a will can include the following:\n\n*   Inheritance and legacy: The testator can leave their property to specific individuals or organizations.\n*   Prior and legal rights: The testator can make provision for the prior and legal rights of certain individuals or organizations.\n*   Vested, conditional, and future interests: The testator can make provision for vested, conditional, and future interests in their property.\n*   Testamentary devices: The testator can use testamentary devices such as usufruct, substitution, and fideicommissum to distribute their property.\n\n### Inheritance and Legacy\n\nInheritance and legacy refer to the transfer of property from one person to another. The testator can leave their property to specific individuals or organizations.\n\n### Prior and Legal Rights\n\nPrior and legal rights refer to the rights of certain individuals or organizations that must be respected when distributing the estate. The testator can make provision for prior and legal rights.\n\n### Vested, Conditional, and Future Interests\n\nVested, conditional, and future interests refer to the rights of certain individuals or organizations to receive property in the future. The testator can make provision for vested, conditional, and future interests.\n\n### Vested Interests\n\nVested interests refer to the rights of certain individuals or organizations to receive property immediately. The testator can make provision for vested interests.\n\n### Conditional Interests\n\nConditional interests refer to the rights of certain individuals or organizations to receive property in the future if certain conditions are met. The testator can make provision for conditional interests.\n\n### Future Interests\n\nFuture interests refer to the rights of certain individuals or organizations to receive property in the future. The testator can make provision for future interests.\n\n### Valid and Invalid Conditions\n\nConditions can be valid or invalid. Valid conditions must be met for the interest to be transferred. Invalid conditions cannot be met for the interest to be transferred.\n\n### Nudum Praeceptum\n\nNudum praeceptum is a Latin phrase that means \"naked command.\" It refers to a condition that is not capable of being met. The testator cannot make a condition that is not capable of being met.\n\n### Estate Massing\n\nEstate massing refers to the process of consolidating the estate into a single entity. The testator can use estate massing to distribute their property.\n\n### Customary Law\n\nCustomary law plays an important role in the distribution of the estate. The rules of customary law apply to the property of the testator.\n\n### Testamentary Devices\n\nTestamentary devices are legal tools that can be used to distribute the estate. The testator can use testamentary devices such as usufruct, substitution, and fideicommissum to distribute their property.\n\n### Usufruct\n\nUsufruct is a legal tool that allows the grantee to use the property but not to sell it. The testator can use usufruct to distribute their property.\n\n### Substitution\n\nSubstitution is a legal tool that allows the grantee to substitute another person as the beneficiary of the property. The testator can use substitution to distribute their property.\n\n### Direct Substitution\n\nDirect substitution is a type of substitution where the grantee is substituted as the beneficiary of the property. The testator can use direct substitution to distribute their property.\n\n### Fideicommissary Substitution\n\nFideicommissary substitution is a type of substitution where the grantee is substituted as the beneficiary of the property, but the property is still held by the testator. The testator can use fideicommissary substitution to distribute their property.\n\n### Difference between Usufruct and Fideicommissum\n\nUsufruct and fideicommissum are both legal tools that can be used to distribute the estate. However, usufruct allows the grantee to use the property but not to sell it, while fideicommissum allows the grantee to receive the property at a future date.\n\n### Fideicommissum Residui\n\nFideicommissum residui is a type of fideicommissum where the grantee receives the property at a future date, but only if the testator dies before the grantee.\n\n### Fideicommissum Pures\n\nFideicommissum pures is a type of fideicommissum where the grantee receives the property at a future date, regardless of whether the testator dies before the grantee.\n\n### Trust\n\nTrust is a legal tool that allows the grantor to transfer property to a trustee, who holds the property for the benefit of the beneficiary. The testator can use trust to distribute their property.\n\n### Bequests Subject to a Modus\n\nBequests subject to a modus are bequests that are made to a grantee, but the grantee must perform a certain task or condition before receiving the property. The testator can make bequests subject to a modus.\n\n### Interpretation of Some Common Dispositions in Wills\n\nThe interpretation of some common dispositions in wills can be complex. The court will consider the following factors when interpreting a disposition:\n\n*   The language used in the will.\n*   The context in which the disposition was made.\n*   The intentions of the testator.\n\n### Presumption Against Fideicommissa\n\nThere is a presumption against fideicommissa, which means that the court will not interpret a disposition as a fideicommissum unless it is clear that it is intended to be a fideicommissum.\n\n### Si Sine Liberis Decesserit Clause\n\nSi sine liberis decesserit clause is a Latin phrase that means \"if there are no children.\" It is a type of condition that is often used in wills to determine who will inherit the property.\n\n### Implied Fideicommissa\n\nImplied fideicommissa are fideicommissa that are not explicitly stated in the will, but can be inferred from the language used. The court will consider the following factors when determining whether an implied fideicommissum exists:\n\n*   The language used in the will.\n*   The context in which the disposition was made.\n*   The intentions of the testator.\n\n### Fideicommissum Subject to a Si Sine Liberis Condition\n\nFideicommissum subject to a si sine liberis condition is a type of fideicommissum where the grantee receives the property at a future date, but only if there are no children.\n\n### Prohibitions Against Alienation\n\nProhibitions against alienation are restrictions that prevent the grantee from selling or transferring the property to someone else.

(Meta), the same company behind Instagram and Facebook. The platform was announced in July 2023 and launched in July 2023.\n\n## History\n\n### Predecessor\n\nBefore the development of Threads, Meta had been experimenting with various social media platforms, including Lasso and Collab. However, these platforms failed to gain significant traction. The company's focus shifted towards creating a more intimate and community-driven platform, which eventually led to the development of Threads.\n\n### Development and announcement\n\nThreads was in development for several months before its announcement. The company reportedly worked on the platform's design, features, and user interface to create a seamless and engaging experience. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced the platform in July 2023, stating that Threads aims to provide a space for users to engage in real-time discussions and connect with others who share similar interests.\n\n### Launch\n\nThreads launched in July 2023, with a significant marketing campaign to promote the platform. The launch was accompanied by a series of promotional videos and advertisements on Instagram and Facebook, highlighting the platform's features and benefits.\n\n## Appearance and features\n\n### Possibility of open interoperability\n\nThreads is designed to be an open platform, allowing users to connect with others across different social media platforms. This interoperability enables users to share content and engage in discussions across multiple platforms, creating a more cohesive online experience.\n\n### Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads allows users to integrate their Instagram accounts, making it easy to connect with friends and followers on both platforms. This integration also enables users to share content from Instagram on Threads, further enhancing the platform's social features.\n\n### Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on both desktop and mobile devices, allowing users to access the platform from anywhere. The platform's mobile app is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to navigate and engage with content.\n\n### Censorship attempts\n\nDespite its openness, Threads has faced censorship attempts from various governments and organizations. In some countries, the platform has been blocked or restricted, citing concerns over content moderation and user safety.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThreads generates revenue through advertising, with the platform displaying ads to users based on their interests and engagement patterns. However, the platform has faced criticism for its advertising policies, with some users expressing concerns over the prevalence of ads and their impact on the user experience.\n\n## Userbase\n\n### Decline in the months after launch\n\nIn the months following its launch, Threads experienced a decline in user engagement and growth. This decline was attributed to various factors, including the platform's initial slow pace and the lack of compelling content. However, the platform has continued to evolve and improve, with efforts to enhance its features and user experience.\n\n### Popularity in Taiwan\n\nDespite its decline, Threads has maintained a strong presence in Taiwan, where it has become a popular platform for social media users. The platform's popularity in Taiwan can be attributed to its ease of use and the vibrant online community that has formed around it.\n\n## Responses\n\n### Intellectual property dispute\n\nThreads has faced an intellectual property dispute over the use of its name and logo.

The film is based on the 1987 film Predator, with a 20th-century setting and a Comanche tribe protagonist. The movie is a spin-off and the fifth installment in the Predator franchise.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in 1719, during the Comanche tribe's reign over the Great Plains. Naru, a young Comanche hunter, is tasked with proving herself as a warrior to her tribe. While on a hunt, she encounters a technologically advanced alien, known as a Yautja, who arrives on Earth to hunt human prey. The Yautja is attracted to the tribe's hunting skills and sees them as worthy opponents.\n\nAs Naru and the Yautja engage in a series of battles, she discovers that the alien's technology is unlike anything she has ever seen.
