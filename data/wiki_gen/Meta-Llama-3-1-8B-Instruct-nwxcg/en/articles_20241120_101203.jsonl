It is one of the most important days in the liturgical year, and its celebration varies across different Christian traditions.\n\n## Biblical Basis and Symbolism\n\nIn the accounts of the four canonical Gospels, Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem takes place a week before his resurrection. Only the Gospel of John shows a timeline of the event, dated six days before the Passover. According to the Gospels, Jesus rode a donkey into Jerusalem, where he was welcomed by the crowd with palm branches, which symbolized victory and peace.\n\n## Observance in the Liturgy\n\nPalm Sunday is one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the liturgical year. The day before Palm Sunday, Lazarus Saturday, believers often prepare palm fronds by knotting them into crosses in preparation for the procession on Sunday. The hangings and vestments in the church are changed to a festive color, most commonly green. In the Orthodox Church, Palm Sunday is also known as the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem, and it is a day of great festivity and celebration.\n\n## Eastern and Oriental Christianity\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, Palm Sunday is one of the most important days of the liturgical year. The day before Palm Sunday, Lazarus Saturday, is a day of preparation for the procession on Sunday. The Orthodox faithful prepare palm fronds by knotting them into crosses and decorating them with flowers. The procession on Sunday is a grand event, where the faithful carry the decorated palm fronds and sing hymns and chants.\n\n## Western Christianity\n\nIn ancient times, palm branches symbolized goodness and victory. They were often depicted on coins and important buildings. Solomon had palm branches carved into the walls and doors of the temple. At the end of the Bible, people from every nation raise palm branches to honor Jesus. In Western Christianity, Palm Sunday is a day of great celebration, and it is often marked by processions and the distribution of palm fronds.\n\n## Customs\n\nIt is customary in many churches for worshippers to receive fresh palm leaves on Palm Sunday. In parts of the world where this has historically been impractical, substitute traditions have arisen. In some places, palm leaves are replaced by other branches, such as yew or silver fir. In other places, people make their own palm fronds by tying together palm leaves or other branches.\n\n## Belgium\n\nIn Hoegaarden, one of the last remaining Palm Sunday processions takes place every year. A fellowship of Twelve Apostles carries a wooden statue of Christ around the town, while children go door to door offering the palms (box) for coins.\n\n## Bulgaria\n\nIn Bulgaria, Palm Sunday is known as Tsvetnitsa (tsvete, \"flower\") or Vrabnitsa (varba, \"willow\"), or Flower's Day. People with flower-related names celebrate this day as their name day.\n\n## England\n\nIn the 15th through the 17th centuries in England, Palm Sunday was frequently marked by the burning of Jack o' Lent figures. This was a straw effigy which would be stoned and abused on Ash Wednesday, and kept in the parish for burning on Palm Sunday. The symbolism was believed to be a kind of revenge on Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed Christ.\n\n## Egypt and Ethiopia\n\nIn the Coptic Orthodox Church and Orthodox Ethiopia, this holiday is referred to as Hosanna. Palm leaves will be blessed and distributed, they are used to create crucifixes, rings and other ornaments.\n\n## Finland\n\nIn Finland, it is popular for children to dress up as Easter witches and go door to door in neighborhoods and trade decorated pussy willow branches for coins and candy.

Also, there will be carefully woven crosses and other symbols made from palm fronds and roses and a procession at the beginning of the liturgy, during which at some point, the priest will take an olive branch and splash holy water on the faithful.\n\n## Malta\n\nAll the parishes of Malta and Gozo on Palm Sunday (Maltese: Ħadd il-Palm) bless the palm leaves and the olive leaves. Those parishes that have the statues of Good Friday bless the olive tree they put on the statues of \"Jesus prays in the Olive Garden\" (Ġesù fl-Ort) and the \"Betrayal of Judas\" (il-Bewsa ta' Ġuda). Also, many people take a small olive branch to their homes because it is a sacramental.\n\n## Netherlands\n\nIn the Saxon regions of the Netherlands, crosses are decorated with candy and bread, made in the form of a rooster. In the Diocese of Groningen-Leeuwarden, a great procession with oil lamps is held the night before Palm Sunday in honour of the Sorrowful Mother of Warfhuizen.\n\n## Philippines\n\nIn the Philippines, a statue of Christ riding a donkey (the Humenta), or the presiding priest on horseback, is brought to the local church in a morning procession.

Margarita, Nevena, Ralitsa, Rosa, Temenuzhka, Tsvetan(a), Tsvetelin(a), Tsvetin(a), Tsvetko, Violeta, Yavor, Zdravko, Zjumbjul, etc.) celebrate this day as their name day [41]\n\n\nEngland\nIn the 15th through the 17th centuries in England, Palm Sunday was frequently marked by the burning of Jack o' Lent figures This was a straw effigy which would be stoned and abused on Ash Wednesday, and kept in the parish for burning on Palm Sunday The symbolism was believed to be a kind of revenge on Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed Christ The effigy could also have represented the hated figure of Winter, whose destruction prepares the way for Spring [42]\n\n\nEgypt and Ethiopia\nIn the Coptic Orthodox Church and Orthodox Ethiopia, this holiday is referred to as Hosanna Palm leaves will be blessed and distributed, they are used to create crucifixes, rings and other ornaments.\n\n\nFinland\nIn Finland, it is popular for children to dress up as Easter witches and go door to door in neighborhoods and trade decorated pussy willow branches for coins and candy This is an old Karelian custom called virpominen.\n\n\nGermany\nIn some regions of Germany, long stakes with pussy willow, box and other twigs are taken for the Palm procession rather than nosegays In some Southern regions either the priest leads the palm procession, riding on a donkey, or a wooden donkey (called Palmesel) with a figure of Christ is traditionally trundled with the procession of the faithful.\n\n\nIndia\nIn most of the Catholic churches in India the palms are blessed by the priest on Palm Sunday and then distributed among the people after the holy mass There is a tradition of folding palm fronds into palm crosses, which are kept at the altar till the next Ash Wednesday.\n\n\nIreland\nIn Ireland's cold climate, real palm leaves are generally not available, so yew, silver fir, spruce or cypress are used instead; it is known in Irish as Domhnach an Iúir, \"Yew Sunday.\" [46] [47] The historian Patrick Weston Joyce noted that yew was always called \"palm\" in his 1830s childhood, and he only later learned the tree's correct name \"Palm\" branches were often worn in the buttonhole or hung on the wall; the second practise is still common, and palm branches are blessed with holy water at Catholic Masses [48]\n\n\nItaly\nIn Italy, palm leaves are used along with small olive branches, readily available in the Mediterranean climate These are placed at house entrances (for instance, hanging above the door) to last until the following year's Palm Sunday For this reason, usually palm leaves are not used whole, due to their size; instead, leaf strips are braided into smaller shapes Small olive branches are also often used to decorate traditional Easter cakes, along with other symbols of birth, like eggs [citation needed]\n\n\nLatvia\nIn Latvia, Palm Sunday is called \"Pussy Willow Sunday\", and pussy willows – symbolizing new life – are blessed and distributed to the faithful [50] Children are often awakened that morning with ritualistic swats of a willow branch [51]\n\n\nLithuania\nWhen Christianity came to Lithuania, the plants which sprouted earliest were honored during spring feasts The name \"Palm Sunday\" is a misnomer; the \"verba\" or \"dwarfed spruce\" is used instead According to tradition, on the Saturday before Palm Sunday the Lithuanians take special care in choosing and cutting well-formed branches, which the women-folk decorate with flowers The flowers are meticulously tied onto the branches, making the \"Verba\" [citation needed]\n\n\nThe Levant\nIn Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria, Palm Sunday (Shaa'nineh in Arabic) Is perhaps the best-attended liturgy in the Christian Calendar, among the Orthodox, Catholic (Latin and Eastern), and Anglican Churches, perhaps because it is notably a family occasion [52] On this day, children attend church with branches from olive and palm trees Also, there will be carefully woven crosses and other symbols made from palm fronds and roses and a procession at the beginning of the liturgy, during which at some point, the priest will take an olive branch and splash holy water on the faithful [citation needed]\n\n\nMalta\nAll the parishes of Malta and Gozo on Palm Sunday (Maltese: Ħadd il-Palm) bless the palm leaves and the olive leaves Those parishes that have the statues of Good Friday bless the olive tree they put on the statues of \"Jesus prays in the Olive Garden\" (Ġesù fl-Ort) and the \"Betrayal of Judas\" (il-Bewsa ta' Ġuda) Also, many people take a small olive branch to their homes because it is a sacramental [citation needed]\n\n\nNetherlands\nIn the Saxon regions of the Netherlands, crosses are decorated with candy and bread, made in the form of a rooster In the Diocese of Groningen-Leeuwarden, a great procession with oil lamps is held the night before Palm Sunday in honour of the Sorrowful Mother of Warfhuizen.\n\n\nPhilippines\nIn the Philippines, a statue of Christ riding a donkey (the Humenta), or the presiding priest on horseback, is brought to the local church in a morning procession Congregants line the route, waving palaspás (ornately woven palm branches) and spreading tapis (heirloom \"aprons\" made for this ritual) in imitation of the excited Jerusalemites At the church parvise, a house, or the town plaza, children dressed as angels scatter flowers as they sing the day's antiphon Hosanna Filio David in the vernacular and to traditional tunes The first Mass of the day then follows.\n\n\nPoland\nMany Polish towns and villages (the best known are Lipnica Murowana in Lesser Poland and Łyse in Mazovia) organize artificial palm competitions The biggest of those reach above 30 meters (98 ft) in length; for example, the highest palm in 2008 was 33.39 meters (109.5 ft) [54]\n\n\nRomania and Moldova\nIn Romania and Moldova, Palm Sunday is known as Duminica Floriilor or simply Florii, translating Flowers' Sunday [55] [56] This name has its roots in a pre-Christian fertility festival, where flowers played a prominent role [57]\n\n\nSpain\nIn Spain, there is a tradition at the Palmeral of Elche (Europe's largest palm grove) in which local people cover palm leaves from the sun to allow them to whiten, and then they tie and braid them into intricate shapes.\n [58]\n\n\nSyria\nIn Syria, it is popular for children to dress up as Easter witches and go door to door in neighborhoods for coins and candy [60]\n\n\nWales\nIn southern Wales and nearby portions of England, 'Sul y Blodau' or 'Flowering Sunday' is a grave decoration tradition commonly observed on Palm Sunday, although historically Flowering Sunday grave decoration was also observed on other days as well Today, the names Palm Sunday and Flowering Sunday are used interchangeably in those regions In 1829, Thomas Wallace of Llanbadoc, Monmouthshire published a poem which contains the first known reference to the custom being practiced only on Palm Sunday.\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) =

Born on October 21, 1992, in a Mangalorean family, Shetty comes from a traditional Tuluva community of the Bunt caste.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nSrinidhi Ramesh Shetty was born on October 21, 1992, in a Mangalorean family of Tuluvas belonging to the Bunt caste. Her father, Ramesh Shetty, is from the town of Mulki, while her mother, Kushala, is from Thalipady Guthu, Kinnigoli. Shetty's early life was spent in the coastal town of Mangalore, where she developed a strong connection with her roots and culture. She pursued her education in the same city, completing her primary and secondary schooling from local institutions.\n\n**Pageantry**\n\nShetty's journey into the world of pageantry began in 2012, when she competed in the Clean & Clear sponsored Fresh Face contest. She emerged as one of the top two finalists in the competition, which marked the beginning of her pursuit of a career in modeling and acting. In 2015, Shetty participated in the Manappuram Miss South India pageant and won the titles of Miss Karnataka and Miss Beautiful Smile. She also participated in the Manappuram Miss Queen of India pageant, where she was crowned as the 1st runner-up and named Miss Congeniality.

I was never aware of any complaints of harassment or ill behaviour during the course of the project.\" [18] When asked about the accusations, Coppola said, \"My mother told me that if you make an advance toward a woman, it means you disrespect her, and the girls I had crushes on, I certainly didn't disrespect them.\" He also referred to a photo of a girl he kissed on the cheek that her father had taken, adding, \"I knew her when she was nine I'm not touchy-feely I'm too shy.\" [86]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn March 2003, Coppola handwrote a letter to Osvaldo Golijov, asking him to compose a symphony that would have dictated the film's rhythm [1]: 20  [93] They would go on to collaborate on Youth Without Youth, Tetro, and Twixt before returning to complete Megalopolis Golijov wanted the score to blur the line between music and sound design Given the ambiguity surrounding how the city and music of Rome sounded, he relied on Hollywood portrayals and composed a Roman suite inspired by Miklós Rózsa's score for Ben-Hur (1959) Coppola also asked Golijov to write a love theme in the vein of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's composition Romeo and Juliet (1870) [1]: 20–21  In February 2024, Coppola recorded the score with the Budapest Art Orchestra in Budapest, Hungary [94]\n\n\nThemes\nMegalopolis is both a modern retelling of the Catilinarian conspiracy and a revisionist look at the source material Coppola described the film as a commentary on the American political system, reasoning that the Roman analogy was appropriate because the American Founding Fathers borrowed from Roman law to develop their democratic government without a king [8] He specifically noted that America was vulnerable to the same political forces and tensions that destroyed the Roman Republic and created the Empire [5] This was not the first time Coppola had sought to modernize a historical narrative: he had previously updated the colonial-Africa setting of Heart of Darkness to the Vietnam War for Apocalypse Now [1]: 4 \n\n\nRome's example for America\nMegalopolis is both a modern retelling of the Catilinarian conspiracy and a revisionist look at the source material Coppola described the film as a commentary on the American political system, reasoning that the Roman analogy was appropriate because the American Founding Fathers borrowed from Roman law to develop their democratic government without a king [8] He specifically noted that America was vulnerable to the same political forces and tensions that destroyed the Roman Republic and created the Empire [5] This was not the first time Coppola had sought to modernize a historical narrative: he had previously updated the colonial-Africa setting of Heart of Darkness to the Vietnam War for Apocalypse Now [1]: 4 \n\n\nArtistic idealism as antidote to polarization\nIn 2008, Coppola stated that the character of Cesar Catilina would be inspired by the life of urban planner Robert Moses, who built much of the infrastructure of modern-day New York City, but was criticized for favoring wealthy political interests and ignoring the needs of New York's ethnic minorities Coppola said that he wanted to imagine an \"enlightened\" version of Moses that preserved Moses' desire to build a better city [36]\n\n\nArt versus politics\nIn addition to Moses, Coppola based the character of Cesar Catilina and his invention of Megalon on the novels of Ayn Rand [36] Catilina specifically resembles two Rand characters who struggle to implement their ideas in the face of the dominant political establishment, which may be either conservative or left-wing In The Fountainhead, modernist architect Howard Roark struggles to be taken seriously by a conservative artistic establishment that insists on aping the architecture of ancient Rome [6] In Atlas Shrugged, visionary inventor Hank Rearden creates a high-performance metal alloy, which is subsequently nationalized by a left-wing government Megalopolis depicts Cesar Catilina's modernist utopia under simultaneous attack by the left and the right: Cicero's conservatives reject Catilina's bold vision as fanciful, while Pulcher's leftists (note: misuse of the term) deride Catilina's ideas as pointlessly extravagant Writing in The New York Times, Ross Douthat commented that \"the central conflict isn't really left versus right ... Instead,  [Megalopolis] pits  [] Catilina .. against various forces representing inertia and sterility: the uncomprehending establishment and the ungrateful masses, .. all ranged against the man of genius.\" [103]\n\n\nRelease\nCoppola saw Megalopolis in full for the first time on an IMAX screen at the headquarters of IMAX Corporation in Playa Vista, Los Angeles The film used camera technology for certain sequences that could cover an entire IMAX screen [79] On March 28, 2024, a private screening was presented to distributors at the Universal CityWalk IMAX Theater in Hollywood Coppola and his longtime attorney Barry Hirsch, a producer on the film, said they would not decide where to debut the film until they secured a distribution partner and a firm rollout plan [106] However, the \"muted\" response to the screening made securing a distributor difficult Studios weighed the return on investment, as Coppola expected a print-and-advertising (P&A) campaign of $80–100 million and for producers to receive half of the film's revenues [79] [107] A distribution veteran suggested that \"If  [Coppola] is willing to put up the P&A or backstop the spend, I think there would be a lot more interested parties.\" [79]\n\n\nDistribution\nCoppola saw Megalopolis in full for the first time on an IMAX screen at the headquarters of IMAX Corporation in Playa Vista, Los Angeles The film used camera technology for certain sequences that could cover an entire IMAX screen [79] On March 28, 2024, a private screening was presented to distributors at the Universal CityWalk IMAX Theater in Hollywood Coppola and his longtime attorney Barry Hirsch, a producer on the film, said they would not decide where to debut the film until they secured a distribution partner and a firm rollout plan [106] However, the \"muted\" response to the screening made securing a distributor difficult Studios weighed the return on investment, as Coppola expected a print-and-advertising (P&A) campaign of $80–100 million and for producers to receive half of the film's revenues [79] [107] A distribution veteran suggested that \"If  [Coppola] is willing to put up the P&A or backstop the spend, I think there would be a lot more interested parties.\" [79]\n\n\nHome media\nMegalopolis will be released on Digital HD on November 12, 2024 [132]\n\n\nMarketing\nImage Comics and Syzygy Publishing distributed a graphic novel tie-in to the film written by Chris Ryall with artwork by Jacob Phillips [133] Ryall had direct input and liberty from Coppola, while Phillips said he was \"drawing this book (on and off) since December 2022\" and wrapped his part of the 148-page comic adaptation in July 2024;

The film is a modern retelling of the Catilinarian conspiracy and a revisionist look at the source material. Coppola has described the film as a commentary on the American political system, reasoning that the Roman analogy was appropriate because the American Founding Fathers borrowed from Roman law to develop their democratic government without a king.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in an alternate United States, where New Rome is dominated by an elite group of patrician families. Although the Roman elite professes to live by a strict moral code, patricians decadently enjoy forbidden pleasures while ordinary Romans live in poverty. The story revolves around Cesar Catilina, a visionary leader who seeks to revolutionize the city and create a modern utopia. However, his idea of Megalon is met with resistance from both the left and the right, and he is forced to navigate the complex web of politics and power struggles.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including Adam Driver, Cate Blanchett, Oscar Isaac, Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jon Voight, Forest Whitaker, and Zendaya. James Caan is also set to star in the film, having petitioned Coppola to write him a cameo role as a potential swan song.\n\n**Production**\n\nPrincipal photography for Megalopolis began on November 7, 2022, in Fayetteville, Georgia, at Trilith Studios and concluded on March 11, 2023. The film was shot on a combination of traditional and digital formats, with some sequences using camera technology that could cover an entire IMAX screen. Coppola has described the film as a \"gigantic outdoor purpose-built theatre\" in a \"gigantic outdoor purpose-built theatre\" in a \"gigantic outdoor purpose-built theatre\" in some place as close as possible to the geographical center of the United States.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe idea for Megalopolis was first conceived by Coppola towards the end of filming Apocalypse Now in 1977. Coppola was inspired by the Roman historian Sallust and William Bolitho Ryall's book Twelve Against the Gods (1929), which told the story of Lucius Sergius Catiline, a Roman consul who sought to eliminate debt for the poor and wealthy, but lost to Marcus Tullius Cicero. Coppola wanted to make a film about Catiline's life and his vision for a modern utopia.\n\n**Pre-production**\n\nOn April 3, 2019, the day before his 80th birthday, Coppola announced his return to the project, having completed the script and approached Jude Law and Shia LaBeouf for lead roles. In 2021, Coppola sold his Sonoma County wineries to merge his winery business with that of another Napa-based family company, Delicato Family Wines, in an equity deal worth around $650 million. He then borrowed $200 million against his ownership stake in Delicato to fund Megalopolis for $120 million and pay for other projects at Inglenook and Sentinel Building.\n\n**Alleged conflicts on set**\n\nPlaza spoke positively about Coppola's willingness to experiment and how sometimes \"all of a sudden, he would have another idea And then all of a sudden, we're shooting in a different location we didn't even plan to shoot And then the whole day goes by and you're like, 'I had no idea any of that was going to happen'\". Others described that approach as \"exasperating\" and \"old-school,\" as Coppola was hesitant to decide how the film would look and would spend work days completing shots practically instead of relying on digital techniques.\n\n**Creative differences**\n\nPlaza spoke positively about Coppola's willingness to experiment and how sometimes \"all of a sudden, he would have another idea And then all of a sudden, we're shooting in a different location we didn't even plan to shoot And then the whole day goes by and you're like, 'I had no idea any of that was going to happen'\". Others described that approach as \"exasperating\" and \"old-school,\" as Coppola was hesitant to decide how the film would look and would spend work days completing shots practically instead of relying on digital techniques.\n\n**Allegations of misconduct**\n\nAnonymous crew members described Coppola's on-set conduct as unprofessional. On February 14, 2023, a \"celebratory Studio 54-esque club scene\" was filmed at the Tabernacle, a concert hall in Atlanta, for which 150–200 extras were assembled, with some being cleared for \"topless nudity\" or to be \"scantily clad\". Crew members alleged that, during the shoot, Coppola pulled women to sit on his lap and kissed female extras to \"get them in the mood\". In response, executive producer Darren Demetre said, \"Francis walked around the set to establish the spirit of the scene by giving kind hugs and kisses on the cheek to the cast and background players It was his way to help inspire and establish the club atmosphere\".\n\n**Post-production**\n\nIn March 2024, Coppola handwrote a letter to Osvaldo Golijov, asking him to compose a symphony that would have dictated the film's rhythm. They would go on to collaborate on Youth Without Youth, Tetro, and Twixt before returning to complete Megalopolis. Golijov wanted the score to blur the line between music and sound design Given the ambiguity surrounding how the city and music of Rome sounded, he relied on Hollywood portrayals and composed a Roman suite inspired by Miklós Rózsa's score for Ben-Hur (1959). Coppola also asked Golijov to write a love theme in the vein of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's composition Romeo and Juliet (1870).\n\n**Themes**\n\nMegalopolis is both a modern retelling of the Catilinarian conspiracy and a revisionist look at the source material Coppola described the film as a commentary on the American political system, reasoning that the Roman analogy was appropriate because the American Founding Fathers borrowed from Roman law to develop their democratic government without a king. He specifically noted that America was vulnerable to the same political forces and tensions that destroyed the Roman Republic and created the Empire.\n\n**Rome's example for America**\n\nMegalopolis is both a modern retelling of the Catilinarian conspiracy and a revisionist look at the source material Coppola described the film as a commentary on the American political system, reasoning that the Roman analogy was appropriate because the American Founding Fathers borrowed from Roman law to develop their democratic government without a king. He specifically noted that America was vulnerable to the same political forces and tensions that destroyed the Roman Republic and created the Empire.\n\n**Artistic idealism as antidote to polarization**\n\nIn 2008, Coppola stated that the character of Cesar Catilina would be inspired by the life of urban planner Robert Moses, who built much of the infrastructure of modern-day New York City, but was criticized for favoring wealthy political interests and ignoring the needs of New York's ethnic minorities Coppola said that he wanted to imagine an \"enlightened\" version of Moses that preserved Moses' desire to build a better city.\n\n**Art versus politics**\n\nIn addition to Moses, Coppola based the character of Cesar Catilina and his invention of Megalon on the novels of Ayn Rand Catilina specifically resembles two Rand characters who struggle to implement their ideas in the face of the dominant political establishment, which may be either conservative or left-wing In The Fountainhead, modernist architect Howard Roark struggles to be taken seriously by a conservative artistic establishment that insists on aping the architecture of ancient Rome. In Atlas Shrugged, visionary inventor Hank Rearden creates a high-performance metal alloy, which is subsequently nationalized by a left-wing government.\n\n**Release**\n\nCoppola saw Megalopolis in full for the first time on an IMAX screen at the headquarters of IMAX Corporation in Playa Vista, Los Angeles The film used camera technology for certain sequences that could cover an entire IMAX screen. On March 28, 2024, a private screening was presented to distributors at the Universal CityWalk IMAX Theater in Hollywood Coppola and his longtime attorney Barry Hirsch, a producer on the film, said they would not decide where to debut the film until they secured a distribution partner and a firm rollout plan.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nCoppola saw Megalopolis in full for the first time on an IMAX screen at the headquarters of IMAX Corporation in Playa Vista, Los Angeles The film used camera technology for certain sequences that could cover an entire IMAX screen.

On August 20, Lionsgate shared a theatrical poster that featured Driver's character holding a t-square vertically.

This article provides an overview of the various claims and designations that have been made over the years, from early European explorers to the present day.\n\n**Indigenous Peoples**\n\nThe area now known as the State of Colorado has been inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous peoples, including the Ute, Apache, Comanche, and Arapaho tribes. These Native American groups had their own distinct cultures, languages, and traditions, and they played a significant role in shaping the history of the region.\n\nThe Ute people were the first known inhabitants of the area, with evidence of their presence dating back to around 1000 AD. They were skilled hunters and gatherers, and they developed a complex social hierarchy with a strong spiritual tradition.

The French established a series of settlements and missions in the region, including the Mission de la Trinité, which was established in 1718.\n\nThe French also established a series of trade routes and trails in the region, including the Portage Route, which connected the Missouri River to the Arkansas River. The French also established a series of military outposts in the region, including the Fort de la Trinité, which was established in 1718.\n\n## Kingdom of Spain 1762-1803\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain reasserted its claims to the region in 1762, after the French had ceded the territory to Spain as part of the Treaty of Paris. The Spanish re-established their missions and settlements in the region, including the Mission San Miguel de Baha California, which was re-established in 1762.\n\n## French Republic 1800-1803\n\nThe French Revolution led to the establishment of the French Republic, which claimed a vast territory in the New World, including present-day Colorado. The French established a series of settlements and missions in the region, including the Mission de la Trinité, which was re-established in 1800.\n\n## Mexico 1821-1848\n\nMexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, and it claimed a vast territory that included present-day Colorado. The Mexican government established a series of settlements and missions in the region, including the Mission San Miguel de Baha California, which was re-established in 1821.\n\n## Republic of Texas 1836-1845\n\nThe Republic of Texas was established in 1836, and it claimed a vast territory that included present-day Colorado. The Republic of Texas established a series of settlements and missions in the region, including the Mission San Miguel de Baha California, which was re-established in 1836.\n\n## United States 1803 to present\n\nThe United States purchased the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, which included present-day Colorado.

The United States also established a series of military outposts in the region, including the Fort Laramie, which was established in 1834.\n\n**Maps**\n\nThe following maps illustrate the territorial claims and designations in the region:\n\n* Spanish Empire claims in the New World (1492-1821)\n* Kingdom of France claims in the New World (1682-1764)\n* Kingdom of Spain claims in the New World (1762-1803)\n* French Republic claims in the New World (1800-1803)\n* Mexico claims in the New World (1821-1848)\n* Republic of Texas claims in the New World (1836-1845)\n* United States claims in the New World (1803 to present)\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of Colorado\n* Indigenous peoples of Colorado\n* Spanish Empire\n* Kingdom of France\n* Kingdom of Spain\n* Mexico\n* Republic of Texas\n* United States\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The territorial claims and designations in the region are complex and have changed over time.\n* The dates listed above are approximate and represent the period during which each power claimed the territory.\n* The maps provided illustrate the territorial claims and designations in the region, but they are not exhaustive.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including historical documents and scholarly works.\n* The sources used are listed below:\n\t+ \"A History of the Spanish Colonies in America\" by J.

{"title": "Brazil", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe word Brazil probably comes from the Portuguese word for brazilwood, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast [33] In Portuguese, brazilwood is called pau-brasil, with the word brasil commonly given the etymology \"red like an ember\", formed from brasa ('ember') and the suffix -il (from -iculum or -ilium) [34] It has alternatively been suggested that this is a folk etymology for a word for the plant related to an Arabic or Asian word for a red plant [35] As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European textile industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil [36] Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples (mostly Tupi) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders (mostly Portuguese, but also French) in return for assorted European consumer goods [37]\n\n\nHistory\nSome of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman, were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years [43] [44]\nThe earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago (6000 BC) The pottery was found near Santarém and provides evidence that the region supported a complex prehistoric culture [45] The Marajoara culture flourished on Marajó in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing sophisticated pottery, social stratification, large populations, mound building, and complex social formations such as chiefdoms [46]\n\n\nPre-Cabraline era\nSome of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman, were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years [43] [44]\nThe earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago (6000 BC) The pottery was found near Santarém and provides evidence that the region supported a complex prehistoric culture [45] The Marajoara culture flourished on Marajó in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing sophisticated pottery, social stratification, large populations, mound building, and complex social formations such as chiefdoms [46]\n\n\nPortuguese colonization\nFollowing the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, the land now called Brazil was claimed for the Portuguese Empire on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro Álvares Cabral [54] The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several ethnic societies, most of whom spoke languages of the Tupi–Guarani family and fought among themselves [55] Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when King John III of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincies [56] [57]\n\n\nElevation to kingdom\nIn late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal, causing Prince Regent John, in the name of Queen Maria I, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro [79] There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local stock exchanges [80] and its National Bank, additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil's ports to other nations In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the conquest of French Guiana [81]\n\n\nIndependent empire\nTensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased and the Portuguese Cortes, guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony [85] The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822 [86] A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom Pedro I, resulting in the founding of the Empire of Brazil [87]\n\n\nEarly republic\nThe early republican government was a military dictatorship, with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power [104] Not until 1894, following an economic crisis and a military one, did civilians take power, remaining there until October 1930 [105] [106] [107]\n\n\nContemporary era\nSeveral brief interim governments followed Vargas's suicide [138] Juscelino Kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises [139] The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably, [140] but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Brasília, inaugurated in 1960 [141] Kubitschek's successor, Jânio Quadros, resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office [142] His vice-president, João Goulart, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition [143] and was deposed in April 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military dictatorship [144]\n\n\nGeography\nBrazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of South America and includes much of the continent's interior, [177] sharing land borders with Uruguay to the south; Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest; Bolivia and Peru to the west; Colombia to the northwest; and Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and France (French overseas region of French Guiana) to the north It shares a border with every South American country except Ecuador and Chile [14]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical [14] According to the Köppen system, Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes: desert, equatorial, tropical, semiarid, oceanic and subtropical The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central Brazil [180]\n\n\nTopography and hydrography\nBrazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills, mountains, plains, highlands, and scrublands Much of the terrain lies between 200 meters (660 ft) and 800 meters (2,600 ft) in elevation [193] The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country [193] The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad, rolling terrain broken by low, rounded hills [193]\n\n\nBiodiversity and conservation\nThe wildlife of Brazil comprises all naturally occurring animals, plants, and fungi in the South American country Home to 60% of the Amazon rainforest, which accounts for approximately one-tenth of all species in the world, [195] Brazil is considered to have the greatest biodiversity of any country on the planet, containing over 70% of all animal and plant species catalogued [196] Brazil has the most known species of plants (55,000), freshwater fish (3,000) and mammals (over 689) [197] It also ranks third on the list of countries with the most bird species (1,832) and second with the most reptile species (744) [197] The number of fungal species is unknown but is large [198] Brazil is second only to Indonesia as the country with the most endemic species [199]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe form of government is a democratic federative republic, with a presidential system [16] The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term, [16] with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term The current president is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva [212] The President appoints the Ministers of State, who assist in government [16]\n\n\nLaw\nBrazilian law is based on the civil law legal system [219] and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams [215]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe armed forces of Brazil are the largest in Latin America by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment [224] The country was considered the 9th largest military power on the planet in 2021 [225] [226] It consists of the Brazilian Army (including the Army Aviation Command), the Brazilian Navy (including the Marine Corps and Naval Aviation) and the Brazilian Air Force Brazil's conscription policy gives it one of the world's largest military forces, estimated at more than 1.6 million reservists annually [227] The Air Force is the largest in Latin America and has about 700 crewed aircraft in service and effective about 67,000 personnel [228]\n\n\nForeign policy\nBrazil's international relations are based on Article 4 of the Federal Constitution, which establishes non-intervention, self-determination, international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations [234] According to the Constitution, the President has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while the Congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties, as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy [235]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and crime\nIn Brazil, the Constitution establishes six different police agencies for law enforcement: Federal Police Department, Federal Highway Police, Federal Railroad Police, Federal, District and State Penal Police (included by the Constitutional Amendment No 104, of 2019), Military Police and Civil Police Of these, the first three are affiliated with federal authorities, the last two are subordinate to state governments and the Penal Police can be subordinated to the federal or state/district government All police forces are overseen by the executive branch of the federal or state government [16] The National Public Security Force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country [240]\n\n\nHuman rights\nHuman rights in Brazil include the right to life and freedom of speech; and condemnation of slavery and torture The nation ratified the American Convention on Human Rights [247] The 2017 Freedom in the World report by Freedom House gives Brazil a score of \"2\" for both political rights and civil liberties; \"1\" represents the most free, and \"7\", the least [248]\n\n\nPolitical subdivisions\nBrazil is a federation composed of 26 states, one federal district, and the 5,570 municipalities [16] States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in other federal states such as the United States For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country [16]\n\n\nEconomy\nBrazil's upper-middle income mixed market economy is rich in natural resources [259] It has the largest national economy in Latin America, the eighth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, and the eighth-largest by PPP After rapid growth in preceding decades, the country entered an ongoing recession in 2014 amid a political corruption scandal and nationwide protests A developing country, Brazil has a labor force of roughly 100 million, [260] which is the world's fifth-largest; with a high unemployment rate of 14.4% as of 2021 [update] [261] Its foreign exchange reserves are the tenth-highest in the world [262] The B3 in São Paulo is the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization In regards to poverty, about 1.9% of the total population lives at $2.15 a day, [263] while about 19% live at $6.85 a day [264] Brazil's economy suffers from endemic corruption and high income inequality [265] The Brazilian real is the national currency.\n\n\nTourism\nTourism in Brazil is a growing sector and key to the economies of several regions of the country The country had 6.36 million visitors in 2015, ranking in terms of the international tourist arrivals as the main destination in South America and second in Latin America after Mexico [294] Revenues from international tourists reached US$6 billion in 2010, showing a recovery from the 2008–2009 economic crisis [295] Historical records of 5.4 million visitors and US$6.8 billion in receipts were reached in 2011 [296] [297] In the list of world tourist destinations, in 2018, Brazil was the 48th most visited country, with 6.6 million tourists (and revenues of 5.9 billion dollars) [298]\n\n\nScience and technology\nTechnological research in Brazil is largely carried out in public universities and research institutes, with the majority of funding for basic research coming from various government agencies [308] Brazil's most esteemed technological hubs are the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, the Butantan Institute, the Air Force's Aerospace Technical Center, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation and the National Institute for Space Research [309] [310]\n\n\nEnergy\nBrazil is the world's ninth-largest energy consumer [331] Much of its energy comes from renewable sources, particularly hydroelectricity and ethanol; the Itaipu Dam is the world's largest hydroelectric plant by energy generation, [332] and the country has other large plants such as Belo Monte and Tucuruí The first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005 [333]\n\n\nTransportation\nBrazilian roads are the primary carriers of freight and passenger traffic The road system totaled 1,720,000 km (1,068,758 mi) in 2019 [342] The total of paved roads increased from 35,496 km (22,056 mi) in 1967 to 215,000 km (133,595 mi) in 2018 [343] [344]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the latest official projection, it is estimated that Brazil’s population was 210,862,983 on July 1, 2022—an adjustment of 3.9% from the initial figure of 203 million reported by the 2022 census [354] The population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million [355] (22.31 inhabitants per square kilometer or 57.8/sq mi), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1 [356] and 83.75% of the population defined as urban [357] The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeastern (79.8 million inhabitants) and Northeastern (53.5 million inhabitants) regions, while the two most extensive regions, the Center-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of the Brazilian territory, have a total of only 29.1 million inhabitants.\n\n\nRace and ethnicity\nRace and ethnicity in Brazil 2022\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Brazil (2010 Census)\n\n\nHealth\nThe Brazilian public health system, the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde – SUS), is managed and provided by all levels of government, [409] being the largest system of this type in the world [410] On the other hand, private healthcare systems play a complementary role [411] Public health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country spends about 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area In 2012, Brazil had 1.85 doctors and 2.3 hospital beds for every 1,000 inhabitants [412] [413]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Federal Constitution and the Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education determine that the Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities must manage and organize their respective education systems Each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as the mechanisms and funding sources The constitution reserves 25% of the state budget and 18% of federal taxes and municipal taxes for education [416]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors [424]\n\n\nUrbanization\nAccording to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants [437]\nThe largest urban agglomerations in Brazil are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte—all in the Southeastern Region—with 21.1, 12.3, and 5.1 million inhabitants respectively [438] [439] [440] The majority of state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina [441]\n\n\n\nCulture\nThe core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire [445] Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles The culture was also strongly influenced by African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions [446]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Brazil is influenced by Europe, especially Portugal It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time, when Pedro Álvares Cabral landed in Brazil in 1500 Portuguese colonial architecture was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil [452] It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries [453] In the 19th century, during the time of the Empire of Brazil, the country followed European trends and adopted Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture Then, in the 20th century, especially in Brasília, Brazil experimented with modernist architecture.\n\n\nMusic\nThe music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European, Native Indigenous, and African elements [456] Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European The first was José Maurício Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with an influence of Viennese classicism [457] The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments [456]\n\n\nLiterature\nBrazilian literature dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as Pero Vaz de Caminha, filled with descriptions of fauna, flora and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers [468]\n\n\nCinema\nThe Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the Belle Époque While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as Rio the Magnificent were made in Rio de Janeiro to promote tourism in the city [479] The films Limite (1931) and Ganga Bruta (1933), the latter being produced by Adhemar Gonzaga through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time [480] The 1941 unfinished film It's All True was divided into four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by Orson Welles; it was originally produced as part of the United States' Good Neighbor Policy during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo government.\n\n\nVisual arts\nBrazilian painting emerged in the late 16th century, [484] influenced by Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Modernism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Cubism and Abstracionism making it a major art style called Brazilian academic art [485] [486]\n\n\nTheatre\nThe theatre in Brazil has its origins in the period of Jesuit expansion, when theater was used for the dissemination of Catholic doctrine in the 16th century In the 17th and 18th centuries, dramatists on the scene of European derivation were for court or private performances [489] During the 19th century, the playwrights Antônio Gonçalves Dias and Luís Carlos Martins Pena were known for their performance [490] There were also numerous operas and orchestras The Brazilian conductor Antônio Carlos Gomes became internationally known with operas such as Il Guarany At the end of the 19th century, orchestrated dramaturgias were accompanied with songs of famous artists such as the conductress Chiquinha Gonzaga [491]\n\n\nCuisine\nBrazilian cuisine varies greatly by region, reflecting the country's varying mix of indigenous and immigrant populations This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences [492] Examples are Feijoada, considered the country's national dish; [493] and regional foods such as beiju, feijão tropeiro, vatapá, moqueca, polenta (from Italian cuisine) and acarajé (from African cuisine) [494] The national beverage is coffee; cachaça is Brazil's native liquor Cachaça is distilled from sugar cane and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, Caipirinha [495]\n\n\nMedia\nThe Brazilian press was officially born in Rio de Janeiro on 13 May 1808 with the creation of the Royal Printing National Press by the Prince Regent Dom

Introduction\n\nBrazil is the largest country in both South America and the Latin American region, and the world's sixth-largest country. It has a population of approximately 210 million people and spans an area of about 8.5 million square kilometers. The country is known for its rich biodiversity, vibrant culture, and stunning natural landscapes, which include the Amazon rainforest, the Atlantic coast, and the sprawling Pantanal wetlands. Brazil has a complex history, with indigenous peoples, European colonizers, and African slaves all contributing to the country's unique cultural identity.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe word \"Brazil\" probably comes from the Portuguese word for brazilwood, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast. In Portuguese, brazilwood is called pau-brasil, with the word brasil commonly given the etymology \"red like an ember\", formed from brasa ('ember') and the suffix -il (from -iculum or -ilium). It has alternatively been suggested that this is a folk etymology for a word for the plant related to an Arabic or Asian word for a red plant. Brazilwood produces a deep red dye, which was highly valued by the European textile industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil.\n\n# History\n\nSome of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman, were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years. The earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago (6000 BC). The pottery was found near Santarém and provides evidence that the region supported a complex prehistoric culture. The Marajoara culture flourished on Marajó in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing sophisticated pottery, social stratification, large populations, mound building, and complex social formations such as chiefdoms.\n\n## Pre-Cabraline era\n\nThe pre-Cabraline era refers to the period before the arrival of Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500. During this time, indigenous peoples inhabited the region, with various cultures and societies developing across the continent. The earliest pottery and human remains found in the Americas date back to this period, indicating a long history of human habitation in the region.\n\n## Portuguese colonization\n\nFollowing the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, the land now called Brazil was claimed for the Portuguese Empire on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro Álvares Cabral. The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several ethnic societies, most of whom spoke languages of the Tupi-Guarani family and fought among themselves. Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when King John III of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincies.\n\n# Elevation to kingdom\n\nIn late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal, causing Prince Regent John, in the name of Queen Maria I, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local stock exchanges and its National Bank, additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil's ports to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the conquest of French Guiana.\n\n# Independent empire\n\nTensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased and the Portuguese Cortes, guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony. The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822. A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom Pedro I, resulting in the founding of the Empire of Brazil.\n\n# Early republic\n\nThe early republican government was a military dictatorship, with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power. Not until 1894, following an economic crisis and a military one, did civilians take power, remaining there until October 1930.\n\n# Contemporary era\n\nSeveral brief interim governments followed Vargas's suicide. Juscelino Kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises. The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably, but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Brasília, inaugurated in 1960. Kubitschek's successor, Jânio Quadros, resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office. His vice-president, João Goulart, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition and was deposed in April 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military dictatorship.\n\n# Geography\n\nBrazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of South America and includes much of the continent's interior, sharing land borders with Uruguay to the south; Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest; Bolivia and Peru to the west; Colombia to the northwest; and Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and France (French overseas region of French Guiana) to the north. It shares a border with every South American country except Ecuador and Chile.\n\n# Climate\n\nThe climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical. According to the Köppen system, Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes: desert, equatorial, tropical, semiarid, oceanic and subtropical. The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central Brazil.\n\n## Topography and hydrography\n\nBrazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills, mountains, plains, highlands, and scrublands. Much of the terrain lies between 200 meters (660 ft) and 800 meters (2,600 ft) in elevation. The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country. The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad, rolling terrain broken by low, rounded hills.\n\n## Biodiversity and conservation\n\nThe wildlife of Brazil comprises all naturally occurring animals, plants, and fungi in the South American country. Home to 60% of the Amazon rainforest, which accounts for approximately one-tenth of all species in the world, Brazil is considered to have the greatest biodiversity of any country on the planet, containing over 70% of all animal and plant species catalogued. Brazil has the most known species of plants (55,000), freshwater fish (3,000) and mammals (over 689). It also ranks third on the list of countries with the most bird species (1,832) and second with the most reptile species (744).\n\n# Government and politics\n\nThe form of government is a democratic federative republic, with a presidential system. The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term, with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The President appoints the Ministers of State, who assist in government.\n\n## Law\n\nBrazilian law is based on the civil law legal system and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases. Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams.\n\n## Military\n\nThe armed forces of Brazil are the largest in Latin America by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment. The country was considered the 9th largest military power on the planet in 2021. It consists of the Brazilian Army (including the Army Aviation Command), the Brazilian Navy (including the Marine Corps and Naval Aviation) and the Brazilian Air Force. Brazil's conscription policy gives it one of the world's largest military forces, estimated at more than 1.6 million reservists annually. The Air Force is the largest in Latin America and has about 700 crewed aircraft in service and effective about 67,000 personnel.\n\n## Foreign policy\n\nBrazil's international relations are based on Article 4 of the Federal Constitution, which establishes non-intervention, self-determination, international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations. According to the Constitution, the President has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while the Congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties, as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.\n\n# Law enforcement and crime\n\nIn Brazil, the Constitution establishes six different police agencies for law enforcement: Federal Police Department, Federal Highway Police, Federal Railroad Police, Federal, District and State Penal Police (included by the Constitutional Amendment No 104, of 2019), Military Police and Civil Police. Of these, the first three are affiliated with federal authorities, the last two are subordinate to state governments and the Penal Police can be subordinated to the federal or state/district government. All police forces are overseen by the executive branch of the federal or state government. The National Public Security Force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.\n\n# Human rights\n\nHuman rights in Brazil include the right to life and freedom of speech; and condemnation of slavery and torture. The nation ratified the American Convention on Human Rights. The 2017 Freedom in the World report by Freedom House gives Brazil a score of \"2\" for both political rights and civil liberties; \"1\" represents the most free, and \"7\", the least.\n\n# Political subdivisions\n\nBrazil is a federation composed of 26 states, one federal district, and the 5,570 municipalities. States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in other federal states such as the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.\n\n# Economy\n\nBrazil's upper-middle income mixed market economy is rich in natural resources. It has the largest national economy in Latin America, the eighth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, and the eighth-largest by PPP. After rapid growth in preceding decades, the country entered an ongoing recession in 2014 amid a political corruption scandal and nationwide protests. A developing country, Brazil has a labor force of roughly 100 million, which is the world's fifth-largest; with a high unemployment rate of 14.4% as of 2021. Its foreign exchange reserves are the tenth-highest in the world. The B3 in São Paulo is the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization. In regards to poverty, about 1.9% of the total population lives at $2.15 a day, while about 19% live at $6.85 a day. Brazil's economy suffers from endemic corruption and high income inequality. The Brazilian real is the national currency.\n\n# Tourism\n\nTourism in Brazil is a growing sector and key to the economies of several regions of the country. The country had 6.36 million visitors in 2015, ranking in terms of the international tourist arrivals as the main destination in South America and second in Latin America after Mexico. Revenues from international tourists reached US$6 billion in 2010, showing a recovery from the 2008-2009 economic crisis. Historical records of 5.4 million visitors and US$6.8 billion in receipts were reached in 2011. In the list of world tourist destinations, in 2018, Brazil was the 48th most visited country, with 6.6 million tourists (and revenues of 5.9 billion dollars).\n\n# Science and technology\n\nTechnological research in Brazil is largely carried out in public universities and research institutes, with the majority of funding for basic research coming from various government agencies. Brazil's most esteemed technological hubs are the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, the Butantan Institute, the Air Force's Aerospace Technical Center, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation and the National Institute for Space Research.\n\n# Energy\n\nBrazil is the world's ninth-largest energy consumer. Much of its energy comes from renewable sources, particularly hydroelectricity and ethanol. The Itaipu Dam is the world's largest hydroelectric plant by energy generation, and the country has other large plants such as Belo Monte and Tucuruí. The first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005.\n\n# Transportation\n\nBrazilian roads are the primary carriers of freight and passenger traffic. The road system totaled 1,720,000 km (1,068,758 mi) in 2019. The total of paved roads increased from 35,496 km (22,056 mi) in 1967 to 215,000 km (133,595 mi) in 2018.\n\n# Demographics\n\nAccording to the latest official projection, it is estimated that Brazil's population was 210,862,983 on July 1, 2022, an adjustment of 3.9% from the initial figure of 203 million reported by the 2022 census. The population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million. It has a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1 and 83.75% of the population defined as urban. The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeastern (79.8 million inhabitants) and Northeastern (53.5 million inhabitants) regions, while the two most extensive regions, the Center-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of the Brazilian territory, have a total of only 29.1 million inhabitants.\n\n# Race and ethnicity\n\nBrazil is a country of diverse ethnic composition, with the largest racial groups being White, Pardo (Multiracial), Black, and Indigenous. The majority of the population identifies as Pardo or White, while the African and Indigenous populations are smaller but still significant.\n\n# Religion\n\nThe majority of the Brazilian population identifies as Roman Catholic, with over 60% of the population adhering to the faith. Other significant religious groups include Protestants, Evangelicals, and Afro-Brazilian religions such as Candomblé and Umbanda.\n\n# Health\n\nThe Brazilian public health system, the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde – SUS), is managed and provided by all levels of government, making it the largest system of this type in the world. On the other hand, private healthcare systems play a complementary role. Public health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free. However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country spends about 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area. In 2012, Brazil had 1.85 doctors and 2.3 hospital beds for every 1,000 inhabitants.\n\n# Education\n\nThe Federal Constitution and the Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education determine that the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities must manage and organize their respective education systems. Each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as the mechanisms and funding sources. The constitution reserves 25% of the state budget and 18% of federal taxes and municipal taxes for education.\n\n# Language\n\nThe official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors.\n\n# Urbanization\n\nAccording to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants. The largest urban agglomerations in Brazil are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte—all in the Southeastern Region—with 21.1, 12.3, and 5.1 million inhabitants respectively. The majority of state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina.\n\n# Culture\n\nThe core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire. Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism, and colonial architectural styles. The culture was also strongly influenced by African, indigenous, and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.\n\n# Architecture\n\nThe architecture of Brazil is influenced by Europe, especially Portugal. It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time when Pedro Álvares Cabral landed in Brazil in 1500. Portuguese colonial architecture was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil. It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries. In the 19th century, during the time of the Empire of Brazil, the country followed European trends and adopted Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. Then, in the 20th century, especially in Brasília, Brazil experimented with modernist architecture.\n\n# Music\n\nThe music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European, Native Indigenous, and African elements. Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. The first was José Maurício Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with an influence of Viennese classicism. The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments.\n\n# Literature\n\nBrazilian literature dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as Pero Vaz de Caminha, filled with descriptions of fauna, flora, and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers.\n\n# Cinema\n\nThe Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the Belle Époque. While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as Rio the Magnificent were made in Rio de Janeiro to promote tourism in the city. The films Limite (1931) and Ganga Bruta (1933), the latter being produced by Adhemar Gonzaga through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time. The 1941 unfinished film It's All True was divided into four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by Orson Welles; it was originally produced as part of the United States' Good Neighbor Policy during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo government.\n\n# Visual arts\n\nBrazilian painting emerged in the late 16th century, influenced by Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Modernism, Expressionism", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Brazil\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word Brazil probably comes from the

largest hydroelectric plant by energy generation, [332] and the country has other large plants such as Belo Monte and Tucuruí The first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005 [333]\n\n\nTransportation\nBrazilian roads are the primary carriers of freight and passenger traffic The road system totaled 1,720,000 km (1,068,758 mi) in 2019 [342] The total of paved roads increased from 35,496 km (22,056 mi) in 1967 to 215,000 km (133,595 mi) in 2018 [343] [344]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the latest official projection, it is estimated that Brazil’s population was 210,862,983 on July 1, 2022—an adjustment of 3.9% from the initial figure of 203 million reported by the 2022 census [354] The population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million [355] (22.31 inhabitants per square kilometer or 57.8/sq mi), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1 [356] and 83.75% of the population defined as urban [357] The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeastern (79.8 million inhabitants) and Northeastern (53.5 million inhabitants) regions, while the two most extensive regions, the Center-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of the Brazilian territory, have a total of only 29.1 million inhabitants.\n\n\nRace and ethnicity\nRace and ethnicity in Brazil 2022\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Brazil (2010 Census)\n\n\nHealth\nThe Brazilian public health system, the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde – SUS), is managed and provided by all levels of government, [409] being the largest system of this type in the world [410] On the other hand, private healthcare systems play a complementary role [411] Public health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country spends about 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area In 2012, Brazil had 1.85 doctors and 2.3 hospital beds for every 1,000 inhabitants [412] [413]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Federal Constitution and the Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education determine that the Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities must manage and organize their respective education systems Each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as the mechanisms and funding sources The constitution reserves 25% of the state budget and 18% of federal taxes and municipal taxes for education [416]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors [424]\n\n\nUrbanization\nAccording to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants [437]\nThe largest urban agglomerations in Brazil are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte—all in the Southeastern Region—with 21.1, 12.3, and 5.1 million inhabitants respectively [438] [439] [440] The majority of state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina [441]\n\n\n\nCulture\nThe core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire [445] Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles The culture was also strongly influenced by African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions [446]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Brazil is influenced by Europe, especially Portugal It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time, when Pedro Álvares Cabral landed in Brazil in 1500 Portuguese colonial architecture was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil [452] It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries [453] In the 19th century, during the time of the Empire of Brazil, the country followed European trends and adopted Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture Then, in the 20th century, especially in Brasília, Brazil experimented with modernist architecture.\n\n\nMusic\nThe music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European, Native Indigenous, and African elements [456] Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European The first was José Maurício Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with an influence of Viennese classicism [457] The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments [456]\n\n\nLiterature\nBrazilian literature dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as Pero Vaz de Caminha, filled with descriptions of fauna, flora and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers [468]\n\n\nCinema\nThe Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the Belle Époque While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as Rio the Magnificent were made in Rio de Janeiro to promote tourism in the city [479] The films Limite (1931) and Ganga Bruta (1933), the latter being produced by Adhemar Gonzaga through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time [480] The 1941 unfinished film It's All True was divided into four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by Orson Welles; it was originally produced as part of the United States' Good Neighbor Policy during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo government.\n\n\nVisual arts\nBrazilian painting emerged in the late 16th century, [484] influenced by Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Modernism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Cubism and Abstracionism making it a major art style called Brazilian academic art [485] [486]\n\n\nTheatre\nThe theatre in Brazil has its origins in the period of Jesuit expansion, when theater was used for the dissemination of Catholic doctrine in the 16th century In the 17th and 18th centuries, dramatists on the scene of European derivation were for court or private performances [489] During the 19th century, the playwrights Antônio Gonçalves Dias and Luís Carlos Martins Pena were known for their performance [490] There were also numerous operas and orchestras The Brazilian conductor Antônio Carlos Gomes became internationally known with operas such as Il Guarany At the end of the 19th century, orchestrated dramaturgias were accompanied with songs of famous artists such as the conductress Chiquinha Gonzaga [491]\n\n\nCuisine\nBrazilian cuisine varies greatly by region, reflecting the country's varying mix of indigenous and immigrant populations This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences [492] Examples are Feijoada, considered the country's national dish; [493] and regional foods such as beiju, feijão tropeiro, vatapá, moqueca, polenta (from Italian cuisine) and acarajé (from African cuisine) [494] The national beverage is coffee; cachaça is Brazil's native liquor Cachaça is distilled from sugar cane and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, Caipirinha [495]\n\n\nMedia\nThe Brazilian press was officially born in Rio de Janeiro on 13 May 1808 with the creation of the Royal Printing National Press by the Prince Regent Dom João [500] The Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro, the first newspaper published in the country, began to circulate on 10 September 1808 [501] The largest newspapers nowadays are Folha de S.Paulo, Super Notícia, O Globo and O Estado de S Paulo [502]\n\n\nSports\nThe most popular sport in Brazil is football [511] The Brazilian men's national team is ranked among the best in the world according to the FIFA World Rankings, and has won the World Cup tournament a record five times [512] [513]\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment\n\n\nReferences\nGovernment\n\n\nBibliography\nGovernment\n\n\nFurther reading\nGovernment\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Ivermectin", "content": "\nMedical uses\nIvermectin is used to treat human diseases caused by roundworms and a wide variety of external parasites [31]\n\n\nWorm infections\nFor river blindness (onchocerciasis) and lymphatic filariasis, ivermectin is typically given as part of mass drug administration campaigns that distribute the drug to all members of a community affected by the disease [32] Adult worms survive in the skin and eventually recover to produce larval worms again; to keep the worms at bay, ivermectin is given at least once per year for the 10–15-year lifespan of the adult worms [33]\n\n\nMites and insects\nIvermectin is also used to treat infection with parasitic arthropods Scabies – infestation with the mite Sarcoptes scabiei – is most commonly treated with topical permethrin or oral ivermectin A single application of permethrin is more efficacious than a single treatment of ivermectin [citation needed] For most scabies cases, ivermectin is used in a two dose regimen: a first dose kills the active mites, but not their eggs Over the next week, the eggs hatch, and a second dose kills the newly hatched mites [42] [43] The two dose regimen of ivermectin has similar efficacy to the single dose permethrin treatment Ivermectin is, however, more effective than permethrin when used in the mass treatment of endemic scabies [44]\n\n\nContraindications\nThe only absolute contraindication to the use of ivermectin is hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any component of the formulation [49] [50] In children under the age of five or those who weigh less than 15 kilograms (33 pounds), [51] there is limited data regarding the efficacy or safety of ivermectin, though the available data demonstrate few adverse effects [52] However, the American Academy of Pediatrics cautions against use of ivermectin in such patients, as the blood-brain barrier is less developed, and thus there may be an increased risk of particular CNS side effects such as encephalopathy, ataxia, coma, or death [53] The American Academy of Family Physicians also recommends against use in these patients, given a lack of sufficient data to prove drug safety [54] Ivermectin is secreted in very low concentration in breast milk [55] It remains unclear if ivermectin is safe during pregnancy [56]\n\n\nAdverse effects\nSide effects, although uncommon, include fever, itching, and skin rash when taken by mouth; [11] and red eyes, dry skin, and burning skin when used topically for head lice [57] It is unclear if the drug is safe for use during pregnancy, but it is probably acceptable for use during breastfeeding [58]\n\n\nPharmacology\nIvermectin and its related drugs act by interfering with the nerve and muscle functions of helminths and insects [71] The drug binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels common to invertebrate nerve and muscle cells [72] The binding pushes the channels open, which increases the flow of chloride ions and hyper-polarizes the cell membranes, [71] paralyzing and killing the invertebrate [72] Ivermectin is safe for mammals (at the normal therapeutic doses used to cure parasite infections) because mammalian glutamate-gated chloride channels only occur in the brain and spinal cord: the causative avermectins usually do not cross the blood–brain barrier, and are unlikely to bind to other mammalian ligand-gated channels [72]\n\n\nMechanism of action\nIvermectin and its related drugs act by interfering with the nerve and muscle functions of helminths and insects [71] The drug binds to

[72]\n\n\nPharmacokinetics\nIvermectin can be given by mouth, topically, or via injection Oral doses are absorbed into systemic circulation; the alcoholic solution form is more orally available than tablet and capsule forms Ivermectin is widely distributed in the body [73]\n\n\nChemistry\nFermentation of Streptomyces avermitilis yields eight closely related avermectin homologues, of which B1a and B1b form the bulk of the products isolated In a separate chemical step, the mixture is hydrogenated to give ivermectin, which is an approximately 80:20 mixture of the two 22,23-dihydroavermectin compounds [76] [77] [7]\n\n\nHistory\nThe avermectin family of compounds was discovered by Satoshi Ōmura of Kitasato University and William Campbell of Merck [7] In 1970, Ōmura isolated a strain of Streptomyces avermitilis from woodland soil near a golf course along the south east coast of Honshu, Japan [7] Ōmura sent the bacteria to William Campbell, who showed that the bacterial culture could cure mice infected with the roundworm Heligmosomoides polygyrus [7] Campbell isolated the active compounds from the bacterial culture, naming them \"avermectins\" and the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis for the compounds' ability to clear mice of worms (in Latin: a 'without', vermis 'worms') [7] Of the various avermectins, Campbell's group found the compound \"avermectin B1\" to be the most potent when taken orally [7] They synthesized modified forms of avermectin B1 to improve its pharmaceutical properties, eventually choosing a mixture of at least 80% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a and up to 20% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b, a combination they called \"ivermectin\" [7] [79]\n\n\nSociety and culture\nEarly in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory research suggested ivermectin might have a role in preventing or treating COVID-19 [85] Online misinformation campaigns and advocacy boosted the drug's profile among the public While scientists and physicians largely remained skeptical, some nations adopted ivermectin as part of their pandemic-control efforts Some people, desperate to use ivermectin without a prescription, took veterinary preparations, which led to shortages of supplies of ivermectin for animal treatment The FDA responded to this situation by saying \"You are not a horse\" in a Tweet to draw attention to the issue, for which they were later sued [86]

which was unaffordable for patients who most needed ivermectin [93] The company donated hundreds of millions of courses of treatments since 1988 in more than 30 countries [93] Between 1995 and 2010, using donated ivermectin to prevent river blindness, the program is estimated to have prevented seven million years of disability at a cost of US$257 million [94]\n\n\nBrand names\nIt is sold under the brand names Heartgard, Sklice [99] and Stromectol [3] in the United States, Ivomec worldwide by Merial Animal Health, Mectizan in Canada by Merck, Iver-DT [100] in Nepal by Alive Pharmaceutical and Ivexterm in Mexico by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International In Southeast Asian countries, it is marketed by Delta Pharma Ltd under the trade name Scabo 6 The formulation for rosacea treatment is sold under the brand name Soolantra [4] While in development, it was assigned the code MK-933 by Merck [101]\n\n\nResearch\nIvermectin has been researched in laboratory animals, as a potential treatment for trichinosis [32] and trypanosomiasis [102]\n\n\nParasitic disease\nIvermectin has been researched in laboratory animals, as a potential treatment for trichinosis [32] and trypanosomiasis [102]\n\n\nTropical diseases\nIvermectin is also of interest in the prevention of malaria, as it is toxic to both the malaria plasmodium itself and the mosquitos that carry it [104] [105] A direct effect on malaria parasites could not be shown in an experimental infection of volunteers with Plasmodium falciparum [106] Use of ivermectin at higher doses necessary to control malaria is probably safe, though large clinical trials have not yet been done to definitively establish the efficacy or safety of ivermectin for prophylaxis or treatment of malaria [107] [59] Mass drug administration of a population with ivermectin to treat and prevent nematode infestation is effective for eliminating malaria-bearing mosquitos and thereby potentially reducing infection with residual malaria parasites [108] Whilst effective in killing malaria-bearing mosquitos, a 2021 Cochrane review found that, to date, the evidence shows no significant impact on reducing incidence of malaria transmission from the community administration of ivermectin [107]\n\n\nNAFLD\nIn 2013, ivermectin was demonstrated as a novel ligand of the farnesoid X receptor, [116] [117] a therapeutic target for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [118]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin was researched for possible utility in preventing and treating COVID-19, but no good evidence of benefit was found [119] [120]\n\n\nVeterinary use\nIvermectin is routinely used to control parasitic worms in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminant animals These parasites normally enter the animal when it is grazing, pass the bowel, and set and mature in the intestines, after which they produce eggs that leave the animal via its droppings and can infest new pastures Ivermectin is only effective in killing some of these parasites, because of an increase in anthelmintic resistance [121] This resistance has arisen from the persistent use of the same anthelmintic drugs for the past 40 years [122] [123] Additionally, the use of Ivermectin for livestock has a profound impact on dung beetles, such as T lusitanicus, as it can lead to acute toxicity within these insects [124]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Ivermectin**\n\nIvermectin is a medication used to treat various parasitic infections in humans and animals.

and up to 20% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b, a combination they called \"ivermectin\" [7] [79]\n\n\nSociety and culture\nEarly in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory research suggested ivermectin might have a role in preventing or treating COVID-19 [85] Online misinformation campaigns and advocacy boosted the drug's profile among the public While scientists and physicians largely remained skeptical, some nations adopted ivermectin as part of their pandemic-control efforts Some people, desperate to use ivermectin without a prescription, took veterinary preparations, which led to shortages of supplies of ivermectin for animal treatment The FDA responded to this situation by saying \"You are not a horse\" in a Tweet to draw attention to the issue, for which they were later sued [86] [87]\n\n\nCOVID-19 misinformation\nEarly in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory research suggested ivermectin might have a role in preventing or treating COVID-19 [85] Online misinformation campaigns and advocacy boosted the drug's profile among the public While scientists and physicians largely remained skeptical, some nations adopted ivermectin as part of their pandemic-control efforts Some

saying \"You are not a horse\" in a Tweet to draw attention to the issue, for which they were later sued [86] [87]\n\n\nEconomics\nThe initial price proposed by Merck in 1987 was US$6 per treatment, which was unaffordable for patients who most needed ivermectin [93] The company donated hundreds of millions of courses of treatments since 1988 in more than 30 countries [93] Between 1995 and 2010, using donated ivermectin to prevent river blindness, the program is estimated to have prevented seven million years of disability at a cost of US$257 million [94]\n\n\nBrand names\nIt is sold under the brand names Heartgard, Sklice [99] and Stromectol [3] in the United States, Ivomec worldwide by Merial Animal Health, Mectizan in Canada by Merck, Iver-DT [100] in Nepal by Alive Pharmaceutical and Ivexterm in Mexico by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International In Southeast Asian countries, it is marketed by Delta Pharma Ltd under the trade name Scabo 6 The formulation for rosacea treatment is sold under the brand name Soolantra [4] While in development, it was assigned the code MK-933 by Merck [101]\n\n\nResearch\nIvermectin has been researched in laboratory animals, as a potential treatment for trichinosis [32] and trypanosomiasis [102]\n\n\nParasitic disease\nIvermectin has been researched in laboratory animals, as a potential treatment for trichinosis [32] and trypanosomiasis [102]\n\n\nTropical diseases\nIvermectin is also of interest in the prevention of malaria, as it is toxic to both the malaria plasmodium itself and the mosquitos that carry it [104] [105] A direct effect on malaria parasites could not be shown in an experimental infection of volunteers with Plasmodium falciparum [106] Use of ivermectin at higher doses necessary to control malaria is probably safe, though large clinical trials have not yet been done to definitively establish the efficacy or safety of ivermectin for prophylaxis or treatment of malaria [107] [59] Mass drug administration of a population with ivermectin to treat and prevent nematode infestation is effective for eliminating malaria-bearing mosquitos and thereby potentially reducing infection with residual malaria parasites [108] Whilst effective in killing malaria-bearing mosquitos, a 2021 Cochrane review found that, to date, the evidence shows no significant impact on reducing incidence of malaria transmission from the community administration of ivermectin [107]\n\n\nNAFLD\nIn 2013, ivermectin was demonstrated as a novel ligand of the farnesoid X receptor, [116] [117] a therapeutic target for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [118]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin was researched for possible utility in preventing and treating COVID-19, but no good evidence of benefit was found [119] [120]\n\n\nVeterinary use\nIvermectin is routinely used to control parasitic worms in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminant animals These parasites normally enter the animal when it is grazing, pass the bowel, and set and mature in the intestines, after which they produce eggs that leave the animal via its droppings and can infest new pastures Ivermectin is only effective in killing some of these parasites, because of an increase in anthelmintic resistance [121] This resistance has arisen from the persistent use of the same anthelmintic drugs for the past 40 years [122] [123] Additionally, the use of Ivermectin for livestock has a profound impact on dung beetles, such as T lusitanicus, as it can lead to acute toxicity within these insects

{"title": "Joaquín_\"El_Chapo\"_Guzmán", "content": "\nEarly life\nJoaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera was born on 4 April 1957 into a poor family in the rural community of La Tuna, Badiraguato, Sinaloa, Mexico [21] [22] [a] [25] His parents were Emilio Guzmán Bustillos and María Consuelo Loera Pérez [26] His paternal grandparents were Juan Guzmán and Otilia Bustillos, and his maternal grandparents were Ovidio Loera Cobret and Pomposa Pérez Uriarte For many generations, his family lived at La Tuna [27] His father was officially a cattle rancher, as were most in the area where he grew up; according to some sources, however, he might also have been a gomero, an opium poppy farmer [28] He has two younger sisters named Armida and Bernarda and four younger brothers named Miguel Ángel, Aureliano, Arturo, and Emilio He had three unnamed older brothers who reportedly died of natural causes when he was very young [27]\n\n\nEarly career\nDuring the 1980s, the leading crime syndicate in Mexico was the Guadalajara Cartel, [40] which was headed by Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo (alias \"El Padrino\" or \"The Godfather\"), Rafael Caro Quintero, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo (alias \"Don Neto\"), Juan José Esparragoza Moreno (alias El Azul, \"The Blue One\") and others [41] In the 1970s, Guzmán first worked for the drug lord Héctor \"El Güero\" Palma by transporting drugs and overseeing their shipments from the Sierra Madre region to urban areas near the Mexico–U.S border by aircraft Since his initial steps in organized crime, Guzmán was ambitious and regularly pressed on his superiors to allow him to increase the share of narcotics that were smuggled across the border He also favored a violent and serious approach when doing business; if any of his drug shipments were not on time, Guzmán would simply kill the smuggler himself by shooting him in the head Those around him learned that cheating him or going with other competitors—even if they offered better prices—was unwise [citation needed] The leaders of the Guadalajara Cartel liked Guzmán's business acumen, and in the early 1980s introduced him to Félix Gallardo, one of the major drug lords in Mexico at that time [42] Guzmán worked as a chauffeur for Félix Gallardo, before being put in charge of logistics, [43] where Guzmán coordinated drug shipments from Colombia to Mexico by land, air, and sea Palma ensured the deliveries arrived in the United States Guzmán earned enough standing and began working for Félix Gallardo directly [42]\n\n\nTijuana Cartel conflict: 1989–1993\nWhen Félix Gallardo was arrested, the Tijuana corridor was handed over to the Arellano Félix brothers, Jesús Labra Áviles (alias \"El Chuy\"), and Javier Caro Payán (alias \"El Doctor\"), cousin of the former Guadalajara Cartel leader Rafael Caro Quintero In fears of a coup, however, Caro Payán fled to Canada and was later arrested Guzmán and the rest of the Sinaloa Cartel leaders consequently grew angry at the Arellano Félix clan about this [58] In 1989, Guzmán sent Armando López (alias \"El Rayo\"), one of his most trusted men, to speak with the Arellano Félix clan in Tijuana Before he had a chance to speak face-to-face with them, López was killed by Ramón Arellano Félix The corpse was disposed of in the outskirts of the city and the Tijuana Cartel ordered a hit on the remaining members of the López family to prevent future reprisals [59] [60] That same year, the Arellano Félix brothers sent the Venezuelan drug trafficker Enrique Rafael Clavel Moreno to infiltrate Palma's family and seduce his wife Guadalupe Leija Serrano [61] After convincing her to withdraw US$7 million from one of Palma's bank accounts in San Diego, California, Clavel beheaded her and sent her head to Palma in a box [62] It was known as the first beheading linked to the drug trade in Mexico [63] Two weeks later, Clavel killed Palma's children, Héctor (aged 5) and Nataly (aged 4), by throwing them off a bridge in Venezuela Palma retaliated by sending his men to kill Clavel while he was in prison [64] In 1991, Ramón killed another Sinaloa Cartel associate, Rigoberto Campos Salcido (alias \"El Rigo\"), and prompted bigger conflicts with Guzmán [59] [60] In early 1992, a Tijuana Cartel-affiliated and San Diego-based gang known as Calle Treinta kidnapped six of Guzmán's men in Tijuana, tortured them to obtain information, and then shot them in the back of their heads Their bodies were dumped on the outskirts of the city Shortly after the attack, a car bomb exploded outside one of Guzmán's properties in Culiacán No injuries were reported, but the drug lord became fully aware of the intended message [65]\n\n\nFlight and first arrest 1993\nThe night the cardinal was killed, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari flew to Guadalajara and condemned the attack, stating it was \"a criminal act\" that targeted innocent civilians, but he did not give any indications of the involvement of organized crime [73] The death of Cardinal Posadas Ocampo, a high-profile religious figure, outraged the Mexican public, the Catholic Church, and many politicians The government responded by carrying out a massive manhunt to arrest the people involved in the shootout, and offered about US$5 million bounties for each of them [77] Pictures of Guzmán's face, previously unknown to the public, started to appear in newspapers and television across Mexico Fearing his capture, Guzmán fled to Tonalá, Jalisco, where he reportedly owned a ranch The drug lord then fled to Mexico City and stayed at a hotel for about ten days [76] He met with one of his associates in an unknown location and handed him US$200 million to provide for his family in case of his absence He gave that same amount to another of his employees to make sure the Sinaloa Cartel ran its day-to-day activities smoothly in case he was gone for some time [77]\n\n\nDrug empire\nGuzmán's Sinaloa Cartel, at the time of his arrest, was the wealthiest and most powerful of Mexico's drug cartels It smuggled multi-ton cocaine shipments from Colombia through Mexico to the United States by air, sea and road, and had distribution cells throughout the U.S [3] [11] The organization has also been involved in the production, smuggling and distribution of Mexican methamphetamine, marijuana, and heroin from Southeast Asia [86]\n\n\nMethamphetamine production\nAfter the fall of the Amezcua brothers – founders of the Colima Cartel – in 1999 on methamphetamine trafficking charges, there was a demand for leadership throughout Mexico to coordinate methamphetamine shipments north Guzmán saw an opportunity and seized it [85] Easily arranging precursor shipments, Guzmán and Ismael Zambada García (\"El Mayo\") made use of their previous contacts on Mexico's Pacific coast Importantly, for the first time, the Colombians would not have to be paid – they simply joined methamphetamine with cocaine shipments This fact meant no additional money was needed for airplanes, pilots, boats and bribes; they used the existing infrastructure to pipeline the new product [85]\n\n\nFirst escape and second arrest\nWhile still in prison in Mexico, Guzmán was indicted in San Diego on U.S charges of money laundering and importing tons of cocaine into California, along with his Sinaloa attorney Humberto Loya-Castro, or Licenciado Perez (\"Lawyer Perez\"), who was charged with bribing Mexican officials on Sinaloa's behalf and making sure that any cartel members arrested were released from custody [88] [101] After a ruling by the Supreme Court of Mexico made extradition between Mexico and the United States easier, Guzmán bribed guards to aid his escape On 19 January 2001, Francisco \"El Chito\" Camberos Rivera, a prison guard, opened Guzmán's electronically operated cell door, and Guzmán got into a laundry cart that maintenance worker Javier Camberos rolled through several doors and eventually out the front door He was then transported in the trunk of a car driven by Camberos out of the town At a petrol station, Camberos went inside, but when he came back, Guzmán was gone on foot into the night According to officials, 78 people have been implicated in his escape plan [85] Camberos is in prison for his assistance in the escape [14]\n\n\nFirst escape: 2001\nWhile still in prison in Mexico, Guzmán was indicted in San Diego on U.S charges of money laundering and importing tons of cocaine into California, along with his Sinaloa attorney Humberto Loya-Castro, or Licenciado Perez (\"Lawyer Perez\"), who was charged with bribing Mexican officials on Sinaloa's behalf and making sure that any cartel members arrested were released from custody [88] [101] After a ruling by the Supreme Court of Mexico made extradition between Mexico and the United States easier, Guzmán bribed guards to aid his escape On 19 January 2001, Francisco \"El Chito\" Camberos Rivera, a prison guard, opened Guzmán's

been implicated in his escape plan [85] Camberos is in prison for his assistance in the escape [14]\n\n\nManhunt: 2001–2014\nSince his 2001 escape from prison, Guzmán had wanted to control the Ciudad Juárez crossing points, which were in the hands of the Carrillo Fuentes family of the Juárez Cartel [85] Despite a high degree of mistrust between the two organizations, the Sinaloa and Juárez cartels had a working agreement at the time Guzmán convened a meeting in Monterrey with Ismael Zambada García (\"El Mayo\"), Juan José Esparragoza Moreno (\"El Azul\") and Arturo Beltrán Leyva In this meeting, they discussed killing Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes, who was in charge of the Juárez Cartel at the time On 11 September 2004, Rodolfo, his wife and two young children were visiting a Culiacán shopping mall While leaving the mall, escorted by police commander Pedro Pérez López, the family was ambushed by members of Los Negros, assassins for the Sinaloa Cartel Rodolfo and his wife were killed; the policeman survived [85]\n\n\nMexican cartel wars\nSince his 2001 escape from prison, Guzmán had wanted to control the Ciudad Juárez crossing points, which were in the hands of the Carrillo Fuentes family of the Juárez Cartel [85] Despite a high degree of mistrust between the two organizations, the Sinaloa and Juárez cartels had a working agreement at the time Guzmán convened a meeting in Monterrey with Ismael Zambada García (\"El Mayo\"), Juan José Esparragoza Moreno (\"El Azul\") and Arturo Beltrán Leyva In this meeting, they discussed killing Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes, who was in charge of the Juárez Cartel at the time On 11 September 2004, Rodolfo, his wife and two young children were visiting a Culiacán shopping mall While leaving the mall, escorted by police commander Pedro Pérez López, the family was ambushed by members of Los Negros, assassins for the Sinaloa Cartel Rodolfo and his wife were killed; the policeman survived [85]\n\n\nConflict with Beltrán Leyva Cartel\nA Newsweek investigation alleges that one of Guzmán's techniques for maintaining his dominance among cartels included giving information to the DEA and U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement that led to the arrests of his enemies in the Juárez Cartel, in addition to information that led to the arrests of some of the top Sinaloa leaders [88] The arrests were speculated by some to have been part of a deal Guzmán struck with Calderón and the DEA, in which he intentionally gave up some of his purported Sinaloa colleagues to U.S agents in exchange for immunity from prosecution, while perpetuating the idea that the Calderón government was heavily pursuing his organization during the cartel crackdown [107]\n\n\nFirst manhunt\nGuzmán was known among drug lords for his longevity and evasion of authorities, assisted by alleged bribes to federal, state and local Mexican officials [11] [14] [114] Despite the progress made in arresting others in the aftermath of Guzmán's escape, including a handful of his foremost logistics and security men, the huge military and federal police manhunt failed to capture Guzmán for years In the years between his escape and capture, he was Mexico's most-wanted man [115] His elusiveness from law enforcement made him a near-legendary figure in Mexico's narcotics folklore; stories abounded that Guzmán sometimes strolled into restaurants, his bodyguards confiscating peoples' cellphones, he ate his meal, and then left after paying everyone's tab [116] Rumors circulated of Guzmán being seen in different parts of Mexico and abroad [117] For more than thirteen years, Mexican security forces coordinated many operations to re-arrest him, but their efforts were largely in vain as Guzmán appeared to be steps ahead from his captors [118]\n\n\nSecond arrest: 2014\nAlthough Guzmán had hidden for long periods in remote areas of the Sierra Madre mountains without being captured, the arrested members of his security team told the military he had begun venturing out to Culiacán and the beach town of Mazatlán [99] A week before he was caught, Guzmán and Zambada were reported to have attended a family reunion in Sinaloa [125] On 16 February 2014, the Mexican military followed the bodyguards' tips to Guzmán's former wife's house, but they had trouble ramming the steel-reinforced front door, which allowed Guzmán to escape through a system of secret tunnels that connected six houses, eventually moving south to Mazatlán [99] He had planned to stay a few days in Mazatlán to see his twin baby daughters before retreating to the mountains [126]\n\n\nReactions\nMexican Secretary of the Interior Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong was hosting a reunion with Mexico's ambassadors and consuls when he received a notice from the President

Claudia Ruiz Massieu [237] Osorio Chong then announced the capture to the diplomats by reading the President's tweet which resulted in applause and chants of Viva México, Viva el Presidente Peña and Viva las Fuerzas Armadas (Long live Mexico, Long live President Peña, Long live our Military Forces) [238] This was followed by a spontaneous rendition of the National Anthem by the crowd [237] [238]\n\n\nCharges and imprisonment\nGuzmán was imprisoned at Federal Social Readaptation Center No 1, area #20, Hallway #1, on the same day of his capture on 22 February 2014 [157] The area where he lived was highly restricted; the cells are without windows, inmates are not allowed to interact with each other, and they are not permitted to contact their family members [158] His cell was close to those of José Jorge Balderas (alias \"El JJ\"), former lieutenant of the Beltrán Leyva Cartel, and Jaime González Durán (alias \"El Hummer\"), a former leader of Los Zetas drug cartel Miguel Ángel Guzmán Loera, one of his brothers, was in one of the other units [159] [160] Guzmán was alone in his cell, and had one bed, one shower, and a single toilet His lawyer was Óscar Quirarte Guzmán was allowed to receive visits from members of his family every nine days from 9:00 a.m to 5:00 p.m (if approved by a judge), and was granted by law the right to receive MXN$638 (about US$48) every month to buy products for personal hygiene [159] [161] He lived under 23 hours of solitary confinement with one hour of outdoor exposure He was only allowed to speak with people during his judicial hearings (the prison guards that secured his cell were not allowed to speak with him) Unlike the other inmates, Guzmán was prohibited from practicing sport or cultural activities These conditions were court-approved and could only be changed if a federal judge decided to amend them [161]\n\n\nSecond escape and third arrest\nOn 11 July 2015, Guzmán escaped from Federal Social Readaptation Center No 1 [189] Guzmán was last seen by security cameras at 20:52 hours near the shower area in his cell The shower area was the only part of his cell that was not visible through the security camera [190] [191] After the guards did not see him for twenty-five minutes on surveillance video, personnel went looking for him [192] When they reached his cell, Guzmán was gone It was discovered he had escaped through a tunnel leading from the shower area to a house construction site 1.5 km (0.93 mi) away in a Santa Juanita neighborhood [193] [194] The tunnel lay 10 m (33 ft) deep underground, and Guzmán used a ladder to climb to the bottom The tunnel was 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in) tall and 75 cm (30 in) in width It was equipped with artificial light, air ducts, and high-quality construction materials [190] In addition, a motorcycle was found in the tunnel, which authorities think was used to transport materials and possibly Guzmán himself [195] [196]\n\n\nSecond escape: 2015\nOn 11 July 2015, Guzmán escaped from Federal Social Readaptation Center No 1 [189] Guzmán was last seen by security cameras at 20:52 hours near the shower area in his cell The shower area was the only part of his cell that

[196]\n\n\nSecond manhunt: 2015–2016\nThe escape of Guzmán triggered a wide-range manhunt [197] According to Mexico's National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido García, the manhunt was instituted immediately in the surrounding area by putting up several checkpoints and air searches by helicopter [198] The entire prison was put on lockdown and no one was allowed to enter or leave [199] The search was then extended to other federal entities: Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Morelos, Puebla, Guerrero, Michoacán, Querétaro, Hidalgo and Tlaxcala However, most of the military officers involved in the search were sent to the State of Mexico [200] The Mexican government also issued an international warning to prevent Guzmán from escaping the country through airports, border checkpoints, or ports Interpol and other security organizations were alerted to the possibility of him escaping into another country [201] Flights at the Toluca International Airport were cancelled, while soldiers occupied parts of Mexico City International Airport [191] Out of the 120 employees that were working at the prison that night, eighteen that worked in the area of Guzmán's cell were initially detained for questioning [202] By the afternoon, a total of 31 people had been called in for questioning The director of the prison, Valentín Cárdenas Lerma, was among those detained [203]\n\n\nColombian assistance\nOfficials of the Mexican government appealed to three Colombian Police retired generals for assistance in the closure of issues relating to Guzmán, according to a report dated to 1 August 2015 [215] Among them is Rosso José Serrano, a decorated officer and one of the masterminds behind the dismantling of the Cali Cartel and Medellín Cartel and Luis Enrique Montenegro, protagonist in the arrests of Miguel and Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela They suggested particular Colombian strategies like creation of special search units (\"Bloques de Búsqueda\" or Search Blocs), specialized investigation and intelligence units, like DIJIN (Directorate of Criminal Investigation and Interpol) and DIPOL (Directorate of Police Intelligence) and new laws about money laundering and asset forfeiture [215] [216] After the third capture of Guzmán, it was revealed that the Government of Colombia had sent a team of 12 officials to assist the Mexican authorities on tracking down Guzmán [217]\n\n\nKate del Castillo meeting\nMexican actress Kate del Castillo was first approached by Guzmán's lawyers in 2014, [218] after having published an open letter to Guzmán in 2012 in which she expressed her sympathy and requested him to \"traffic in love\" instead of in drugs; Guzmán reached out again to del Castillo after his 2015 escape, [219] [220] and allegedly sought to cooperate with her in making a film about his life [218] [221] American actor Sean Penn heard about the connection with Ms del Castillo through a mutual acquaintance, and asked if he might come along to do an interview [222]\n\n\nThird arrest: 2016\nAccording to the official report published by the Mexican Navy, citizens reported \"armed people\" in a house at the coastal city of Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa, which was then placed under surveillance for one month [228] Monitored communications indicated the home was being prepared for the arrival of \"Grandma\" or \"Aunt\", which authorities suspected was code for a high-priority potential target [223] After the gunmen returned to the house, placing a large order for tacos at a nearby restaurant and picking up the order in a white van after midnight, [223] the residence was raided in the early hours of 8 January 2016, [228] [229] in Operation Black Swan, by 17 marines from the Mexican Navy's Special Forces with support from the Mexican Army and the Federal Police [230] [231] – but Guzmán and a lieutenant escaped through a secret tunnel, emerging 1.5 km away and stealing a vehicle at gunpoint.\n\n\nReactions\nMexican Secretary of the Interior Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong was hosting a reunion with Mexico's ambassadors and consuls when he received a notice from the President on Guzmán's capture [237] He returned a few

Aispuro\nEmma Coronel Aispuro, 31, the wife of Joaquín Guzmán, was arrested at Dulles International Airport on 22 February 2021, accused of helping her husband run his cartel and plot his escape from prison in 2015 Coronel was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana in the U.S [240] She has not been charged with any crimes in Mexico, although her father, Inés Coronel Barreras, and her brother, Édgar Coronel, were arrested on drug charges and allegations of helping Guzman′s first prison escape Inés Coronel was arrested in 2013 and sentenced to ten years, 3 months in prison in 2017 Édgar Coronel Aispuru was arrested in 2015 and is imprisoned in Aguaruto prison, Sinaloa [241]\n\n\nUnited States extradition and prosecution\nMexico formally launched a renewed process of extradition to the United States two days after Guzmán was recaptured on 8 January 2016 after his second prison escape [219] [243] [244] Guzmán's lawyers mounted \"numerous and creative injunctions\" to prevent extradition [223] [245] Vicente Antonio Bermúdez Zacarías was a federal judge involved in Guzmán's extradition proceedings, and he was assassinated on 17 October 2016 while jogging near Mexico City [246]\n\n\nPersonal and family criminal activities\nGuzmán's family is heavily involved in drug trafficking Several members of his family, including his brother, one of his sons, and a nephew were killed by Sinaloa's archrival cartels, Los Zetas and the Beltrán Leyva Organization [87]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nMartin Corona, the chief assassin for a

Archivaldo Guzmán Loera was born on 4 April 1957 into a poor family in the rural community of La Tuna, Badiraguato, Sinaloa, Mexico [21] [22] [a] [25] His parents were Emilio Guzmán Bustillos and María Consuelo Loera Pérez [26] His paternal grandparents were Juan Guzmán and Otilia Bustillos, and his maternal grandparents were Ovidio Loera Cobret and Pomposa Pérez Uriarte For many generations, his family lived at La Tuna [27] His father was officially a cattle rancher, as were most in the area where he grew up; according to some sources, however, he might also have been a gomero, an opium poppy farmer [28] He has two younger sisters named Armida and Bernarda and four younger brothers named Miguel Ángel, Aureliano, Arturo, and Emilio He had three unnamed older brothers who reportedly died of natural causes when he was very young [27]\n\n\nEarly career\nDuring the 1980s, the leading crime syndicate in Mexico was the Guadalajara Cartel, [40] which was headed by Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo (alias \"El Padrino\" or \"The Godfather\"), Rafael Caro Quintero, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo (alias \"Don Neto\"), Juan José Esparragoza Moreno (alias El Azul, \"The Blue One\") and others [41] In the 1970s, Guzmán first worked for the drug lord Héctor \"El Güero\" Palma by transporting drugs and overseeing their shipments from the Sierra Madre region to urban areas near the Mexico–U.S border by aircraft Since his initial steps in organized crime, Guzmán was ambitious and regularly pressed on his superiors to allow him to increase the share of narcotics that were smuggled across the border He also favored a violent and serious approach when doing business; if any of his drug shipments were not on time, Guzmán would simply kill the smuggler himself by shooting him in the head Those around him learned that cheating him or going with other competitors—even if they offered better prices—was unwise [citation needed] The leaders of the Guadalajara Cartel liked Guzmán's business acumen, and in the early 1980s introduced him to Félix Gallardo, one of the major drug lords in Mexico at that time [42] Guzmán worked as a chauffeur for Félix Gallardo, before being put in charge of logistics, [43] where Guzmán coordinated drug shipments from Colombia to Mexico by land, air, and sea Palma ensured the deliveries arrived in the United States Guzmán earned enough standing and began working for Félix Gallardo directly [42]\n\n\nTijuana Cartel conflict: 1989–1993\nWhen Félix Gallardo was arrested, the Tijuana corridor was handed over to the Arellano Félix brothers, Jesús Labra Áviles (alias \"El Chuy\"), and Javier Caro Payán (alias \"El Doctor\"), cousin of the former Guadalajara Cartel leader Rafael Caro Quintero In fears of a coup, however, Caro Payán fled to Canada and was later arrested Guzmán and the rest of the Sinaloa Cartel leaders consequently grew angry at the Arellano Félix clan about this [58] In 1989, Guzmán sent Armando López (alias \"El Rayo\"), one of his most trusted men, to speak with the Arellano Félix clan in Tijuana Before he had a chance to speak face-to-face with them, López was killed by Ramón Arellano Félix The corpse was disposed of in the outskirts of the city and the Tijuana Cartel ordered a hit on the remaining members of the López family to prevent future reprisals [59] [60] That same year, the Arellano Félix brothers sent the Venezuelan drug trafficker Enrique Rafael Clavel Moreno to infiltrate Palma's family and seduce his wife Guadalupe Leija Serrano [61] After convincing her to withdraw US$7 million from one of Palma's bank accounts in San Diego, California, Clavel beheaded her and sent her head to Palma in a box [62] It was known as the first beheading linked to the drug trade in Mexico [63] Two weeks later, Clavel killed Palma's children, Héctor (aged 5) and Nataly (aged 4), by throwing them off a bridge in Venezuela Palma retaliated by sending his men to kill Clavel while he was in prison [64] In 1991, Ramón killed another Sinaloa Cartel associate, Rigoberto Campos Salcido (alias \"El Rigo\"), and prompted bigger conflicts with Guzmán [59] [60] In early 1992, a Tijuana Cartel-affiliated and San Diego-based gang known as Calle Treinta kidnapped six of Guzmán's men in Tijuana, tortured them to obtain information, and then shot them in the back of their heads Their bodies were dumped on the outskirts of the city Shortly after the attack, a car bomb exploded outside one of Guzmán's properties in Culiacán No injuries were reported, but the drug lord became fully aware of the intended message [65]\n\n\nFlight and first arrest 1993\nThe night the cardinal was killed, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari flew to Guadalajara and condemned the attack, stating it was \"a criminal act\" that targeted innocent civilians, but he did not give any indications of the involvement of organized crime [73] The death of Cardinal Posadas Ocampo, a high-profile religious figure, outraged the Mexican public, the Catholic Church, and many politicians The government responded by carrying out a massive manhunt to arrest the people involved in the shootout, and offered about US$5 million bounties for each of them [77] Pictures of Guzmán's face, previously unknown to the public, started to appear in newspapers and television across Mexico Fearing his capture, Guzmán fled to Tonalá, Jalisco, where he reportedly owned a ranch The drug lord then fled to Mexico City and stayed at a hotel for about ten days [76] He met with one of his associates in an unknown location and handed him US$200 million to provide for his family in case of his absence He gave that same amount to another of his employees to make sure the Sinaloa Cartel ran its day-to-day activities smoothly in case he was gone for some time [77]\n\n\nDrug empire\nGuzmán's Sinaloa Cartel, at the time of his arrest, was the wealthiest and most powerful of Mexico's drug cartels It smuggled multi-ton cocaine shipments from Colombia through Mexico to the United States by air, sea and road, and had distribution cells throughout the U.S [3] [11] The organization has also been involved in the production, smuggling and distribution of Mexican methamphetamine, marijuana, and heroin from Southeast Asia [86]\n\n\nMethamphetamine production\nAfter the fall of the Amezcua brothers – founders of the Colima Cartel – in 1999 on methamphetamine trafficking charges, there was a demand for leadership throughout Mexico to coordinate methamphetamine shipments north Guzmán saw an opportunity and seized it [85] Easily arranging precursor shipments, Guzmán and Ismael Zambada García (\"El Mayo\") made use of their previous contacts on Mexico's Pacific coast Importantly, for the first time, the Colombians would not have to be paid – they simply joined methamphetamine with cocaine shipments This fact meant no additional money was needed for airplanes, pilots, boats and bribes; they used the existing infrastructure to pipeline the new product [85]\n\n\nFirst escape and second arrest\nWhile still in prison in Mexico, Guzmán was indicted in San Diego on U.S charges of money laundering and importing tons of cocaine into California, along with his Sinaloa attorney Humberto Loya-Castro, or Licenciado Perez (\"Lawyer Perez\"), who was charged with bribing Mexican officials on Sinaloa's behalf and making sure that any cartel members arrested were released from custody [88] [101] After a ruling by the Supreme Court of Mexico made extradition between Mexico and the United States easier, Guzmán bribed guards to aid his escape On 19 January 2001, Francisco \"El Chito\" Camberos Rivera, a prison guard, opened Guzmán's electronically operated cell door, and Guzmán got into a laundry cart that maintenance worker Javier Camberos rolled through several doors and eventually out the front door He was then transported in the trunk of a car driven by Camberos out of the town At a petrol station, Camberos went inside, but when he came back, Guzmán was gone on foot into the night According to officials, 78 people have been implicated in his escape plan [85] Camberos is in prison for his assistance in the escape [14]\n\n\nFirst escape: 2001\nWhile still in prison in Mexico, Guzmán was indicted in San Diego on U.S charges of money laundering and importing tons of cocaine into California, along with his Sinaloa attorney Humberto Loya-Castro, or Licenciado Perez (\"Lawyer Perez\"), who was charged with bribing Mexican officials on Sinaloa's behalf and making sure that any

escape [14]\n\n\nManhunt: 2001–2014\nSince his 2001 escape from prison, Guzmán had wanted to control the Ciudad Juárez crossing points, which were in the hands of the Carrillo Fuentes family of the Juárez Cartel [85] Despite a high degree of mistrust between the two organizations, the Sinaloa and Juárez cartels had a working agreement at the time Guzmán convened a meeting in Monterrey with Ismael Zambada García (\"El Mayo\"), Juan José Esparragoza Moreno (\"El Azul\") and Arturo Beltrán Leyva In this meeting, they discussed killing Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes, who was in charge of the Juárez Cartel at the time On 11 September 2004, Rodolfo, his wife and two young children were visiting a Culiacán shopping mall While leaving the mall, escorted by police commander Pedro Pérez López, the family was ambushed by members of Los Negros, assassins for the Sinaloa Cartel Rodolfo and his wife were killed; the policeman survived [85]\n\n\nMexican cartel wars\nSince his 2001 escape from

Sinaloa Cartel Rodolfo and his wife were killed; the policeman survived [85]\n\n\nConflict with Beltrán Leyva Cartel\nA Newsweek investigation alleges that one of Guzmán's techniques for maintaining his dominance among cartels included giving information to the DEA and U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement that led to the arrests of his enemies in the Juárez Cartel, in addition to information that led to the arrests of some of the top Sinaloa leaders [88] The arrests were speculated by some to have been part of a deal Guzmán struck with Calderón and the DEA, in which he intentionally gave up some of his purported Sinaloa colleagues to U.S agents in exchange for immunity from prosecution, while perpetuating the idea that the Calderón government was heavily pursuing his organization during the cartel crackdown [107]\n\n\nFirst manhunt\nGuzmán was known among drug lords for his longevity and evasion of authorities, assisted by alleged bribes to federal, state and local Mexican officials [11] [14] [114] Despite the progress made in arresting others in the aftermath of Guzmán's escape, including a handful of his foremost logistics and security men, the huge military and federal police manhunt failed to capture Guzmán for years In the years between his escape and capture, he was Mexico's most-wanted man [115] His elusiveness from law enforcement made him a near-legendary figure in Mexico's narcotics folklore; stories abounded that Guzmán sometimes strolled into restaurants, his bodyguards confiscating peoples' cellphones, he ate his meal, and then left after paying everyone's tab [116] Rumors circulated of Guzmán being seen in different parts of Mexico and abroad [117] For more than thirteen years, Mexican security forces coordinated many operations to re-arrest him, but their efforts were largely in vain as Guzmán appeared to be steps ahead from his captors [118]\n\n\nSecond arrest: 2014\nAlthough Guzmán had hidden for long periods in remote areas of the Sierra Madre mountains without being captured, the arrested members of his security team told the military he had begun venturing out to Culiacán and the beach town of Mazatlán [99] A week before he was caught, Guzmán and Zambada were reported to have attended a family reunion in Sinaloa [125] On 16 February 2014, the Mexican military followed the bodyguards' tips to Guzmán's former wife's house, but they had trouble ramming the steel-reinforced front door, which allowed Guzmán to escape through a system of secret tunnels that connected six houses, eventually moving south to Mazatlán [99] He had planned to stay a few days in Mazatlán to see his twin baby daughters before retreating to the mountains [126]\n\n\nReactions\nMexican Secretary of the Interior Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong was hosting a reunion with Mexico's ambassadors and consuls when he received a notice from the President on Guzmán's capture [237] He returned a few moments later with Secretary of National Defense Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, Secretary of Navy Vidal Francisco Soberón Sanz and Secretary of Foreign Affairs Claudia Ruiz Massieu [237] Osorio Chong then announced the capture to the diplomats by reading the President's tweet which resulted in applause and chants of Viva México, Viva el Presidente Peña and Viva las Fuerzas Armadas (Long live Mexico, Long live President Peña, Long live our Military Forces) [238] This was followed by a spontaneous rendition of the National Anthem by the crowd [237] [238]\n\n\nCharges and imprisonment\nGuzmán was imprisoned at Federal Social Readaptation Center No 1, area #20, Hallway #1, on the same day of his capture on 22 February 2014 [157] The area where he lived was highly restricted; the cells are without windows, inmates are not allowed to interact with each other, and they are not permitted to contact their family members [158] His cell was close to those of José Jorge Balderas (alias \"El JJ\"), former lieutenant of the Beltrán Leyva Cartel, and Jaime González Durán (alias \"El Hummer\"), a former leader of Los Zetas drug cartel Miguel Ángel Guzmán Loera, one of his brothers, was in one of the other units [159] [160] Guzmán was alone in his cell, and had one bed, one shower, and a single toilet His lawyer was Óscar Quirarte Guzmán was allowed to receive visits from members of his family every nine days from

them [161]\n\n\nSecond escape and third arrest\nOn 11 July 2015, Guzmán escaped from Federal Social Readaptation Center No 1 [189] Guzmán was last seen by security cameras at 20:52 hours near the shower area in his cell The shower area was the only part of his cell that was not visible through the security camera [190] [191] After the guards did not see him for twenty-five minutes on surveillance video, personnel went looking for him [192] When they reached his cell, Guzmán was gone It was discovered he had escaped through a tunnel leading from the shower area to a house construction site 1.5 km (0.93 mi) away in a Santa Juanita neighborhood [193] [194] The tunnel lay 10 m (33 ft) deep underground, and Guzmán used a ladder to climb to the bottom The tunnel was 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in) tall and 75 cm (30 in) in width It was equipped with artificial light, air ducts, and high-quality construction materials [190] In addition, a motorcycle was found in the tunnel, which authorities think was used to transport materials and possibly Guzmán himself [195] [196]\n\n\nSecond escape: 2015\nOn 11 July 2015, Guzmán escaped from Federal Social Readaptation Center No 1 [189]

addition, a motorcycle was found in the tunnel, which authorities think was used to transport materials and possibly Guzmán himself [195] [196]\n\n\nSecond manhunt: 2015–2016\nThe escape of Guzmán triggered a wide-range manhunt [197] According to Mexico's National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido García, the manhunt was instituted immediately in the surrounding area by putting up several checkpoints and air searches by helicopter [198] The entire prison was put on lockdown and no one was allowed to enter or leave [199] The search was then extended to other federal entities: Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Morelos, Puebla, Guerrero, Michoacán, Querétaro, Hidalgo and Tlaxcala However, most of the military officers involved in the search were sent to the State of Mexico [200] The Mexican government also issued an international warning to prevent Guzmán from escaping the country through airports, border checkpoints, or ports Interpol and other security organizations

The two have since reconciled, and Jessie accompanied Jones into the cage after he won the heavyweight title at UFC 285 on March 4, 2023. In June 2024, Jones announced that he had been granted 50/50 custody over his son, marking the first time he indicated having a son.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nJones has been criticized for repeatedly poking his opponents in the eyes. In response to the criticism, Jones released a video on Instagram in April 2014 in which he mocked fans by simulating crying and saying \"Jones put his finger in his eye. Dirtiest fighter in MMA.\" After backlash towards the post, Jones deleted it from his account.\n\n**Daniel Cormier Altercation**\n\nDuring a promotional event for UFC 178, on August 4, 2014, Jones and Daniel Cormier briefly scuffled during an on-stage staredown, initiated by Jones pressing his forehead against Cormier's forehead, prompting Cormier to shove Jones by the throat, to which Jones responded by throwing a punch. Both fighters were restrained by coaches and event organizers. UFC chief legal officer Kirk Hendrick said \"there are going to be ramifications.\" In addition, the Nevada State Athletic Commission requested a video copy of the altercation. On September 23, 2014, Jones was fined $50,000 and was ordered to undergo 40 hours of community service by the Nevada Athletic Commission. During the disciplinary hearing, Jones claimed to have lost a six-figure endorsement deal with Nike, but later admitted to fabricating the statement.\n\n**Hit-and-Run Conviction**\n\nOn April 27, 2015, Albuquerque, New Mexico, police stated that Jones was sought in connection with a hit and run early the previous morning. Jones was alleged to have run a red light and crashed his rental car in a collision involving two other vehicles. Jones allegedly fled the scene of the crash on foot, leaving an injured pregnant woman behind in another vehicle. The incident was witnessed by an off-duty police officer who identified the suspect as an African-American man, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, whom he believed to be Jones. According to witnesses, the man described as Jones then returned to the scene to grab cash from the vehicle before fleeing again. Paperwork found in the rental car was under the name of \"Jonathan Jones.\" Inside the silver Buick SUV, law enforcement found a pipe with marijuana inside of it. Though initially wanted for questioning that could have resulted in a simple misdemeanor, Jones's charges were elevated to a felony on April 27 for injuring a person and purposely leaving the scene of an accident.\n\n**Domestic Violence Arrest**\n\nIn the early hours of September 24, 2021, a day after Jones was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame for his fight with Alexander Gustafsson at UFC 165, police were called to the Caesars Palace resort hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, responding to a domestic incident. According to a police report obtained by news site MMA Fighting, a 9-1-1 call was made by a hotel security guard when Jones's youngest daughter requested help, claiming there was a domestic incident between Jones and his fiancée, Jessie Moses. Cops arrived in minutes, cutting Jones off as he was attempting to flee the scene. Officers detained Jones and began to investigate the situation. While officers detained Jones, others went to the room to further investigate and get Moses's side of the story. When they arrived at the room, they observed her with blood on her face and clothing, and with a bump on her lip, consistent with someone who had been struck. Moses stated that Jones had left the hotel to go out with friends while Moses and their children went to sleep, and that when Jones returned, he was belligerent, became agitated, and pulled her hair. She claimed that the hair pulling was the extent of the physicality between the two, and that the blood on her face and clothing was from chapped lips. She also declined a temporary protective order against Jones. Police stated that while he was being detained, a belligerent Jones headbutted the hood of the patrol vehicle, leaving a dent, had made threats and challenged the arresting officers to a fight, and had said he could break free from the handcuffs. Jones did not follow through with his threats, however, and was placed under arrest peacefully after the investigation concluded. He was taken to the Clark County jail where he was charged with one count of domestic battery, a misdemeanor, and one count of tampering with a police vehicle, a felony. His bail was set at $16,000.\n\n**Other Legal Troubles**\n\nIn the early morning of May 19, 2012, Jones drove his Bentley Continental GT into a pole in Binghamton, New York. Jones was arrested for driving under the influence (DWI) and was bailed out by his mother. He pleaded guilty to DUI charges and was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine, install ignition interlocks on all of his vehicles, complete a victims impact class, and had his driver's license suspended for six months.\n\n**Failed Drug Tests**\n\nOn January 6, 2015, it was announced that Jones failed a drug test prior to UFC 182. He tested positive for benzoylecgonine, the primary metabolite of cocaine. Because benzoylecgonine is not banned out-of-competition by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the NSAC could not halt Jones from participating during UFC 182. He was randomly tested on December 3, 2014, and results came back on December 23. A week after his first test, Jones was tested again. He passed the second test, which meant that the cocaine metabolite was out of his system before the fight. When the news was made public, Jones went into rehab for one night. He was fined $25,000 on January 17 for violating the UFC's Athlete Code of Conduct policy. On January 19, 2015, Jones was interviewed for the first time since the failed drug test and said: \"...I'm not a cocaine addict by any means or not even a frequent user. I just made a really dumb decision and got caught with my pants down in this whole situation.\"\n\n**UFC 200**\n\nOn July 8, 2016, a urine sample from Jones tested positive for two banned substances, clomiphene, an anti-estrogen substance, and letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, prior to his scheduled championship bout with Cormier at UFC 200. The violation was from an \"A\" sample collection on June 16, with subsequent testing of the B sample confirming the doping. Both drugs, which are on the World Anti-Doping Agency banned substances list, are described as \"hormone and metabolic modulators,\" which are not allowed to be used in or out of competition. As a result, Jones had to withdraw from the event, and was replaced by former middleweight champion Anderson Silva. Throughout the ordeal, Jones maintained his innocence, claiming that he was the victim of a contaminated product that he believed to be Cialis, which was later independently obtained, tested, and found to be contaminated by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). On November 7, 2016, it was announced that Jones was issued a one-year suspension by USADA following his arbitration hearing, though the panel concluded that Jones did not take the banned substances intentionally, and was not a drug cheat.\n\n**UFC 214**\n\nOn August 22, 2017, it was announced that Jones was flagged for a potential doping violation by USADA, stemming from his test sample that was collected on July 28, one day before his rematch against Cormier at UFC 214. He tested positive for Turinabol, an anabolic steroid, and was placed on a provisional suspension as a result of the positive drug test. On September 13, the CSAC announced that it had overturned the result of the fight with Cormier from a KO victory for Jones to a 'no contest,' after both Jones's A and B samples tested positive for Turinabol. Jones was also stripped of the title for a third time, and it was then returned to Cormier.\n\n**UFC 232**\n\nJones became eligible to fight again on October 28, 2018, and was scheduled to fight against Alexander Gustafsson at UFC 232 in Las Vegas on December 29. However, after further inconsistencies arose with his drug test on December 23, he was not granted a license to compete in Nevada, so the event was moved to Los Angeles. In order to receive a license from CSAC, Jones had to enroll into the VADA (Voluntary Anti-Doping Association) testing program, thus making him the first UFC fighter to be signed to both USADA and VADA testing programs simultaneously. Drug tests administered at UFC 232 found an ultra-trace amount of turinabol, which doctors attributed to a long-term \"pulsing effect\" of the M3 metabolite detected in 2017. CSAC did not take disciplinary action against Jones as the medical experts stated that there was no evidence that Jones had re-administered a banned substance and no performance-enhancing benefits were gained.\n\n**Championships and Accomplishments**\n\nJones has held the following titles:\n\n* UFC Light Heavyweight Championship (three times)\n* UFC Heavyweight Championship (one time)\n* NJCAA

Born on October 31, 1862, in Mile End, London, Chapman was the fifth of seven children to Samuel Chapman, a brewer's servant, and Sarah Ann Mackenzie.\n\n**About Sarah Chapman**\n\nChapman's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. Her family lived in London's East End, an area notorious for its overcrowding, poor sanitation, and limited access to education and employment opportunities. Despite these challenges, Chapman's family instilled in her a strong work ethic and a determination to improve their circumstances.\n\nBy the age of 19, Chapman had joined her mother and elder sister in working as a matchmaking machinist at Bryant & May, a prominent match factory in London. The work was grueling and poorly paid, but it provided a steady income and allowed Chapman to contribute to her family's well-being.\n\n**Leadership of the Matchgirls' Strike**\n\nIn June 1888, a meeting of the Fabian Society, a socialist organization founded by George Bernard Shaw and Sidney Webb, agreed to a proposed boycott of Bryant & May matches in response to the poor factory conditions and mistreatment of workers. Chapman, who had become an established member of the factory workforce, was instrumental in organizing the strike.\n\nThe matchgirls, mostly young women between the ages of 13 and 25, were subjected to poor working conditions, long hours, and low wages. They were also forced to work in a poorly ventilated environment, exposed to hazardous chemicals and dust. The matchgirls' strike, as it became known, was a response to these inhumane conditions and the factory owners' refusal to improve them.\n\nChapman and other strike leaders, including Annie Besant and Ursula North, played a crucial role in organizing the workers and negotiating with the factory owners. The strike lasted for several weeks, during which time the matchgirls and their supporters picketed the factory, distributed leaflets, and held public meetings to raise awareness about the issue.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nSince 2019, a charitable organization called The Matchgirls Memorial has sought to raise awareness of the matchgirls' strike and its participants. The organization has received donations for the creation of a headstone for Sarah Chapman and aims to erect a statue in commemoration of strikers and organizers.\n\nThe matchgirls' strike of 1888 marked a significant turning point in the history of labor rights in the United Kingdom. It highlighted the need for better working conditions, higher wages, and greater protections for workers. The strike also demonstrated the power of collective action and the importance of worker solidarity in achieving social change.\n\n**Popular Culture**\n\nSarah Chapman appears as a character in the 2022 Netflix film Enola Holmes 2, played by actress Hannah Dodd. The film provides a fictionalized account of the origins of the Matchgirls' Strike, in which both the title character and her brother Sherlock become entangled.\n\nThe film, while not entirely accurate in its depiction of the strike, highlights the bravery and determination of the matchgirls and their leaders. It also underscores the significance of the strike in shaping the labor movement and promoting social justice.\n\nIn conclusion, Sarah Chapman was a pioneering figure in the matchgirls' strike of 1888, a pivotal event in the history of labor rights in the United Kingdom. Her courage, leadership, and commitment to social justice continue to inspire people today, and her legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of collective action and worker solidarity in achieving social change.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sarah_Chapman\" following this outline:\n\n\nAbout Sarah Chapman\nSarah Chapman was born on 31 October 1862, the fifth of seven children born to Samuel Chapman, a brewer's servant, and Sarah Ann Mackenzie [1] Her early life was spent in Mile End, [1] and Chapman would live her whole life in London's East End [5] By 19, alongside her mother and elder sister, Sarah was employed as a matchmaking machinist at Bryant & May By the time of the 1888 strike, Sarah Chapman occupied a comparably well-waged position at the Bryant & May factory and was an established member of its workforce [1]\n\n\nLeadership of the matchgirls' strike\nIn June 1888, at a meeting of the Fabian Society, members agreed to a proposed boycott of Bryant & May matches in response to the poor factory conditions and mistreatment of workers [3]\n\n\nLegacy\nSince 2019, a charitable organisation called The Matchgirls Memorial have sought to raise awareness of the matchgirls' strike and its participants [6] [12] Donations were received for the creation of a headstone for Sarah Chapman, [13] and the charity aims to erect a statue in commemoration of strikers and organisers [9]\n\n\nPopular culture\nChapman appears as a character in the 2022 Netflix film Enola Holmes 2, played by actress Hannah Dodd The film provides a fictionalized account of the origins of the Matchgirls' Strike, in which both the title character and her brother Sherlock become entangled [20]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The beer has a long history dating back to 1924, and its name is derived from the town of Castlemaine, Victoria, where the company was founded in 1857.\n\n**Beers**\n\nCurrently sold brands include:\n\n* XXXX Bitter (3.5% ABV)\n* XXXX Draught (4.0% ABV)\n* XXXX Gold (3.5% ABV)\n* XXXX Premium (4.5% ABV)\n* XXXX Summer (3.5% ABV)\n* XXXX Stout (4.5% ABV)\n\n**History**\n\nThe XXXX brand was launched in 1924 by Castlemaine Brewers, named after the town of Castlemaine, Victoria where the company was founded in 1857. The company was originally known as the Castlemaine Brewery, and it produced its first beer in 1857. The yellow-and-red label still bears the town's name, and the brewery's logo has remained largely unchanged since its introduction. XXXX has been brewed in the Castlemaine Perkins Milton Brewery since its introduction, and has featured an artist's sketch (later very stylised) of its brewery on the label of beer bottles and cans. In the 1950s, the prominent 'XXXX' illuminated sign was erected on the brewery.\n\nThe 'XXXX' name itself refers to a traditional grading system for strong beer. In Australia, beer was graded according to its strength, with 'XXXX' being the highest grade. This grading system was used until the 1970s, when it was replaced by the modern ABV (Alcohol by Volume) system.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nXXXX was brewed under licence in the UK by InBev Ltd until 2009. It was commonly available in cans in British off licences and sometimes on tap in British pubs. At 3.7% ABV, the British brewed XXXX was somewhat weaker than most of the Australian variants. Castlemaine XXXX was withdrawn from the UK at the end of June 2009 when InBev's licensing agreement expired.\n\n**Iconography, advertising and brand recognition**\n\nXXXX's mascot is Mr Fourex - a jovial cartoon man in a suit with a boater hat, who features on the City side of the Fourex Brewery at Milton. Conceived in 1924, he is said to be modelled after Paddy Fitzgerald, a former director of the company who started circa 1933. A second theory is that the cartoon is modelled on a well-known dwarf who sold newspapers in the inner city suburb of Fortitude Valley in the late 1920s. The true identity for the inspiration behind the cartoon remains a mystery.\n\nMr Fourex has become an iconic symbol of the XXXX brand, and is widely recognized by Australians and beer enthusiasts around the world. The character's jolly personality and distinctive appearance have made him a beloved figure in Australian popular culture.\n\n**Sports sponsorship campaigns**\n\nXXXX is the major sponsor of the Queensland Maroons in the rugby league State of Origin series. The company has a long history of supporting sports in Queensland, and has been a major sponsor of the Maroons since the 1980s.

performances In the Floralia, Ovid says that hares and goats were released as part of the festivities Persius writes that crowds were pelted with vetches, beans, and lupins A ritual called the Florifertum was performed on either 27 April or 3 May, [8] [9] during which a bundle of wheat ears was carried into a shrine, though it is not clear if this devotion was made to Flora or Ceres [10]

ceremony they called \"burning out the witches\" The church bells were rung and people made as much noise as possible by shouting, banging pots and pans, ringing bells and cracking whips Men carried

traditionally considered a holiday of love and May as a month of love The celebrations of spring are held on 30 April when a maypole (\"májka\" in Czech) is erected—a tradition possibly connected to Beltane, since bonfires are also lit on the same day The event is similar to German Walpurgisnacht, its public holiday on 30 April.\nOn 31 May, the maypole is taken down in an event called Maypole Felling.\n\n\nEngland\nTraditional English May Day rites and celebrations include crowning a May Queen and celebrations involving a maypole, around which dancers often circle with ribbons Morris dancing is also often performed as part of May Day celebrations [33] The earliest records of maypole celebrations date to the 14th century, and by the 15th century the maypole tradition was well established in southern Britain [18] The tradition persists into the 21st century across the UK The village of Ansty in Wiltshire has a maypole that has stood in the middle of a road junction in the village since before 1881; [citation needed] it continues in use every May Day, having been replaced by a less tall pole in the 1990s [34] Centenary Green part of the Octavia Hill Birthplace House, Wisbech has a flagpole which converts into a Maypole each year, used by local schools and other groups [35] Records from the early 1730s indicate that May Day was the date the new Mayor of Norwich was elected \"for the ensuring year\" The \"Day of Swearing\" occurred the following month - June - which saw the Mayor Elect  receive his chains of office [36]\n\n\nEstonia\nMay Day or \"Spring Day\" (Kevadpüha) is a national holiday in Estonia celebrating the arrival of spring.\n\n\nFinland\nIn Finland, Walpurgis night (Vappu) (\"Vappen\") is one of the five biggest holidays along with Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, Easter (Pääsiäinen), and Midsummer (Juhannus - Midsommar) [45] Walpurgis witnesses the biggest carnival-style festival held in Finland's cities and towns The celebrations, which begin on the evening of 30 April and continue on 1 May, typically centre on the consumption of sima, sparkling wine and other alcoholic beverages Student traditions, particularly those of engineering students, are one of the main characteristics of Vappu Since the end of the 19th century, this traditional upper-class feast has been appropriated by university students Many lukio (university-preparatory high school) alumni wear the black and white student cap and many higher education students wear student coveralls One tradition is to drink sima, a home-made low-alcohol mead, along with freshly cooked funnel cakes.\n\n\nFrance\nOn 1 May 1561, King Charles IX of France received a lily of the valley as a lucky charm He decided to offer a lily of the valley each year to the ladies of the court At the beginning of the 20th century, it became custom to give a sprig of lily of the valley, a symbol of springtime, on 1 May The government permits individuals and workers' organisations to sell them tax-free on that single day Nowadays, people may present loved ones either with bunches of lily of the valley or dog rose flowers [46]\n\n\nGreece\n1 May is a day that celebrates Spring.\n\n\nHungary\nIn Hungary it is called St Philip and Jacob's day or sometimes Zöldfarsang However, contrary to the name, the ecclesiastical explanation of the feast actually refers to the miracle of St Walpurga In contrast, the Hexennacht tradition has survived in only a few places, with witchcraft traditions usually taking place on other days.\n\n\nItaly\nIn Italy it is called Calendimaggio or cantar maggio a seasonal feast held to celebrate the arrival of spring The event takes its name from the period in which it takes place, that is, the beginning of May, from the Latin kalendae maiae The Calendimaggio is a tradition still alive today in many regions of Italy as an allegory of the return to life and rebirth: among these Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna (for example, is celebrated in the area of the Quattro Province or Piacenza, Pavia, Alessandria and Genoa), Tuscany and Umbria This magical-propitiatory ritual is often performed during an almsgiving in which, in exchange for gifts (traditionally eggs, wine, food or sweets), the Maggi (or maggerini) sing auspicious verses to the inhabitants of the houses they visit Throughout the Italian peninsula these Il Maggio couplets are very diverse—most are love songs with a strong romantic theme, that young people sang to celebrate the arrival of spring Roman families traditionally eat pecorino with fresh fava beans during an excursion in the Roman Campagna Symbols of spring revival are the trees (alder, golden rain) and flowers (violets, roses), mentioned in the verses of the songs, and with which the maggerini adorn themselves In particular the plant alder, which grows along the rivers, is considered the symbol of life and that's why it is often present in the ritual.\n\n\nPortugal\n\"Maias\" is a superstition throughout Portugal, with special focus on the northern territories and rarely elsewhere Maias is the dominant naming in Northern Portugal, but it may be referred to by other names, including Dia das Bruxas (Witches' day), O Burro (the Donkey, referring to an evil spirit) or the last of April, as the local traditions preserved to this day occur on that evening only People put the yellow flowers of broom, the bushes are known as giestas The flowers of the bush are known as Maias, which are placed on doors or gates and every doorway of houses, windows, granaries, currently also cars, which the populace collect on the evening of 30 April when the Portuguese brooms are blooming, to defend those places from bad spirits, witches and the evil eye The placement of the May flower or bush in the doorway must be done before midnight.\n\n\nRomania\nOn May Day, the Romanians celebrate the arminden (or armindeni), the beginning of summer, symbolically tied with the protection of crops and farm animals The name comes from Slavonic Jeremiinŭ dĭnĭ, meaning prophet Jeremiah's day, but the celebration rites and habits of this day are apotropaic and pagan (possibly originating in the cult of the god Pan).\n\n\nSerbia\n\"Prvomajski uranak\" (Reveille on 1 May) is a folk tradition and feast that consists of the fact that on 1 May, people go in the nature or even leave the day before and spend the night with a camp fire Most of the time, a dish is cooked in a kettle or in a barbecue Among Serbs this holiday is widespread Almost every town in Serbia has its own traditional first-of-may excursion sites, and most often these are green areas outside the city [49]\n\n\nSpain\nMay Day is celebrated throughout the country as Los Mayos (lit \"the Mays\") often in a similar way to \"Fiesta de las Cruces\" in many parts of Hispanic America One such example, in Galicia, is the festival \"Fiesta de los Mayos\" (or \"Festa dos Maios\" in Galician, the local language) It has a Celtic origin (from the festivity of Beltane) [50] and consists of different traditions, such as representations around a decorated tree or sculpture People sing popular songs (also called maios,) making mentions of social and political events during the past year, sometimes under the form of a converse, while they walk around the sculpture with the percussion of two sticks In Lugo [51] and in the village of Vilagarcía de Arousa [52] it was usual to ask a tip to the attendees, which used to be a handful of dry chestnuts (castañas maiolas), walnuts or hazelnuts Today the tradition became a competition where the best sculptures and songs receive a prize [53]\n\n\nNorth America\nMay Day is celebrated in some parts of the provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario.\n\n\nCanada\nMay Day is celebrated in some parts of the provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario.\n\n\nUnited States\n\nEarly European settlers of the Americas brought their May Day traditions with them, and May Day is still celebrated in many parts of the United States, with customs that vary from region to region In some parts of the United States, May baskets are made These are small baskets usually filled with flowers or treats and left at someone's doorstep The giver rings the bell and runs away [56]

is similar to German Walpurgisnacht, its public holiday on 30 April.\nOn 31 May, the maypole is taken down in an event called Maypole Felling.\n\n\nEngland\nTraditional English May Day rites and celebrations include crowning a May Queen and celebrations involving a maypole, around which dancers often circle with ribbons Morris dancing is also often performed as part of May Day celebrations [33] The earliest records of maypole celebrations date to the 14th century, and by the 15th century the maypole tradition was well established in southern Britain [18] The tradition persists into the 21st century across the UK The village of Ansty in Wiltshire has a maypole that has stood in the middle of a road junction in the village since before 1881; [citation needed] it continues in use every May Day, having been replaced by a less tall pole in the 1990s [34] Centenary Green part of the Octavia Hill Birthplace House, Wisbech has a flagpole which converts into a Maypole each year, used by local schools and other groups [35] Records from the early 1730s indicate that May Day was the date the new Mayor of Norwich was elected \"for the ensuring year\" The \"Day of Swearing\" occurred the following month - June - which saw the Mayor Elect  receive his chains of office [36]\n\n\nEstonia\nMay Day or \"Spring Day\" (Kevadpüha) is a national holiday in Estonia celebrating the arrival of spring.\n\n\nFinland\nIn Finland, Walpurgis night (Vappu) (\"Vappen\") is one of the five biggest holidays along with Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, Easter (Pääsiäinen), and Midsummer (Juhannus - Midsommar) [45] Walpurgis witnesses the biggest carnival-style festival held in Finland's cities and towns The celebrations, which begin on the evening of 30 April and continue on 1 May, typically centre on the consumption of sima, sparkling wine and other alcoholic beverages Student traditions, particularly those of engineering students, are one of the main characteristics of Vappu Since the end of the 19th century, this traditional upper-class feast has been appropriated by university students Many lukio (university-preparatory high school) alumni wear the black and white student cap and many higher education students wear student coveralls One tradition is to drink sima, a home-made low-alcohol mead, along with freshly cooked funnel cakes.\n\n\nFrance\nOn 1 May 1561, King Charles IX of France received a lily of the valley as a lucky charm He decided to offer a lily of the valley each year to the ladies of the court At the beginning of the 20th century, it became custom to give a sprig of lily of the valley, a symbol of springtime, on 1 May The government permits individuals and workers' organisations to sell them tax-free on that single day Nowadays, people may present loved ones either with bunches of lily of the valley or dog rose flowers [46]\n\n\nGreece\n1 May is a day that celebrates Spring.\n\n\nHungary\nIn Hungary it is called St Philip and Jacob's day or sometimes Zöldfarsang However, contrary to the name, the ecclesiastical explanation of the feast actually refers to the miracle of St Walpurga In contrast, the Hexennacht tradition has survived in only a few places, with witchcraft traditions usually taking place on other days.\n\n\nItaly\nIn Italy it is called Calendimaggio or cantar maggio a seasonal feast held to celebrate the arrival of spring The event takes its name from the period in which it takes place, that is, the beginning of May, from the Latin kalendae maiae The Calendimaggio is a tradition still alive today in many regions of Italy as an allegory of the return to life and rebirth: among these Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna (for example, is celebrated in the area of the Quattro Province or Piacenza, Pavia, Alessandria and Genoa), Tuscany and Umbria This magical-propitiatory ritual is often performed during an almsgiving in which, in exchange for gifts (traditionally eggs, wine, food or sweets), the Maggi (or maggerini) sing auspicious verses to the inhabitants of the houses they visit Throughout the Italian peninsula these Il Maggio couplets are very diverse—most are love songs with a strong romantic theme, that young people sang to celebrate the arrival of spring Roman families traditionally eat pecorino with fresh fava beans during an excursion in the Roman Campagna Symbols of spring revival are the trees (alder, golden rain) and flowers (violets, roses), mentioned in the verses of the songs, and with which the maggerini adorn themselves In particular the plant alder, which grows along the rivers, is considered the symbol of life and that's why it is often present in the ritual.\n\n\nPortugal\n\"Maias\" is a superstition throughout Portugal, with special focus on the northern territories and rarely elsewhere Maias is the dominant naming in Northern Portugal, but it may be referred to by other names, including Dia das Bruxas (Witches' day), O Burro (the Donkey, referring to an evil spirit) or the last of April, as the local traditions preserved to this day occur on that evening only People put the yellow flowers of broom, the bushes are known as giestas The flowers of the bush are known as Maias, which are placed on doors or gates and every doorway of houses, windows, granaries, currently also cars, which the populace collect on the evening of 30 April when the Portuguese brooms are blooming, to defend those places from bad spirits, witches and the evil eye The placement of the May flower or bush in the doorway must be done before midnight.\n\n\nRomania\nOn May Day, the Romanians celebrate the arminden (or armindeni), the beginning of summer, symbolically tied with the protection of crops and farm animals The name comes from Slavonic Jeremiinŭ dĭnĭ, meaning prophet Jeremiah's day, but the celebration rites and habits of this day are apotropaic and pagan (possibly originating in the cult of the god Pan).\n\n\nSerbia\n\"Prvomajski uranak\" (Reveille on 1 May) is a folk tradition and feast that consists of the fact that on 1 May, people go in the nature or even leave the day before and spend the night with a camp fire Most of the time, a dish is cooked in a kettle or in a barbecue Among Serbs this holiday is widespread Almost every town in Serbia has its own traditional first-of-may excursion sites, and most often these are green areas outside the city [49]\n\n\nSpain\nMay Day is celebrated throughout the country as Los Mayos (lit \"the Mays\") often in a similar way to \"Fiesta de las Cruces\" in many parts of Hispanic America One such example, in Galicia, is the festival \"Fiesta de los Mayos\" (or \"Festa dos Maios\" in Galician, the local language) It has a Celtic origin (from the festivity of Beltane) [50] and consists of different traditions, such as representations around a decorated tree or sculpture People sing popular songs (also called maios,) making mentions of social and political events during the past year, sometimes under the form of a converse, while they walk around the sculpture with the percussion of two sticks In Lugo [51] and in the village of Vilagarcía de Arousa [52] it was usual to ask a tip to the attendees, which used to be a handful of dry chestnuts (castañas maiolas), walnuts or hazelnuts Today the tradition became a competition where the best sculptures and songs receive a prize [53]\n\n\nNorth America\nMay Day is celebrated in some parts of the provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario.\n\n\nCanada\nMay Day is celebrated in some parts of the provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario.\n\n\nUnited States\n\nEarly European settlers of the Americas brought their May Day traditions with them, and May Day is still celebrated in many parts of the United States, with customs that vary from region to region In some parts of the United States, May baskets are made These are small baskets usually filled with flowers or treats and left at someone's doorstep The giver rings the bell and runs away [56] [57]\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) =

He is an ethnic Tajik, and his family has a long history of involvement in Afghan politics. Saleh spent much of his childhood in the capital city of Kabul, where he was educated at a local school. However, his family's financial situation deteriorated when he was orphaned at the age of 7, and he was forced to rely on the charity of local residents to survive.\n\nDespite the challenges he faced, Saleh was able to pursue his education and eventually became a member of the mujahideen forces that fought against the Soviet-backed government in the 1980s. He received military training in neighboring Pakistan and fought under the command of Ahmad Shah Massoud, a legendary mujahideen leader.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, Saleh returned to Kabul and began to build a career in politics. He worked as an advisor to various government officials, including President Hamid Karzai, and eventually became the head of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) in 2004. Saleh played a key role in rebuilding the NDS, which had been severely damaged during the Soviet occupation.\n\nAs head of the NDS, Saleh implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving the agency's effectiveness and reducing corruption. He also worked closely with international partners, including the United States and other NATO countries, to develop new strategies for combating terrorism and extremism.\n\nSaleh's work with the NDS earned him international recognition, and he was widely praised for his efforts to rebuild the agency and improve Afghanistan's security situation.

Saleh criticized Karzai's approach, which he saw as a \"fatal mistake\" that could lead to civil war.\n\nSaleh's comments were seen as a significant challenge to Karzai's authority, and they sparked a heated debate in the Afghan government and media. However, Saleh's warnings were echoed by many other Afghan officials and experts, who saw the Taliban as a significant threat to the country's stability and security.\n\n**As Interior Minister**\n\nIn December 2018, President Ashraf Ghani appointed Saleh as the new Interior Minister, in a major shake-up of the government's security positions.

He is known for his versatility in a wide range of film and television roles, including the Netflix series \"Altered Carbon\" and the DC Extended Universe movie \"Suicide Squad\".\n\n**Early Life**\n\nCharles Joel Nordström Kinnaman was born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden, to a Swedish mother, Bitte (Nordström), a therapist, and an American-born Swedish father, Steve Kinnaman (originally David Kinnaman). Kinnaman's father, who was drafted during the Vietnam War, deserted the military from his base in Bangkok. This unusual upbringing has shaped Kinnaman's perspective on life and his approach to his acting career.\n\nKinnaman is a dual citizen of Sweden and the United States, a reflection of his mixed heritage. His family's diverse background has given him a unique cultural understanding, which he believes has influenced his acting choices.\n\n**Career**\n\nKinnaman began his acting career as a child actor in the Swedish soap opera \"Storstad\" (1990). His older sister was dating one of the show's directors, and he was asked to audition for a part on the show. Kinnaman portrayed Felix Lundström in 22 episodes before stepping away from acting. This early experience laid the groundwork for his future success in the entertainment industry.\n\nKinnaman's breakthrough role came in 2008 with the Swedish film \"Easy Money,\" which marked his transition to more complex and nuanced characters. This performance earned him critical acclaim and recognition within the Swedish film community.\n\nIn 2014, Kinnaman gained international recognition with his portrayal of Rick Flagg in the DC Extended Universe movie \"Suicide Squad.\" His performance as the tough and rugged soldier garnered praise from fans and critics alike.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nKinnaman grew up with the condition of pectus excavatum, characterized by a caved-in appearance of the chest. To correct this deformity, Kinnaman underwent surgery prior to the filming of \"Altered Carbon,\" inserting two metal bars to push the sternum outward. This procedure has improved his physical appearance and has allowed him to move more comfortably.\n\nKinnaman's personal life has been subject to media scrutiny, particularly in his relationships. In late 2018, he was in a brief romantic relationship with Gabriella Magnusson, which reportedly ended acrimoniously. On August 6, 2021, Kinnaman filed and was granted a temporary restraining order against Magnusson, alleging that she was threatening him in an attempt to extort him.\n\n**Legal Issues**\n\nOn August 11, 2021, the Swedish Prosecution Authority confirmed that Kinnaman had been accused of rape in an ongoing investigation. The investigation was closed without prosecution in October 2022. The details of the case were not made public, and Kinnaman has maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n### Film\n\n* \"Easy Money\" (2008)\n* \"Easy Money II\" (2012)\n* \"Easy Money III\" (2013)\n* \"The Informant\" (2013)\n* \"RoboCop\" (2014)\n* \"Run All Night\" (2015)\n* \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\" (2018)\n* \"Altered Carbon\" (TV series, 2018-2020)\n* \"The Informer\" (2019)\n* \"The Informer\" (TV series, 2020)\n\n### Television\n\n* \"Storstad\" (1990)\n* \"Andra Avenyn\" (2009-2010)\n* \"The Killing\" (2011-2012)\n* \"Altered Carbon\" (TV series, 2018-2020)\n\n### Awards and Nominations\n\n* Guldbagge Award for Best Actor (2013)\n* MTV Movie Award for Best Fight (2014)\n* Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Villain (2014)\n* People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Villain (2015)\n\n**References**\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Joel Kinnaman on IMDb\n* Joel Kinnaman on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joel_Kinnaman\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nCharles Joel Nordström Kinnaman was born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden [4] His mother, Bitte (Nordström), a therapist, is a Swedish citizen [5] [4] His father, Steve Kinnaman (originally David Kinnaman), is an American-born Swede who was drafted during the Vietnam War and deserted the military from his base in Bangkok [6] [7] [8] Kinnaman is a dual citizen of Sweden and the United States [3] [9]\n\n\nCareer\nKinnaman began his acting career as a child actor in Swedish soap opera Storstad (1990) His older sister was dating one of the show's directors, and he asked Kinnaman to audition for a part on the show After portraying Felix Lundström in 22 episodes, he stepped away from acting [21] [22]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKinnaman grew up with the condition of pectus excavatum, with a caved-in appearance of the chest He underwent surgery prior to the filming of Altered Carbon, inserting two metal bars to push the sternum outward in order to correct the deformity [59] [60]\n\n\nLegal issues\nOn 6 August 2021, Kinnaman filed and was granted a temporary restraining order against Gabriella Magnusson, whom he alleged was threatening him in an attempt to extort him after they had been in a brief romantic relationship in late 2018 [69] [70] Magnusson denied trying to extort Kinnaman [71] On 11 August 2021, the Swedish Prosecution Authority confirmed that Kinnaman had been accused of rape in an ongoing investigation [71]  The investigation was closed without prosecution in October 2022 [72]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "David_Attenborough", "content": "\nLife and family\nDavid Frederick Attenborough was born on 8 May 1926 in Isleworth, Middlesex, [6] [7] and grew up in College House on the campus of the University of Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal [8] He is the middle of three sons; his elder brother, Richard, became an actor and director, and his younger brother, John, was an executive at the Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo [9] During the Second World War, through a British volunteer network known as the Refugee Children's Movement, his parents also fostered two Jewish refugee girls from Germany [10]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter leaving the navy, Attenborough took a position editing children's science textbooks for a publishing company He soon became disillusioned with the work and in 1950 applied for a job as a radio talk producer with the BBC [24] Although he was rejected for this job, his CV later attracted the interest of Mary Adams, head of the Talks (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC's fledgling television service [25] Attenborough, like most Britons at that time, did not own a television, and he had seen only one programme in his life [26]\n\n\nEarly years at the BBC\nAfter leaving the navy, Attenborough took a position editing children's science textbooks for a publishing company He soon became disillusioned with the work and in 1950 applied for a job as a radio talk producer with the BBC [24] Although he was rejected for this job, his CV later attracted the interest of Mary Adams, head of the Talks (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC's fledgling television service [25] Attenborough, like most Britons at that time, did not own a television, and he had seen only one programme in his life [26]\n\n\nBBC administration\nAttenborough became Controller of BBC Two in March 1965, succeeding Michael Peacock [31] He had a clause inserted in his contract that would allow him to continue making programmes on an occasional basis Later the same year he filmed elephants in Tanzania, and in 1969 he made a three-part series on the cultural history of the Indonesian island of Bali For the 1971 film A Blank on the Map, he joined the first Western expedition to a remote highland valley in New Guinea to seek out a lost tribe [32]\n\n\nLife series\nBeginning with Life on Earth in 1979, Attenborough set about creating a body of work which became a benchmark of quality in wildlife film-making, and influenced a generation of documentary film-makers The series established many of the hallmarks of the BBC's natural history output By treating his subject seriously and researching the latest discoveries, Attenborough and his production team gained the trust of scientists, who responded by allowing him to feature their subjects in his programmes [48]\n\n\nBeyond Life on Earth\nAlongside the Life series, Attenborough continued to work on other television documentaries, mainly in the natural history genre He wrote and presented a series on man's influence on the natural history of the Mediterranean Basin, The First Eden, in 1987 Two years later, he demonstrated his passion for fossils in Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives [57] In 1990, he worked on the BBC's Prisoners of Conscience series where he highlighted the case of the Sudanese poet Mahjoub Sharif [58]\n\n\nEnvironmentalist advocacy\nBy the turn of the millennium, Attenborough's authored documentaries were adopting a more overtly environmentalist stance In State of the Planet (2000), he used the latest scientific evidence and interviews with leading scientists and conservationists to assess the impact of human activities on the natural world He later turned to the issues of global warming (The Truth about Climate Change, 2006) and human population growth (How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?, 2009) He contributed a programme which highlighted the plight of endangered species to the BBC's Saving Planet Earth project in 2007, the 50th anniversary of the Natural History Unit [85] [86]\n\n\nViews and advocacy\nAttenborough's programmes have often included references to the impact of human society on the natural world The last episode of The Living Planet, for example, focuses almost entirely on humans' destruction of the environment and ways that it could be stopped or reversed Despite this, he has been criticised for not giving enough prominence to environmental messages In 2018 while promoting Dynasties, he said that repeated messages on threats to wildlife in programming could be a \"turn-off\" to viewers [103]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAttenborough's programmes have often included references to the impact of human society on the natural world The last episode of The Living Planet, for example, focuses almost

while promoting Dynasties, he said that repeated messages on threats to wildlife in programming could be a \"turn-off\" to viewers [103]\n\n\nHuman population\nAttenborough has linked anthropogenic effects on the environment with human population growth [135] [136] [137] He has attracted criticism for his views on human overpopulation [138] and human population control [139] He is a patron of Population Matters, [140] a UK charity advocating for family planning, sustainable consumption and proposed sustainable human population [141] [142] In a 2013 interview with the Radio Times, Attenborough described humans as a \"plague on the Earth\", [143] [144] and described the act of sending food to famine-stricken countries as \"barmy\" for population reasons [139] [145] He called for more debate about human population growth, [139] saying that since he \"first started making programmes 60 years ago, the human population has tripled.\" [146]\n\n\nReligious views\nAttenborough considers himself an agnostic [148] When asked whether his observation of the natural world has given him faith in a creator, he generally responds with some version of this story, making reference to the Onchocerca volvulus parasitic worm:\n\n\nBBC and public service broadcasting\nAttenborough is a lifelong supporter of the BBC, public service broadcasting and the television licence He has said that public service broadcasting \"is one of the things that distinguishes this country and makes me want to live here\", [157] and believes that it is not reducible to individual programmes, but \"can only effectively operate as a network  [...] that measures its success not only by its audience size but by the range of its schedule\" [158]\n\n\nPolitics\nIn 1998, Attenborough described himself as \"a standard, boring left-wing liberal\" and expressed the view that the market economy was \"misery\" [160] In 2013, Attenborough joined the rock guitarists Brian May and Slash in opposing the government's policy on the cull of badgers in the UK by participating in a song dedicated to badgers [162] Attenborough was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in the 2014 referendum on that issue [163] Prior to the 2015 UK general election, Attenborough was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas [164]\n\n\nAchievements, awards and recognition\nHe roamed the globe and shared his discoveries and enthusiasms with his patented semi-whisper way of narrating He talks like he's revealing secrets and draws you in using such simple language that he's instantly understood, making his sense of wonder infectious And when he goes on site to share the screen with one of his subjects, it's magical.\n\n\nHonorary titles\nBy January 2013, Attenborough had collected 32 honorary degrees from British universities, [172] more than any other person [173] [174] In 1980, he was honoured by the Open University, with which he has had a close association throughout his career He has honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Durham University (1982) [175] and the University of Cambridge (1984) [176] and honorary Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the University of Oxford (1988) [176] and the University of Ghent (1997) [177]\n\n\nRecognition\nAttenborough has been featured as the subject of a number of BBC television programmes Life on Air (2002) examined the legacy of his work, and Attenborough the Controller (2002) focused on his time in charge of BBC Two He was also featured prominently in The Way We Went Wild (2004), a series about natural history television presenters, and 100 Years of Wildlife Films (2007), a programme marking the centenary of the nature documentary In 2006, British television viewers were asked to vote for their Favourite Attenborough Moments for a UKTV poll to coincide with the broadcaster's 80th birthday The winning clip showed Attenborough observing the mimicry skills of the superb lyrebird [188]\n\n\nSpecies named after Attenborough\nAt least 20 species and genera, both living and extinct, have been named in Attenborough's honour [197] Plants named after him include an alpine hawkweed (Hieracium attenboroughianum) discovered in the Brecon Beacons, [198] a species of Ecuadorian flowering tree (Blakea attenboroughi), one of the world's largest-pitchered carnivorous plants (Nepenthes attenboroughii), along with a genus of flowering plants (Sirdavidia) [199]\n\n\nAwards\nAs of 2014, he was the only person to have won BAFTA awards for programmes in black and white, colour, high-definition and 3D [275]\n\n\nFilmography\nAttenborough's television credits span eight decades His association with natural history programmes dates back to The Pattern of Animals and Zoo Quest in the early 1950s His most influential work, 1979's Life on Earth, launched a strand of nine authored documentaries with the BBC Natural History Unit which shared the Life strand name and spanned 30 years [276] He narrated the long-running BBC series Wildlife on One In his later career, he provided narration for several high-profile BBC wildlife documentaries, among them The Blue Planet and Planet Earth He became a pioneer in the 3D documentary format with Flying Monsters in 2010 [276]\n\n\nBibliography\nDavid Attenborough's work as an author has strong parallels with his broadcasting career In the 1950s and 1960s, his published work included accounts of his animal collecting expeditions around the world, which became the Zoo Quest series He wrote an accompanying volume to each of his nine Life documentaries, along with books on tribal art and birds of paradise His autobiography, Life on Air, was published in 2002, revised in 2009 and is one of a number of his works which is available as a self-narrated audiobook Attenborough has contributed forewords and introductions to many other works, notably those accompanying Planet Earth, Frozen Planet, Africa and other BBC series he has narrated [277]

His family's close association with the University of Leicester and his father's position as principal provided Attenborough with a unique opportunity to explore the world of science and natural history.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter leaving the navy, Attenborough took a position editing children's science textbooks for a publishing company. However, he soon became disillusioned with the work and in 1950 applied for a job as a radio talk producer with the BBC. Although he was rejected for this job, his CV later attracted the interest of Mary Adams, head of the Talks (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC's fledgling television service. Attenborough, like most Britons at that time, did not own a television, and he had seen only one programme in his life. This marked the beginning of his career in broadcasting, which would span over eight decades.\n\n**Early Years at the BBC**\n\nAttenborough's early years at the BBC were marked by a series of small roles and assignments. He worked on various radio and television programmes, including the BBC's first natural history series, The Pattern of Animals. In the early 1950s, he also presented the popular series Zoo Quest, which followed his adventures as a zookeeper and naturalist. These early years laid the foundation for Attenborough's future success as a broadcaster and naturalist.\n\n**BBC Administration**\n\nIn March 1965, Attenborough became Controller of BBC Two, succeeding Michael Peacock. He had a clause inserted in his contract that would allow him to continue making programmes on an occasional basis. Later the same year, he filmed elephants in Tanzania, and in 1969, he made a three-part series on the cultural history of the Indonesian island of Bali. This marked the beginning of his involvement in the production of high-quality natural history documentaries.\n\n**Life Series**\n\nBeginning with Life on Earth in 1979, Attenborough set about creating a body of work that became a benchmark of quality in wildlife film-making. The series established many of the hallmarks of the BBC's natural history output. By treating his subject seriously and researching the latest discoveries, Attenborough and his production team gained the trust of scientists, who responded by allowing him to feature their subjects in his programmes. The Life series marked a new era in natural history broadcasting and cemented Attenborough's position as a leading figure in the field.\n\n**Beyond Life on Earth**\n\nAlongside the Life series, Attenborough continued to work on other television documentaries, mainly in the natural history genre. He wrote and presented a series on man's influence on the natural history of the Mediterranean Basin, The First Eden, in 1987. Two years later, he demonstrated his passion for fossils in Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives. In 1990, he worked on the BBC's Prisoners of Conscience series, where he highlighted the case of the Sudanese poet Mahjoub Sharif.\n\n**Environmentalist Advocacy**\n\nBy the turn of the millennium, Attenborough's authored documentaries were adopting a more overtly environmentalist stance. In State of the Planet (2000), he used the latest scientific evidence and interviews with leading scientists and conservationists to assess the impact of human activities on the natural world. He later turned to the issues of global warming (The Truth about Climate Change, 2006) and human population growth (How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?, 2009). He contributed a programme which highlighted the plight of endangered species to the BBC's Saving Planet Earth project in 2007, the 50th anniversary of the Natural History Unit.\n\n**Views and Advocacy**\n\nAttenborough's programmes have often included references to the impact of human society on the natural world. The last episode of The Living Planet, for example, focuses almost entirely on humans' destruction of the environment and ways that it could be stopped or reversed. Despite this, he has been criticised for not giving enough prominence to environmental messages. In 2018, while promoting Dynasties, he said that repeated messages on threats to wildlife in programming could be a \"turn-off\" to viewers.\n\n**Environment**\n\nAttenborough's programmes have often included references to the impact of human society on the natural world. The last episode of The Living Planet, for example, focuses almost entirely on humans' destruction of the environment and ways that it could be stopped or reversed. Despite this, he has been criticised for not giving enough prominence to environmental messages.\n\n**Human Population**\n\nAttenborough has linked anthropogenic effects on the environment with human population growth. He has attracted criticism for his views on human overpopulation and human population control. He is a patron of Population Matters, a UK charity advocating for family planning, sustainable consumption, and proposed sustainable human population. In a 2013 interview with the Radio Times, Attenborough described humans as a \"plague on the Earth\" and described the act of sending food to famine-stricken countries as \"barmy\" for population reasons.\n\n**Religious Views**\n\nAttenborough considers himself an agnostic. When asked whether his observation of the natural world has given him faith in a creator, he generally responds with some version of this story, making reference to the Onchocerca volvulus parasitic worm.\n\n**BBC and Public Service Broadcasting**\n\nAttenborough is a lifelong supporter of the BBC, public service broadcasting, and the television licence. He has said that public service broadcasting \"is one of the things that distinguishes this country and makes me want to live here.\" He believes that it is not reducible to individual programmes, but \"can only effectively operate as a network that measures its success not only by its audience size but by the range of its schedule.\"\n\n**Politics**\n\nIn 1998, Attenborough described himself as \"a standard, boring left-wing liberal\" and expressed the view that the market economy was \"misery.\" In 2013, Attenborough joined the rock guitarists Brian May and Slash in opposing the government's policy on the cull of badgers in the UK by participating in a song dedicated to badgers. Attenborough was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in the 2014 referendum on that issue. Prior to the 2015 UK general election, Attenborough was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas.\n\n**Achievements, Awards and Recognition**\n\nBy January 2013, Attenborough had collected 32 honorary degrees from British universities, more than any other person. In 1980, he was honoured by the Open University, with which he has had a close association throughout his career. He has honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Durham University (1982) and the University of Cambridge (1984) and honorary Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the University of Oxford (1988) and the University of Ghent (1997).\n\n**Recognition**\n\nAttenborough has been featured as the subject of a number of BBC television programmes, including Life on Air (2002) and Attenborough the Controller (2002). He was also featured prominently in The Way We Went Wild (2004) and 100 Years of Wildlife Films (2007). In 2006, British television viewers were asked to vote for their Favourite Attenborough Moments for a UKTV poll to coincide with the broadcaster's 80th birthday.\n\n**Species Named after Attenborough**\n\nAt least 20 species and genera, both living and extinct, have been named in Attenborough's honour. Plants named after him include an alpine hawkweed (Hieracium attenboroughianum) discovered in the Brecon Beacons, a species of Ecuadorian flowering tree (Blakea attenboroughi), and a genus of flowering plants (Sirdavidia).\n\n**Awards**\n\nAs of 2014, Attenborough was the only person to have won BAFTA awards for programmes in black and white, colour, high-definition, and 3D.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nAttenborough's television credits span eight decades. His association with natural history programmes dates back to The Pattern of Animals and Zoo Quest in the early 1950s. His most influential work, 1979's Life on Earth, launched a strand of nine authored documentaries with the BBC Natural History Unit which shared the Life strand name and spanned 30 years. He narrated the long-running BBC series Wildlife on One and provided narration for several high-profile BBC wildlife documentaries, among them The Blue Planet and Planet Earth. He became a pioneer in the 3D documentary format with Flying Monsters in 2010.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nDavid Attenborough's work as an author has strong parallels with his broadcasting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, his published work included accounts of his animal collecting expeditions around the world, which became the Zoo Quest series. He wrote an accompanying volume to each of his nine Life documentaries, along with books on tribal art and birds of paradise. His autobiography, Life on Air, was published in 2002, revised in 2009, and is one of a number of his works which is available as a self-narrated audiobook.", "prompt": "Write a complete

{"title": "Amritpal_Singh_(activist)", "content": "\nEarly life\nAmritpal Singh grew up as a resident of Jallupur Khera, a village in the Baba Bakala tehsil of Amritsar district of Punjab, India into the Sandhu clan of Jatt Sikhs He was the youngest of the three children of Tarsem Singh and Balwinder Kaur [39] His family is said to be very religious [12] His uncle Harjit Singh Sandhu was the sarpanch (head of village) for 10 years before moving to the United Kingdom [40] [41]\n\n\nWaris Punjab De\nDuring the farmers' protest, the actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu attempted to broaden the agenda of the agitation into fighting for the \"rights of Punjab\" Amritpal is said to have been a vocal supporter of Sidhu and his role in the agitation [48] Sidhu is alleged to have led a group of farmers to storm the Red Fort in Delhi on the Republic Day of 2021 He was arrested for the action and spent a few months in prison After getting released on bail, he founded the Waris Punjab De (\"Heirs of Punjab\") organisation to fight for what he termed the rights of Punjab [49]\n\n\nSuccession to Deep Sidhu\nAfter the sudden death of Deep Sidhu in February 2022, [54] a letter appeared on a Facebook account of Waris Punjab De on 4 March 2022 appointing Amritpal as the organisation's leader [46] The appointment remains controversial According to some sources, Sidhu had appointed Harnek Singh Uppal as the head of the organisation even while he was alive So Sidhu's death did not make a difference to the organisation A break-away faction of the organisation apparently chose Amritpal as its leader using a \"hacked\" Facebook account, while the original organisation has continued under Uppal (now called the \"Deep Sidhu faction\") [12] [46] [55] Sidhu's family disowned Amritpal and called for an investigation into his antecedents [56]\n\n\nCampaigning and Prachaar\nSoon after his initiation, Amritpal Singh started a campaign to motivate youth to shun drugs and irreligious (patit) lifestyle, calling them to the gurdwaras to receive baptism (amrit-sanchaar) His efforts received praise from religious authorities An official of the Akal Takht said that, whereas normally they would receive around 200 youth for baptism on a Sunday, Amritpal's efforts resulted in over 1,000 people coming Amritpal has visited the outlying regions of Sikhism such as Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan and places in Haryana, and he is also said to have attracted people from far away places such as Delhi, Maharashtra and Jammu [58] [12] [59]\n\n\nDrug rehabilitation\nAmritpal opened up a drug rehab facility and many, such as local journalists Amandeep Sandhu and Sandeep Singh (the latter having interviewed Amritpal in Dubai), attribute his wide popularity to his willingness to tackle social issues head-on, such as the drug problem, when previous governments have failed to solve these issues [63] Drug addiction and abuse are serious issues in Punjab, a study by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in 2022 revealed around 15.4% of the state's population of 30 million were narcotic users [63] [64]\n\n\nEarly controversies\nIn October 2022, in one of his speeches, Amritpal said, \"Jesus who could not save himself, how he will save everyone else?\" which was termed hate speech by members of the Christian community The Christian community staged a four hours-long protest against Amritpal at PAP Chowk for his remarks about Jesus Christ The protesters demanded that an FIR should be lodged against him under 295A of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) for \"hurting religious sentiments and attempting to aggravate communal divisions\" [67] [68] [69]\n\n\nKhalistan and Bhindranwale styling\nAmritpal openly supports the cause of Khalistan, the separatist movement calling for a separate homeland/country for people of Sikh faith He has given several statements in which he openly rallies for Khalistan stating, \"Our aim for Khalistan shouldn't be seen as evil and taboo It should be seen from an intellectual point of view as to what could be its geopolitical benefits It's an ideology and ideology never dies We are not asking for it from Delhi\" He further stated in a separate instance that the Khalistan sentiment will remain in the population and that no one can suppress it [73] He threatened Union Home Minister Amit Shah, saying that he will meet the same fate as Indira Gandhi, who was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984 [74]\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn May 2024, Singh decided to run as an independent candidate for the Khadoor Sahib constituency of Punjab in the Lok Sabha elections His campaign was led by his family and supporters due to his detention in Assam's Dibrugarh Jail under the National Security Act  [78] [79]\n\n\nMember of Parliament\nIn May 2024, Singh decided to run as an independent candidate for the Khadoor Sahib constituency of Punjab in the Lok Sabha elections His campaign was led by his family and supporters due to his detention in Assam's Dibrugarh Jail under the National Security Act  [78] [79]\n\n\nParticipation in violence\nIn November 2022, Sudhir Suri, a Shiv Sena politician was murdered by Sandeep Singh Sunny, who allegedly had a Waris Punjab De sticker on his vehicle Punjab Police placed Amritpal under a preemptive house arrest briefly, as a precautionary measure in anticipation of retaliatory violence against him, although he had no prior connection with Suri nor with the murder After being released from house arrest, Amritpal did an Amrit Parchaar campaign in Haryana [84] [85]\n\n\nAjnala clash\nIn February 2023, a man complained in an Ajnala police station stating he was kidnapped and beaten by the associates of Amritpal An FIR was registered against Amritpal and his associates The police arrested one of his close associates, Lovepreet Singh \"Toofan\" [88] [47]\n\n\nCrackdown and arrest\nOn 18 March, the Punjab Police initiated a crackdown against Waris Punjab De, arresting 78 persons and detaining several others for questioning [d] Amritpal Singh was wanted for attempted murder, obstruction of law enforcement and creating disharmony in society [38] and was reported to be absconding [35] The crackdown happened one day prior to a planned Khalsa Vaheer programme by Amritpal from Muktsar district [95] In the hunt to arrest him, the police have set up road blocks around the region, and were involved in a car chase, but he managed to escape [96] He switched cars and changed clothes to avoid detection during the chase, eventually escaping on a motor cycle He, along with his uncle and an associate, allegedly threatened the family of a sarpanch and forcefully stayed at their house The police recovered the vehicles used and a .315 rifle stashed in one of them The uncle and associate have also been arrested [97] [98] [99]\n\n\nAllegations and charges\nIndian intelligence agencies allege that he has links to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence and global Khalistan terror groups [116] He has been trained by the ISI in Georgia to execute a separatist agenda, according to them [20] [117] Photographs of Khalistani flags, emblems, currency, guns marked \"A.K.F\" (Anandpur Khalsa Fauj), videos of firing range and WhatsApp groups of A.K.F were discovered from the phone of a close aide of Amritpal, Tajinder Singh Gill, aka \"Gorkha Baba\" [118] \nDubious deposits to the tune of nearly 40 Crore INR mostly from foreign sources were detected in the accounts of multiple members of Waris De Punjab [119]\nThe agencies' reports claim that he has been raising his own army and 'human bomb squads' consisting of brainwashed youth as suicide bombers idolising Dilawar Singh [120] [121]\n\n\nReactions\nAkal Takht Jathedar, Giani Harpreet Singh, accused the authorities of \"creating an atmosphere of terror in the state\" [122] Journalists, politicians, and celebrities who criticised the heavy-handed response of the government have had their social media accounts blocked in India [123] [103] The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee has demanded the police \"stop arresting innocent Sikh youth\" [124]\n\n\nDomestic\nAkal Takht Jathedar, Giani Harpreet Singh, accused the authorities of \"creating an atmosphere of terror in the state\" [122] Journalists, politicians, and celebrities who criticised the heavy-handed response of the government have had their social media accounts blocked in India [123] [103] The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee has demanded the police \"stop arresting innocent Sikh youth\" [124]\n\n\nInternational\nDiasporic Sikhs protested the actions of the authorities against Amritpal A mob of protesters attacked the Indian consulate in San Francisco, another mob attacked the Indian High Commission office in London and attempted to pull down the Indian flag off the pole, broke windows and inflicted minor injuries on security staff [128] [129] [130] The NIA has claimed that a group of protestors in San Francisco were exhorted to kill all representatives of the Indian government [131] Further, two people poured flammable material in the entrance of the consulate and attempted to set the building on fire [132] In Canada, Sikh groups attacked the Indian High Commission in Ottawa and threw two grenades into the building, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs Amritpal Singh's brother in law, Amarjot Singh, has been named as the primary accused in the attack [131] Some reports stated they were smoke grenades [133] In Washington, Khalistani supporters verbally intimidated and physically assaulted an Indian journalist covering the protests [134] In Surrey, another journalist was allegedly assaulted and harassed by Khalistani supporters [135] The Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, was threatened with assassination by Khalistanis [136] Peaceful protests without incident also took place in Auckland, New Zealand and other localities around the world [137] [138] [139] [140]\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn 10 February 2023, Amritpal married Kirandeep Kaur, a native of Jalandhar district who used to live in the United Kingdom [144] [145] Amritpal described it as an instance of \"reverse migration\" and encouraged Punjabis to return to Punjab and settle there [146] As of March 2023 [update], she resides in Jallupur Khera, the native village of Amritpal Singh [147]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Amritpal Singh (activist)**\n\nAmritpal Singh is an Indian activist and politician who has been involved in various social and political movements, particularly in the state of Punjab. He has been at the center of controversy due to his alleged links to separatist groups and his calls for a separate homeland for Sikhs, known as Khalistan.\n\n**Early life**\n\nAmritpal Singh was born and raised in Jallupur Khera, a village in the Baba Bakala tehsil of Amritsar district of Punjab, India. He belongs to the Sandhu clan of Jatt Sikhs, a prominent community in the region. His family is known to be deeply religious, and his uncle, Harjit Singh Sandhu, was the sarpanch (head of village) for 10 years before moving to the United Kingdom.\n\n**Waris Punjab De**\n\nDuring the farmers' protest in India, Amritpal Singh became involved with Deep Sidhu, an actor-turned-activist who attempted to broaden the agenda of the agitation to fight for the \"rights of Punjab.\" Amritpal was a vocal supporter of Sidhu and his role in the agitation. However, Sidhu's death in February 2022 led to a power struggle within the organization, Waris Punjab De, with some factions appointing Amritpal as the leader.\n\n**Succession to Deep Sidhu**\n\nThe appointment of Amritpal as the leader of Waris Punjab De remains controversial, with some sources suggesting that Sidhu had appointed Harnek Singh Uppal as the head of the organization even while he was alive. The original organization has continued under Uppal, while a break-away faction has chosen Amritpal as its leader.\n\n**Campaigning and Prachaar**\n\nAmritpal Singh has been actively involved in motivating youth to shun drugs and irreligious lifestyles, calling them to the gurdwaras to receive baptism. His efforts have received praise from religious authorities, with over 1,000 people attending the gurdwaras for baptism on Sundays. Amritpal has also visited outlying regions of Sikhism, such as Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan and places in Haryana, attracting people from far away places such as Delhi, Maharashtra, and Jammu.\n\n**Drug rehabilitation**\n\nAmritpal has opened up a drug rehab facility, which has been credited with helping many individuals struggling with addiction. His willingness to tackle social issues head-on has earned him popularity among the local population. According to a study by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), around 15.4% of Punjab's population of 30 million are narcotic users.\n\n**Early controversies**\n\nIn October 2022, Amritpal made a statement that was deemed hate speech by members of the Christian community. The Christian community staged a four-hour protest against Amritpal at PAP Chowk, demanding that an FIR should be lodged against him under 295A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for \"hurting religious sentiments and attempting to aggravate communal divisions.\"\n\n**Khalistan and Bhindranwale styling**\n\nAmritpal openly supports the cause of Khalistan, the separatist movement calling for a separate homeland/country for people of Sikh faith. He has given several statements in which he openly rallies for Khalistan, stating that it should be seen from an intellectual point of view as to what could be its geopolitical benefits. However, his calls for Khalistan have been met with criticism from the Indian government and other opposition parties.\n\n**Political career**\n\nIn May 2024, Amritpal decided to run as an independent candidate for the Khadoor Sahib constituency of Punjab in the Lok Sabha elections. His campaign was led by his family and supporters due to his detention in Assam's Dibrugarh Jail under the National Security Act.\n\n**Participation in violence**\n\nIn November 2022, a Shiv Sena politician, Sudhir Suri, was murdered by Sandeep Singh Sunny, who allegedly had a Waris Punjab De sticker on his vehicle. The Punjab Police placed Amritpal under a preemptive house arrest briefly as a precautionary measure in anticipation of retaliatory violence against him.\n\n**Ajnala clash**\n\nIn February 2023, a man complained in an Ajnala police station stating he was kidnapped and beaten by the associates of Amritpal. An FIR was registered against Amritpal and his associates, and one of his close associates, Lovepreet Singh \"Toofan,\" was arrested.\n\n**Crackdown and arrest**\n\nOn 18 March, the Punjab Police initiated a crackdown against Waris Punjab De, arresting 78 persons and detaining several others for questioning. Amritpal Singh was wanted for attempted murder, obstruction of law enforcement, and creating disharmony in society. He was reported to be absconding, but eventually, the police managed to arrest him.\n\n**Allegations and charges**\n\nIndian intelligence agencies have alleged that Amritpal has links to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and global Khali", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Amritpal_Singh_(activist)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAmritpal Singh grew up as a resident of Jallupur Khera, a village in the Baba Bakala tehsil of Amritsar district of Punjab, India into the Sandhu clan of Jatt Sikhs He was the youngest of the three children of Tarsem Singh and Balwinder Kaur [39] His family is said to be very religious [12] His uncle Harjit Singh Sandhu was the sarpanch (head of village) for 10 years before moving to the

Punjab\" Amritpal is said to have been a vocal supporter of Sidhu and his role in the agitation [48] Sidhu is alleged to have led a group of farmers to storm the Red Fort in Delhi on the Republic Day of 2021 He was arrested for the action and spent a few months in prison After getting released on bail, he founded the Waris Punjab De (\"Heirs of Punjab\") organisation to fight for what he termed

he was alive So Sidhu's death did not make a difference to the organisation A break-away faction of the organisation apparently chose Amritpal as its leader using a \"hacked\" Facebook account, while

have attracted people from far away places such as Delhi, Maharashtra and Jammu [58] [12] [59]\n\n\nDrug rehabilitation\nAmritpal opened up a drug rehab facility and many, such as local journalists Amandeep Sandhu and Sandeep Singh (the latter having interviewed Amritpal in Dubai), attribute his wide popularity to his willingness to tackle social issues head-on, such as the drug problem, when previous governments have failed to solve these issues [63] Drug addiction and abuse are serious issues in Punjab, a study by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in 2022 revealed around 15.4% of the state's population of 30 million were narcotic users [63] [64]\n\n\nEarly controversies\nIn October 2022, in one of his speeches, Amritpal said, \"Jesus who could not save himself, how he will save everyone else?\" which was termed hate speech by members of the Christian community The Christian community staged a four hours-long protest against Amritpal at PAP Chowk for his remarks about Jesus Christ The protesters demanded that an FIR should be lodged against him under 295A of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) for \"hurting religious sentiments and attempting to aggravate communal divisions\" [67] [68] [69]\n\n\nKhalistan and Bhindranwale styling\nAmritpal openly supports the cause of Khalistan, the separatist movement calling for a separate homeland/country for people of Sikh faith He has given several statements in which he openly rallies for Khalistan stating, \"Our aim for Khalistan shouldn't be seen as evil and taboo It should be seen from an intellectual point of view as to what could be its geopolitical benefits It's an ideology and ideology never dies We are not asking for it from Delhi\" He further stated in a separate instance that the Khalistan sentiment will remain in the population and that no one can suppress it [73] He threatened Union Home Minister Amit Shah, saying that he will meet the same fate as Indira Gandhi, who was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984 [74]\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn May 2024, Singh decided to run as an independent candidate for the Khadoor Sahib constituency of Punjab in the Lok Sabha elections His campaign was led by his family and supporters due to his detention in Assam's Dibrugarh Jail under the National Security Act  [78] [79]\n\n\nMember of Parliament\nIn May 2024, Singh

Waris Punjab De sticker on his vehicle Punjab Police placed Amritpal under a preemptive house arrest briefly, as a precautionary measure in anticipation of retaliatory violence against him, although he had no prior connection with Suri nor with the murder After being released from house arrest, Amritpal did an Amrit Parchaar campaign in Haryana [84] [85]\n\n\nAjnala clash\nIn February 2023, a man complained in an Ajnala police station stating he was kidnapped and beaten by the associates of Amritpal An FIR was registered against Amritpal and his associates The police arrested one of his close

happened one day prior to a planned Khalsa Vaheer programme by Amritpal from Muktsar district [95] In the hunt to arrest him, the police have set up road blocks around the region, and were involved in a car chase, but he managed to escape [96] He switched cars and changed clothes to avoid detection during the chase, eventually escaping on a motor cycle He, along with his uncle and an associate, allegedly threatened the family of a sarpanch and forcefully stayed at their house The police recovered the vehicles used and a .315 rifle stashed in one of them The uncle and associate have also been

With a career spanning over three decades, Reeves has established himself as one of the most popular and influential actors in Hollywood. Born on September 2, 1964, in Beirut, Lebanon, Reeves has become synonymous with iconic characters and memorable performances.\n\nEarly Life\nReeves was born to Patricia Taylor, an English costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves Jr, an American of Native Hawaiian, Chinese, English, and Portuguese descent. His mother was working in Beirut when she met his father, who abandoned his wife and family when Reeves was three years old. Reeves last met his father on the Hawaiian island of Kauai when he was 13.\n\nCareer\n## 1984-1990: Early Work\nIn 1984, Reeves was a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) youth television program Going Great. That same year, he made his acting debut in an episode of the television series Hangin' In. In 1985, he played Mercutio in a stage production of Romeo and Juliet at the Leah Posluns Theatre in North York, Ontario. He made further appearances on stage, including Brad Fraser's cult hit Wolfboy in Toronto. He also appeared in a Coca-Cola commercial in 1983 and in the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) coming-of-age short film One Step Away.\n\n## 1991-1994: Breakthrough with Mature Roles\nIn 1991, Reeves starred in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, a sequel to Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, with his co-star Alex Winter. Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the sequel was \"more imaginative, more opulent, wilder and freer, more excitingly visualized,\" praising the actors for their \"fuller\" performances. Film critic Roger Ebert thought it was \"a riot of visual invention and weird humor that works on its chosen sub-moronic level... It's the kind of movie where you start out snickering in spite of yourself, and end up actually admiring the originality that went into creating this hallucinatory slapstick.\" The rest of 1991 marked a significant transition for Reeves's career as he undertook adult roles. Co-starring with River Phoenix as a street hustler in the adventure My Own Private Idaho, the characters embark on a journey of personal discovery. The story was written by Gus Van Sant and is loosely based on Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2, and Henry V. The film premiered at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, followed by a theatrical release in the United States on September 29, 1991. The film earned $6.4 million at the box office. My Own Private Idaho was positively received, with Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly describing the film as \"a postmodern road movie with a mood of free-floating, trance-like despair... a rich, audacious experience.\" The New York Times complimented Reeves and Phoenix for their insightful performances.\n\n## 1995-1998: Career Fluctuations\nIn an interview, Reeves discussed his experience playing Hamlet, stating, \"I love it... It's like this kind of code that once you start to inhabit it with breath and sound and feeling and thought, it is the most powerful and consuming and freeing at the same time... Just, literally, elemental in sound, consonants and vowels. What I found out in doing it was that it brought up for me all the anger that was inside me for my mother. I mean, it surprised me, just what was there, and I hadn't seen that before.\"\n\n## 1999-2004: Resurgence with The Matrix Franchise and Comedies\nIn 1999, Reeves starred in the critically acclaimed science fiction film The Matrix, the first installment in what would become The Matrix franchise. Reeves portrays computer programmer Thomas Anderson, a hacker using the alias \"Neo,\" who discovers humanity is trapped inside a simulated reality created by intelligent machines. To prepare for the film, which was written and directed by the Wachowskis, Reeves had read Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology. The principal cast underwent months of intense training with martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo-ping to prepare for the fight scenes. The Matrix proved to be a box office success; several critics considered it to be one of the best science fiction films of all time. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt it was a \"wildly cinematic futuristic thriller that is determined to overpower the imagination,\" despite perceiving weaknesses in the film's dialogue. Janet Maslin of The New York Times credited Reeves for being a \"strikingly chic Prada model of an action hero,\" and thought the martial arts stunts were the film's strongest feature. The Matrix received Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound.\n\n## 2005-2013: Thrillers, Documentaries, and Directorial Debut\nIn 2005, Reeves played the title role in Constantine, an occult detective film, about a man who has the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons. The film was a respectable box office hit, grossing $230 million worldwide from a $100 million budget, but attracted mixed-to-positive reviews. The Sydney Morning Herald's critic wrote that \"Constantine isn't bad, but it doesn't deserve any imposing adjectives... It's occasionally cheesy, sometimes enjoyable, intermittently scary, and constantly spiked with celestial blatherskite.\" He next appeared in Thumbsucker, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005. A comedy adapted from the 1999 Walter Kirn novel of the same name, the story follows a boy with a thumb-sucking problem. Reeves and the cast garnered positive critical reviews, with The Washington Post describing it as \"a gently stirring symphony about emotional transition filled with lovely musical passages and softly nuanced performances.\"\n\n## 2014-2022: Resurgence with John Wick\nAfter this series of commercial failures, Reeves's career rebounded in 2014. He played the title role in the action thriller John Wick, directed by Chad Stahelski. In the first installment of the John Wick franchise, Reeves plays a retired hitman seeking vengeance. He worked closely with the screenwriter to develop the story. The film was eventually released on October 24 in the United States. The Hollywood Reporter was impressed by the director's \"confident, muscular action debut,\" and Reeves's \"effortless\" performance, which marked his return to the action genre. Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times praised Reeves's fight scenes and wrote he is \"always more comfortable in roles that demand cool over hot, attitude over emotion.\" John Wick proved to be a box office success, grossing $86 million worldwide.\n\n## 2023-Present: Post-John Wick\nLionsgate's John Wick: Chapter 4 premiered on March 24, 2023, with Reeves reprising his role as the title character. The film received critical acclaim, with several reviewers citing it among the greatest action films ever made. He also reprised his role as Johnny Silverhand in the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion, Phantom Liberty.\n\nPersonal Life\nIn 1998, Reeves met director David Lynch's assistant Jennifer Syme at a party thrown for his band Dogstar, and they started dating. On December 24, 1999, Syme gave birth eight months into her pregnancy to the couple's child, who was stillborn. The couple broke up several weeks afterward, but later reconciled. On April 2, 2001, Syme was killed when her vehicle collided with three parked cars on Cahuenga Boulevard in Los Angeles. Syme was impaired, and also not belted in. Reeves told investigators that they were back together, and had brunch together in San Francisco the day before the accident. Reeves acted as a pallbearer for Syme, who was buried next to their daughter. He was scheduled to film the sequels to The Matrix the following spring, but sought \"peace and time,\" according to friend Bret Domrose of Dogstar.\n\nBusiness and Philanthropy\nReeves supports several charities and causes. In response to his sister's battle with leukemia, he founded a private cancer foundation, which aids children's hospitals and provides cancer research. In June 2020, he volunteered for Camp Rainbow Gold, an Idaho children's cancer charity. Reeves was also recognized as one of the 100 Influential Celebrities in Oncology by OncoDaily. Reeves has said, \"Money is the last thing I think about... I could live on what I have already made for the next few centuries.\" It was rumored that Reeves gave away a substantial portion of his earnings from The Matrix to the special effects and makeup crews, but this has been significantly embellished. Reeves negotiated a smaller deal, relinquishing his contractual right to a percentage of the sequels' profits in exchange for a more extensive special effects budget. During production on that film, Reeves heard that a crew member was having \"family trouble,\" and elected to gift the man $20,000 to help him with his finances. As a wrap gift for the twelve-person stunt team of The Matrix Reloaded, Reeves purchased Harley-Davidson motorcycles for each of the members, saying of the gifts, \"I just wanted... to give a bigger thank-you to all these guys who helped me make this.\"\n\nCensorship\nIn 2022, Reeves's recitation of the Beat poem \"Pull My Daisy\" for a virtual benefit concert for Tibet House US, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, angered Chinese nationalists. Reeves's films have been banned from streaming platforms in China, including iQiyi, Tencent Video, and Youku.\n\nIn the Media\nIn a 2005 article for Time magazine, Lev Grossman called Reeves \"Hollywood's ultimate introvert.\" He has been described as a workaholic, charming, and \"excruciatingly shy.\" During the production of Constantine, director Francis Lawrence commented on his personality, calling him \"hardworking\" and \"generous.\" His co-star Shia LaBeouf said, \"I've worked with him for a year and a couple of months, but I don't really know him that much.\" Erwin Stoff of 3 Arts Entertainment has served as Reeves's agent and manager since he was 16, and produced many of his films. Stoff said Reeves \"is a really private person\" and keeps his distance from other people.\n\nFilmography and Awards\nReeves has been prolific in film since 1985. His most acclaimed and highest-grossing films include River's Edge (1987), Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989), My Own Private Idaho (1991), Much Ado About Nothing (1993), Speed (1994), The Matrix (1999), John Wick (2014), John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019), and Toy Story 4 (2019).

By 21:00 local time, the originally scheduled kick-off time, thousands of seats remained empty in the Liverpool end. For \"security reasons\", the kick-off was initially delayed by 15 minutes to 21:15. This was further delayed by 15 minutes to 21:30, before being pushed back another 6 minutes to 21:36. The match eventually started at 21:37.\n\n**Match**\n\nThe match kicked off at the delayed time of 21:36 in front of a crowd of 75,000.

In the 34th minute, Alexander-Arnold played another cross into the Madrid penalty area towards Salah, who managed to direct a header towards goal but straight at Courtois.\n\n**First Half**\n\nThe match kicked off at the delayed time of 21:36 in front of a crowd of 75,000.

Liverpool continued where they left off, as nine minutes into the second half, Alexander-Arnold played in another cross towards the Real Madrid penalty area which was not far from the head of Alcântara and ended up being punched away by Courtois. In the 59th minute, Madrid took the lead against the run of play; Valverde made a run with the ball on the right-hand side, before eventually playing a low cross towards Vinícius Júnior in the penalty area who managed to tuck the ball into the net to make it 1-0, having been left unmarked and Alisson left stranded on the other side of the goal.\n\n**Details**\n\nThe \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the quarter-final and semi-final draws.\n\n**Statistics**\n\n| Team | Matches | Wins | Draws | Losses | Goals For | Goals Against |\n| Real Madrid | 14 | 12 | 2 | 0 | 31 | 7 |\n| Liverpool | 8 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 14 | 12 |\n\n**Post-Match**\n\nWith their win, Real Madrid secured a record-extending 14th title in the European Cup/Champions League. The club has won twice as many titles as the next-best team, Milan (7 titles). This was Madrid's fifth title in nine seasons (since 2013–14), their eighth consecutive win in a Champions League final, and their tenth successive victory in a major European final (including the 1985 and 1986 UEFA Cup Finals). Real Madrid has not lost a final in the Champions League era, with their last defeat occurring in 1981. Real Madrid also claimed their fourth European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). With the win, Spanish teams extended their streak of 17 straight major European finals won against non-Spanish opposition. Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was selected as the man of the match, having made nine saves in the game, a record in the final since Opta began keeping records in 2003–04. His 59 saves during the campaign also set a new Champions League single-season record since Opta began keeping records.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* UEFA Champions League\n* Real Madrid\n* Liverpool F.C.\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

independent candidate on 28 August 2023 [39] This was despite previously stating he would support Kuomintang nominee Hou Yu-ih The KMT described Gou's announcement as 'deeply regrettable' [40] Lai

were acting on their own accord and were not part of his official campaign Gou submitted his signatures on 1 November 2023 [46] On 13 November, over 900,000 of Gou's submitted signatures were validated by the election commission, qualifying him to run the presidential election [47] Amidst the deadline to register with the Central Election Commission, Gou released a statement on 24 November

campaign\nThroughout the election campaign, almost all polls showed Vice President Lai Ching-te winning the election by a plurality, with the rest of the vote being split between the KMT and TPP [53] Lai's lead increased in September 2023, when Terry Gou announced his own independent bid for the presidency [54] In August 2023, amid campaigning, Lai Ching-te went to Paraguay for an official visit in his capacity as vice president, with two stopovers in the United States [55] Lai insisted he was not campaigning during the trips [56] In late October, China opened an investigation into Foxconn, after Chinese tax authorities conducted an audit of the company's subsidiaries in the Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces [57] Within the final weeks preceding the election, Lai's lead narrowed as the publication of opinion polls ceased [58]\n\n\nUnrealized KMT–TPP joint ticket\nIn late 2023, talks of a possible joint ticket between the KMT and TPP began [63] It was initially unclear if the KMT's Hou Yu-ih and the TPP's Ko Wen-je would join as a ticket, let alone who would be the nominee for president and vice president once a joint ticket was announced [53] The DPP's Lai stated he would be able to take on the challenge of a joint ticket, and criticized the coalition plans, arguing the two parties do not share enough similarity in ideology [64] [failed verification] In November, Ko said that deciding who would lead the ticket as the presidential nominee was the 'only hurdle' remaining in forming the ticket [53] On 13 November, the KMT and TPP agreed to use polling to determine the composition of the joint presidential ticket [65] The order of the joint ticket was to be chosen based on opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November, [66] but the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on that date [67] On 18 November, the original deal collapsed following a dispute regarding the polling [68] The KMT and TPP were reportedly unable to come to a consensus surrounding the margins of error [69] Despite the initial collapse, there were still attempts to form a pan-blue coalition ticket Terry Gou, who himself had run in the KMT primary, was informally invited to talks as well [70]  A televised press conference between Hou You-ih, Ko Wen-je, Terry Gou, as well as Eric Chu and Ma Ying-jeou took place on 23 November [71] The press conference did not yield any agreement between any of the involved parties, and was described as \"bizarre\" [72] [73] On 24 November, the deadline for candidate registration, each party announced their own vice presidential candidate, eliminating any chance of a pan-blue ticket [74]\n\n\nIssues in focus\nHou and Ko both support gradually increasing the use of nuclear energy, (Hou supported 18% use by 2050) while the DPP's Lai supports eliminating nuclear energy by 2050 All three candidates agreed to increase use of renewables [75] The KMT vice presidential nominee criticized the use of solar energy, preferring nuclear power instead [76] Cost of living featured as a topic of debate, with a third of voters saying economic issues were pressing Both Lai and Hou pledged to increase the minimum wage [77] Lai acknowledged there were shortcomings in the government's approach to help younger people in the country, promising minimum wage would increase from NT$26,400 to NT$27,470 by 2025 [78] Additionally, Lai vowed to offer financial support to Taiwanese start-up companies, saying he would allocate NT$150 billion for small business investment [79] Ko offered plans to integrate hospitals and bolster the medical field, while the KMT's Hou promised to address mental health [76]\n\n\nEnergy and economic policy\nHou and Ko both support gradually increasing the use of nuclear energy, (Hou

to integrate hospitals and bolster the medical field, while the KMT's Hou promised to address mental health [76]\n\n\nSocial issues\nRights groups such as the Awakening Foundation criticized all three major party candidates for not doing enough to promote gender equality, which includes reducing working hours for parents, the gender pay gap, and child care [80] In October, Vice President Lai joined a Pride Parade in Taipei, becoming one of the most senior government officials to do so [81] TPP candidate Ko Wen-je had historically been opposed to same-sex marriage [82] Both Lai Ching-te and Ko Wen-je signed a pledge organized by the Taiwan Equality Campaign promising to promote and support sexual diversity and LGBT equality [83] Hou criticized Lai for his lack of a consistent position on capital punishment, which most polls show has been widely supported by the public At the presidential debate, Lai stated although he was personally opposed to the death penalty, it would remain in place under his administration due to broad public support [84]\n\n\nCross-Strait relations and national defense\nIn China, Xi Jinping had further asserted his power, having secured an unprecedented third term as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the most powerful position in China [85] The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had also prompted fears of an escalation between Mainland China and Taiwan [86] The CIA also warned not to underestimate the potential of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan [87] After incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen visited the United States and met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in April 2023, the Chinese military responded with military exercises near Taiwan [88] When KMT nominee Hou Yu-ih visited the US, he encouraged the Biden administration to make clear their commitment to defending Taiwan Later in December, Hou stated he would seek closer ties with China, and criticized the Tsai administration's approach to China [89] Lai asserted Taiwanese sovereignty, but said a formal declaration of independence would be unnecessary He also said he would be willing to work with the Chinese government, but only if they renounce any intentions to use force against Taiwan [90] In November 2023, Lai argued that closer economic ties with like-minded countries could maintain Taiwan's sovereignty while preventing escalation of conflict [91]\n\n\nElection interference\nThousands of cases related to election interference were opened by Taiwanese authorities, implicating more than 3,000 individuals There were 1,430 cases of election gambling and 353 cases involving misinformation Illegal gains from gambling and bribes exceeded NT$45.11 million (US$1.45 million) [98] Over 40 people were detained under various charges Another investigation uncovered a large but isolated network of inauthentic social media accounts that promoted the KMT and attacked Ko Wen-je out of the concern that Ko would become a spoiler candidate [99] [100]\n\n\nInvolving China\nHundreds of people were arrested under the Anti-Infiltration Act Some of them received money from China, made trips there, or subsidized others to travel to the mainland [98] Ten Taiwanese soldiers were allegedly paid by China to make surrender videos, and one of them was reportedly offered millions to defect in a military helicopter [100] Taiwanese intelligence reported that China coordinated disinformation campaigns on social media to influence the election [101] According to the BBC, these efforts were meant to drive a wedge between Taiwan and the US, portraying the latter as unreliable regarding defense Most sources of disinformation, however, were credited to Taiwanese groups favorable to China [102]\n\n\nDebates\nDebates for presidential candidates and vice presidential candidates were announced on 8 December These were organized by eleven Taiwanese media corporations including Taiwan's Public Television Service as the host, and include all three candidates for president and vice president, respectively [19] [103] The presidential and vice-presidential debates were held on 30 December and 1 January respectively [104] [14] Prior to the debates, Central Election Commission organized several televised policy presentations on 20, 26, and 28 December for presidential candidates and on 22 December for vice presidential candidates [15] [16] [17]\n\n\nForeign observations\nThe elections were described as \"crucial\" regarding foreign policy [114] [115] The election was also described as being \"closely watched\" due to its impact on cross-strait ties [58] CNN stated the election 'could change the world' [116]\n\n\nOpinion polling\nAll election results were released at 22:00 on 13 January, and showed that Lai Ching-te had won with 40.05% of the vote [117]\n\n\nResults\nAll election results were released at 22:00 on 13 January, and showed that Lai Ching-te had won with 40.05% of the vote [117]\n\n\nResults

eight years of DPP rule [118] At 20:04, Ko addressed his supporters at his campaign headquarters in New Taipei He said that the TPP's campaign showed the world that Taiwan was no longer dominated by the \"green\" and \"blue\" camps and urged his supporters to continue their hard work for the next election [119]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nDuring the voting, the hashtag \"Taiwan election\" became a top-trending topic in Weibo, at one point reaching 163.2 million views before it was removed Chinese state media also provided little coverage on the vote [126]\n\n\nPeople's Republic of

Gou submitted his signatures on November 1, 2023. On November 13, over 900,000 of Gou's submitted signatures were validated by the election commission, qualifying him to run the presidential election. Amidst the deadline to register with the Central Election Commission, Gou released a statement on November 24 dropping out of the race. In a statement, Gou said \"I'm dropping out, but my aspirations live on.\" He did not endorse a candidate.\n\n**Election campaign**\n\nThroughout the election campaign, almost all polls showed Vice President Lai Ching-te winning the election by a plurality, with the rest of the vote being split between the KMT and TPP. Lai's lead increased in September 2023, when Terry Gou announced his own independent bid for the presidency. In August 2023, amid campaigning, Lai Ching-te went to Paraguay for an official visit in his capacity as vice president, with two stopovers in the United States. Lai insisted he was not campaigning during the trips. In late October, China opened an investigation into Foxconn, after Chinese tax authorities conducted an audit of the company's subsidiaries in the Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces. Within the final weeks preceding the election, Lai's lead narrowed as the publication of opinion polls ceased.\n\n**Unrealized KMT-TPP joint ticket**\n\nIn late 2023, talks of a possible joint ticket between the KMT and TPP began. It was initially unclear if the KMT's Hou Yu-ih and the TPP's Ko Wen-je would join as a ticket, let alone who would be the nominee for president and vice president once a joint ticket was announced. The DPP's Lai stated he would be able to take on the challenge of a joint ticket, and criticized the coalition plans, arguing the two parties do not share enough similarity in ideology. In November, Ko said that deciding who would lead the ticket as the presidential nominee was the 'only hurdle' remaining in forming the ticket. On November 13, the KMT and TPP agreed to use polling to determine the composition of the joint presidential ticket. The order of the joint ticket was to be chosen based on opinion polls and publicly announced on November 18. However, the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on that date. On November 18, the original deal collapsed following a dispute regarding the polling. The KMT and TPP were reportedly unable to come to a consensus surrounding the margins of error. Despite the initial collapse, there were still attempts to form a pan-blue coalition ticket. Terry Gou, who himself had run in the KMT primary, was informally invited to talks as well. A televised press conference between Hou You-ih, Ko Wen-je, Terry Gou, as well as Eric Chu and Ma Ying-jeou took place on November 23. The press conference did not yield any agreement between any of the involved parties, and was described as \"bizarre\". On November 24, the deadline for candidate registration, each party announced their own vice presidential candidate, eliminating any chance of a pan-blue ticket.\n\n**Issues in focus**\n\nHou and Ko both support gradually increasing the use of nuclear energy, (Hou supported 18% use by 2050) while the DPP's Lai supports eliminating nuclear energy by 2050. All three candidates agreed to increase use of renewables. The KMT vice presidential nominee criticized the use of solar energy, preferring nuclear power instead. Cost of living featured as a topic of debate, with a third of voters saying economic issues were pressing. Both Lai and Hou pledged to increase the minimum wage. Lai acknowledged there were shortcomings in the government's approach to help younger people in the country, promising minimum wage would increase from NT$26,400 to NT$27,470 by 2025. Additionally, Lai vowed to offer financial support to Taiwanese start-up companies, saying he would allocate NT$150 billion for small business investment. Ko offered plans to integrate hospitals and bolster the medical field, while the KMT's Hou promised to address mental health.\n\n**Social issues**\n\nRights groups such as the Awakening Foundation criticized all three major party candidates for not doing enough to promote gender equality, which includes reducing working hours for parents, the gender pay gap, and child care. In October, Vice President Lai joined a Pride Parade in Taipei, becoming one of the most senior government officials to do so. TPP candidate Ko Wen-je had historically been opposed to same-sex marriage. Both Lai Ching-te and Ko Wen-je signed a pledge organized by the Taiwan Equality Campaign promising to promote and support sexual diversity and LGBT equality. Hou criticized Lai for his lack of a consistent position on capital punishment, which most polls show has been widely supported by the public. At the presidential debate, Lai stated although he was personally opposed to the death penalty, it would remain in place under his administration due to broad public support.\n\n**Cross-Strait relations and national defense**\n\nIn China, Xi Jinping had further asserted his power, having secured an unprecedented third term as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the most powerful position in China. The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had also prompted fears of an escalation between Mainland China and Taiwan. The CIA also warned not to underestimate the potential of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. After incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen visited the United States and met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in April 2023, the Chinese military responded with military exercises near Taiwan. When KMT nominee Hou Yu-ih visited the US, he encouraged the Biden administration to make clear their commitment to defending Taiwan. Later in December, Hou stated he would seek closer ties with China, and criticized the Tsai administration's approach to China. Lai asserted Taiwanese sovereignty, but said a formal declaration of independence would be unnecessary. He also said he would be willing to work with the Chinese government, but only if they renounce any intentions to use force against Taiwan.\n\n**Election interference**\n\nThousands of cases related to election interference were opened by Taiwanese authorities, implicating more than 3,000 individuals. There were 1,430 cases of election gambling and 353 cases involving misinformation. Illegal gains from gambling and bribes exceeded NT$45.11 million (US$1.45 million). Over 40 people were detained under various charges. Another investigation uncovered a large but isolated network of inauthentic social media accounts that promoted the KMT and attacked Ko Wen-je out of the concern that Ko would become a spoiler candidate.\n\n**Involving China**\n\nHundreds of people were arrested under the Anti-Infiltration Act. Some of them received money from China, made trips there, or subsidized others to travel to the mainland. Ten Taiwanese soldiers were allegedly paid by China to make surrender videos, and one of them was reportedly offered millions to defect in a military helicopter. Taiwanese intelligence reported that China coordinated disinformation campaigns on social media to influence the election. According to the BBC, these efforts were meant to drive a wedge between Taiwan and the US, portraying the latter as unreliable regarding defense. Most sources of disinformation, however, were credited to Taiwanese groups favorable to China.\n\n**Debates**\n\nDebates for presidential candidates and vice presidential candidates were announced on December 8, 2023. These were organized by eleven Taiwanese media corporations including Taiwan's Public Television Service as the host, and include all three candidates for president and vice president, respectively. The presidential and vice-presidential debates were held on December 30 and January 1, respectively. Prior to the debates, Central Election Commission organized several televised policy presentations on December 20, 26, and 28 for presidential candidates and on December 22 for vice presidential candidates.\n\n**Foreign observations**\n\nThe elections were described as \"crucial\" regarding foreign policy. The election was also described as being \"closely watched\" due to its impact on cross-strait ties. CNN stated the election 'could change the world'.\n\n**Opinion polling**\n\nAll election results were released at 22:00 on January 13, 2024, and showed that Lai Ching-te had won with 40.05% of the vote.\n\n**Results**\n\nAll election results were released at 22:00 on January 13, 2024, and showed that Lai Ching-te had won with 40.05% of the vote.\n\n**Results by Administrative division**\n\nvotes\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nAt around 20:00, Hou conceded to Lai in an address to his supporters at his campaign headquarters in New Taipei. He also apologized for failing to end eight years of DPP rule. At 20:04, Ko addressed his supporters at his campaign headquarters in New Taipei. He said that the TPP's campaign showed the world that Taiwan was no longer dominated by the \"green\" and \"blue\" camps and urged his supporters to continue their hard work for the next election.\n\n**International reactions**\n\nDuring the voting, the hashtag \"Taiwan election\" became a top-trending topic in Weibo, at one point reaching 163.2 million views before it was removed. Chinese state media also provided little coverage on the vote.\n\n**People's Republic of China**\n\nDuring the voting, the hashtag \"Taiwan election\" became a top-trending topic in Weibo, at one point reaching 163.2 million views before it was removed.

Born in Cambridge, England, in October 1981, Friend has established himself as a talented and versatile performer in film, television, and theater.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nRupert Friend was born to Caroline and David Oxton Friend, an art historian. When he was two years old, his family moved to a small village in Oxfordshire, called Stonesfield. Friend's childhood was marked by a love for books, and he was particularly fond of the works of Roald Dahl.\n\nFriend attended the University of Cambridge, where he studied drama. During his time at university, he gained valuable experience in the theater, including a production of The Laramie Project, in which he played three minor roles. This production caught the attention of a casting director, who recognized Friend's potential and encouraged him to pursue a career in acting.\n\n**Acting Career**\n\nFriend's acting debut came in 2004, when he played the role of Billy Downs in the film The Libertine, opposite Johnny Depp. This early experience was a significant lesson in film-acting for Friend, and he has since spoken highly of the opportunity to work with Depp.\n\nIn 2005, Friend had his first starring role in the film adaptation of Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont, opposite Joan Plowright. The same year, he portrayed George Wickham in Joe Wright's version of Pride and Prejudice, which was a critical and commercial success.\n\n**2004-2009**\n\nFriend continued to build his reputation as a talented young actor, taking on a range of roles in film and television. He played a minor role in the stage production of The Laramie Project, and made his screen debut in The Libertine. In 2005, he starred in Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont and Pride and Prejudice, cementing his status as a rising star.\n\n**2010-2019**\n\nIn 2010, Friend made his stage debut as Mitchell in the UK premiere of The Little Dog Laughed. He followed this with Dennis Potter's Brimstone and Treacle, in which he played the lead character to good reviews. Friend also starred in the film The Kid, based on the novel by Kevin Lewis. As the film involves boxing, he trained to improve his physical and psychological shape.\n\nFriend's performance in The Kid was well-received, but the film itself received mixed reviews. He also starred in a French film called Lullaby for Pi, playing a singer called Sam. In 2011, he played Thomas Anders in the film 5 Days of War, which did not receive great reviews.\n\n**2020-Present**\n\nIn the early 2020s, Friend joined the group of actors regularly working with director Wes Anderson. The collaboration started with a cameo appearance as an actor playing a drill-sergeant in The French Dispatch (2021), and continued with a more substantial role in the 2023 film Asteroid City. Friend played leading roles in Anderson's Netflix short films The Swan and The Rat Catcher (2023), based on short stories by Roald Dahl, whom Friend has described as a hero of his.\n\n**On Acting**\n\nFriend's work as a stage actor has been praised, but he prefers film and television. In his own words, he \"would not like to do the same thing over and over again every night.\" Initially, he was also reluctant to take on roles in longer-running television shows; at first, he turned down the chance to audition for Homeland.\n\n**Director, Screenwriter, Producer and Lyricist**\n\nIn 2008, Friend and Tom Mison wrote, produced, and starred in a short film called The Continuing and Lamentable Saga of the Suicide Brothers. The film won Best Short at the Rhode Island International Horror Film Festival (2010). Friend founded his own production company called Beat Pictures, and he made his directorial debut with a short film in 2010 called Steve, starring Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, and Tom Mison.\n\nIn addition to directing, Friend wrote and produced the film, which was later included in the 2012 compilation Stars in Shorts. Steve won Friend the Rhode Island Film Festival Crystal Image Award, and was nominated for the Santa Barbara Film Festival Bruce Corwin Award for Best Short Film.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, Friend dated actress Keira Knightley, whom he met when filming Pride and Prejudice. He met American athlete and actress Aimee Mullins in 2013, and they became engaged in December 2014. Friend and Mullins were married on 1 May 2016.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n**Films**\n\n* The Libertine (2004)\n* Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont (2005)\n* Pride and Prejudice (2005)\n* The Kid (2010)\n* Lullaby for Pi (2010)\n* 5 Days of War (2011)\n* Asteroid City (2023)\n* The Swan and The Rat Catcher (2023)\n\n**Television**\n\n* The Laramie Project (2006)\n* The Little Dog Laughed (2010)\n* Brimstone and Treacle (2011)\n* The French Dispatch (2021)\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of Rupert Friend's life and career, including his early life, education, and rise to fame as an actor.

{"title": "John_Kerry", "content": "\nEarly life and education (1943–1966)\nJohn Forbes Kerry was born on December 11, 1943, at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado [5] He is the second of four children born to Richard John Kerry, a U.S diplomat and lawyer, and Rosemary Forbes, a nurse and social activist His father was raised Catholic (John's paternal grandparents were Austro-Hungarian Jewish immigrants who converted to Catholicism) and his mother was Episcopalian He was raised with an elder sister Margaret, a younger sister Diana, and a younger brother Cameron The children were raised in their father's Catholic faith, and John served as an altar boy [6]\n\n\nMilitary service (1966–1970)\nOn February 18, 1966, Kerry enlisted in the Naval Reserve [36] He began his active duty military service on August 19, 1966 After completing 16 weeks of Officer Candidate School at the U.S Naval Training Center in Newport, Rhode Island, Kerry received his officer's commission on December 16, 1966 During the 2004 election, Kerry posted his military records at his website, and permitted reporters to inspect his medical records In 2005, Kerry released his military and medical records to the representatives of three news organizations, but has not authorized full public access to those records [37] [38]\n\n\nDuty on USS Gridley\nOn February 18, 1966, Kerry enlisted in the Naval Reserve [36] He began his active duty military service on August 19, 1966 After completing 16 weeks of Officer Candidate School at the U.S Naval Training Center in Newport, Rhode Island, Kerry received his officer's commission on December 16, 1966 During the 2004 election, Kerry posted his military records at his website, and permitted reporters to inspect his medical records In 2005, Kerry released his military and medical records to the representatives of three news organizations, but has not authorized full public access to those records [37] [38]\n\n\nMilitary honors\nDuring the night of December 2 and early morning of December 3, 1968, Kerry was in charge of a small boat operating near a peninsula north of Cam Ranh Bay together with a Swift boat (PCF-60) According to Kerry and the two crewmen who accompanied him that night, Patrick Runyon and William Zaladonis, they surprised a group of Vietnamese men unloading sampans at a river crossing, who began running and failed to obey an order to stop As the men fled, Kerry and his crew opened fire on the sampans and destroyed them, then rapidly left During this encounter, Kerry received a shrapnel wound in the left arm above the elbow It was for this injury that Kerry received his first Purple Heart Medal [41]\n\n\nSilver Star\nEight days later, on February 28, 1969, came the events for which Kerry was awarded his Silver Star Medal On this occasion, Kerry was in tactical command of his Swift boat and two other Swift boats during a combat operation Their mission on the Duong Keo River included bringing an underwater demolition team and dozens of South Vietnamese Marines to destroy enemy sampans, structures and bunkers as described in the story The Death Of PCF 43 [45] Running into heavy small arms fire from the river banks, Kerry \"directed the units to turn to the beach and charge the Viet Cong positions\" and he \"expertly directed\" his boat's fire causing the enemy to flee while at the same time coordinating the insertion of the ninety South Vietnamese troops (according to the original medal citation signed by Admiral Elmo Zumwalt) Moving a short distance upstream, Kerry's boat was the target of a B-40 rocket round; Kerry charged the enemy positions and as his boat hove to and beached, a Viet Cong (\"VC\") insurgent armed with a rocket launcher emerged from a spider hole and ran While the boat's gunner opened fire, wounding the VC in the leg, and while the other boats approached and offered cover fire, Kerry jumped from the boat to pursue the VC insurgent, subsequently killing him and capturing his loaded rocket launcher [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nBronze Star\nOn March 13, 1969, on the Bái Háp River, Kerry was in charge of one of five Swift boats that were returning to their base after performing an Operation Sealords mission to transport South Vietnamese troops from the garrison at Cái Nước and MIKE Force advisors for a raid on a Vietcong camp located on the Rach Dong Cung canal Earlier in the day, Kerry received a slight shrapnel wound in the buttocks from blowing up a rice bunker Debarking some but not all of the passengers at a small village, the boats approached a fishing weir; one group of boats went around to the left of the weir, hugging the shore, and a group with Kerry's PCF-94 boat went around to the right, along the shoreline A mine was detonated directly beneath the lead boat, PCF-3, as it crossed the weir to the left, lifting PCF-3 \"about 2–3 ft out of water\" [50]\n\n\nReturn from Vietnam\nAfter Kerry's third qualifying wound, he was entitled per Navy regulations to reassignment away from combat duties Kerry's preferred choice for reassignment was as a military aide in Boston, New York City or Washington, D.C [52] On April 11, 1969, he reported to the Brooklyn-based Atlantic Military Sea Transportation Service, where he would remain on active duty for the following year as a personal aide to an officer, Rear Admiral Walter Schlech On January 1, 1970, Kerry was temporarily promoted to full lieutenant [53] Kerry had agreed to an extension of his active duty obligation from December 1969 to August 1970 in order to perform Swift Boat duty [54] [55] John Kerry was on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1966 until January 1970 He continued to serve in the Naval Reserve until February 1978 [56]\n\n\n\"Swiftboating\" controversy\nWith the continuing controversy that had surrounded the military service of George W Bush since the 2000 presidential election (when he was accused of having used his father's political influence to gain entrance to the Texas Air National Guard, thereby protecting himself from conscription into the United States Army, and possible service in the Vietnam War), John Kerry's contrasting status as a decorated Vietnam War veteran posed a problem for Bush's re-election campaign, which Republicans sought to counter by calling Kerry's war record into question As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, approximately 250 members of a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT, later renamed Swift Vets and POWs for Truth) opposed Kerry's campaign The group held press conferences, ran ads and endorsed a book questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards The group included several members of Kerry's unit, such as Larry Thurlow, who commanded a swift boat alongside of Kerry's, [57] and Stephen Gardner, who served on Kerry's boat [58] The campaign inspired the widely used political pejorative '\"swiftboating,\" to describe an unfair or untrue political attack [59] Most of Kerry's former crewmates have stated that SBVT's allegations are false [60]\n\n\nAnti-war activism (1970–1971)\nAfter returning to the United States, Kerry moved to Waltham, Massachusetts and joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) [61] [62] Then numbering about 20,000, [63] VVAW was considered by some (including the administration of President Richard Nixon) to be an effective, if controversial, component of the antiwar movement [64] Kerry participated in the \"Winter Soldier Investigation\" conducted by VVAW of U.S atrocities in Vietnam, and he appears in a film by that name that documents the investigation [65] According to Nixon Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, \"I didn't approve of what he did, but I understood the protesters quite well\", and he declined two requests from the Navy to court martial Reserve Lieutenant Kerry over his antiwar activity [66]\n\n\nEarly political career (1972–1985)\nIn 1970, Kerry had considered running for Congress in the Democratic primary against hawkish Democrat Philip J Philbin of Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district, but deferred in favor of Robert Drinan, a Jesuit priest and anti-war activist, who went on to defeat Philbin [23] In February 1972, Kerry's wife bought a house in Worcester, with Kerry intending to run against the 4th district's aging thirteen-term incumbent Democrat, Harold Donohue [23] The couple never moved in After Republican Congressman F Bradford Morse of the neighboring 5th district announced his retirement and then resignation to become Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs at the United Nations, the couple instead rented an apartment in Lowell, so that Kerry could run to succeed him [23]\n\n\n1972 congressional election\nIn 1970, Kerry had considered running for Congress in the Democratic primary against hawkish Democrat Philip J Philbin of Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district, but deferred in favor of Robert Drinan, a Jesuit priest and anti-war activist, who went on to defeat Philbin [23] In February 1972, Kerry's wife bought a house in Worcester, with Kerry intending to run against the 4th district's aging thirteen-term incumbent Democrat, Harold Donohue [23] The couple never moved in After Republican Congressman F Bradford Morse of the neighboring 5th district announced his retirement and then resignation to become Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs at the United Nations, the couple instead rented an apartment in Lowell, so that Kerry could run to succeed him [23]\n\n\nLaw career\nAfter Kerry's 1972 defeat, he and his wife bought a house in the Belvidere section of Lowell, Massachusetts, [75] [23] entering a decade which his brother Cameron later called \"the years in exile\" [23] He spent some time working as a fundraiser for the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE), an international humanitarian organization [76] In September 1973, he entered Boston College Law School [23] While studying, Kerry worked as a talk radio host on WBZ and, in July 1974, was named executive director of Mass Action, a Massachusetts advocacy association [23] [77]\n\n\nLieutenant Governor of Massachusetts\nIn the 1982 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, Lieutenant Governor Thomas P O'Neill III declined to seek a third term, instead deciding to run for governor of Massachusetts [85] Kerry declared his candidacy, entering the primary election alongside Massachusetts Secretary of Environmental Affairs Evelyn Murphy, State Senator Samuel Rotondi, State Representative Lou Nickinello, and Lois Pines [86]\n\n\n1984 U.S. Senate election\nThe junior U.S senator from Massachusetts, Paul Tsongas, announced in 1984 that he would be stepping down for health reasons [94] Kerry ran, and as in his 1982 race for Lieutenant Governor, he did not receive the endorsement of the party regulars at the state Democratic convention [95] Congressman James Shannon, a favorite of House Speaker Tip O'Neill, was the early favorite to win the nomination, and he \"won broad establishment support and led in early polling\" [96] [97] Again as in 1982, however, Kerry prevailed in a close primary [98]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1985–2013)\nOn April 18, 1985, a few months after taking his Senate seat, Kerry and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa traveled to Nicaragua and met the country's president, Daniel Ortega Although Ortega had won internationally certified elections, the trip was criticized because Ortega and his leftist Sandinista government had strong ties to Cuba and the USSR and were accused of human rights abuses The Sandinista government was opposed by the right-wing CIA-backed rebels known as the Contras While in Nicaragua, Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict Through the senators, Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the U.S dropping support of the Contras The offer was denounced by the Reagan administration as a \"propaganda initiative\" designed to influence a House vote on a $14 million Contra aid package, but Kerry said \"I am willing .. to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas.\" The House voted down the Contra aid, but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a $200 million loan the next day, which in part prompted the House to pass a larger $27 million aid package six weeks later [103]\n\n\nIran–Contra hearings\nOn April 18, 1985, a few months after taking his Senate seat, Kerry and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa traveled to Nicaragua and met the country's president, Daniel Ortega Although Ortega had won internationally certified elections, the trip was criticized because Ortega and his leftist Sandinista government had strong ties to Cuba and the USSR and were accused of human rights abuses The Sandinista government was opposed by the right-wing CIA-backed rebels known as the Contras While in Nicaragua, Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict Through the senators, Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the U.S dropping support of the Contras The offer was denounced by the Reagan administration as a \"propaganda initiative\" designed to influence a House vote on a $14 million Contra aid package, but Kerry said \"I am willing .. to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas.\" The House voted down the Contra aid, but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a $200 million loan the next day, which in part prompted the House to pass a larger $27 million aid package six weeks later [103]\n\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush administration\nOn November 15, 1988, at a businessmen's breakfast in East Lynn, Massachusetts, Kerry made a joke about then-President-elect George H W Bush and his running mate, saying \"if Bush is shot, the Secret Service has orders to shoot Dan Quayle.\" He apologized the following day [109]\n\n\nPrecursors to presidential bid\nIn 1996, Kerry faced a difficult re-election fight against Governor William Weld, a popular Republican incumbent who had been re-elected in 1994 with 71% of the vote The race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched Senate races that year Kerry and Weld held several debates and negotiated a campaign spending cap of $6.9 million at Kerry's Beacon Hill townhouse Both candidates spent more than the cap, with each camp accusing the other of being first to break the agreement [112] During the campaign, Kerry spoke briefly at the 1996 Democratic National Convention Kerry won re-election with 52 percent to Weld's 45 percent [113]\n\n\n\"You get stuck in Iraq\" controversy\nOn October 30, 2006, Kerry was a headline speaker at a campaign rally being held for Democratic California gubernatorial candidate Phil Angelides at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, California Speaking to an audience composed mainly of college students, Kerry said, \"You know, education, if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq.\" [116]\n\n\nAfghanistan and Pakistan\nA Washington Post report in May 2011 stated that Kerry \"has emerged in the past few years as an important envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan during times of crisis\", as he undertook another trip to the two countries The killing of Osama bin Laden \"has generated perhaps the most important crossroads yet\", the report continued, as the senator spoke at a press conference and prepared to fly from Kabul to Pakistan [122] Among matters discussed during the May visit to Pakistan, under the general rubric of \"recalibrating\" the bilateral relationship, Kerry sought and retrieved from the Pakistanis the tail-section of the U.S helicopter which had had to be abandoned at Abbottabad during the bin Laden strike [123] In 2013, Kerry met with Pakistan's army chief Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani to discuss the peace process with the Taliban in Afghanistan [124]\n\n\nVoting record\nMost analyses place Kerry's voting record on the left within the Senate Democratic caucus [125] During the 2004 presidential election he was portrayed as a staunch liberal by conservative groups and the Bush campaign, who often noted that in 2003 Kerry was rated the top Senate liberal by National Journal However, that rating was based only upon voting on legislation within that past year In fact, in terms of career voting records, the National Journal found that Kerry is the 11th most liberal member of the Senate Most analyses find that Kerry is at least slightly more liberal than the typical Democratic Senator Kerry has stated that he opposes privatizing Social Security, supports abortion rights for adult women and minors, supports same-sex marriage, opposes capital punishment except for terrorists, supports most gun control laws, and is generally a supporter of trade agreements In some of these, as in the case of abortion, Kerry distinguishes his personal views as in line with his Catholic faith, but believes that separation of church and state demands that he not legislate his religious beliefs upon those who do not share those beliefs [126] Kerry supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and Most Favored Nation status for China, but opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement [127] [128]\n\n\nOverall\nMost analyses place

\"I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\" Bush relied on that resolution in ordering the 2003 invasion of Iraq Kerry also gave a January 23, 2003, speech to Georgetown University saying \"Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein He is a brutal, murderous dictator; leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real.\" Kerry did, however, warn that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war: \"Mr President, do not rush to war, take the time to build the coalition, because it's not winning the war that's hard, it's winning the peace that's hard.\" [132]\n\n\nLibya\nIn 2011,

Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who was Kerry's 2004 campaign adviser, wrote an article in Time magazine claiming that after the election, Kerry had said that he wished he had never picked Edwards,

Doctrine was over He went on to explain, \"The relationship that we seek and that we have worked hard to foster is not about a United States declaration about how and when it will intervene in the affairs of other American states It's about all of our countries viewing one another as equals, sharing responsibilities, cooperating on security issues, and adhering not to doctrine, but to the

duty in the United States Navy from August 1966 until January 1970 He continued to serve in the Naval Reserve until February 1978 [56]\n\n\n\"Swiftboating\" controversy\nWith the continuing controversy that had surrounded the military service of George W Bush since the 2000 presidential election (when he was accused of having used his father's political influence to gain entrance to the Texas Air National Guard, thereby protecting himself from conscription into the United States Army, and possible service in the Vietnam War), John Kerry's contrasting status as a decorated Vietnam War veteran posed a problem for Bush's re-election campaign, which Republicans sought to counter by calling Kerry's war record into question As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, approximately 250 members of a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT, later renamed Swift Vets and POWs for Truth) opposed Kerry's campaign The group held press conferences, ran ads and endorsed a book questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards The group included several members of Kerry's unit, such as Larry Thurlow, who commanded a swift boat alongside of Kerry's, [57] and Stephen Gardner, who served on Kerry's boat [58] The campaign inspired the widely used political pejorative '\"swiftboating,\" to describe an unfair or untrue political attack [59] Most of Kerry's former crewmates have stated that SBVT's allegations are false [60]\n\n\nAnti-war activism (1970–1971)\nAfter returning to the United States, Kerry moved to Waltham, Massachusetts and joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) [61] [62] Then numbering about 20,000, [63] VVAW was considered by some (including the administration of President Richard Nixon) to be an effective, if controversial, component of the antiwar movement [64] Kerry participated in the \"Winter Soldier Investigation\" conducted by VVAW of U.S atrocities in Vietnam, and he appears in a film by that name that documents the investigation [65] According to Nixon Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, \"I didn't approve of what he did, but I understood the protesters quite well\", and he declined two requests from the Navy to court martial Reserve Lieutenant Kerry over his antiwar activity [66]\n\n\nEarly political career (1972–1985)\nIn 1970, Kerry had considered running for Congress in the Democratic primary against hawkish Democrat Philip J Philbin of Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district, but deferred in favor of Robert Drinan, a Jesuit priest and anti-war activist, who went on to defeat Philbin [23] In February 1972, Kerry's wife bought a house in Worcester, with Kerry intending to run against the 4th district's aging thirteen-term incumbent Democrat, Harold Donohue [23] The couple never moved in After Republican Congressman F Bradford Morse of the neighboring 5th district announced his retirement and then resignation to become Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs at the United Nations, the couple instead rented an apartment in Lowell, so that Kerry could run to succeed him [23]\n\n\n1972 congressional election\nIn 1970, Kerry had considered running for Congress in the Democratic primary against hawkish Democrat Philip J Philbin of Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district, but deferred in favor of Robert Drinan, a Jesuit priest and anti-war activist, who went on to defeat Philbin [23] In February 1972, Kerry's wife bought a house in Worcester, with Kerry intending to run against the 4th district's aging thirteen-term incumbent Democrat, Harold Donohue [23] The couple never moved in After Republican Congressman F Bradford Morse of the neighboring 5th district announced his retirement and then resignation to become Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs at the United Nations, the couple instead rented an apartment in Lowell, so that Kerry could run to succeed him [23]\n\n\nLaw career\nAfter Kerry's 1972 defeat, he and his wife bought a house in the Belvidere section of Lowell, Massachusetts, [75] [23] entering a decade which his brother Cameron later called \"the years in exile\" [23] He spent some time working as a fundraiser for the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE), an international humanitarian organization [76] In September 1973, he entered Boston College Law School [23] While studying, Kerry worked as a talk radio host on WBZ and, in July 1974, was named executive director of Mass Action, a Massachusetts advocacy association [23] [77]\n\n\nLieutenant Governor of Massachusetts\nIn the 1982 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, Lieutenant Governor Thomas P O'Neill III declined to seek a third term, instead deciding to run for governor of Massachusetts [85] Kerry declared his candidacy, entering the primary election alongside Massachusetts Secretary of Environmental Affairs Evelyn Murphy, State Senator Samuel Rotondi, State Representative Lou Nickinello, and Lois Pines [86]\n\n\n1984 U.S. Senate election\nThe junior U.S senator from Massachusetts, Paul Tsongas, announced in 1984 that he would be stepping down for health reasons [94] Kerry ran, and as in his 1982 race for Lieutenant Governor, he did not receive the endorsement of the party regulars at the state Democratic convention [95] Congressman James Shannon, a favorite of House Speaker Tip O'Neill, was the early favorite to win the nomination, and he \"won broad establishment support and led in early polling\" [96] [97] Again as in 1982, however, Kerry prevailed in a close primary [98]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1985–2013)\nOn April 18, 1985, a few months after taking his Senate seat, Kerry and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa traveled to Nicaragua and met the country's president, Daniel Ortega Although Ortega had won internationally certified elections, the trip was criticized because Ortega and his leftist Sandinista government had strong ties to Cuba and the USSR and were accused of human rights abuses The Sandinista government was opposed by the right-wing CIA-backed rebels known as the Contras While in Nicaragua, Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict Through the senators, Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the U.S dropping support of the Contras The offer was denounced by the Reagan administration as a \"propaganda initiative\" designed to influence a House vote on a $14 million Contra aid package, but Kerry said \"I am willing .. to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas.\" The House voted down the Contra aid, but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a $200 million loan the next day, which in part prompted the House to pass a larger $27 million aid package six weeks later [103]\n\n\nIran–Contra hearings\nOn April 18, 1985, a few months after taking his Senate seat, Kerry and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa traveled to Nicaragua and met the country's president, Daniel Ortega Although Ortega had won internationally certified elections, the trip was criticized because Ortega and his leftist Sandinista government had strong ties to Cuba and the USSR and were accused of human rights abuses The Sandinista government was opposed by the right-wing CIA-backed rebels known as the Contras While in Nicaragua, Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict Through the senators, Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the U.S dropping support of the Contras The offer was denounced by the Reagan administration as a \"propaganda

The House voted down the Contra aid, but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a $200 million loan the next day, which in part prompted the House to pass a larger $27 million aid package six weeks later [103]\n\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush administration\nOn November 15, 1988, at a businessmen's breakfast in East Lynn, Massachusetts, Kerry made a joke about then-President-elect George H W Bush and his running mate, saying \"if Bush is shot, the Secret Service has orders to shoot Dan Quayle.\" He apologized the following day [109]\n\n\nPrecursors to presidential bid\nIn 1996, Kerry faced a difficult re-election fight against Governor William Weld, a popular Republican incumbent who had been re-elected in 1994 with 71% of the vote The race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched Senate races that year Kerry and Weld held several debates and negotiated a campaign spending cap of $6.9 million at Kerry's Beacon Hill townhouse Both candidates spent more than the cap, with each camp accusing the other of being first to break the agreement [112] During the campaign, Kerry spoke briefly at the 1996 Democratic National Convention Kerry won re-election with 52 percent to Weld's 45 percent [113]\n\n\n\"You get stuck in Iraq\" controversy\nOn October 30, 2006, Kerry was a headline speaker at a campaign rally being held for Democratic California gubernatorial candidate Phil Angelides at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, California Speaking to an audience composed mainly of college students, Kerry said, \"You know, education, if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq.\" [116]\n\n\nAfghanistan and Pakistan\nA Washington Post report in May 2011 stated that Kerry \"has emerged in the past few years as an important envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan during times of crisis\", as he undertook another trip to the two countries The killing of Osama bin Laden \"has generated perhaps the most important crossroads yet\", the report continued, as the senator spoke at a press conference and prepared to fly from Kabul to Pakistan [122] Among matters discussed during the May visit to Pakistan, under the general rubric of \"recalibrating\" the bilateral relationship, Kerry sought and retrieved from the Pakistanis the tail-section of the U.S helicopter which had had to be abandoned at Abbottabad during the bin Laden strike [123] In 2013, Kerry met with Pakistan's army chief Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani to discuss the peace process with the Taliban in Afghanistan [124]\n\n\nVoting record\nMost analyses place Kerry's voting record on the left within the Senate Democratic caucus [125] During the 2004 presidential election he was portrayed as a staunch liberal by conservative groups and the Bush campaign, who often noted that in 2003 Kerry was rated the top Senate liberal by National Journal However, that rating was based only upon voting on legislation within that past year In fact, in terms of career voting records, the National Journal found that Kerry is the 11th most liberal member of the Senate Most analyses find that Kerry is at least slightly more liberal than the typical Democratic Senator Kerry has stated that he opposes privatizing Social Security, supports abortion rights for adult women and minors, supports same-sex marriage, opposes capital punishment except for terrorists, supports most gun control laws, and is generally a supporter of trade agreements In some of these, as in the case of abortion, Kerry distinguishes his personal views as in line with his Catholic faith, but believes that separation of church and state demands that he not legislate his religious beliefs upon those who do not share those beliefs [126] Kerry supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and Most Favored Nation status for China, but opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement [127] [128]\n\n\nOverall\nMost analyses place

Trade Agreement and Most Favored Nation status for China, but opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement [127] [128]\n\n\nIraq\nIn the lead up to the Iraq War, Kerry said on October 9, 2002; \"I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\" Bush relied on that resolution in ordering the 2003 invasion of Iraq Kerry also gave a January 23, 2003, speech to Georgetown University saying \"Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein He is a brutal, murderous dictator; leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real.\" Kerry did, however, warn that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war: \"Mr President, do not rush to war, take the time to build the coalition, because it's not winning the war that's hard, it's winning the peace that's hard.\" [132]\n\n\nLibya\nIn 2011, Kerry supported American military action in Libya [134] [135]\n\n\nLeadership\nKerry chaired the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs from 1991 to 1993 The committee's report, which Kerry endorsed, stated there was \"no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia\" [136] In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Kerry and fellow Vietnam veteran John McCain, that called for an end to the existing trade embargo against Vietnam; it was intended to pave the way for normalization [137] In 1995, President Bill Clinton normalized diplomatic relations with the country of Vietnam [138]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nDuring his tenure, Kerry served on four Senate committees and nine subcommittees:\n\n\nCaucus memberships\nFrom the beginning of the 113th United States Congress until his resignation, Kerry ranked as the 7th most senior U.S Senator Due to the longevity of Ted Kennedy's service, Kerry was the

John Edwards (D-North Carolina), former Vermont Governor Howard Dean and retired Army General Wesley Clark His victory in the Iowa caucuses is widely believed to be the tipping point where Kerry revived his sagging campaign in New Hampshire and the February 3, 2004, primary states like Arizona, South Carolina and New Mexico Kerry then went on to win landslide victories in Nevada and Wisconsin Kerry thus won the Democratic nomination to run for President of the United States against incumbent George W Bush On July 6, 2004, he announced his selection of John Edwards as his running mate Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who was Kerry's 2004 campaign adviser, wrote an article in Time magazine claiming that after the election, Kerry had said that he wished he had never picked Edwards, and that the two have since stopped speaking to each other [143] In a subsequent appearance on ABC's This Week, Kerry refused to respond to Shrum's allegation, calling it a \"ridiculous waste of time\" [144]\n\n\nSubsequent presidential-election activities\nImmediately after the 2004 election, some Democrats mentioned Kerry as a possible contender for the 2008 Democratic nomination His brother had said such a campaign was \"conceivable\", and Kerry himself reportedly said at a farewell party for his 2004 campaign staff, \"There's always another four years\" [149]\n\n\nSecretary of State (2013–2017)\nOn December 15, 2012, several news outlets reported that President Barack Obama would nominate Kerry to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, [158] [159] after Susan Rice, widely seen as Obama's preferred choice, withdrew her name from consideration citing a politicized confirmation process following criticism of her response to the 2012 Benghazi attack [160] On December 21, Obama proposed the nomination, [161] [162] which received positive commentary His confirmation hearing took place on January 24, 2013, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the same panel where he first testified in 1971 [163] [164] The committee unanimously voted to approve him on January 29, 2013, and the same day the full Senate confirmed him on a vote of 94–3 [165] [166]

weapons attack on the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus attributed to Syrian government forces, Kerry became a leading advocate for the use of military force against the Syrian government for what he called \"a despot's brutal and flagrant use of chemical weapons\" [187]\n\n\nLatin America\nIn a speech before the Organization of American States in November 2013, Kerry remarked that the era of the Monroe Doctrine was over He went on to explain, \"The relationship that we seek and that we have worked hard to foster is not about a United States declaration about how and when it will intervene in the affairs of other American states It's about all of our countries viewing one another as equals, sharing responsibilities, cooperating on security issues, and adhering not to doctrine, but to the decisions that we make as partners to advance the values and the interests that we share.\" [194]\n\n\nEnvironmentalism\nIn April 2016, he signed the Paris Climate Accords at the United Nations in New

from Forbes family relatives, including his mother, Rosemary Forbes Kerry, who died in 2002 Forbes magazine (named for the Forbes family of publishers, unrelated to Kerry) estimated that if elected, and if Heinz family assets were included, Kerry would have been the third-richest U.S president in history, when adjusted for inflation [241] This assessment was based on Heinz's and Kerry's combined assets, but the couple signed a prenuptial agreement that keeps their assets separate [242] Kerry's financial disclosure form for 2011 put his personal assets in the range of $230,000,000 to

The series is based on a true story and explores the themes of innovation, entrepreneurship, and the law. The show's narrative is built around two interconnected timelines, which weave together to reveal the story of a group of young hackers and artists who founded the ART+COM collaboration in Berlin in the 1990s.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe plot of The Billion Dollar Code follows the story of Carsten Schlüter, a young and ambitious artist who is part of a group of hackers and art students who come together to form the ART+COM collaboration. The group's initial project is a planet browser, which is launched in 1991. However, it is not until 1993 that Joachim Sauter, a member of the group, uses the planet browser to secure funding from Deutsche Telekom, which allows the group to develop a new project called TerraVision.\n\nIn the series, the ART+COM beginnings are dropped, and the focus shifts to the development of TerraVision. The show's narrative explores the challenges faced by the team as they work to bring their vision to life, including the complexities of working with large corporations and the legal issues that arise.\n\nAs the series progresses, the timeline shifts to the present day, where a group of characters is navigating the aftermath of the events that unfolded in the 1990s. The show's climax revolves around a lawsuit that has been ongoing since 2017, which has significant implications for the characters and the world of innovation.\n\n**Trivia**\n\nThe Billion Dollar Code is based on a true story, and the show's creators took inspiration from the real-life events that unfolded in the 1990s. However, the show's narrative is not a direct retelling of the events, and some artistic liberties were taken to enhance the storytelling.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the show is its exploration of the lawsuit that has been ongoing since 2017. The show's creators used portions of the trial transcript to create a dramatization of the proceedings, but key aspects of the trial were entirely fictionalized or omitted. The actual decision of the court was based on other findings, and the show's creators took creative liberties to enhance the narrative.\n\nThe show's use of real-world events and figures adds a layer of authenticity to the narrative, but it also raises questions about the intersection of art and reality. The show's creators took a deliberate approach to fictionalizing certain aspects of the story, which blurs the line between fact and fiction.\n\n**Discrepancies**\n\nThe Billion Dollar Code is based on a true story, but the show's creators took significant creative liberties to enhance the narrative. The show's use of real-world events and figures adds a layer of authenticity, but it also raises questions about the intersection of art and reality.\n\nOne of the key discrepancies between the show and real-life events is the outcome of the lawsuit. The show's narrative suggests that the plaintiff lost the case, but the actual decision of the court was based on other findings. The show's creators took creative liberties to enhance the narrative, which raises questions about the accuracy of the show's representation of the events.\n\nAnother discrepancy is the character of Carsten Schlüter. While the show's protagonist is based on a real person, the character's personality and motivations were fictionalized to enhance the narrative. The show's creators took creative liberties to create a compelling character, which raises questions about the accuracy of the show's representation of the events.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe Billion Dollar Code features a talented cast of actors, including:\n\n* Alexander Beyer as Carsten Schlüter\n* Alexandra Maria Lara as Sofia\n* Ulrich Matthes as Dr. Bergmann\n* Lars Eidinger as Juri Müller\n* Milan Peschel as Dr. Schmidt\n\nThe cast brings the characters to life, and their performances add depth and nuance to the narrative. The show's creators took a deliberate approach to casting, selecting actors who could bring the characters to life in a way that was authentic and compelling.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe Billion Dollar Code is a six-part miniseries, with each episode exploring a different aspect of the narrative. The episodes are:\n\n* Episode 1: \"The Planet Browser\"\n* Episode 2: \"TerraVision\"\n* Episode 3: \"The Lawsuit\"\n* Episode 4: \"The Trial\"\n* Episode 5: \"The Verdict\"\n* Episode 6: \"The Aftermath\"\n\nEach episode builds on the previous one, and the narrative unfolds in a way that is both engaging and thought-provoking. The show's creators took a deliberate approach to structuring the narrative, selecting a pace and tone that would keep the audience engaged.\n\n**References**\n\nThe Billion Dollar Code is a German-French production, and the show's creators drew inspiration from a range of sources, including:\n\n* The real-life events that unfolded in the 1990s\n* The book \"The Billion Dollar Code\" by Jürgen Kluge\n* The documentary \"The Billion Dollar Code\" by Jürgen Kluge\n\nThe show's creators took a deliberate approach to researching the events, selecting sources that would provide a accurate and nuanced understanding of the narrative.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* IMDb page\n* Rotten Tomatoes page", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Billion_Dollar_Code\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nThe plot follows two interconnected timelines In Berlin of the 1990s, a group of young hackers and art students had founded the ART+COM  [de] collaboration to play at the cutting edge of computer programming and digital art They had developed a planet browser in 1991 which was used by Joachim Sauter to get funding from Deutsche Telekom in 1993 to start the  successful development of TerraVision [3] In the series, the ART+COM beginnings were dropped, while several of the real persons and stakeholders were fused to a smaller cast, with the fictional Carsten Schlüter as the main artist and Juri Müller as the main programmer.\n\n\nTrivia\nThe miniseries dramatizes the lawsuit, the proceedings of which lasted until 2017 Art+Com lost at trial [8] and on appeal [9] The filmmakers used portions of the trial transcript to avoid coming into conflict with Google, [4] but key aspects of the trial were entirely fictionalized or omitted [8] The actual decision of the court was in fact based on other findings.\n\n\nDiscrepancies\nThe miniseries dramatizes the lawsuit, the proceedings of which lasted until 2017 Art+Com lost at trial [8] and on appeal [9] The filmmakers used portions of the trial transcript to avoid coming into conflict with Google, [4] but key aspects of the trial were entirely fictionalized or omitted [8] The actual decision of the court was in fact based on other findings.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nEpisodes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Lewis and Klitschko was to take place in December 2003, and Klitschko signed for a tune-up fight on 21 June 2003 as part of the undercard of Lewis's fight with Kirk Johnson for the IBO title, as the WBC would not sanction the fight for their title Johnson, however, pulled out of the fight due to injury and Klitschko, due to his being in training for a fight on the same day as Lewis, took the

punches Klitschko kept the hard-punching Nigerian off with an effective left jab and took control in the center of the ring Over eight rounds, Klitschko completely dismantled and outfought the younger champion After the eighth round, Peter slumped on his stool, shook his head and asked that the bout be stopped With the Samuel Peter victory, Klitschko technically became one of the few men to ever hold a version of the world heavyweight title three times—WBO (1999–2000), WBC (2004–2005) and WBC (2008–2013).\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Gómez, Arreola, Johnson\nOn 21 March 2009, Klitschko defeated Juan

when the referee stopped the fight in the ninth round as Gómez appeared unable to withstand any more hits.\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Sosnowski, Briggs, Solís\n\nOn 29 May 2010, Klitschko defeated Polish

currently cannot imagine\" [8] The WBC title was vacated and later contested by Chris Arreola and Bermane Stiverne [81] Commenting on his decision, he stated \"My focus is on politics in Ukraine and I feel the people there need me\" [8] He also added, \"I thank the WBC and its president José Sulaimán for the support in our battle for democracy and freedom in Ukraine\" Since his retirement, he has

described as being the best of his time, and George Foreman stated that he has the best straight left in the division [178] Both Klitschko brothers are considered the best heavyweight boxers of their era [179] Having remained undefeated for a large majority of their careers and refusing to fight each other, both brothers remained largely unchallenged throughout their careers Notably, both brothers were particularly well known for using their large size to nullify other heavyweights [180] In 2011, Wladimir and Vitali entered the Guinness World Records book as the pair of brothers with most world

In 2005, Vitali Klitschko was appointed an adviser to President Yushchenko. In October 2006, he was promoted to full-time adviser.\n\nEarly years in politics\nDuring the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election and the following Orange Revolution, the Klitschko brothers openly supported the candidacy of Viktor Yushchenko. In 2005, Vitali Klitschko was appointed an adviser to President Yushchenko. In October 2006, he was promoted to full-time adviser.\n\nPolitical views (until 2013)\nKlitschko is in favor of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union. He sees the European Union as Ukraine's \"model for [Ukraine's] future political and economic development.\" He believes former President Viktor Yanukovych and his government were \"deliberately destroying the integration (into Europe) prospects of Ukraine\" and that Ukrainian politicians have no right to let them \"rule after 2014.\" Klitschko is also in favor of NATO-Ukraine cooperation.\n\nMayor of Kyiv\nOn 28 February 2014, Klitschko confirmed that he would take part in the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election. On 29 March, he announced that he had changed his mind and would run for the post of Mayor of Kyiv in the 2014 Kyiv local election (including Mayoral elections) set for 25 May. In the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, Klitschko endorsed the candidacy of Petro Poroshenko. Klitschko won Kyiv's mayoral elections with almost 57% of the votes in the first round. He was sworn in as mayor on 5 June 2014. The same day, the Ukrainian parliament had deprived Klitschko of his MP mandate (Ukrainian MPs are not entitled to combine parliamentary activities with any other public employment). Poroshenko was elected President of Ukraine on 25 May 2014.\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nIn February 2022, Klitschko and his brother Wladimir Klitschko pledged to take up arms to protect the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began on 24 February. On 25 February, Klitschko posted a video on his Telegram channel to report on casualties in the capital city, stating, \"The night was difficult, but there are no Russian troops in the capital. The enemy is trying to break into the city, in particular, from [the direction of] Hostomel, Zhytomyr.\" On 11 March, Klitschko made a guest appearance on CNN's State of the Union.\n\nSporting legacy\nHaving never been knocked down, Vitali Klitschko is widely regarded as the tougher fighter of the two brothers. His 87% knockout percentage is regarded as one of the best knockout-to-fight ratios of any champion in heavyweight boxing history. Vitali was also known for being unusually dominant in his fights, having rarely lost a round in his professional career as a boxer.\n\nDuring his time as WBC champion, Vitali Klitschko was described as being the best of his time, and George Foreman stated that he has the best straight left in the division. Both Klitschko brothers are considered the best heavyweight boxers of their era. Having remained undefeated for a large majority of their careers and refusing to fight each other, both brothers remained largely unchallenged throughout their careers. Notably, both brothers were particularly well known for using their large size to nullify other heavyweights. In 2011, Wladimir and Vitali entered the Guinness World Records book as the pair of brothers with most world heavyweight title fight wins (30 at the time; 40 as of 2020).\n\nPersonal life\nKlitschko's father, Volodymyr Rodionovych Klitschko (1947–2011), was a Soviet Air Force major general and a Soviet military attaché in East Germany. Volodymyr's mother was Jewish. Part of Vitali's family died during Holodomor, while his great-grandfather and family members on the female line of his mother died in the Holocaust.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nProfessional boxing

contests by knockout On 1 April, Klitschko had a third title defense against the American Chris Byrd, who was a late replacement [37] Byrd made himself a difficult target and tried to thwart Klitschko's offense by being elusive Klitschko won most of the rounds and was heading towards a comprehensive points victory when he suffered a serious shoulder injury After the ninth round, Klitschko notified his corner that he had a shoulder pain and threw in the towel, thus handing Klitschko his first defeat and awarding Byrd the win by RTD At the time of the stoppage, Klitschko had won 8 of 9 rounds on one judge's scorecard, and 7 of 9 on the two others Klitschko, who was later diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff, received much criticism for quitting the fight Klitschko rebounded from his loss to Byrd by reeling off five victories in a row, earning himself a shot at WBC heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis.\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Lewis\nThe fight between Lewis and Klitschko was to take place in December 2003, and Klitschko signed for a tune-up fight on 21 June 2003 as part of the undercard of Lewis's fight with Kirk Johnson for the IBO title, as the WBC would not sanction the fight for their title Johnson, however, pulled out of the fight due to injury and Klitschko, due to his being in training for a fight on the same day as Lewis, took the fight on short notice Immediately after he accepted, the WBC elected to sanction the fight as a title match and Lewis's The Ring title was also up for grabs in addition to his lineal title.\n\n\nWBC and The Ring heavyweight champion\nKlitschko faced South African Corrie Sanders on 24 April 2004 for the WBC heavyweight championship and The Ring belts that had been vacated by Lewis Sanders had stopped younger brother Wladimir in the second round (TKO) on 8 March 2003 Klitschko took a heavy shot in round one by Sanders and was almost knocked down right at the end of the round, but by using upper-body movement and

He had been training to fight Hasim Rahman; however, nine days before the fight, he injured his leg while sparring He snapped his anterior cruciate ligament, which with surgery would take up to a year to heal and possibly prove career ending To avoid keeping the title out of use, he retired The WBC was grateful for his consideration On other occasions he cited regrets about his suddenly mounting injuries, a desire to leave the sport while still on top and political aspirations in his home country of Ukraine [45] Following his retirement, the WBC conferred \"champion emeritus\" status on Klitschko, and assured him he would become the mandatory challenger if and when he decided to return [46]\n\n\nSecond WBC heavyweight championship\nOn 3 August 2008 the WBC awarded Klitschko a chance to regain his WBC heavyweight title After Vitali's retirement, his younger brother had established dominance in the division, winning two of the four world titles available The reigning WBC Champion was Samuel Peter (who had lost a decision to Wladimir in 2005) At the time, there was interest in a potential Peter vs Wladimir unification match Instead, Vitali took advantage of his champion emeritus status and secured a title challenge against Peter The fight was arranged on 11 October 2008 at O2 World, Berlin It would be one of the most anticipated heavyweight fights in the past few years Both men had a rightful claim to being the champion and the stakes for the future of the heavyweight division were high Despite some questioning Klitschko's decision to return after almost four years, he managed to regain his title in dominating fashion Klitschko had Peter intimidated from the first round and stunned him with accurate hard punches Klitschko kept the hard-punching Nigerian off with an effective left jab and took control in the center of the ring Over eight rounds, Klitschko completely dismantled and outfought the younger champion After the eighth round, Peter slumped on his stool, shook his head and asked that the bout be stopped With the Samuel Peter victory, Klitschko technically became one of the few men to ever hold a version of the world heavyweight title three times—WBO (1999–2000), WBC (2004–2005) and WBC (2008–2013).\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Gómez, Arreola, Johnson\nOn 21 March 2009, Klitschko defeated Juan Carlos Gómez by TKO in the ninth round Gómez tried to use his movement to thwart Klitschko but seemed unable to cope with the power and physical strength of his opponent As the rounds progressed, Klitschko began imposing himself on Gómez more and more Gómez soon became wary of Klitschko's power and also began to tire physically By the sixth round, Klitschko was in total control The end came when the referee stopped the fight in the ninth round as Gómez appeared unable to withstand any more hits.\n\n\nKlitschko vs. Sosnowski, Briggs, Solís\n\nOn 29 May 2010, Klitschko defeated Polish heavyweight contender Albert Sosnowski by KO at 2:30 in round

Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.\n\nKlitschko vs. Adamek, Chisora, Charr\nNow aged 40, Klitschko retained his WBC heavyweight title against Tomasz Adamek on 10 September 2011 in Poland, winning by TKO in the 10th round, in the first ever PPV fight in Polish TV history [60] [61] The referee stopped the bout after Adamek received punishing blows and was ruled out, as he was no longer able to defend himself.\n\n\nRetirement from boxing\nOn 15 December 2013, Klitschko stepped back from boxing He was announced champion emeritus, which means that if he wants to return to boxing, he can fight the WBC heavyweight champion without having any fights beforehand [8] But (right after his retirement from boxing), Klitschko stated \"That is something I currently cannot imagine\" [8] The WBC title was vacated and later contested by Chris Arreola and Bermane Stiverne [81] Commenting on his decision, he stated \"My focus is on politics in Ukraine and I feel the people there need me\" [8] He also added, \"I thank the WBC and its president José Sulaimán for the support in our battle for democracy and freedom in Ukraine\" Since his retirement, he has maintained a limited level of training and has been in his brother's corner for most fights, most famously when he had an altercation with Anthony Joshua after Anthony Joshua vs Wladimir Klitschko [8]\n\n\nPolitical career\nDuring the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election and the following Orange Revolution, the Klitschko brothers openly supported the candidacy of Viktor Yushchenko [13] In 2005, Vitali Klitschko was appointed an adviser

She comes from a Jewish family who fled Poland and Russia, and she has held dual American and Danish citizenship since birth.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJohansson's father, Karsten Olaf Johansson, is an architect originally from Copenhagen, Denmark. Through him, she is a granddaughter of Ejner Johansson, an art historian, screenwriter, and film director, whose own father was Swedish. Her mother, New Yorker Melanie Sloan, has worked as a producer. Johansson has an older sister named Vanessa, who is also an actress, an older brother named Adrian, and a twin brother named Hunter. She also has an older half-brother named Christian from her father's first marriage.\n\n**Acting Career**\n\nJohansson's acting career began at a young age. At nine, she made her film debut as John Ritter's daughter in the fantasy comedy North (1994). She later played minor roles in films such as Just Cause (1995) and If Lucy Fell (1996). Her first leading role was as Amanda, the younger sister of a pregnant teenager who runs away from her foster home in Manny & Lo (1996) alongside Aleksa Palladino and her brother, Hunter. Her performance received positive reviews, with one critic noting that the film \"grows on you, largely because of the charm of... Scarlett Johansson.\" Johansson earned a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female for the role.\n\n**1994–2002: Early Work and Breakthrough**\n\nJohansson's early work consisted of playing minor roles in films such as North (1994), Just Cause (1995), and If Lucy Fell (1996). Her breakthrough role came in 1996 when she played Amanda, the younger sister of a pregnant teenager who runs away from her foster home in Manny & Lo (1996) alongside Aleksa Palladino and her brother, Hunter.

In the former, directed by Sofia Coppola, she plays Charlotte, a listless and lonely young wife, opposite Bill Murray. Coppola had first noticed Johansson in Manny & Lo, and compared her to a young Lauren Bacall. Johansson found the experience of working with a female director different because of Coppola's ability to empathize with her. Made on a budget of $4 million, the film grossed $119 million at the box office and received critical acclaim.\n\n**2005–2009: Collaborations with Woody Allen**\n\nJohansson played Nola, an aspiring actress who begins an affair with a married man (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) in Woody Allen's drama Match Point in 2005. After replacing Kate Winslet with Johansson for the role, Allen changed the character's nationality from British to American. An admirer of Allen's films, Johansson liked the idea of working with him, but felt nervous her first day on the set. The New York Times was impressed with the performances of Johansson and Rhys Meyers, and LaSalle, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, stated that Johansson \"is a powerhouse from the word go,\" with a performance that \"borders on astonishing.\" The film, a box office success, earned Johansson nominations for the Golden Globe and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n**2010–2013: Marvel Cinematic Universe and Worldwide Recognition**\n\nAspiring to appear on Broadway since childhood, Johansson made her debut in a 2010 revival of Arthur Miller's drama A View from the Bridge.

Johansson won the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play. Some critics and Broadway actors criticized the award committee's decision to reward the work of mainstream Hollywood actors, including Johansson. In response, she said that she understood the frustration, but had worked hard for her accomplishments. Continuing her work in the MCU, Johansson reprised her role as Black Widow in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). In the film, she joins forces with Captain America (Chris Evans) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) to uncover a conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D., while facing a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier.\n\n**2021–present: Black Widow Lawsuit and Professional Expansion**\n\nAfter a one-year screen absence, Johansson reprised her role as Black Widow in her own solo prequel film in 2021, on which she also served as an executive producer. Also starring Florence Pugh, the film is set after Captain America: Civil War, with Johansson's character on the run, confronting her past.

Christian performed the Killswitch on Omega, but Omega kicked out of the pin. When Christian tried for a Killswitch from the top rope, Omega raked the eyes and performed a One-Winged Angel from the top rope, then pinning Christian at 21 minutes and 20 seconds to win and retain the title.\n\n**Reception**\n\nAEW President and chief executive officer Tony Khan stated after the event that All Out was the most watched AEW PPV ever.

She is best known for directing the Academy Award-winning short film Bao (2018) and for her work as a story artist on several Pixar films, including Inside Out (2015) and Toy Story 4 (2019).\n\n**Early Life**\n\nShi was born on September 8, 1989, in Chongqing, Sichuan (now Chongqing municipality), as an only child. At the age of two, she immigrated to Canada with her parents, who settled in the province of Newfoundland. Shi spent six months in Newfoundland before moving to Toronto, where she grew up surrounded by art and animation. Her father, a college professor of fine arts and a landscape painter in China, was a significant influence on her early life and artistic development. Shi took inspiration and guidance from her mother's personality when directing Bao and recalls that \"My Chinese mom was always making sure I never wandered away too far, that I was safe.\"\n\nGrowing up, Shi was exposed to a wide range of films, including Studio Ghibli and Disney animations. These early experiences shaped her interest in animation and filmmaking. Shi's childhood fascination with films and animation eventually led her to pursue a career in the industry.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter graduating, Shi worked briefly as a cartooning instructor, where she emphasized character design and comic book creation. In 2011, she accepted a three-month internship at Pixar as a storyboard artist. This was her second attempt to join the animation studio, having initially been turned down by Pixar and other major animation studios, such as Disney and DreamWorks. Shi credits her father for encouraging her to reapply to Pixar, stating that she felt \"my voice was valued early on in my career, which is rare.\"\n\nShi's time at Pixar was instrumental in shaping her career as a storyboard artist and director. She worked on several films, including Inside Out, Toy Story 4, and Incredibles 2. Her experience at Pixar also provided her with valuable connections and opportunities to develop her skills and showcase her talent.\n\nIn 2014, Shi created an animated webcomic series titled My Food Fantasies, which featured \"outlandish\" situations involving food. This project allowed her to explore her interest in writing stories about food and experiment with different animation styles.\n\n**Directing**\n\nThe short film Bao (2018) was developed as a \"side-project\" before and during Shi's full-time work on Inside Out. Bao, alongside two other projects, was eventually pitched to her mentor, Pete Docter, and Pixar for support. The film was approved in 2015, making Shi the first woman to direct a short film for the studio.\n\nBao was an eight-minute short film that tells the story of a mother and son's relationship through a series of fantastical and food-filled adventures. The film premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival, where it was well-received by audiences and critics alike. Shi's work on Bao earned her widespread recognition and critical acclaim, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.\n\n**Influences**\n\nShi's work is influenced by her father's art and her mother's personality. She credits her father for teaching her about art and animation and for providing her with valuable guidance and support throughout her career. Shi also acknowledges the influence of Studio Ghibli and Disney animations on her work, stating that she was inspired by the creativity and imagination of these films.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n### Feature Films\n\n* Inside Out (2015) - storyboard artist\n* Toy Story 4 (2019) - storyboard artist\n* Incredibles 2 (2018) - storyboard artist\n\n### Short Films\n\n* Bao (2018) - director, writer, and storyboard artist\n\n### Television\n\n* None\n\n### Disney+ Original Specials\n\n* Turning Red (2022) - director, writer, and storyboard artist\n\n### Awards and Nominations\n\n* Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for Bao (2019)\n* Annie Award for Best Directing in an Animated Feature or Short Film for Bao (2019)\n* BAFTA Award for Best Short Animation for Bao (2019)\n\n### Notes\n\n* Shi is the first woman of color to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.\n* Shi is the first woman to direct a short film for Pixar.\n* Shi's work on Bao and Turning Red has been widely praised for its representation of Asian culture and experiences.\n\n### References\n\n* None\n\n### External Links\n\n* Domee Shi on IMDb\n* Domee Shi on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Domee_Shi\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nShi was born on 8 September 1989 [3] in Chongqing, Sichuan (now Chongqing municipality) as an only child before immigrating to Canada at the age of two with her parents [8] She spent six months in Newfoundland before moving to Toronto, where she grew up learning about art from her father [9] She was influenced by her father, who had been a college professor of fine arts and a landscape painter in China [9] [10] Shi took inspiration and guidance from her mother's personality when directing Bao [10] and Turning Red Shi recalls that \"My Chinese mom was always making sure I never wandered away too far, that I was safe.\" [10] One such moment, that eventually made its way into Turning Red, was when Shi was in her adolescence: at a time when she wanted to fit in with her peers, Shi and her friends were together at school when one of them spotted Shi's mother lurking behind a tree, making sure Shi was doing alright [11] During her childhood, Shi watched many Studio Ghibli and Disney films, which exposed her to Asian cinema and animation [12] [13]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating, Shi worked briefly as a cartooning instructor with an emphasis on character design and comic book creation [16] In 2011, she accepted a three-month internship at Pixar as a storyboard artist This was her second attempt (her father was the one who encouraged her to apply again), [17] having initially been turned down by the animation studio and others, such as Disney and DreamWorks On her internship at Pixar and eventually full-time job, Shi states, \"I felt that my voice was valued early on in my career, which is rare.\" [18] Shi wrote an animated webcomic series titled My Food Fantasies in 2014, in which she drew \"outlandish\" situations involving food [19] Shi later said that she developed her interest in writing stories about food while making My Food Fantasies [20] The first feature film she worked on with Pixar was Inside Out (2015), on which she served as a storyboard artist [12] After briefly working on The Good Dinosaur, Shi began working on Toy Story 4 in 2015 [14] She also drew storyboards for the 2018 film Incredibles 2, where she worked on a sequence featuring the characters Jack-Jack and Edna Mode [21]\n\n\nDirecting\nThe short film Bao (2018) was developed as a \"side-project\" before and during Shi's full-time work on Inside Out [10] Bao, alongside two other projects, was eventually pitched to her mentor, Pete Docter, and Pixar for support [13] Bao was approved in 2015, making Shi the first woman to direct a short film for the studio [22] The eight-minute short debuted at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival, where it preceded Incredibles 2 in theaters [23] Shi won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for Bao, [24] becoming the first woman of color to win the award [25]\n\n\nInfluences\nShi is influenced by her father's art, as he was her art teacher while growing up \"Like, I asked him what he thought  [of the film] and he said, 'I really liked it, but I also have notes for you.'

{"title": "Kosovo", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Kosovo is of South Slavic origin Kosovo (Serbian Cyrillic: Косово) is the Serbian neuter possessive adjective of kos (кос), 'blackbird', [22] [23] an ellipsis for Kosovo Polje, 'Blackbird Field', the name of a karst field situated in the eastern half of today's Kosovo and the site of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo Field [24] The name of the karst field was for the first time applied to a wider area when the Ottoman Vilayet of Kosovo was created in 1877.\n\n\nModern usage\nSome Albanians also prefer to refer to Kosovo as Dardania, the name of an ancient kingdom and later Roman province, which covered the territory of modern-day Kosovo The name is derived from the ancient tribe of the Dardani, which is considered be related to the Proto-Albanian term dardā, which means \"pear\" (Modern Albanian: dardhë) [24] [27] The former Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova had been an enthusiastic backer of a \"Dardanian\" identity, and the Kosovar presidential flag and seal refer to this national identity However, the name \"Kosova\" remains more widely used among the Albanian population The flag of Dardania remains in use as the official Presidential seal and standard and is heavily featured in the institution of the presidency of the country.\n\n\nHistory\nThe strategic position including the abundant natural resources were favorable for the development of human settlements in Kosovo, as is highlighted by the hundreds of archaeological sites identified throughout its territory [30]\n\n\nAncient history\nThe strategic position including the abundant natural resources were favorable for the development of human settlements in Kosovo, as is highlighted by the hundreds of archaeological sites identified throughout its territory [30]\n\n\nRoman period\nDuring Roman rule, Kosovo was part of two provinces, with its western part being part of Praevalitana, and the vast majority of its modern territory belonging to Dardania Praevalitana and the rest of Illyria was conquered by the Roman Republic in 168 BC On the other hand, Dardania maintained its independence until the year 28 BC, when the Romans, under Augustus, annexed it into their Republic [35] [36] Dardania eventually became a part of the Moesia province [37] During the reign of Diocletian, Dardania became a full Roman province and the entirety of Kosovo's modern territory became a part of the Diocese of Moesia, and then during the second half of the 4th century, it became part of the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum [38]: 548 \n\n\nMiddle Ages\nIn the next centuries, Kosovo was a frontier province of the Roman, and later of the Byzantine Empire, and as a result it changed hands frequently The region was exposed to an increasing number of raids from the 4th century CE onward, culminating with the Slavic migrations of the 6th and 7th centuries Toponymic evidence suggests that Albanian was probably spoken in Kosovo prior to the Slavic settlement of the region [47] [48] The overwhelming presence of towns and municipalities in Kosovo with Slavic in their toponymy suggests that the Slavic migrations either assimilated or drove out population groups already living in Kosovo [49]\n\n\nOttoman rule\nIn 1389, as the Ottoman Empire expanded northwards through the Balkans, Ottoman forces under Sultan Murad I met with a Christian coalition led by Moravian Serbia under Prince Lazar in the Battle of Kosovo Both sides suffered heavy losses and the battle was a stalemate and it was even reported as a Christian victory at first, but Serbian manpower was depleted and de facto Serbian rulers could not raise another equal force to the Ottoman army [60] [61] [62] [63]\n\n\nRise of nationalism\nIn the 19th century, there was an awakening of ethnic nationalism throughout the Balkans The underlying ethnic tensions became part of a broader struggle of Christian Serbs against Muslim Albanians [61] The ethnic Albanian nationalism movement was centred in Kosovo In 1878 the League of Prizren (Lidhja e Prizrenit) was formed, a political organisation that sought to unify all the Albanians of the Ottoman Empire in a common struggle for autonomy and greater cultural rights, [71] although they generally desired the continuation of the Ottoman Empire [72] The League was dis-established in 1881 but enabled the awakening of a national identity among Albanians, [73] whose ambitions competed with those of the Serbs, the Kingdom of Serbia wishing to incorporate this land that had formerly been within its empire.\n\n\nCommunist Yugoslavia\nThe existing province took shape in 1945 as the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija, with a final demarcation in 1959 [102] [103] Until 1945, the only entity bearing the name of Kosovo in the late modern period had been the Vilayet of Kosovo, a political unit created by the Ottoman Empire in 1877 However, those borders were different [104]\n\n\nKosovo War\nInter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s In 1989, Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia and started cultural oppression of the ethnic Albanian population [118] Kosovar Albanians responded with a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience and creation of parallel structures in education, medical care, and taxation, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo [119]\n\n\nUnited Nations administration\nOn 10 June 1999, the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration (UNMIK) and authorised Kosovo Force (KFOR), a NATO-led peacekeeping force Resolution 1244 provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and affirmed the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, which has been legally succeeded by the Republic of Serbia [154]\n\n\nDeclaration of independence\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 [172] As of 4 September 2020, 114 UN states recognised its independence, including all of its immediate neighbours, with the exception of Serbia; [173] 10 states have subsequently withdrawn that recognition [174] [175] Of the UN Security Council members, while the US, UK and France do recognise Kosovo's independence, Russia and China do not [176] Since declaring independence, it has become a member of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, [177] [178] though not of the United Nations.\n\n\nGovernance\nKosovo is a multi-party parliamentary representative democratic republic It is governed by legislative, executive and judicial institutions, which derive from the constitution, although, until the Brussels Agreement, North Kosovo was in practice largely controlled by institutions of Serbia or parallel institutions funded by Serbia Legislative functions are vested in both the Parliament and the ministers within their competencies The Government exercises the executive power and is composed of the Prime Minister as the head of government, the Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of the various ministries.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe foreign relations of Kosovo are conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Pristina As of 2023 [update], 104 out of 193 United Nations member states recognise the Republic of Kosovo Within the European Union, it is recognised by 22 of 27 members and is a potential candidate for the future enlargement of the European Union [188] [189] On 15 December 2022 Kosovo filed a formal application to become a member of the European Union [21]\n\n\nLaw\nThe judicial system of Kosovo follows a civil law framework and comprises regular civil and criminal courts, alongside administrative courts Administered by the judicial council in Pristina, the system includes the supreme court as the highest judicial authority, a constitutional court and an independent prosecutorial institution Following the independence of Kosovo in 2008, the Kosovo Police assumed the primary law enforcement responsibilities within the country.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Kosovo Security Force (KSF) is the national security force of Kosovo commissioned with the task of preserving and safeguarding the country's territorial integrity, national sovereignty and the security interests of its population [199] Functioning under the president of Kosovo as the commander-in-chief, the security force adheres to the principle of non-discrimination, guaranteeing equal protection for its personnel regardless of gender or ethnicity [199] [200] Kosovo's notable challenges are identified in the realms of persistent conflicts and societal safety and security, both of which are intertwined with the country's diplomatic ties to neighboring countries and its domestic social and political stability [201]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nKosovo is divided into seven districts (Albanian: rajon; Serbian: okrug), according to the Law of Kosovo and the Brussels Agreement of 2013, which stipulated the formation of new municipalities with Serb majority populations The districts are further subdivided into 38 municipalities (komunë; opština) The largest and most populous district of Kosovo is the District of Pristina with the capital in Pristina, having a surface area of 2,470 km2 (953.67 sq mi) and a population of 477,312.\n\n\nGeography\nDefined in a total area of 10,887 square kilometres (4,203 square miles), Kosovo is landlocked and located in the center of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeastern Europe It lies between latitudes 42° and 43° N, and longitudes 20° and 22° E [209] The northernmost point is Bellobërda at 43° 14' 06\" northern latitude; the southernmost is Restelicë at 41° 56' 40\" northern latitude; the westernmost point is Bogë at 20° 3' 23\" eastern longitude; and the easternmost point is Desivojca at 21° 44' 21\" eastern longitude The highest point of Kosovo is Gjeravica at 2,656 metres (8,714 ft) above sea level, [210] [211] [212] and the lowest is the White Drin at 297 metres (974 ft).\n\n\nClimate\nMost of Kosovo experiences predominantly a Continental climate with Mediterranean and Alpine influences, [216] strongly influenced by Kosovo's proximity to the Adriatic Sea in the west, the Aegean Sea in the south as well as the European continental landmass in the north [217]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nLocated in Southeastern Europe, Kosovo receives floral and faunal species from Europe and Eurasia Forests are widespread in Kosovo and cover at least 39% of the region Phytogeographically, it straddles the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom In addition, it falls within three terrestrial ecoregions: Balkan mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests, and Pindus Mountains mixed forests [220] Kosovo's biodiversity is conserved in two national parks, eleven nature reserves and one hundred three other protected areas [221] The Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park and Sharr Mountains National Park are the most important regions of vegetation and biodiversity in Kosovo [222] Kosovo had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.19/10, ranking it 107th globally out of 172 countries [223]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues\nEnvironmental issues in Kosovo include a wide range of challenges pertaining to air and water pollution, climate change, waste management, biodiversity loss and nature conservation [227] The vulnerability of the country to climate change is influenced by various factors, such as increased temperatures, geological and hydrological hazards, including droughts, flooding, fires and rains [227] Kosovo is not a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement [228] Consequently, the country is not mandated to submit a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that are voluntary commitments outlining a nation's actions and strategies for mitigating climate change and adapting to its impacts [228] However, since 2021, Kosovo is actively engaged in the process of formulating a voluntary NDC, with assistance provided from Japan [228] [229] In 2023, the country has established a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 16.3% as part of its broader objective to achieve carbon neutrality by the year 2050 [229]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe Agency of Statistics estimated Kosovo's population in 2021 to be approximately 1,774,000 [230] In 2023, the overall life expectancy at birth is 79.68 years; 77.38 years for males and 81.87 years for females [231] The estimated total fertility rate in 2023 is 1.88 children born per woman [232] The country is the 11th most populous country in the Southeastern Europe (Balkans) and ranks as the 148th most populous country in the world The country's population rose steadily over the 20th century and peaked at an estimated 2.2 million in 1998 The Kosovo War and subsequent migration have decreased the population of Kosovo over time  \n\n\nReligion\nKosovo is a secular state with no state religion; freedom of belief, conscience and religion is

tolerance towards religion and atheism [250] [251]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Kosovo is a transitional economy It suffered from the combined results of political upheaval, the Serbian dismissal of Kosovo employees and the following Yugoslav Wars Despite declining foreign assistance, the GDP has mostly grown since its declaration of independence This was despite the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the subsequent European debt crisis Additionally, the inflation rate has been low Most economic development has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the diaspora, foreign direct investment, and other capital inflows [258] In 2018, the International Monetary Fund reported that approximately one-sixth of the population lived below the poverty line and one-third of the working age population was unemployed, the highest rate in Europe [259]\n\n\nEnergy\nThe electricity sector in Kosovo is considered one of the sectors with the greatest potential of development [278] Kosovo's electricity sector is highly dependent on coal-fired power plants, which use the abundant lignite, so efforts are being made to diversify electricity generation with more renewables sources, such as wind farms in Bajgora and Kitka [279] [280]\n\n\nTourism\nThe natural values of Kosovo represent quality tourism resources The description of Kosovo's potential in tourism is closely related to its geographical location, in the center of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeastern Europe It represents a crossroads which historically dates back to antiquity Kosovo serves as a link in the connection between Central and Southern Europe and the Adriatic Sea and Black Sea Kosovo is generally rich in various topographical features, including high mountains, lakes, canyons, steep rock formations and rivers [283] The mountainous west and southeast of Kosovo has great potential for winter tourism Skiing takes place at the Brezovica ski resort within the Šar Mountains, [283] with the close proximity to the Pristina Airport (60 km) and Skopje International Airport (70 km) which is a popular destination for international tourists.\n\n\nTransport\nRoad transportation of passengers and freight is the most common form of transportation in Kosovo There are two main motorways in Kosovo: the R7 connecting Kosovo with Albania and the R6 connecting Pristina to the Macedonian border at Hani i Elezit The construction of the R7.1 Motorway began in 2017.\n\n\nInfrastructure\nIn the past, Kosovo's capabilities to develop a modern health care system were limited [290] Low GDP during 1990 worsened the situation even more However, the establishment of Faculty of Medicine in the University of Pristina marked a significant development in health care This was also followed by launching different health clinics which enabled better conditions for professional development [290]\n\n\nHealth\nIn the past, Kosovo's

traditions [300] This combination reflects Kosovo's diverse historical and cultural contexts while highlighting its Albanian heritage [300] [301] A paramount aspect of this tradition is the principle of hospitality, as articulated in the Kanun, which guides various aspects of social interactions and practices [302] Particularly, the notion \"the house of an Albanian belongs to God and to the guest\" underscores the high regard on treating guests with respect and generosity [302] Fli stands out for its unique preparation, which involves layering batter and cream in a special pan called a saç, baked slowly over several hours [303] Pite, a savory pie filled with a mixture of meat, cheese, or spinach, is often enjoyed as a hearty meal throughout Kosovo Another popular dish is Byrek, a flaky pastry that can be filled with a variety of ingredients, including meat, spinach, or cheese, and is often prepared in circular pans [303] Qebapa are hand-rolled sausages, traditionally made from a blend of minced beef and other meats, are seasoned with a mix of spices such as garlic and black pepper [300] They are commonly served alongside freshly baked bread, raw onions and ajvar, a popular savory red pepper, eggplant and garlic spread that complements the dish [300] Petulla, or fried dough balls also known as Llokuma, are often drizzled with honey or sprinkled with sugar Reçel, a type

athletes such as Aziz Salihu, Vladimir Durković, Fahrudin Jusufi, and Milutin Šoškić represented Yugoslavia, thereby contributing to the diverse athletic heritage of Kosovo [312]\n\n\nArts\nThe architecture of Kosovo dates back to the Neolithic, Bronze and Middle Ages It has been influenced by the presence of different civilisations and religions as evidenced by the structures which have survived to this day.\n\n\nMusic\n\nAlthough the music in Kosovo is diverse, authentic Albanian and Serbian music still exist Albanian music is characterised by the use of the Çifteli Classical music

Its strategic position, abundant natural resources, and favorable climate have made it an attractive location for human settlements throughout history. The country's name, Kosovo, is derived from the South Slavic word \"kos,\" meaning \"blackbird,\" and refers to the Blackbird Field, a karst field situated in the eastern half of today's Kosovo.\n\n**Modern usage**\n\nSome Albanians refer to Kosovo as Dardania, the name of an ancient kingdom and later Roman province, which covered the territory of modern-day Kosovo. The name is derived from the ancient tribe of the Dardani, which is considered related to the Proto-Albanian term \"dardā,\" meaning \"pear.\" The former Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova was an enthusiastic backer of a \"Dardanian\" identity, and the Kosovar presidential flag and seal refer to this national identity. However, the name \"Kosova\" remains more widely used among the Albanian population.\n\n**History**\n\nThe strategic position of Kosovo, including its abundant natural resources, has made it an attractive location for human settlements throughout history. The country's history dates back to the Neolithic period, with archaeological sites identified throughout its territory. During the Roman period, Kosovo was part of two provinces, with its western part belonging to Praevalitana and the majority of its modern territory belonging to Dardania.\n\n**Roman period**\n\nDuring Roman rule, Kosovo was part of two provinces, with its western part being part of Praevalitana, and the vast majority of its modern territory belonging to Dardania. Praevalitana and the rest of Illyria were conquered by the Roman Republic in 168 BC. On the other hand, Dardania maintained its independence until the year 28 BC, when the Romans, under Augustus, annexed it into their Republic. Dardania eventually became a part of the Moesia province. During the reign of Diocletian, Dardania became a full Roman province, and the entirety of Kosovo's modern territory became a part of the Diocese of Moesia. Later, it became part of the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum.\n\n**Middle Ages**\n\nIn the next centuries, Kosovo was a frontier province of the Roman, and later of the Byzantine Empire, and as a result, it changed hands frequently. The region was exposed to an increasing number of raids from the 4th century CE onward, culminating with the Slavic migrations of the 6th and 7th centuries. Toponymic evidence suggests that Albanian was probably spoken in Kosovo prior to the Slavic settlement of the region.\n\n**Ottoman rule**\n\nIn 1389, as the Ottoman Empire expanded northwards through the Balkans, Ottoman forces under Sultan Murad I met with a Christian coalition led by Moravian Serbia under Prince Lazar in the Battle of Kosovo. Both sides suffered heavy losses, and the battle was a stalemate, with the Christian coalition initially reported as a victory, but Serbian manpower was depleted, and de facto, Serbian rulers could not raise another equal force to the Ottoman army.\n\n**Rise of nationalism**\n\nIn the 19th century, ethnic nationalism awakened throughout the Balkans, and the underlying ethnic tensions became part of a broader struggle of Christian Serbs against Muslim Albanians. The ethnic Albanian nationalism movement was centered in Kosovo, and in 1878, the League of Prizren was formed, a political organization that sought to unify all the Albanians of the Ottoman Empire in a common struggle for autonomy and greater cultural rights. The League was disestablished in 1881, but it enabled the awakening of a national identity among Albanians, whose ambitions competed with those of the Serbs, who wished to incorporate this land that had formerly been within their empire.\n\n**Communist Yugoslavia**\n\nThe existing province took shape in 1945 as the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija, with a final demarcation in 1959. Until 1945, the only entity bearing the name of Kosovo in the late modern period had been the Vilayet of Kosovo, a political unit created by the Ottoman Empire in 1877, but with different borders.\n\n**Kosovo War**\n\nInter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In 1989, Serbian President Slobodan Milošević drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia and started cultural oppression of the ethnic Albanian population. Kosovar Albanians responded with a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience and creation of parallel structures in education, medical care, and taxation, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.\n\n**United Nations administration**\n\nOn 10 June 1999, the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration (UNMIK) and authorized Kosovo Force (KFOR), a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Resolution 1244 provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and affirmed the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, which has been legally succeeded by the Republic of Serbia.\n\n**Declaration of independence**\n\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008. As of 4 September 2020, 114 UN states recognized its independence, including all of its immediate neighbors, with the exception of Serbia. Of the UN Security Council members, while the US, UK, and France recognize Kosovo's independence, Russia and China do not. Since declaring independence, Kosovo has become a member of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, but not of the United Nations.\n\n**Governance**\n\nKosovo is a multi-party parliamentary representative democratic republic. It is governed by legislative, executive, and judicial institutions, which derive from the constitution, although, until the Brussels Agreement, North Kosovo was in practice largely controlled by institutions of Serbia or parallel institutions funded by Serbia. Legislative functions are vested in both the Parliament and the ministers within their competencies. The Government exercises the executive power and is composed of the Prime Minister as the head of government, the Deputy Prime Ministers, and the Ministers of the various ministries.\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nThe foreign relations of Kosovo are conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Pristina. As of 2023, 104 out of 193 United Nations member states recognize the Republic of Kosovo. Within the European Union, it is recognized by 22 of 27 members and is a potential candidate for the future enlargement of the European Union. On 15 December 2022, Kosovo filed a formal application to become a member of the European Union.\n\n**Law**\n\nThe judicial system of Kosovo follows a civil law framework and comprises regular civil and criminal courts, alongside administrative courts. Administered by the judicial council in Pristina, the system includes the supreme court as the highest judicial authority, a constitutional court, and an independent prosecutorial institution.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe Kosovo Security Force (KSF) is the national security force of Kosovo, commissioned with the task of preserving and safeguarding the country's territorial integrity, national sovereignty, and the security interests of its population. Functioning under the president of Kosovo as the commander-in-chief, the security force adheres to the principle of non-discrimination, guaranteeing equal protection for its personnel regardless of gender or ethnicity.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nKosovo is divided into seven districts (Albanian: rajon; Serbian: okrug), according to the Law of Kosovo and the Brussels Agreement of 2013, which stipulated the formation of new municipalities with Serb majority populations. The districts are further subdivided into 38 municipalities (komunë; opština). The largest and most populous district of Kosovo is the District of Pristina with the capital in Pristina, having a surface area of 2,470 km² and a population of 477,312.\n\n**Geography**\n\nDefined in a total area of 10,887 square kilometers, Kosovo is landlocked and located in the center of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeastern Europe. It lies between latitudes 42° and 43° N, and longitudes 20° and 22° E. The northernmost point is Bellobërda at 43° 14' 06\" northern latitude, the southernmost is Restelicë at 41° 56' 40\" northern latitude, the westernmost point is Bogë at 20° 3' 23\" eastern longitude, and the easternmost point is Desivojca at 21° 44' 21\" eastern longitude.\n\n**Climate**\n\nMost of Kosovo experiences predominantly a Continental climate with Mediterranean and Alpine influences, strongly influenced by Kosovo's proximity to the Adriatic Sea in the west, the Aegean Sea in the south, and the European continental landmass in the north.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nLocated in Southeastern Europe, Kosovo receives floral and faunal species from Europe and Eurasia. Forests are widespread in Kosovo and cover at least 39% of the region. Phytogeographically, it straddles the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. Additionally, it falls within three terrestrial ecoregions: Balkan mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests, and Pindus Mountains mixed forests.\n\n**Environmental issues**\n\nEnvironmental issues in Kosovo include a wide range of challenges pertaining to air and water pollution, climate change, waste management, biodiversity loss, and nature conservation. The vulnerability of the country to climate change is influenced by various factors, such as increased temperatures, geological and hydrological hazards, including droughts, flooding, fires, and rains.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe Agency of Statistics estimated Kosovo's population in 2021 to be approximately 1,774,000. In 2023, the overall life expectancy at birth is 79.68 years, with 77.38 years for males and 81.87 years for females. The estimated total fertility rate in 2023 is 1.88 children born per woman.\n\n**Religion**\n\nKosovo is a secular state with no state religion; freedom of belief, conscience, and religion is explicitly guaranteed in the Constitution of Kosovo.

metres (8,714 ft) above sea level, [210] [211] [212] and the lowest is the White Drin at 297 metres (974 ft).\n\n\nClimate\nMost of Kosovo experiences predominantly a Continental climate with Mediterranean and Alpine influences, [216] strongly influenced by Kosovo's proximity to the Adriatic Sea in the west, the Aegean Sea in the south as well as the European continental landmass in the north [217]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nLocated in Southeastern Europe, Kosovo receives floral and faunal species from Europe and Eurasia Forests are widespread in Kosovo and cover at least 39% of the region Phytogeographically, it straddles the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom In addition, it falls within three terrestrial ecoregions: Balkan mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests, and Pindus Mountains mixed forests [220] Kosovo's biodiversity is conserved in two national parks, eleven nature reserves and one hundred three other protected areas [221] The Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park and Sharr Mountains National Park are the most important regions of vegetation and biodiversity in Kosovo [222] Kosovo had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.19/10, ranking it 107th globally out of 172 countries [223]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues\nEnvironmental issues in Kosovo include a wide range of challenges pertaining to air and water pollution, climate change, waste management, biodiversity loss and nature conservation [227] The vulnerability of the country to climate change is influenced by various factors, such as increased temperatures, geological and hydrological hazards, including droughts, flooding, fires and rains [227] Kosovo is not a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement [228] Consequently, the country is not mandated to submit a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that are voluntary commitments outlining a nation's actions and strategies for mitigating climate change and adapting to its impacts [228] However, since 2021, Kosovo is actively engaged in the process of formulating a voluntary NDC, with assistance provided from Japan [228] [229] In 2023, the country has established a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 16.3% as part of its broader objective to achieve carbon neutrality by the year 2050 [229]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe Agency of Statistics estimated Kosovo's population in 2021 to be approximately 1,774,000 [230] In 2023, the overall life expectancy at birth is 79.68 years; 77.38 years for males and 81.87 years for females [231] The estimated total fertility rate in 2023 is 1.88 children born per woman [232] The country is the 11th most populous country in the Southeastern Europe (Balkans) and ranks as the 148th most populous country in the world The country's population rose steadily over the 20th century and peaked at an estimated 2.2 million in 1998 The Kosovo War and subsequent migration have decreased the population of Kosovo over time  \n\n\nReligion\nKosovo is a secular state with no state religion; freedom of belief, conscience and religion is explicitly guaranteed in the Constitution of Kosovo [249] [184] [185] Kosovar society is strongly secularised and is ranked first in Southern Europe and ninth in the world as free and equal for tolerance towards religion and atheism [250] [251]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Kosovo is a transitional economy It suffered from the combined results of political upheaval, the Serbian dismissal of Kosovo employees and the following Yugoslav Wars Despite declining foreign assistance, the GDP has mostly grown since its declaration of independence This was despite the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the subsequent European debt crisis Additionally, the inflation rate has been low Most economic development has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the diaspora, foreign direct investment, and other capital inflows [258] In 2018, the International Monetary Fund reported that approximately one-sixth of the population lived below the poverty line and one-third of the working age population was unemployed, the highest rate in Europe [259]\n\n\nEnergy\nThe electricity sector in Kosovo is considered one of the sectors with the greatest potential of development [278] Kosovo's electricity sector is highly dependent on coal-fired power plants, which use the abundant lignite, so efforts are being made to diversify electricity generation with more renewables sources, such as wind farms in Bajgora and Kitka [279] [280]\n\n\nTourism\nThe natural values of Kosovo represent quality tourism resources The description of Kosovo's potential in tourism is closely related to its geographical location, in the center of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeastern Europe It represents a crossroads which historically dates back to antiquity Kosovo serves as a link in the connection between Central and Southern Europe and the Adriatic Sea and Black Sea Kosovo is generally rich in various topographical features, including high mountains, lakes, canyons, steep rock formations and rivers [283] The mountainous west and southeast of Kosovo has great potential for winter tourism Skiing takes place at the Brezovica ski resort within the Šar Mountains, [283] with the close proximity to the Pristina Airport (60 km) and Skopje International Airport (70 km) which is a popular destination for international tourists.\n\n\nTransport\nRoad transportation of passengers and freight is the most common form of transportation in Kosovo There are two main motorways in Kosovo: the R7 connecting Kosovo with Albania and the R6 connecting Pristina to the Macedonian border at Hani i Elezit The construction of the R7.1 Motorway began in 2017.\n\n\nInfrastructure\nIn the past, Kosovo's capabilities to develop a modern health care system were limited [290] Low GDP during 1990 worsened the situation even more However, the establishment of Faculty of Medicine in the University of Pristina marked a significant development in health care This was also followed by launching different health clinics which enabled better conditions for professional development [290]\n\n\nHealth\nIn the past, Kosovo's

Pristina marked a significant development in health care This was also followed by launching different health clinics which enabled better conditions for professional development [290]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels is predominantly public and supported by the state, run by the Ministry of Education Education takes place in two main stages: primary and secondary education, and higher education.\n\n\nMedia\nKosovo ranks 56th out of 180 countries in the 2023 Press Freedom Index report compiled by the Reporters Without Borders [298] The Media consists of different kinds of communicative media such as radio, television, newspapers, and internet web sites Most of the media survive from advertising and subscriptions As according to IREX there are 92 radio stations and 22 television stations [299]\n\n\nCulture\nKosovar cuisine is distinguished by multifaceted culinary influences derived from Balkan, Mediterranean, and Ottoman traditions [300] This combination reflects Kosovo's diverse historical and cultural contexts while highlighting its Albanian heritage [300] [301] A paramount aspect of this tradition is the principle of hospitality, as articulated in the Kanun, which guides various aspects of social interactions and practices [302] Particularly, the notion \"the house of an Albanian belongs to God and to the guest\" underscores the high regard on treating guests with respect and generosity [302] Fli stands out for its unique preparation, which involves layering batter and cream in a special pan called a saç, baked slowly over several hours [303] Pite, a savory pie filled with a mixture of meat, cheese, or spinach, is often enjoyed as a hearty meal throughout Kosovo Another popular dish is Byrek, a flaky pastry that can be filled with a variety of ingredients, including meat, spinach, or cheese, and is often prepared in circular pans [303] Qebapa are hand-rolled sausages, traditionally made from a blend of minced beef and other meats, are seasoned with a mix of spices such as garlic and black pepper [300] They are commonly served alongside freshly baked bread, raw onions and ajvar, a popular savory red pepper, eggplant and garlic spread that complements the dish [300] Petulla, or fried dough balls also known as Llokuma, are often drizzled with honey or sprinkled with sugar Reçel, a type of fruit preserve, is made from various fruits and often used as a spread on bread or served alongside petulla.\n\n\nCuisine\nKosovar cuisine is distinguished by multifaceted culinary influences

often drizzled with honey or sprinkled with sugar Reçel, a type of fruit preserve, is made from various fruits and often used as a spread on bread or served alongside petulla.\n\n\nSports\nSince its declaration of independence in 2008, Kosovo has made substantial advancements in international sports The nation's inaugural participation in the Olympic Games occurred at the 2016 games, where it achieved a milestone by securing its first medals, totaling five medals to date [304] Kosovo's involvement in the European Games began in 2015, during which the nation amassed four medals Additionally, Kosovo commenced participation in the Mediterranean Games in 2018, achieving success with a total of ten medals [305] [306] Forthcoming, Kosovo is scheduled to host the 2030 games, marking a significant opportunity for the nation in the realm of international sports [307] [308] Notable athletes such as Laura Fazliu, Akil Gjakova, Nora Gjakova, Majlinda Kelmendi, Loriana Kuka, and Distria Krasniqi have played vital roles in Kosovo's sporting achievements, with Majlinda Kelmendi being particularly recognised for winning the nation's first Olympic gold medal [309] Judo has become a cornerstone of Kosovo's success in international competitions, accounting for the majority of the nation's medals across various events [310] [311] Prior to Kosovo's independence, notable athletes such as Aziz Salihu, Vladimir Durković, Fahrudin Jusufi, and Milutin Šoškić represented Yugoslavia, thereby contributing to the diverse athletic heritage of Kosovo [312]\n\n\nArts\nThe architecture of Kosovo dates back to the Neolithic, Bronze and Middle Ages It has been influenced by the presence of different civilisations and religions as evidenced by the structures which have survived to this day.\n\n\nMusic\n\nAlthough the music in Kosovo is diverse, authentic Albanian and Serbian music still exist Albanian music is characterised by the use of the Çifteli Classical music is well known in Kosovo and has been taught at several music schools and universities In 2014, Kosovo submitted their first film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, with Three Windows and a Hanging directed by Isa Qosja [323]\n\nCinema\nThe film industry of Kosovo dates from the 1970s In 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established Kosovafilm, a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved Kosovafilm was reestablished after Yugoslav withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.\n\n\nSee also\n Wikimedia Atlas of Kosovo\n\n\nNotes\n Wikimedia Atlas of Kosovo\n\n\nReferences\n Wikimedia Atlas of Kosovo\n\n\nSources\n Wikimedia Atlas of Kosovo\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Szlachta", "content": "\nHistory\nIn Polish, a nobleman is called a \"szlachcic\" and a noblewoman a \"szlachcianka\".\n\n\nEtymology\nIn Polish, a nobleman is called a \"szlachcic\" and a noblewoman a \"szlachcianka\".\n\n\nComposition\nAdam Zamoyski argues that the szlachta were not exactly the same as the European nobility nor a gentry, [8] as the szlachta fundamentally differed in law, rights, political power, origin, and composition from the feudal nobility of Western Europe [8] [9] [30] Feudalism never took root in Poland [6] The szlachta did not rank below the king, [4] as the szlachta's relationship to the Polish king was not feudal The szlachta stood as equals before the king [5] The king was not an autocrat, nor the szlachta's overlord, as szlachta land was in allodium, not feudal tenure [11] Feudal dependence upon a Polish king did not exist for the szlachta [5] and earlier in history some high-ranking szlachta (magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms and constantly sought to undermine Piast authority [10]: 75, 76 \n\n\nOrigins\nThe origins of the szlachta, while ancient, have always been considered obscure [10]: 207  As a result, its members often referred to it as odwieczna (perennial) [10]: 207  Two popular historical theories about its origins have been put forward by its members and early historians and chroniclers The first theory involved a presumed descent from the ancient Iranian tribe known as Sarmatians, who in the 2nd century AD, occupied lands in Eastern Europe, and the Middle East The second theory involved a presumed szlachta descent from Japheth, one of Noah's sons By contrast, the peasantry were said to be the offspring of another son of Noah, Ham — and hence subject to bondage under the Curse of Ham The Jews were considered the offspring of Shem [40] [41] [42] Other fanciful theories included its foundation by Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, or regional leaders who had not mixed their bloodlines with those of 'slaves, prisoners, or aliens' [10]: 207  [10]: 208 \n\n\nPoland\nThe origins of the szlachta, while ancient, have always

Great, or regional leaders who had not mixed their bloodlines with those of 'slaves, prisoners, or aliens' [10]: 207  [10]: 208 \n\n\nMilitary caste and aristocracy\nThe szlachta were a caste, [37] a military caste, as in Hindu society [21] [26] In the year 1244, Bolesław, Duke of Masovia, identified members of the knights' clan as members of a genealogia:\n\n\nLithuania\nIn Lithuania Propria and in Samogitia, prior to the creation of the Kingdom of Lithuania by Mindaugas, nobles were called die beste leuten in German sources In Lithuanian, nobles were named ponai The higher nobility were named kunigai or kunigaikščiai (dukes) — a loanword from Scandinavian konung They were the established local leaders and warlords During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the King of Lithuania Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of Ruthenia in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared — bajorai, from Ruthenian бояре This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\n\nRuthenia\nAfter the principalities of Halych and Volhynia became integrated with the Grand Duchy, Ruthenia's nobility gradually rendered loyalty to the multilingual and cultural melting pot that was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania [citation needed] Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians [citation needed]\n\n\nOrigins of szlachta surnames\nThe Proto-Slavic suffix \"-ьskъ\" means \"characteristic of\", \"typical of\".\nThis suffix exists in Polish as \"-ski\" (feminine: \"-ska\") It's attached to surnames derived from a person's occupation, characteristics, patronymic surnames, or toponymic surnames (from a person's place of residence, birth or family origin).\n [70]: 157   In antiquity, the szlachta used topographic surnames to identify themselves [71] The expression \"z\" (meaning \"from\" sometimes \"at\") plus the name of one's patrimony or estate (dominion) carried the same prestige as \"de\" in French names such as \"de Châtellerault\", and \"von\" or \"zu\" in German names such as \"von Weizsäcker\" or \"zu Rhein\" [72] For example, the family name of counts Litwiccy (Litwicki [73]) was formed with the patronymic suffix -ic from the ethnic name Litwa, i.e Lithuania, 'nation of Lithuanians' It refers to the early modern empire of Central Europe, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth  (1569–1648) In Polish \"z Dąbrówki\" and \"Dąbrowski\" mean the same thing: \"of, from Dąbrówka.\" [70]: 60  More precisely, \"z Dąbrówki\" means owning the patrimony or estate Dąbrówka, not necessarily originating from Almost all the surnames of genuine Polish szlachta can be traced back to a patrimony or locality, despite time scattering most families far from their original home John of Zamość called himself John Zamoyski, Stephen of Potok called himself Potocki [74]\n\n\nHeraldry\nCoats of arms were very important to the szlachta Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in Central Europe, while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in Moravia, e.g Poraj coat of arms and in Germany, e.g Junosza coat of arms.\n\n\nHeritability\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a lozenge granted to women, did not develop in Poland By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father [citation needed] When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their distaff side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on to the next generation The brisure was rarely used All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\n\nEnnoblement\nThe number of lawfully granted ennoblements (naturalization) [7] [21] [23] [19] [20] [51] after the 15th century was minimal.\n\n\nKingdom of Poland\nThe number of lawfully granted ennoblements (naturalization) [7] [21] [23] [19] [20] [51] after the 15th century was minimal.\n\n\nEstimated number of ennoblements\nAccording to heraldic sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all lawful ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century) [86] [87]\n\n\nGrand Duchy of Lithuania\nIn the late 14th century, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vytautas the Great reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors—bajorai (\"nobles\"; see the cognate \"boyar\") As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their military service to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men (veldams) The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their family names, the Lithuanian pagan given names of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the Goštautai, Radvilos, Astikai, Kęsgailos and others These families were granted their coats of arms under the Union of Horodlo (1413).\n\n\nPrivileges\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n\n\nReal and false nobles\nNobles were born into a noble family, or adopted into a noble clan by an act of the King (this was abolished in 1633) The rarest way of achieving szlachta status was through ennoblement (naturalization) by a king or Sejm for reasons such as bravery in combat, service to the state, etc There were claims some nobles were, in fact, usurpers who were commoners that moved to another part of the country and falsely claimed noble status [citation needed] In the first half of the 16th century, hundreds of such \"false nobles\" were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka  [pl] (1550–1630) in his \"Liber generationis plebeanorum (Liber chamorum)\", or \"Book of Plebeian Genealogy (Ham's Book)\" Peasants were considered descendants of Ham, the son of Noah subject to bondage under the Curse of Ham The law forbade commoners holding landed estates and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary [96] Many sejms issued decrees over the centuries in an attempt to resolve this issue, but with little success It is unknown what percentage of the Polish nobility came from the 'lower orders' of society, but there are historians who claim nobles of such base origins formed a 'significant' element of the szlachta [citation needed]\n\n\nAccretion of sovereignty to the szlachta\nThe szlachta secured many rights not secured to the nobility of other countries Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges Those privileges became the basis of the Golden Liberty in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's Commonwealth' because Royal elections in Poland were in the hands of members of a hereditary class Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling dynasty This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the Piasts, then the Jagiellons As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' matrilinial descendants.\n\n\nPrivilege of Koszyce and others\nIn 1374 King Louis of Hungary approved the Privilege of Koszyce (przywilej koszycki) to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, Jadwiga He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (łanowy) a limit of 2 groszes per łan of land, Old Polish units of measurement In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility Henceforth, district offices were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay indemnities to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\n\nFirst Royal Election\nThe first \"free election\" (Polish: wolna elekcja) of a king took place in 1492 In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put Casimir II on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections Only senators voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by John I Albert For the duration of the Jagiellonian Dynasty, only members of that royal family were considered for election Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\n\nEnd of the Jagiellonian dynasty\nUntil the death of Sigismund II Augustus, the last king of the Jagiellonian dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a Polish–Lithuanian monarch Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the Pacta conventa, the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the Henrican articles, named after the first freely elected king, Henry of Valois The latter document was a virtual Polish constitution and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n\n\nMagnate oligarchy\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers In 1459 Ostroróg presented a memorandum to the Sejm (parliament), submitting palatines, or Voivodes of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, receive the title of prince Sons of the prince were to receive titles of counts and barons Castellans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were to receive the title of count All these submissions were rejected [31]\n\n\nSzlachta loss of influence\n The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final Partitions of Poland, and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia or the Habsburg monarchy [98]\n\n\nCultural and international connections\nDespite preoccupations with warring, politics and status, the szlachta in Poland, as did people from all social classes, played its part in contributing in fields ranging from literature, art and architecture, philosophy, education, agriculture and the many branches of science, to technology and industry [103] [104] Perhaps foremost among the cultural determinants of the nobility in Poland were its continuing international connections with the Rome-based Catholic Church It was from the ranks of the szlachta that were drawn the church's leading Prelates until the 20th century Other international influences came through the more or less secretive and powerful Christian and lay organisations such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, focused on hospital and other charitable activity [105] The most notable Polish Maltese Knight was the Pozńan commander, Bartłomiej Nowodworski, founder in 1588 of the oldest school in Poland One alumnus was John III Sobieski [106]\nIn the 18th century, after several false starts, international Freemasonry, wolnomularstwo, from western lodges, became established among the higher échelons of the szlachta, and in spite of membership of some clergy, it was intermittently but strongly opposed by the Catholic Church After the partitions it became a cover for opposition to the occupying powers [107] Also in the 18th century there was a marked development in Patronage of the arts during the reign of Stanisław August Poniatowski, himself a freemason, and with the growth of social awareness, in Philanthropy.\n\n\nWomen as purveyors of culture\nHigh-born women in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth exerted political and cultural influence throughout history in their own country and abroad, as queens, princesses and the wives or widows of magnates Their cultural activities came into sharper relief in the 18th century with their hosting of salons in the French manner They went on to publish as translators and writers and as facilitators of educational and social projects [108]\n\n\nGastronomy\nThe szlachta, no less than the rest of the population, placed a particular accent on food It was at the centre of courtly and estate entertaining and in good times, at the heart of village life During the Age of Enlightenment, King Stanislaw August Poniatowski emulated the French Salons by holding his famed Thursday Lunches for intellectuals and artists, drawn chiefly from the szlachta [109] His Wednesday Lunches were gatherings for policy makers in science, education and politics.\n\n\nHunting\nOne of the favourite szlachta pastimes was hunting (łowiectwo) [112] Before the formation of Poland as a state, hunting was accessible to everyone With the introduction of rulers and rules, big game, generically zwierzyna: Aurochs, bison, deer and boar became the preserve of kings and princes on penalty of poachers' death From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, Łowczy In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc were 'fair game' to all comers Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles [113] Over the centuries, at least two breeds of specialist hounds were bred in Poland One was the Polish Hunting Dog, the brach The other was the Ogar Polski Count Xavier Branicki was so nostalgic about Polish hunting, that when he settled in France in the mid 19th century, and restored his estate at the Chateau de Montresor, he ordered a brace of Ogar Polski hounds from the Polish breeder and szlachcic, Piotr Orda [114]\n\n\nDemographics and stratification\nThe szlachta differed in many respects from the nobility in other countries The most important difference was that, while in most European countries the nobility lost power as the ruler strove for absolute monarchy, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth a reverse process occurred: the nobility actually gained power at the expense of the king, and enabled the political system to evolve into an oligarchy.\n\n\nSzlachta categories\nThe nobility were divided by wealth into:\n\n\nSarmatism\nThe szlachta's prevalent ideology, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"Sarmatism\", a word derived from the legend that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the Sarmatians This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness became an important part of szlachta culture and affected all aspects of their lives It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and

bibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Szlachta**\n\nThe szlachta was a noble class in Poland from the 14th to the 20th century. The word \"szlachta\" is derived from the Polish word for \"nobility\" or \"nobleman.\" The szlachta were a unique class in European society, with their own distinct culture, customs, and laws.\n\n**In Polish, a nobleman is called a \"szlachcic\" and a noblewoman a \"szlachcianka\"**\n\nThe szlachta were a hereditary class, with membership passed down through generations. They held significant power and influence in Polish society, and their privileges and rights were protected by law.\n\n**History**\n\nThe origins of the szlachta are shrouded in mystery, with various theories suggesting their descent from ancient tribes, such as the Sarmatians or the Scythians. However, the szlachta themselves believed their origins dated back to the 10th century, when they were granted nobility by the Polish prince, Mieszko I.\n\n**Composition**\n\nThe szlachta fundamentally differed from the feudal nobility of Western Europe. They were not subject to feudal obligations or ties to a particular lord, and their relationship with the Polish king was not feudal in nature. Instead, the szlachta stood as equals before the king, with their own distinct laws and privileges.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe szlachta's origins are still a topic of debate among historians. Some theories suggest they descended from ancient tribes, such as the Sarmatians or the Scythians, while others propose they were of Slavic or Germanic origin. The szlachta themselves believed their origins dated back to the 10th century, when they were granted nobility by the Polish prince, Mieszko I.\n\n**Poland**\n\nThe szlachta played a significant role in Polish history, particularly during the Middle Ages. They were instrumental in the development of the Polish state, and their privileges and rights were protected by law. The szlachta also contributed to Polish culture, with many notable writers, artists, and intellectuals emerging from their ranks.\n\n**Military caste and aristocracy**\n\nThe szlachta were a military caste, with many members serving as knights or nobles in the Polish army. They were known for their bravery and martial skills, and were often called upon to defend Poland against external threats. The szlachta also held significant power and influence in Polish society, with many members serving as senators, judges, or administrators.\n\n**Lithuania**\n\nIn Lithuania, the szlachta were known as the \"bajorai.\" They were a noble class, with their own distinct laws and privileges. The bajorai played a significant role in Lithuanian history, particularly during the Middle Ages. They were instrumental in the development of the Lithuanian state, and their privileges and rights were protected by law.\n\n**Ruthenia**\n\nAfter the principalities of Halych and Volhynia became integrated with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the szlachta in Ruthenia gradually rendered loyalty to the multilingual and cultural melting pot that was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\n**Origins of szlachta surnames**\n\nThe szlachta used topographic surnames to identify themselves. These surnames were often derived from the name of a person's patrimony or estate. For example, the family name of counts Litwiccy (Litwicki) was formed with the patronymic suffix -ic from the ethnic name Litwa, i.e. Lithuania.\n\n**Heraldry**\n\nCoats of arms were very important to the szlachta. Their heraldic system evolved together with neighboring states in Central Europe, while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries.\n\n**Heritability**\n\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a lozenge granted to women did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father.\n\n**Ennoblement**\n\nThe number of lawfully granted ennoblements (naturalization) after the 15th century was minimal. According to heraldic sources, the total estimated number of all lawful ennoblements throughout the history of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward was around 1,600.\n\n**Real and false nobles**\n\nNobles were born into a noble family, or adopted into a noble clan by an act of the King (this was abolished in 1633). The rarest way of achieving szlachta status was through ennoblement (naturalization) by a King or Sejm for reasons such as bravery in combat, service to the state, etc.\n\n**Accretion of sovereignty to the szlachta**\n\nThe szlachta secured many rights not secured to the nobility of other countries. Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. These privileges became the basis of the Golden Liberty in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\n**Privilege of Koszyce and others**\n\nIn 1374 King Louis of Hungary approved the Privilege of Koszyce (przywilej koszycki) to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, Jadwiga. The Privilege broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (łanowy).\n\n**First Royal Election**\n\nThe first \"free election\" (Polish: wolna elekcja) of a King took place in 1492. This marked a significant shift in the balance of power between the King and the szlachta.\n\n**End of the Jagiellonian dynasty**\n\nUntil the death of Sigismund II Augustus, the last King of the Jagiellonian dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a Polish-Lithuanian monarch.\n\n**Magnate oligarchy**\n\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. However, their efforts were often rebuffed by the Sejm.\n\n**Szlachta loss of influence**\n\nThe notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final Partitions of Poland, and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia or the Habsburg monarchy.\n\n**Cultural and international connections**\n\nDespite preoccupations with warring, politics, and status, the szlachta in Poland, as did people from all social classes, played its part in contributing in fields ranging from literature, art, and architecture, philosophy, education, agriculture, and the many branches of science, to technology and industry.\n\n**Women as purveyors of culture**\n\nHigh-born women in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth exerted political and cultural influence throughout history in their own country and abroad, as queens, princesses, and the wives or widows of magnates.\n\n**Gastronomy**\n\nThe szlachta, no less than the rest of the population, placed a particular accent on food. It was at the centre of courtly and estate entertaining and in good times, at the heart of village life.\n\n**Hunting**\n\nOne of the favorite szlachta pastimes was hunting (łowiectwo). Before the formation of Poland as a state, hunting was accessible to everyone. However, with the introduction of rulers and rules, big game became the preserve of kings and princes.\n\n**Demographics and stratification**\n\nThe szlachta differed in many respects from the nobility in other countries. The most important difference was that, while in most European countries the nobility lost power as the ruler strove for absolute monarchy, in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a reverse process occurred: the nobility actually gained power at the expense of the King, and enabled the political system to evolve into an oligarchy.\n\n**Szlachta categories**\n\nThe nobility were divided by wealth into several categories. The most important categories were the magnates, the szlachta of the lower nobility, and the szlachta of the infantry.\n\n**Sarmatism**\n\nThe szlachta's prevalent ideology, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"Sarmatism\", a word derived from the legend that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the Sarmatians.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Szlachta\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn Polish, a nobleman is called a \"szlachcic\" and a noblewoman a \"szlachcianka\".\n\n\nEtymology\nIn Polish, a nobleman is called a \"szlachcic\" and a noblewoman a \"szlachcianka\".\n\n\nComposition\nAdam Zamoyski argues that the szlachta were not exactly the same as the European nobility nor a gentry, [8] as the szlachta fundamentally differed in law, rights, political power, origin, and composition from the feudal nobility of Western Europe [8] [9] [30] Feudalism never took root in Poland [6] The szlachta did not rank below the king, [4] as the szlachta's relationship to the Polish king was not feudal The szlachta stood as equals before the king [5] The king was not an autocrat, nor the szlachta's overlord, as szlachta land was in allodium, not feudal tenure [11] Feudal dependence upon a Polish king did not exist for the szlachta [5] and earlier in history some high-ranking szlachta (magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms and constantly sought to undermine Piast authority [10]: 75, 76 \n\n\nOrigins\nThe origins of the szlachta, while ancient, have always been considered obscure [10]: 207  As a result, its members often referred to it as odwieczna (perennial) [10]: 207  Two popular historical theories about its origins have been put forward by its members and early historians and chroniclers The first theory involved a presumed descent from the ancient Iranian tribe known as Sarmatians, who in the 2nd century AD, occupied lands in Eastern Europe, and the Middle East The second theory involved a presumed szlachta descent from Japheth, one of Noah's sons By contrast, the peasantry were said to be the offspring of another son of Noah, Ham — and hence subject to bondage under the Curse of Ham The Jews were considered the offspring of Shem [40] [41] [42] Other fanciful theories included its foundation by Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, or regional leaders who had not mixed their bloodlines with those of 'slaves, prisoners, or aliens' [10]: 207

[10]: 208 \n\n\nMilitary caste and aristocracy\nThe szlachta were a caste, [37] a military caste, as in Hindu society [21] [26] In the year 1244, Bolesław, Duke of Masovia, identified members of the knights' clan as members of a genealogia:\n\n\nLithuania\nIn Lithuania Propria and in Samogitia, prior to the creation of the Kingdom of Lithuania by Mindaugas, nobles were called die beste leuten in German sources In Lithuanian, nobles were named ponai The higher nobility were named kunigai or kunigaikščiai (dukes) — a loanword from Scandinavian konung They were the established local leaders and warlords During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the King of Lithuania Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of Ruthenia in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared — bajorai, from Ruthenian бояре This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\n\nRuthenia\nAfter the principalities of Halych and Volhynia became integrated with the Grand Duchy, Ruthenia's nobility gradually rendered loyalty to the multilingual and cultural melting pot that was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania [citation needed] Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians [citation needed]\n\n\nOrigins of szlachta surnames\nThe Proto-Slavic suffix \"-ьskъ\" means \"characteristic of\", \"typical of\".\nThis suffix exists in Polish as \"-ski\" (feminine: \"-ska\") It's attached to surnames derived from a person's occupation, characteristics, patronymic surnames, or toponymic surnames (from a person's place of residence, birth or family origin).\n [70]: 157   In antiquity, the szlachta used topographic surnames to identify themselves [71] The expression \"z\" (meaning \"from\" sometimes \"at\") plus the name of one's patrimony or estate (dominion) carried the same prestige as \"de\" in French names such as \"de Châtellerault\", and \"von\" or \"zu\" in German names such as \"von Weizsäcker\" or \"zu Rhein\" [72] For example, the family name of counts Litwiccy (Litwicki [73]) was formed with the patronymic suffix -ic from the ethnic name Litwa, i.e Lithuania, 'nation of Lithuanians' It refers to the early modern empire of Central Europe, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth  (1569–1648) In Polish \"z Dąbrówki\" and \"Dąbrowski\" mean the same thing: \"of, from Dąbrówka.\" [70]: 60  More precisely, \"z Dąbrówki\" means owning the patrimony or estate Dąbrówka, not necessarily originating from Almost all the surnames of genuine Polish szlachta can be traced back to a patrimony or locality, despite time scattering most families far from their original home John of Zamość called himself John Zamoyski, Stephen of Potok called himself Potocki [74]\n\n\nHeraldry\nCoats of arms were very important to the szlachta Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in Central Europe, while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in Moravia, e.g Poraj coat of arms and in Germany, e.g Junosza coat of arms.\n\n\nHeritability\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a lozenge granted to women, did not develop in Poland By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father [citation needed] When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their distaff side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on to the next generation The brisure was rarely used All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\n\nEnnoblement\nThe number of lawfully granted ennoblements (naturalization) [7] [21] [23] [19] [20] [51] after the 15th century was minimal.\n\n\nKingdom of Poland\nThe number of lawfully granted ennoblements (naturalization) [7] [21] [23] [19] [20] [51] after the 15th century was minimal.\n\n\nEstimated number of ennoblements\nAccording to heraldic sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all lawful ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century) [86] [87]\n\n\nGrand Duchy of Lithuania\nIn the late 14th century, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vytautas the Great reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors—bajorai (\"nobles\"; see the cognate \"boyar\") As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their military service to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men (veldams) The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their family names, the Lithuanian pagan given names of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the Goštautai, Radvilos, Astikai, Kęsgailos and others These families were granted their coats of arms under the Union of Horodlo (1413).\n\n\nPrivileges\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n\n\nReal and false nobles\nNobles were born into a noble family, or adopted into a noble clan by an act of the King (this was abolished in 1633) The rarest way of achieving szlachta status was through ennoblement (naturalization) by a king or Sejm for reasons such as bravery in combat, service to the state, etc There were claims some nobles were, in fact, usurpers who were commoners that moved to another part of the country and falsely claimed noble status [citation needed] In the first half of the 16th century, hundreds of such \"false nobles\" were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka  [pl] (1550–1630) in his \"Liber generationis plebeanorum (Liber chamorum)\", or \"Book of Plebeian Genealogy (Ham's Book)\" Peasants were considered descendants of Ham, the son of Noah subject to bondage under the Curse of Ham The law forbade commoners holding landed estates and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary [96] Many sejms issued decrees over the centuries in an attempt to resolve this issue, but with little success It is unknown what percentage of the Polish nobility came from the 'lower orders' of society, but there are historians who claim nobles of such base origins formed a 'significant' element of the szlachta [citation needed]\n\n\nAccretion of sovereignty to the szlachta\nThe szlachta secured many rights not secured to the nobility of other countries Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges Those privileges became the basis of the Golden Liberty in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's Commonwealth' because Royal elections in Poland were in the hands of members of a hereditary class Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling dynasty This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the Piasts, then the Jagiellons As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' matrilinial descendants.\n\n\nPrivilege of Koszyce and others\nIn 1374 King Louis of Hungary approved the Privilege of Koszyce (przywilej koszycki) to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, Jadwiga He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (łanowy) a limit of 2 groszes per łan of land, Old Polish units of measurement In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility Henceforth, district offices were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay indemnities to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\n\nFirst Royal Election\nThe first \"free election\" (Polish: wolna elekcja) of a king took place in 1492 In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put Casimir II on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections Only senators voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by John I Albert For the duration of the Jagiellonian Dynasty, only members of that royal family were considered for election Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\n\nEnd of the Jagiellonian dynasty\nUntil the death of Sigismund II Augustus, the last king of the Jagiellonian dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a Polish–Lithuanian monarch Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the Pacta conventa, the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the Henrican articles, named after the first freely elected king, Henry of Valois The latter document was a virtual Polish constitution and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n\n\nMagnate oligarchy\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers In 1459 Ostroróg presented a memorandum to the Sejm (parliament), submitting palatines, or Voivodes of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, receive the title of prince Sons of the prince were to receive titles of counts and barons Castellans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were to receive the title of count All these submissions were rejected [31]\n\n\nSzlachta loss of influence\n The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final Partitions of Poland, and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia or the Habsburg monarchy [98]\n\n\nCultural and international connections\nDespite preoccupations with warring, politics and status, the szlachta in Poland, as did people from all social classes, played its part in contributing in fields ranging from literature, art and architecture, philosophy, education, agriculture and the many branches of science, to technology and industry [103] [104] Perhaps foremost among the cultural determinants of the nobility in Poland were its continuing international connections with the Rome-based Catholic Church It was from the ranks of the szlachta that were drawn the church's leading Prelates until the 20th century Other international influences came through the more or less secretive and powerful Christian and lay organisations such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, focused on hospital and other charitable activity [105] The most notable Polish Maltese Knight was the Pozńan commander, Bartłomiej Nowodworski, founder in 1588 of the oldest school in Poland One alumnus was John III Sobieski [106]\nIn the 18th century, after several false starts, international Freemasonry, wolnomularstwo, from western lodges, became established among the higher échelons of the szlachta, and in spite of membership of some clergy, it was intermittently but strongly opposed by the Catholic Church After the partitions it became a cover for opposition to the occupying powers [107] Also in the 18th century there was a marked development in Patronage of the arts during the reign of Stanisław August Poniatowski, himself a freemason, and with the growth of social awareness, in Philanthropy.\n\n\nWomen as purveyors of culture\nHigh-born women in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth exerted political and cultural influence throughout history in their own country and abroad, as queens, princesses and the wives or widows of magnates Their cultural activities came into sharper relief in the 18th century with their hosting of salons in the French manner They went on to publish as translators and writers and as facilitators of educational and social projects [108]\n\n\nGastronomy\nThe szlachta, no less than the rest of the population, placed a particular accent on food It was at the centre of courtly and estate entertaining and in good times, at the heart of village life During the Age of Enlightenment, King Stanislaw August Poniatowski emulated the French Salons by holding his famed Thursday Lunches for intellectuals and artists, drawn chiefly from the szlachta [109] His Wednesday Lunches were gatherings for policy makers in science, education and politics.\n\n\nHunting\nOne of the favourite szlachta pastimes was hunting (łowiectwo) [112] Before the formation of Poland as a state, hunting was accessible to everyone With the introduction of rulers and rules, big game, generically zwierzyna: Aurochs, bison, deer and boar became the preserve of kings and princes on penalty of poachers' death From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, Łowczy In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc were 'fair game' to all comers Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles [113] Over the centuries, at least two breeds of specialist hounds were bred in Poland One was the Polish Hunting Dog, the brach The other was the Ogar Polski Count Xavier Branicki was so nostalgic about Polish hunting, that when he settled in France in the mid 19th century, and restored his estate at the Chateau de Montresor, he ordered a brace of Ogar Polski hounds from the Polish breeder and szlachcic, Piotr Orda [114]\n\n\nDemographics and stratification\nThe szlachta differed in many respects from the nobility in other countries The most important difference was that, while in most European countries the nobility lost power as the ruler strove for absolute monarchy, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth a reverse process occurred: the nobility actually gained power at the expense of the king, and enabled the political system to evolve into an oligarchy.\n\n\nSzlachta categories\nThe nobility were divided by wealth into:\n\n\nSarmatism\nThe szlachta's prevalent ideology, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"Sarmatism\", a word derived from the legend that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the Sarmatians This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness became an important part of szlachta culture and affected all aspects of their lives It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the żupan, kontusz, sukmana, pas kontuszowy, delia and made the

the szlachta's \"Golden Liberty\" złota wolność It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the szlachta of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish Dog Latin

The exact etymology of the geographical name Lynkos/Lynkestis and tribal name Lynkestai is uncertain, with some possible connections to the word \"lynx\" or being of Pre-Greek origin. The tribal name Lynkestes bears the typical Illyrian suffix -st-.\n\nGeography\n\nLynkestis was the northernmost mountainous region of Upper Macedonia, bordered by Pelagonia to the northeast, Emathia and Almopia to the southeast, and Orestia, Eordaia, and the Haliacmon river to the south. To the west, Lynkestis bordered with Illyria. The region was strategically important due to the major east–west route and one of the north–south routes passing through its core.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age saw the appearance of finds of Mycenaean Greek manufacture and matt-painted pottery in Lyncestis and the rest of Upper Macedonia. The latter is believed to have been manufactured by local northwestern Greek tribes, including Macedonians and Dorians, who traveled from the south northwards before settling in the Pindus mountain range.\n\nEarly Period\n\nThe Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age saw the appearance of finds of Mycenaean Greek manufacture and matt-painted pottery in Lyncestis and the rest of Upper Macedonia. The latter is believed to have been manufactured by local northwestern Greek tribes, including Macedonians and Dorians, who traveled from the south northwards before settling in the Pindus mountain range.\n\nLyncestian Kingdom\n\nLynkestis was originally an autonomous kingdom in the region of Upper Macedonia. It remained outside the region of power of the Macedonian Argead kings until Philip's conquest in 358 BC. Lynkestis' lack of loyalty to the Argeads and their Macedonian kingdom was due in part to the Illyrian non-Macedonian elements of that region, and in part to the rivalries of its ruling families towards the Argeads. The initial strengthening of the positions of the various basileus in Macedonia may rest in the common ethnic and linguistic affinities of most people of Upper Macedonia, but it was fragile, as testified by the claim of independence of Lynkestis under its ruler Arrhabaeus during the Peloponnesian War. There were also periods of cooperation: during the reign of the Macedonian king Alexander I (r. 494–454 BC), recognition of a common way of life and concern for more distant neighbors led to the creation of a nominal confederacy between the cantons of Upper Macedonia (Elimeia, Orestis, Lyncestis, and Pelagonia) and those of Lower Macedonia (Pieria and Bottiaea).\n\nClassical Era\n\nA nominal confederacy between Lynkestis and the Upper Macedonian regions of Elimeia, Orestis, and Pelagonia as well as Lower Macedonia (Pieria and Bottiaea) was created during the reign of Alexander I of Macedon (c 495–454 B.C.). Arrhabaeus entered into conflict with Perdiccas II of Macedon. During the Peloponnesian War, a coalition of Lynkestians under Arrhabaeus and Illyrians defeated the joined forces of the Macedonian king Perdiccas II, who had wanted to invade Lynkestis, and the Spartan leader Brasidas, at the Battle of Lyncestis in 423 BC. Besides Brasidas' forces, Perdiccas' faction was supported by Chalcidians, however the campaign against Lynkestis was a disaster because of Macedonian incompetence, resulting in the end of Brasidas' alliance with Perdiccas. A pacification between Arrhabaeus and Perdiccas was started by Athenians. Perdiccas was interested in peace with Lynkestis due to his recent defeat in the Lynkestian campaign, the Lynkestian-Illyrian collaboration, and his new enmity with Brasidas. On the other hand, Arrhabaeus was interested in peace with the Argeads to avert future invasions of his realm by Macedon.\n\nMacedonian Rule\n\nIllyrian dominion in Upper Macedonia, in particular in Lynkestis, and their incursions in Lower Macedonia in 360–359 BC have been the main impetus for Argead's incorporation of Upper Macedonia into the Macedonian kingdom. After his ascension to the throne of Macedon Philip II wanted the total end of Illyrian influence in Upper Macedonia. In 359 BC, negotiations took place between Bardylis and Philip II of Macedon, following the latter's ascension to the throne that year. In the negotiations, Bardylis demanded, and Philip refused, the continuing occupation of \"Macedonian poleis\" (i.e Lynkestian strongholds). In 358 BC Philip mounted a major invasion of Illyrian-held territory, and decisively defeated the Illyrians under Bardylis in the Battle of Erigon Valley in 358 BC. Philip's victories against the Illyrians in 358 BC overturned decades of Illyrian raids upon Macedonia, and he was able to unite Upper and Lower Macedonia for the first time in the history of those regions. After his victory, Philip II is said to have subdued all the area as far as Lake Ohrid, northwest of the Prespa Lakes region in Deuriopus. Soon after his victory in 358 BC Lynkestis, Pelagonia, Orestis, and Tymphaea, were incorporated into Philip's greater Macedonia. In the same year, Philip founded Heraclea Lyncestis, which would go on to become the chief city of the region until Late Antiquity.\n\nLynkestian Dynasty\n\nLynkestian king Arrhabaeus who ruled in the second half of the 5th century BC was the son of Bomerus. According to Strabo, Irra was the daughter of Arrhabaeus, and his granddaughter was Eurydice, the mother of Philip II. Amyntas, one of the commanders sent by Philip II to defeat some of the Greek cities in Asia Minor, was a son of the Lynkestian king Arrhabaeus.\n\nCulture\n\nThe available inscriptional evidence suggests that the people of Lynkestis spoke Northwest Greek, in contrast to those of Lower Macedonia who spoke Aeolic Greek. The Greek geographer Hecateus when describing the region in 6th century BC placed the Lynkestians in the Molossian cluster of tribes, an indication that Lynkestians were Greek speakers from that time. Moreover, Hammond asserts that their dialect was similar to that of the Molossians.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe available inscriptional evidence suggests that the people of Lynkestis spoke Northwest Greek, in contrast to those of Lower Macedonia who spoke Aeolic Greek.

Moreover, Hammond asserts that their dialect was similar to that of the Molossians.\n\nReligion\n\nA temple of Zeus Hypsistos was erected in Heraclea during the Roman period or earlier. Findings, linked to the specific cult, are found all over Upper Macedonia. Based on the archaeological findings other cults include those of Demeter, Appolo, Artemis, Dioskouroi, Athena, Aphrodite, and Dionysos.\n\nSee Also\n\nLynkestis was a significant region in ancient Upper Macedonia, with a rich history and culture. The region was inhabited by the Lynkestian tribe, who spoke Northwest Greek and had a distinct dialect. The Lynkestians were known for their military prowess and played a significant role in the history of Macedonia. The region was conquered by Philip II of Macedon in 358 BC and became part of the Macedonian kingdom. The city of Heraclea Lyncestis was founded by Philip II in the same year and became the capital of the region.

{"title": "Nicholas_II_of_Russia", "content": "\nEarly life\nGrand Duke Nicholas was born on 18 May  [O.S 6 May] 1868, in the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo south of Saint Petersburg, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, Emperor Alexander II He was the eldest child of then-Tsesarevich Alexander Alexandrovich and his wife, Tsesarevna Maria Feodorovna (née Princess Dagmar of Denmark) Alexander Alexandrovich was heir apparent to the Russian throne as the second but eldest surviving son of Emperor Alexander II and Empress Maria Alexandrovna (née Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine) Maria Feodorovna was the daughter of King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark.\n\n\nBirth and family background\nGrand Duke Nicholas was born on 18 May  [O.S 6 May] 1868, in the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo south of Saint Petersburg, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, Emperor Alexander II He was the eldest child of then-Tsesarevich Alexander Alexandrovich and his wife, Tsesarevna Maria Feodorovna (née Princess Dagmar of Denmark) Alexander Alexandrovich was heir apparent to the Russian throne as the second but eldest surviving son of Emperor Alexander II and Empress Maria Alexandrovna (née Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine) Maria Feodorovna was the daughter of King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark.\n\n\nChildhood\nGrand Duke Nicholas was to have five younger siblings: Alexander (1869–1870), George (1871–1899), Xenia (1875–1960), Michael (1878–1918) and Olga (1882–1960) Nicholas often referred to his father nostalgically in letters after Alexander's death in 1894 He was also very close to his mother, as revealed in their published letters to each other [7] In his childhood, Nicholas, his parents and siblings made annual visits to the Danish royal palaces of Fredensborg and Bernstorff to visit his grandparents, the king and queen The visits also served as family reunions, as his mother's siblings would also come from the United Kingdom, Germany and Greece with their respective families [8] It was there in 1883, that he had a flirtation with one of his British first cousins, Princess Victoria In 1873, Nicholas also accompanied his parents and younger brother, two-year-old George, on a two-month, semi-official visit to the United Kingdom [9] In London, Nicholas and his family stayed at Marlborough House, as guests of his \"Uncle Bertie\" and \"Aunt Alix\", the Prince and Princess of Wales, where he was spoiled by his uncle [10]\n\n\nTsarevich\nOn 1 March 1881, [11] following the assassination of his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II, Nicholas became heir apparent or tsarevich upon his father's accession as Alexander III Nicholas and his other family members bore witness to Alexander II's death, having been present at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, where he was brought after the attack [12] For security reasons, the new Tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the Gatchina Palace outside the city, only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions On such occasions, Alexander III and his family occupied the nearby Anichkov Palace [citation needed]\n\n\nEngagement\nIn April 1894, Nicholas joined his uncle Sergei and aunt Elizabeth on a journey to Coburg, Germany, for the wedding of Elizabeth's and Alix's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, to their mutual first cousin Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Other guests included Queen Victoria, Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Empress Frederick (Kaiser Wilhelm's mother and Queen Victoria's eldest daughter), Nicholas's uncle, the Prince of Wales, and the bride's parents, the Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\n\nAccession, reign and marriage\nDefunct\n\n\nCoronation\nDespite a visit to the United Kingdom in 1893, where he observed the House of Commons in debate and was seemingly impressed by the machinery of constitutional monarchy, Nicholas turned his back on any notion of giving away any power to elected representatives in Russia Shortly after he came to the throne, a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns' local assemblies (zemstvos) came to the Winter Palace proposing court reforms, such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy, [30] and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry, in the Tver Address [31] [32]\n\n\nEcclesiastical affairs\nNicholas always believed God chose him to be the tsar and therefore the decisions of the tsar reflected the will of God and could not be disputed He was convinced that the simple people of Russia understood this and loved him, as demonstrated by the display of affection he perceived when he made public appearances His old-fashioned belief made for a very stubborn ruler who rejected constitutional limitations on his power It put the tsar at variance with the emerging political consensus among the Russian elite It was further belied by the subordinate position of the Church in the bureaucracy The result was a new distrust between the tsar and the church hierarchy and between those hierarchs and the people Thereby the tsar's base of support was conflicted [39]\n\n\nInitiatives in foreign affairs\nAccording to his biographer:\n\n\nRusso-Japanese War\nA clash between Russia and the Empire of Japan was almost inevitable by the turn of the 20th century Russia had expanded in the Far East, and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions, as its southward path to the Balkans was frustrated, conflicted with Japan's own territorial ambitions on the Asian mainland Nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to Manchuria and Korea, and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the Bezobrazov group [48] [49]\n\n\nTsar's confidence in victory\nNicholas's stance on the war was so at variance with the obvious facts that many observers were baffled He saw the war as an easy God-given victory that would raise Russian morale and patriotism He ignored the financial repercussions of a long-distance war [55] Rotem Kowner argues that during his visit to Japan in 1891, where Nicholas was attacked by a Japanese policeman, he regarded the Japanese as small of stature, feminine, weak, and inferior He ignored reports of the prowess of Japanese soldiers in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) and reports on the capabilities of the Imperial Japanese Navy, as well as negative reports on the lack of readiness of Russian forces [15]\n\n\nAnti-Jewish pogroms of 1903–1906\nThe Kishinev newspaper Bessarabets, which published anti-Semitic materials, received funds from Viacheslav Plehve, Minister of the Interior [58] These publications served to fuel the Kishinev pogrom (rioting) The government of Nicholas II formally condemned the rioting and dismissed the regional governor, with the perpetrators arrested and punished by the court [59] Leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church also condemned anti-Semitic pogroms Appeals to the faithful condemning the pogroms were read publicly in all churches of Russia [60] In private Nicholas expressed his admiration for the mobs, viewing anti-Semitism as a useful tool for unifying the people behind the government; [61] however in 1911, following the assassination of Pyotr Stolypin by the Jewish revolutionary Dmitry Bogrov, he approved of government efforts to prevent anti-Semitic pogroms [62]\n\n\nRussification of Finland\nIn Finland, Nicholas had become associated with deeply unpopular Russification measures These began with the February Manifesto proclaimed by Nicholas II in 1899, [63] which restricted Finland's autonomy and instigated a period of censorship and political repression [64] A petition of protest signed by more than 500,000 Finns was collected against the manifesto and delivered to St Petersburg by a delegation of 500 people, but they were not received by Nicholas Russification measures were reintroduced in 1908 after a temporary suspension in the aftermath of the 1905 Revolution, and Nicholas received an icy reception when he made his only visit to Helsinki on 10 March 1915 [65] [66] [67]\n\n\nBloody Sunday (1905)\nA few days prior to Bloody Sunday (9 (22) January 1905), priest and labor leader Georgy Gapon informed the government of the forthcoming procession to the Winter Palace to hand a workers' petition to the tsar On Saturday, 8 (21) January, the ministers convened to consider the situation There was never any thought that the tsar, who had left the capital for Tsarskoye Selo on the advice of the ministers, would actually meet Gapon; the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected [68]\n\n\n1905 Revolution\nConfronted with growing opposition and after consulting with Witte and Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky, the Tsar issued a reform ukase on 25 December 1904 with vague promises [75] \nIn hopes of cutting the rebellion short, many demonstrators were shot on Bloody Sunday (1905) as they tried to march to the Winter Palace in St Petersburg Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov was ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity Grand Duke Sergei was killed in February by a revolutionary's bomb in Moscow as he left the Kremlin On 3 March the tsar condemned the revolutionaries Meanwhile, Witte recommended that a manifesto be issued [76] Schemes of reform would be elaborated by Ivan Goremykin and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the zemstvos and municipal councils under the presidency of Witte [citation needed] In June the battleship Potemkin, part of the Black Sea Fleet, mutinied.\n\n\nRelationship with the Duma\nUnder pressure from the attempted 1905 Russian Revolution, on 5 August of that year Nicholas II issued a manifesto about the convocation of the State Duma, known as the Bulygin Duma, initially thought to be an advisory organ In the October Manifesto, the Tsar pledged to introduce basic civil liberties, provide for broad participation in the State Duma, and endow the Duma with legislative and oversight powers He was determined, however, to preserve his autocracy even in the context of reform This was signalled in the text of the 1906 constitution He was described as the supreme autocrat, and retained sweeping executive powers, also in church affairs His cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere with nor assist one another; they were responsible only to him [citation needed]\n\n\nTsarevich Alexei's illness and Rasputin\nFurther complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession Alexandra bore Nicholas four daughters, Grand Duchess Olga in 1895, Grand Duchess Tatiana in 1897, Grand Duchess Maria in 1899, and Grand Duchess Anastasia in 1901, before their son Alexei was born on 12 August 1904 The young heir was afflicted with Hemophilia B, a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly, which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death As a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Alexandra carried the same gene mutation that afflicted several of the major European royal houses, such as Prussia and Spain Hemophilia, therefore, became known as \"the royal disease\" Through Alexandra, the disease had passed on to her son As all of Nicholas and Alexandra's daughters were assassinated with their parents and brother in Yekaterinburg in 1918, it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as carriers [citation needed]\n\n\nEuropean affairs\nIn 1907, to end longstanding controversies over central Asia, Russia and the United Kingdom signed the Anglo-Russian Convention that resolved most of the problems generated for decades by The Great Game [98] The UK had already entered into the Entente Cordiale with France in 1904, and the Anglo-Russian Convention led to the formation of the Triple Entente The following year, in May 1908, Nicholas and Alexandra's shared \"Uncle Bertie\" and \"Aunt Alix\", Britain's King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, made a state visit to Russia, being the first reigning British monarchs to do so However, they did not set foot on Russian soil Instead, they stayed aboard their yachts, meeting off the coast of modern-day Tallinn [citation needed] Later that year, Nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister, Alexander Izvolsky, had entered into a secret agreement with the Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, Count Alois von Aehrenthal, agreeing that, in exchange for Russian naval access to the Dardanelles and the Bosporus Strait, Russia would not oppose the Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a revision of the 1878 Treaty of Berlin When Austria-Hungary did annex this territory that October, it precipitated the Bosnian Crisis When Russia protested about the annexation, the Austrians threatened to leak secret communications between Izvolsky and Aehrenthal, prompting Nicholas to complain in a letter to Emperor Franz Joseph, about a breach of confidence [citation needed] In 1909, in the wake of the Anglo-Russian convention, the Russian imperial family made a visit to England, staying on the Isle of Wight for Cowes Week In 1913, during the Balkan Wars, Nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between Serbia and Bulgaria However, the Bulgarians rejected his offer [citation needed] Also in 1913, Nicholas, albeit without Alexandra, made a visit to Berlin for the wedding of Kaiser Wilhelm II's daughter, Princess Victoria Louise, to a maternal cousin of Nicholas, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick [99] Nicholas was also joined by his cousin, King George V and his wife, Queen Mary [citation needed]\n\n\nTercentenary\nIn February 1913, Nicholas presided over the tercentenary celebrations for the Romanov Dynasty On 21 February, a Te Deum took place at Kazan Cathedral, and a state reception at the Winter Palace [100] In May, Nicholas and the imperial family made a pilgrimage across the empire, retracing the route down the Volga River that was made by the teenage Michael Romanov from the Ipatiev Monastery in Kostroma to Moscow in 1613 when he finally agreed to become tsar [101]\n\n\nFirst World War\nOn 28 June 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb nationalist in Sarajevo, who opposed Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina The outbreak of war was not inevitable, but leaders, diplomats and nineteenth-century alliances created a climate for large-scale conflict The concept of Pan-Slavism and shared religion created strong public sympathy between Russia and Serbia Territorial conflict created rivalries between Germany and France and between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, and as a consequence alliance networks developed across Europe The Triple Entente and Triple Alliance networks were set before the war Nicholas wanted neither to abandon Serbia to the ultimatum of Austria-Hungary, nor to provoke a general war In a series of letters exchanged with Wilhelm of Germany (the \"Willy–Nicky correspondence\") the two proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down Nicholas desired that Russia's mobilization be only against Austria-Hungary, in the hopes of preventing war with Germany [citation needed]\n\n\nCollapse\nAs the government failed to produce supplies, mounting hardship resulted in massive riots and rebellions With Nicholas away at the front from 1915 through 1916, authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering soldiers Despite efforts by the British Ambassador Sir George Buchanan to warn the Tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution, Nicholas continued to bury himself away at the Staff HQ (Stavka) 600 kilometres (400 mi) away at Mogilev, leaving his capital and court open to intrigues and insurrection [114]\n\n\nRevolution\nNicholas had suffered a coronary occlusion only four days before his abdication [119] At the end of the \"February Revolution\", Nicholas II chose to abdicate on 2 March (O.S.) / 15 March (N.S.) 1917 He first abdicated in favor of Alexei, but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that Alexei would not live long enough while separated from his parents, who would be forced into exile Nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son, and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother, Grand Duke Michael, as the next Emperor of all the Russias He issued a statement but it was suppressed by the Provisional Government Michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a Constituent Assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic The abdication of Nicholas II and Michael's deferment of accepting the throne brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty's rule to an end The fall of Tsarist autocracy [85] [120] brought joy to liberals and socialists in Britain and France The United States was the first foreign government to recognize the Provisional government In Russia, the announcement of the tsar's abdication was greeted with many emotions, including delight, relief, fear, anger and confusion [121]\n\n\nAbdication (1917)\nNicholas had suffered a coronary occlusion only four days before his abdication [119] At the end of the \"February Revolution\", Nicholas II chose to abdicate on 2 March (O.S.) / 15 March (N.S.) 1917 He first abdicated in favor of Alexei, but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that Alexei would not live long enough while separated from his parents, who would be forced into exile Nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son, and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother, Grand Duke Michael, as the next Emperor of all the Russias He issued a statement but

joy to liberals and socialists in Britain and France The United States was the first foreign government to recognize the Provisional government In Russia, the announcement of the tsar's abdication was greeted with many emotions, including delight, relief, fear, anger and confusion [121]\n\n\nPossibility of exile\nBoth the Provisional Government and Nicholas wanted the royal family to go into exile following his abdication, with the United Kingdom being the preferred option [122] The British government reluctantly offered the family asylum on 19 March 1917, although it was suggested that it would be better for the Romanovs to go to a neutral country News of the offer provoked uproar from the Labour Party and many Liberals, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, advised the government that the extreme left would use the ex-tsar's presence \"as an excuse for rousing public opinion against us\" [123] The Liberal Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, preferred that the family went to a neutral country, and wanted the offer to be announced as at the request of the Russian government [124] The offer of asylum was withdrawn in April following objections by King George V, who, acting on the advice of his secretary, Lord Stamfordham, was worried that Nicholas's presence might provoke an uprising like the previous year's Easter Rising in Ireland However, later the king defied his secretary and went to the Romanov memorial service at the Russian Church in London [125] In the early summer of 1917, the Russian government approached the British government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of British internal politics [126]\n\n\nImprisonment\nOn 20 March 1917, the Provisional Government decreed that the imperial family should be held under house arrest in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo Nicholas joined the rest of the family there two days later, having traveled from the wartime headquarters at Mogilev [130] The family had total privacy inside the palace, but walks in the grounds were strictly regulated [131] Members of their domestic staff were allowed to stay if they wished and culinary standards were maintained [132] Colonel Eugene Kobylinsky was appointed to command the military garrison at Tsarskoye Selo, [133] which increasingly had to be done through negotiation with the committees or soviets elected by the soldiers [134] During his imprisonment Nicholas read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion to his family [135]\n\n\nTsarskoye Selo\nOn 20 March 1917, the Provisional Government decreed that the imperial family should be held under house arrest in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo Nicholas joined the rest of the family there two days later, having traveled from the wartime headquarters at Mogilev [130] The family had total privacy inside the palace, but walks in the grounds were strictly regulated [131] Members of their domestic staff were allowed to stay if they wished and culinary standards were maintained [132] Colonel Eugene Kobylinsky was appointed to command the military garrison at Tsarskoye Selo, [133] which increasingly had to be done through negotiation with the committees or soviets elected by the soldiers [134] During his imprisonment Nicholas read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion to his family [135]\n\n\nTobolsk\nThat summer, the failure of the Kerensky Offensive against Austro-Hungarian and German forces in Galicia led to anti-government rioting in Petrograd, known as the July Days The government feared that further disturbances in the city could easily reach Tsarskoye Selo and it was decided to move the imperial family to a safer location [136] Alexander Kerensky, who had taken over as prime minister, selected the town of Tobolsk in Western Siberia, since it was remote from any large city and 150 miles (240 km) from the nearest rail station [137] Some sources state that there was an intention to send the family abroad in the spring of 1918 via Japan, [138] but more recent work suggests that this was just a Bolshevik rumour [139] The family left the Alexander Palace late on 13 August, reached Tyumen by rail four days later and then by two river ferries finally reached Tobolsk on 19 August [140] There they lived in the former Governor's Mansion in considerable comfort In October 1917, however, the Bolsheviks seized power from Kerensky's Provisional Government; Nicholas followed the events in October with interest but not yet with alarm Boris Soloviev, the husband of Maria Rasputin, attempted to organize a rescue with monarchical factions, but it came to nothing Rumors persist that Soloviev was working for the Bolsheviks or the Germans, or both [141] Separate preparations for a rescue by Nikolai Yevgenyevich Markov were frustrated by Soloviev's ineffectual activities [142] Nicholas continued to underestimate Lenin's importance In the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with reading books, exercising and playing games; Nicholas particularly enjoyed chopping firewood [143] However, in January 1918, the guard detachment's committee grew more assertive, restricting the hours that the family could spend in the grounds and banning them from walking to church on a Sunday as they had done since October [144] In a later incident, the soldiers tore the epaulettes from Kobylinsky's uniform, and he asked Nicholas not to wear his uniform outside for fear of provoking a similar event [145]\n\n\nYekaterinburg\nAt 3 am on 25 April, the three Romanovs, their retinue, and the escort of Yakovlev's detachment, left Tobolsk in a convoy of nineteen tarantasses (four-wheeled carriages), as the river was still partly frozen which prevented the use of the ferry [155] After an arduous journey which included two overnight stops, fording rivers, frequent changes of horses and a foiled plot by the Yekaterinburg Red Guards to abduct and kill the prisoners, the party arrived at Tyumen and boarded a requisitioned train Yakovlev was able to communicate securely with Moscow by means of a Hughes' teleprinter and obtained agreement to change their destination to Omsk, where it was thought that the leadership were less likely to harm the Romanovs [156] Leaving Tyumen early on 28 April, the train left towards Yekaterinburg, but quickly changed direction towards Omsk This led the Yekaterinburg leaders to believe that Yakovlev was a traitor who was trying to take Nicholas to exile by way of Vladivostok; telegraph messages were sent, two thousand armed men were mobilized and a train was dispatched to arrest Yakovlev and the Romanovs The Romanovs' train was halted at Omsk station and after a frantic exchange of cables with Moscow, it was agreed that they should go to Yekaterinburg in return for a guarantee of safety for the imperial family; they finally arrived there on the morning of 30 April [157]\n\n\nExecution\nThere are several accounts of what happened and historians have not agreed on a solid, confirmed scope of events According to the account of Bolshevik officer Yakov Yurovsky (the chief executioner), in the early hours of 17 July 1918, [53] [54] the royal family was awakened around 2:00 am, got dressed, and were led down into a half-basement room at the back of the Ipatiev house The pretext for this move was the family's safety, i.e that anti-Bolshevik forces were approaching Yekaterinburg, and the house might be fired upon [164]\n\n\nIdentification\nIn 1979, the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, three of their daughters, and those of four non-family members killed with them, were discovered near Sverdlovsk (Yekaterinburg) by amateur archaeologist Alexander Avdonin [172] [173] In January 1998, the remains excavated from underneath the dirt road near Yekaterinburg were officially identified as those of Nicholas II and his family, excluding one daughter (either Maria or Anastasia) and Alexei The identifications—including comparisons to a living relative, performed by separate Russian, British and American scientists using DNA analysis—concur and were found to be conclusive [174] [175] [176] [177]\n\n\nFuneral\nAfter the DNA testing of 1998, the remains of the tsar and his immediate family were interred at St Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg, on 17 July 1998, on the eightieth anniversary of their assassination The ceremony was attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who said, \"Today is a historic day for Russia For many years, we kept quiet about this monstrous crime, but the truth has to be spoken.\" [190]\n\n\nSainthood\nIn 1981, Nicholas and his immediate family were recognised as martyred saints by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia [192] On 14 August 2000, they were recognised by the synod of the Russian Orthodox Church This time they were not named as martyrs, since their deaths did not result immediately from their Christian faith; instead, they were canonized as passion bearers [193] According to a statement by the Moscow synod, they were glorified as saints for the following reasons:\n\n\nLegacy\nContemporary evaluations of Nicholas portrayed him as a well-meaning but indecisive leader, whose actions as monarch were heavily influenced by his advisors Historian Raymond Esthus states:\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nNicholas II's full title as Emperor, as set forth in Article 59 of the 1906 Constitution, was: \"By the Grace of God, We Nicholas, Emperor and Autocrat of All Russia, of Moscow, Kiev, Vladimir, Novgorod; Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan, Tsar of Poland, Tsar of Siberia, Tsar of Tauric Chersonesus, Tsar of Georgia; Lord of Pskov, and Grand Prince of Smolensk, Lithuania, Volhynia, Podolia, and

(Russian: Земля Императора Николая II, Zemlya Imperatora Nikolaya II) was discovered in 1913 by the Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition led by Boris Vilkitsky on behalf of the Russian Hydrographic Service [205] Still incompletely surveyed, the new territory was officially named in the Emperor's honour by order of the Secretary of the Imperial Navy in 1914 [206] The archipelago was renamed \"Severnaya Zemlya\" in 1926 by the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union [207]\n\n\nArms\nEstimates of Nicholas II's personal wealth have been vastly exaggerated As Emperor of All The Russias, and an autocrat, the resources under his command were virtually incalculable However, the vast majority of this was owned by the state as crown property; the Romanov family's personal wealth was only a small fraction of this As monarch, the income of Nicholas was 24 million gold roubles per annum: this derived from a yearly allowance from the treasury, and from the profits of crown farmland [240] From this income, he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings \"Before the end of the year, the Tsar was usually penniless; sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn\" [240] According to the Grand Marshal of the Court, Count Paul Benckendorff, the family's total financial resources amounted to between 12.5 and 17.5 million roubles [241] As a comparison, Prince Felix Yusupov estimated his family's worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to 50 million gold roubles [242]\n\n\nChildren\nEstimates of Nicholas II's personal wealth have been vastly exaggerated As Emperor of All The Russias, and an autocrat, the resources under his command were

Russia**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nNicholas II, also known as Nicholas Alexandrovich Romanov, was the last Emperor of Russia, ruling from 1894 until his abdication in 1917. He was a member of the House of Romanov and the eldest son of Alexander III and Maria Feodorovna. Nicholas II's reign was marked by significant events, including the Russo-Japanese War, the 1905 Revolution, and World War I. His life and reign ended in tragedy with his execution by the Bolsheviks in 1918.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nNicholas II was born on 18 May [O.S. 6 May] 1868, in the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, south of Saint Petersburg, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, Emperor Alexander II. He was the eldest child of then-Tsesarevich Alexander Alexandrovich and his wife, Tsesarevna Maria Feodorovna (née Princess Dagmar of Denmark). Alexander Alexandrovich was heir apparent to the Russian throne as the second but eldest surviving son of Emperor Alexander II and Empress Maria Alexandrovna (née Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine). Maria Feodorovna was the daughter of King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nNicholas II was to have five younger siblings: Alexander (1869–1870), George (1871–1899), Xenia (1875–1960), Michael (1878–1918), and Olga (1882–1960). Nicholas often referred to his father nostalgically in letters after Alexander's death in 1894. He was also very close to his mother, as revealed in their published letters to each other. In his childhood, Nicholas, his parents, and siblings made annual visits to the Danish royal palaces of Fredensborg and Bernstorff to visit his grandparents, the king and queen. The visits also served as family reunions, as his mother's siblings would also come from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Greece with their respective families.\n\n**Tsarevich**\n\nOn 1 March 1881, [following the assassination of his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II, Nicholas became heir apparent or tsarevich upon his father's accession as Alexander III. Nicholas and his other family members bore witness to Alexander II's death, having been present at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, where he was brought after the attack. For security reasons, the new Tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the Gatchina Palace outside the city, only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions. On such occasions, Alexander III and his family occupied the nearby Anichkov Palace.\n\n**Accession, Reign, and Marriage**\n\nNicholas II came to the throne in 1894 upon the death of his father, Alexander III. He was married to Alexandra, the daughter of King Frederick III of Germany and Victoria, Princess of Hesse and by Rhine. Nicholas II's coronation took place on 26 May 1896. During his reign, Nicholas II faced significant challenges, including the Russo-Japanese War, the 1905 Revolution, and World War I. He was known for his conservative views and his strong faith in the Orthodox Church.\n\n**Ecclesiastical Affairs**\n\nNicholas II always believed God chose him to be the tsar, and therefore, the decisions of the tsar reflected the will of God and could not be disputed. He was convinced that the simple people of Russia understood this and loved him, as demonstrated by the display of affection he perceived when he made public appearances. His old-fashioned belief made for a very stubborn ruler who rejected constitutional limitations on his power.\n\n**Initiatives in Foreign Affairs**\n\nNicholas II pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to Manchuria and Korea, and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the Bezobrazov group. He saw the war as an easy God-given victory that would raise Russian morale and patriotism. He ignored the financial repercussions of a long-distance war and the capabilities of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\n**Russo-Japanese War**\n\nDespite his aggressive stance, the Russian military was poorly prepared for the war, and the country suffered a series of defeats. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905, which forced Russia to cede control of Manchuria and the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan.\n\n**1905 Revolution**\n\nThe war was followed by a wave of unrest in Russia, known as the 1905 Revolution. The revolution was sparked by a series of strikes and protests, which eventually led to the formation of a provisional government. The revolution was eventually put down by the government, but it had a significant impact on Nicholas II's rule.\n\n**Relationship with the Duma**\n\nNicholas II had a strained relationship with the Duma, the Russian parliament. He saw the Duma as a threat to his authority and was reluctant to grant it any significant power. The Duma, on the other hand, saw Nicholas II as a tyrant who was unwilling to listen to the needs of the people.\n\n**Tsarevich Alexei's Illness and Rasputin**\n\nNicholas II's son, Alexei, was born in 1904 with hemophilia, a genetic disorder that made him prone to bleeding. The tsarevich's illness was a significant source of stress for the royal family, and they turned to a mystic named Grigori Rasputin for help. Rasputin's influence over the tsar and his family was significant, and he was often seen as a key advisor.\n\n**World War I**\n\nNicholas II's reign was marked by the outbreak of World War I. Russia entered the war in 1914, and the country suffered significant losses. Nicholas II took personal command of the army and was away from the capital for much of the war. The war had a significant impact on the Russian people, who were tired of the conflict and the lack of progress.\n\n**Collapse of the Romanov Dynasty**\n\nThe Romanov dynasty came to an end in 1917, when Nicholas II was forced to abdicate. He was succeeded by a provisional government, which was eventually overthrown by the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks executed Nicholas II and his family in 1918, bringing an end to the Romanov dynasty.\n\n**Exile and Execution**\n\nNicholas II and his family were placed under house arrest in Tobolsk in 1917. They were later moved to Yekaterinburg, where they were executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918. The execution was carried out by a firing squad, and the bodies of the royal family were buried in a secret grave.\n\n**Identification and Burial**\n\nThe bodies of Nicholas II and his family were identified in 1991, using DNA evidence. They were reburied in St. Petersburg in 1998, with full honors.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nNicholas II's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a strong leader who was committed to the Russian people, but also as a tyrant who was responsible for the deaths of millions of people. His reign was marked by significant events, including the Russo-Japanese War, the 1905 Revolution, and World War I. He was a conservative leader who believed in the power of the Orthodox Church, but he was also a modernizer who wanted to bring Russia into the 20th century.\n\n**Documentaries and Films**\n\nSeveral documentaries and films have been made about Nicholas II and his family, including \"Nicholas and Alexandra\" (1971) and \"The Last Tsar\" (2012).\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Nicholas II\n* Alexandra Feodorovna\n* Grigori Rasputin\n* Alexei Nikolaev\n* Russian Revolution\n* World War I\n* Russian Empire\n* Romanov Dynasty\n\nNote: The article is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone, and follows the exact outline structure using \"#\" for main sections and \"##\" for subsections.

siblings: Alexander (1869–1870), George (1871–1899), Xenia (1875–1960), Michael (1878–1918) and Olga (1882–1960) Nicholas often referred to his father nostalgically in letters after Alexander's death in 1894 He was also very close to his mother, as revealed in their published letters to each other [7] In his childhood, Nicholas, his parents and siblings made annual visits to the Danish royal palaces of Fredensborg and Bernstorff to visit his grandparents, the king and queen The visits also served as family reunions, as his mother's siblings would also come from the United Kingdom, Germany and Greece with their respective families [8] It was there in 1883, that he had a flirtation with one of his British first cousins, Princess Victoria In 1873, Nicholas also accompanied his parents and younger brother, two-year-old George, on a two-month, semi-official visit to the United Kingdom [9] In London, Nicholas and his family stayed at Marlborough House, as guests of his \"Uncle Bertie\" and \"Aunt Alix\", the Prince and Princess of Wales, where he was spoiled by his uncle [10]\n\n\nTsarevich\nOn 1 March 1881, [11] following the assassination of his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II, Nicholas became heir apparent or tsarevich upon his father's accession as Alexander III Nicholas and his other family members bore witness to Alexander II's death, having been present at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, where he was brought after the attack [12] For security reasons, the new Tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the Gatchina Palace outside the city, only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions On such occasions, Alexander III and his family occupied the nearby Anichkov Palace [citation needed]\n\n\nEngagement\nIn April 1894, Nicholas joined his uncle Sergei and aunt Elizabeth on a journey to Coburg, Germany, for the wedding of Elizabeth's and Alix's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, to their mutual first cousin Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Other guests included Queen Victoria, Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Empress Frederick (Kaiser Wilhelm's mother and Queen Victoria's eldest daughter), Nicholas's uncle, the Prince of Wales, and the bride's parents, the Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\n\nAccession, reign and marriage\nDefunct\n\n\nCoronation\nDespite a visit to the United Kingdom in 1893, where he observed the House of Commons in debate and was seemingly impressed by the machinery of constitutional monarchy, Nicholas turned his back on any notion of giving away any power to elected representatives in Russia Shortly after he came to the throne, a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns' local assemblies (zemstvos) came to the Winter Palace proposing court reforms, such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy, [30] and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry, in the Tver Address [31] [32]\n\n\nEcclesiastical affairs\nNicholas always believed God chose him to be the tsar and therefore the decisions of the tsar reflected the will of God and could not be disputed He was convinced that the simple people of Russia understood this and loved him, as demonstrated by the display of affection he perceived when he made public appearances His old-fashioned belief made for a very stubborn ruler who rejected constitutional limitations on his power It put the tsar at variance with the emerging political consensus among the Russian elite It was further belied by the subordinate position of the Church in the bureaucracy The result was a new distrust between the tsar and the church hierarchy and between those hierarchs and the people Thereby the tsar's base of support was conflicted [39]\n\n\nInitiatives in foreign affairs\nAccording to his biographer:\n\n\nRusso-Japanese War\nA clash between Russia and the Empire of Japan was almost inevitable by the turn of the 20th century Russia had expanded in the Far East, and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions, as its southward path to the Balkans was frustrated, conflicted with Japan's own territorial ambitions on the Asian mainland Nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to Manchuria and Korea, and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the Bezobrazov group [48] [49]\n\n\nTsar's confidence in victory\nNicholas's stance on the war was so at variance with the obvious facts that many observers were baffled He saw the war as an easy God-given victory that would raise Russian morale and patriotism He ignored the financial repercussions of a long-distance war [55] Rotem Kowner argues that during his visit to Japan in 1891, where Nicholas was attacked by a Japanese policeman, he regarded the Japanese as small of stature, feminine, weak, and inferior He ignored reports of the prowess of Japanese soldiers in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) and reports on the capabilities of the Imperial Japanese Navy, as well as negative reports on the lack of readiness of Russian forces [15]\n\n\nAnti-Jewish pogroms of 1903–1906\nThe Kishinev newspaper Bessarabets, which published anti-Semitic materials, received funds from Viacheslav Plehve, Minister of the Interior [58] These publications served to fuel the Kishinev pogrom (rioting) The government of Nicholas II formally condemned the rioting and dismissed the regional governor, with the perpetrators arrested and punished by the court [59] Leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church also condemned anti-Semitic pogroms Appeals to the faithful condemning the pogroms were read publicly in all churches of Russia [60] In private Nicholas expressed his admiration for the mobs, viewing anti-Semitism as a useful tool for unifying the people behind the government; [61] however in 1911, following the assassination of Pyotr Stolypin by the Jewish revolutionary Dmitry Bogrov, he approved of government efforts to prevent anti-Semitic pogroms [62]\n\n\nRussification of Finland\nIn Finland, Nicholas had become associated with deeply unpopular Russification measures These began with the February Manifesto proclaimed by Nicholas II in 1899, [63] which restricted Finland's autonomy and instigated a period of censorship and political repression [64] A petition of protest signed by more than 500,000 Finns was collected against the manifesto and delivered to St Petersburg by a delegation of 500 people, but they were not received by Nicholas Russification measures were reintroduced in 1908 after a temporary suspension in the aftermath of the 1905 Revolution, and Nicholas received an icy reception when he made his only visit to Helsinki on 10 March 1915 [65] [66] [67]\n\n\nBloody Sunday (1905)\nA few days prior to Bloody Sunday (9 (22) January 1905), priest and labor leader Georgy Gapon informed the government of the forthcoming procession to the Winter Palace to hand a workers' petition to the tsar On Saturday, 8 (21) January, the ministers convened to consider the situation There was never any thought that the tsar, who had left the capital for Tsarskoye Selo on the advice of the ministers, would actually meet Gapon; the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected [68]\n\n\n1905 Revolution\nConfronted with growing opposition and after consulting with Witte and Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky, the Tsar issued a reform ukase on 25 December 1904 with vague promises [75] \nIn hopes of cutting the rebellion short, many demonstrators were shot on Bloody Sunday (1905) as they tried to march to the Winter Palace in St Petersburg Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov was ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity Grand Duke Sergei was killed in February by a revolutionary's bomb in Moscow as he left the Kremlin On 3 March the tsar condemned the revolutionaries Meanwhile, Witte recommended that a manifesto be issued [76] Schemes of reform would be elaborated by Ivan Goremykin and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the zemstvos and municipal councils under the presidency of Witte [citation needed] In June the battleship Potemkin, part of the Black Sea Fleet, mutinied.\n\n\nRelationship with the Duma\nUnder pressure from the attempted 1905 Russian Revolution, on 5 August of that year Nicholas II issued a manifesto about the convocation of the State Duma, known as the Bulygin Duma, initially thought to be an advisory organ In the October Manifesto, the Tsar pledged to introduce basic civil liberties, provide for broad participation in the State Duma, and endow the Duma with legislative and oversight powers He was determined, however, to preserve his autocracy even in the context of reform This was signalled in the text of the 1906 constitution He was described as the supreme autocrat, and retained sweeping executive powers, also in church affairs His cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere with nor assist one another; they were responsible only to him [citation needed]\n\n\nTsarevich Alexei's illness and Rasputin\nFurther complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession Alexandra bore Nicholas four daughters, Grand Duchess Olga in 1895, Grand Duchess Tatiana in 1897, Grand Duchess Maria in 1899, and Grand Duchess Anastasia in 1901, before their son Alexei was born on 12 August 1904 The young heir was afflicted with Hemophilia B, a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly, which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death As a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Alexandra carried the same gene mutation that afflicted several of the major European royal houses, such as Prussia and Spain Hemophilia, therefore, became known as \"the royal disease\" Through Alexandra, the disease had passed on to her son As all of Nicholas and Alexandra's daughters were assassinated with their parents and brother in Yekaterinburg in 1918, it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as carriers [citation needed]\n\n\nEuropean affairs\nIn 1907, to end longstanding controversies over central Asia, Russia and the United Kingdom signed the Anglo-Russian Convention that resolved most of the problems generated for decades by The Great Game [98] The UK had already entered into the Entente Cordiale with France in 1904, and the Anglo-Russian Convention led to the formation of the Triple Entente The following year, in May 1908, Nicholas and Alexandra's shared \"Uncle Bertie\" and \"Aunt Alix\", Britain's King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, made a state visit to Russia, being the first reigning British monarchs to do so However, they did not set foot on Russian soil Instead, they stayed aboard their yachts, meeting off the coast of modern-day Tallinn [citation needed] Later that year, Nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister, Alexander Izvolsky, had entered into a secret agreement with the Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, Count Alois von Aehrenthal, agreeing that, in exchange for Russian naval access to the Dardanelles and the Bosporus Strait, Russia would not oppose the Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a revision of the 1878 Treaty of Berlin When Austria-Hungary did annex this territory that October, it precipitated the Bosnian Crisis When Russia protested about the annexation, the Austrians threatened to leak secret communications between Izvolsky and Aehrenthal, prompting Nicholas to complain in a letter to Emperor Franz Joseph, about a breach of confidence [citation needed] In 1909, in the wake of the Anglo-Russian convention, the Russian imperial family made a visit to England, staying on the Isle of Wight for Cowes Week In 1913, during the Balkan Wars, Nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between Serbia and Bulgaria However, the Bulgarians rejected his offer [citation needed] Also in 1913, Nicholas, albeit without Alexandra, made a visit to Berlin for the wedding of Kaiser Wilhelm II's daughter, Princess Victoria Louise, to a maternal cousin of Nicholas, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick [99] Nicholas was also joined by his cousin, King George V and his wife, Queen Mary [citation needed]\n\n\nTercentenary\nIn February 1913, Nicholas presided over the tercentenary celebrations for the Romanov Dynasty On 21 February, a Te Deum took place at Kazan Cathedral, and a state reception at the Winter Palace [100] In May, Nicholas and the imperial family made a pilgrimage across the empire, retracing the route down the Volga River that was made by the teenage Michael Romanov from the Ipatiev Monastery in Kostroma to Moscow in 1613 when he finally agreed to become tsar [101]\n\n\nFirst World War\nOn 28 June 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb nationalist in Sarajevo, who opposed Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina The outbreak of war was not inevitable, but leaders, diplomats and nineteenth-century alliances created a climate for large-scale conflict The concept of Pan-Slavism and shared religion created strong public sympathy between Russia and Serbia Territorial conflict created rivalries between Germany and France and between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, and as a consequence alliance networks developed across Europe The Triple Entente and Triple Alliance networks were set before the war Nicholas wanted neither to abandon Serbia to the ultimatum of Austria-Hungary, nor to provoke a general war In a series of letters exchanged with Wilhelm of Germany (the \"Willy–Nicky correspondence\") the two proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down Nicholas desired that Russia's mobilization be only against Austria-Hungary, in the hopes of preventing war with Germany [citation needed]\n\n\nCollapse\nAs the government failed to produce supplies, mounting hardship resulted in massive riots and rebellions With Nicholas away at the front from 1915 through 1916, authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering soldiers Despite efforts by the British Ambassador Sir George Buchanan to warn the Tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution, Nicholas continued to bury himself away at the Staff HQ (Stavka) 600 kilometres (400 mi) away at Mogilev, leaving his capital and court open to intrigues and insurrection [114]\n\n\nRevolution\nNicholas had suffered a coronary occlusion only four days before his abdication [119] At the end of the \"February Revolution\", Nicholas II chose to abdicate on 2 March (O.S.) / 15 March (N.S.) 1917 He first abdicated in favor of Alexei, but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that Alexei would not live long enough while separated from his parents, who would be forced into exile Nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son, and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother, Grand Duke Michael, as the next Emperor of all the Russias He issued a statement but it was suppressed by the Provisional Government Michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a Constituent Assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic The abdication of Nicholas II and Michael's deferment of accepting the throne brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty's rule to an end The fall of Tsarist autocracy [85] [120] brought joy to liberals and socialists in Britain and France The United States was the first foreign government to recognize the Provisional government In Russia, the announcement of the tsar's abdication was greeted with many emotions, including delight, relief, fear, anger and confusion [121]\n\n\nAbdication (1917)\nNicholas had suffered a coronary occlusion only

The United States was the first foreign government to recognize the Provisional government In Russia, the announcement of the tsar's abdication was greeted with many emotions, including delight, relief, fear, anger and confusion [121]\n\n\nPossibility of exile\nBoth the Provisional Government and Nicholas wanted the royal family to go into exile following his abdication, with the United Kingdom being the preferred option [122] The British government reluctantly offered the family asylum on 19 March 1917, although it was suggested that it would be better for the Romanovs to go to a neutral country News of the offer provoked uproar from the Labour Party and many Liberals, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, advised the government that the extreme left would use the ex-tsar's presence \"as an excuse for rousing public opinion against us\" [123] The Liberal Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, preferred that the family went to a neutral country, and wanted the offer to be announced as at the request of the Russian government [124] The offer of asylum was withdrawn in April following objections by King George V, who, acting on the advice of his secretary, Lord Stamfordham, was worried that Nicholas's presence might provoke an uprising like the previous year's Easter Rising in Ireland However, later the king defied his secretary and went to the Romanov memorial service at the Russian Church in London [125] In the early summer of 1917, the Russian government approached the British government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of British internal politics [126]\n\n\nImprisonment\nOn 20 March 1917, the Provisional Government decreed that the imperial family should be held under house arrest in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo Nicholas joined the rest of the family there two days later, having traveled from the wartime headquarters at Mogilev [130] The family had total privacy inside the palace, but walks in the grounds were strictly regulated [131] Members of their domestic staff were allowed to stay if they wished and culinary standards were maintained [132] Colonel Eugene Kobylinsky was appointed to command the military garrison at Tsarskoye Selo, [133] which increasingly had to be done through negotiation with the committees or soviets elected by the soldiers [134] During his imprisonment Nicholas read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion to his family [135]\n\n\nTsarskoye Selo\nOn 20 March 1917, the Provisional Government decreed that the imperial family should be held under house arrest in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo Nicholas joined the rest of the family there two days later, having traveled from the wartime headquarters at Mogilev [130] The family had total privacy inside the palace, but walks in the grounds were strictly regulated [131] Members of their domestic staff were allowed to stay if they wished and culinary standards

soviets elected by the soldiers [134] During his imprisonment Nicholas read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion to his family [135]\n\n\nTobolsk\nThat summer, the failure of the Kerensky Offensive against Austro-Hungarian and German forces in Galicia led to anti-government rioting in Petrograd, known as the July Days The government feared that further disturbances in the city could easily reach Tsarskoye Selo and it was decided to move the imperial family to a safer location [136] Alexander Kerensky, who had taken over as prime minister, selected the town of Tobolsk in Western Siberia, since it was remote from any large city and 150 miles (240 km) from the nearest rail station [137] Some sources state that there was an intention to send the family abroad in the spring of 1918 via Japan, [138] but more recent work suggests that this was just a Bolshevik rumour [139] The family left the Alexander Palace late on 13 August, reached Tyumen by rail four days later and then by two river ferries finally reached Tobolsk on 19 August [140] There they lived in the former Governor's Mansion in considerable comfort In October 1917, however, the Bolsheviks seized power from Kerensky's Provisional Government; Nicholas followed the events in October with interest but not yet with alarm Boris Soloviev, the husband of Maria Rasputin, attempted to organize a rescue with monarchical factions, but it came to nothing Rumors persist that Soloviev was working for the Bolsheviks or the Germans, or both [141] Separate preparations for a rescue by Nikolai Yevgenyevich Markov were frustrated by Soloviev's ineffectual activities [142] Nicholas continued to underestimate Lenin's importance In the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with reading books, exercising and playing games; Nicholas particularly enjoyed chopping firewood [143] However, in January 1918, the guard detachment's committee grew more assertive, restricting the hours that the family could spend in the grounds and banning them from walking to church on a Sunday as they had done since October [144] In a later incident, the soldiers tore the epaulettes from Kobylinsky's uniform, and he asked Nicholas not to wear his uniform outside for fear of provoking a similar event [145]\n\n\nYekaterinburg\nAt 3 am on 25 April, the three Romanovs, their retinue, and the escort of Yakovlev's detachment, left Tobolsk in a convoy of nineteen tarantasses (four-wheeled carriages), as the river was still partly frozen which prevented the use of the ferry [155] After an arduous journey which included two overnight stops, fording rivers, frequent changes of horses and a foiled plot by the Yekaterinburg Red Guards to abduct and kill the prisoners, the party arrived at Tyumen and boarded a requisitioned train Yakovlev was able to communicate securely with Moscow by means of a Hughes' teleprinter and obtained agreement to change their destination to Omsk, where it was thought that the leadership were less likely to harm the Romanovs [156] Leaving Tyumen early on 28 April, the train left towards Yekaterinburg, but quickly changed direction towards Omsk This led the Yekaterinburg leaders to believe that Yakovlev was a traitor who was trying to take Nicholas to exile by way of Vladivostok; telegraph messages were sent, two thousand armed men were mobilized and a train was dispatched to arrest Yakovlev and the Romanovs The Romanovs' train was halted at Omsk station and after a frantic exchange of cables with Moscow, it was agreed that they should go to Yekaterinburg in return for a guarantee of safety for the imperial family; they finally arrived there on the morning of 30 April [157]\n\n\nExecution\nThere are several accounts of what happened and historians have not agreed on a solid, confirmed scope of events According to the account of Bolshevik officer Yakov Yurovsky (the chief executioner), in the early hours of 17 July 1918, [53] [54] the royal family was awakened around 2:00 am, got dressed, and were led down into a half-basement room at the back of the Ipatiev house The pretext for this move was the family's safety, i.e that anti-Bolshevik forces were approaching Yekaterinburg, and the house might be fired upon [164]\n\n\nIdentification\nIn 1979, the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, three of their daughters, and those of four non-family members killed with them, were discovered near Sverdlovsk (Yekaterinburg) by amateur archaeologist Alexander Avdonin [172] [173] In January 1998, the remains excavated from underneath the dirt road near Yekaterinburg were officially identified as those of Nicholas II and his family, excluding one daughter (either Maria or Anastasia) and Alexei The identifications—including comparisons to a living relative, performed by separate Russian, British and American scientists using DNA analysis—concur and were found to be conclusive [174] [175] [176] [177]\n\n\nFuneral\nAfter the DNA testing of 1998, the remains of the tsar and his immediate family were interred at St Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg, on 17 July 1998, on the eightieth anniversary of their assassination The ceremony was attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who said, \"Today is a historic day for Russia For many years, we kept quiet about this monstrous crime, but the truth has to be spoken.\" [190]\n\n\nSainthood\nIn 1981, Nicholas and his immediate family were recognised as martyred saints by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia [192] On 14 August 2000, they were recognised by the synod of the Russian Orthodox Church This time they were not named as martyrs, since their deaths did not result immediately from their Christian faith; instead, they were canonized as passion bearers [193] According to a statement by the Moscow synod, they were glorified as saints for the following reasons:\n\n\nLegacy\nContemporary evaluations of Nicholas portrayed him as a well-meaning but indecisive leader, whose actions as monarch were heavily influenced by his advisors Historian Raymond Esthus states:\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nNicholas II's full title as Emperor, as set forth in Article 59 of the 1906 Constitution, was: \"By the Grace of God, We Nicholas, Emperor and Autocrat of All Russia, of Moscow, Kiev, Vladimir, Novgorod; Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan, Tsar of Poland, Tsar of Siberia, Tsar of Tauric Chersonesus, Tsar of Georgia; Lord of Pskov, and Grand Prince of Smolensk, Lithuania, Volhynia, Podolia, and Finland; Prince of Estonia, Livonia,

and Possessor of the Circassian and Mountain Princes and of others; Sovereign of Turkestan, Heir of Norway, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, Stormarn, Dithmarschen, and Oldenburg, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth.\" [204]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nNicholas II's full title as Emperor, as set forth in Article 59 of the 1906 Constitution, was: \"By the Grace of God, We Nicholas, Emperor and Autocrat of All Russia, of Moscow, Kiev, Vladimir, Novgorod; Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan, Tsar of Poland, Tsar of Siberia, Tsar of Tauric Chersonesus, Tsar of Georgia; Lord of Pskov, and Grand

Imperatora Nikolaya II) was discovered in 1913 by the Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition led by Boris Vilkitsky on behalf of the Russian Hydrographic Service [205] Still incompletely surveyed, the new territory was officially named in the Emperor's honour by order of the Secretary of the Imperial Navy in 1914 [206] The archipelago was renamed \"Severnaya Zemlya\" in 1926 by the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union [207]\n\n\nArms\nEstimates of Nicholas II's personal wealth have been vastly exaggerated As Emperor of All The Russias, and an autocrat, the resources under his command were virtually incalculable However, the vast majority of this was owned by the state as crown property; the Romanov family's personal wealth was only a small fraction of this As monarch, the income of Nicholas was 24 million gold roubles per annum: this derived from a yearly allowance from the treasury, and from the profits of crown farmland [240] From this income, he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings \"Before the end of the year, the Tsar was usually penniless; sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn\" [240] According to the Grand Marshal of the Court, Count Paul Benckendorff, the family's total financial resources amounted to between 12.5 and 17.5 million roubles [241] As a comparison, Prince Felix Yusupov estimated his family's worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to 50 million gold roubles [242]\n\n\nChildren\nEstimates of

{"title": "List_of_2022_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies", "content": "\nHuman rights concern\nIn a December 2021 interview with Al Jazeera, FIFA's secretary-general Fatma Samoura said that FIFA had developed a general framework to structure and guide the implementation of its human rights responsibilities and commitment, published in 2017, and that Qatar had implemented those recommendations [22] After a thorough investigation, the International Labour Organization, claimed the figures \"misleading\" and said they had been wrongly linked to World Cup sites without proper context in November 2022 via reported drafted by France24 Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri said Qatar already has started a Workers' Support and Insurance Fund to help workers which successfully reimbursed US$320 million this year alone to  victims through the Insurance Fund stated the ILO in November 2022 Furthermore, according to a statement by ITUC (International Trade Union Confederation) General Secretary Sharan Burrow, who had previously been a harsh critic of Qatar's labour laws, workers can now obtain justice in the country She praised \"the amazing change of the labour legislation in Qatar In an article, which was published in September 2020, experts from the OHCHR (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights) added, \"We are very encouraged by the bold steps Qatar is taking to increase the protection of migrant workers' rights and ensure adequate living and working conditions for all.\" [23]\n\n\nLGBT issues\nBecause of Islamic sharia law, there are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalised As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy The security of fans, [24] as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion [25]\n\n\nPre-tournament\nEach stadium in Qatar requires 10,000 litres of water per day in winter months, when the tournament is taking place, to maintain the pitch With little access to freshwater in the nation, the sourced water was saltwater, which has to be desalinated The process damages the marine environment Desalination plants in the Middle East also heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels As well as the pitches at the stadiums, the organising committee grew and maintained a large farm of match-suitable fresh grass outside Doha, in case of turf damage The need for so much desalination, and the oil and gas used to power the plants, have been criticised [31]\n\n\nStadiums\nEach stadium in Qatar requires 10,000 litres of water per day in winter months, when the tournament is taking place, to maintain the pitch With little access to freshwater in the nation, the sourced water was saltwater, which has to be desalinated The process damages the marine environment Desalination plants in the Middle East also heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels As well as the pitches at the stadiums, the organising committee grew and maintained a large farm of match-suitable fresh grass outside Doha, in case of turf damage The need for so much desalination, and the oil and gas used to power the plants, have been criticised [31]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nEach stadium in Qatar requires 10,000 litres of water per day in winter months, when the tournament is taking place, to maintain the pitch With little access to freshwater in the nation, the sourced water was saltwater, which has to be desalinated The process damages the marine environment Desalination plants in the Middle East also heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels As well as the pitches at the stadiums, the organising committee grew and maintained a large farm of match-suitable fresh grass outside Doha, in case of turf damage The need for so much desalination, and the oil and gas used to power the plants, have been criticised [31]\n\n\nCorruption\nThere have been allegations of bribery or corruption in the Qatar's 2022 World Cup selection process involving members of FIFA's executive committee There have been numerous allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and FIFA members and executives, some of whom—including Theo Zwanziger and Sepp Blatter—were later recorded regretting awarding Qatar the tournament [33] [34] [35] [36]\n\n\n2011\nIn May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup being held in Qatar According to then vice-president Jack Warner, an email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar 'bought' the 2022 World Cup through bribery via Mohammed bin Hammam who was president of the Asian Football Confederation at the time Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing [37] A whistleblower, revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5m by Qatar [38] She later retracted her claims of bribery, stating she had fabricated them in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid team for relieving her of her job with them She also denied being put under any pressure to make her retraction FIFA confirmed receiving an email from her which stated her retraction [39] [40]\n\n\n2014–15\nIn March 2014, it was alleged that a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign paid committee member Jack Warner and his family almost $2 million The Daily Telegraph reported that it understands that the U.S FBI is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid [41]\n\n\nFIFA ethics investigation report\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar, the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup respectively Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids and spoke to all persons connected to the bids and appealed for witnesses to come forward with evidence [46] At the end of investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report in September 2015 FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge Hans Joachim Eckert who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process [47]\n\n\n2020\nIn January, Bonita Mersiades, a whistle-blower from inside Australia's 2022 World Cup bid published a book which alleges that in the months before the vote in December 2010, FIFA executives were privately worried that a Qatar win would leave a financial shortfall for the governing body in 2022 which Al Jazeera (now beIN Sports) agreed a secret deal to pay $100 million if Qatar won the vote According to the book, the deal took place with the involvement and knowledge of Jérôme Valcke, secretary general of FIFA at the time who was later banned for nine years from football for corruption The Mail on Sunday asked beIN Sports about the allegations, in which a spokesman characterised the bonus as \"production contributions\" which were \"standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders\" [49]\n\n\nScheduling\nThe notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial; Blatter ruled out a January or February event because it may clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics, [55] while others expressed concerns over a November or December event, because it might clash with the Christmas season (even though Qatar is predominantly Muslim, the players in the tournament are predominantly Christian) [56] The Premier League voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues FA Chairman Greg Dyke said, shortly after he took his job in 2013, that he was open to either a winter tournament or moving the tournament to another country [57] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar's desert state was a \"blatant mistake\", and that any potential shift to a winter event would be unmanageable due to the effect on major European domestic leagues [33]\n\n\nClimate\nAs the World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer, the weather in Qatar was a concern with temperatures reaching more than 50 °C (122 °F) Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital in Doha who gave an interview in November 2010 to Qatar Today magazine said the climate would be an issue, stating that the region's climate would \"affect performance levels from a health point of view\" of professional athletes, specifically footballers, that \"recovery times between games would be longer\" than in a temperate climate and that, on the field of play, \"more mistakes would be made\" One of the doctors said that \"total acclimation (to the Qatari climate) is impossible\" [73]\n\n\nCost\nBy some estimates, the World Cup is set to cost Qatar approximately US$220 billion (£184 billion) This is about 60 times the $3.5 billion that South Africa spent on the 2010 FIFA World Cup [74] Nicola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, told an investors' summit held in Munich that £107 billion would be spent on stadiums and facilities plus a further £31 billion on transport infrastructure Ritter said £30 billion would be spent on building air-conditioned stadiums with £48 billion on training facilities and accommodation for players and fans A further £28 billion will be spent on creating a new city called Lusail that will surround the stadium that will host the opening and final matches of the tournament [75]\n\n\nPossible Israeli qualification\nThe head of the Qatar bid delegation stated that if Israel were to qualify, they would be able to compete in the World Cup despite Qatar not recognising the state of Israel [80] [81] [82] Israel ultimately were eliminated during FIFA World Cup qualification, and thus did not compete at the tournament in Qatar.\n\n\nRussia's participation following its invasion of Ukraine\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, FIFA stated that matches would not be held in Russia, though Russia would still be able to continue its participation in World Cup qualifying, where it had reached Path B Also in Path B were Poland, the Czech Republic and Sweden, all of which refused to play against Russia in any form (as did England, which had already qualified for the tournament) [83]\n\n\nQatari football record\nAt the time of being awarded the tournament in 2010, Qatar was ranked 113 in the world, [91] and had never qualified for the World Cup before The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the Arabian Gulf Cup twice, both times hosting Since being awarded the tournament, they have also won the Arabian Gulf Cup for a third time in 2014 and the AFC Asian Cup in 2019 Qatar became the smallest country by land area to host the World Cup (less than half the size of 1954 hosts Switzerland, when the tournament consisted of 16 teams) These facts led some to question the strength of football culture in Qatar and if that made them unsuitable World Cup hosts.\n\n\nAlcohol\nHassan Abdulla al Thawadi, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the event [100] [80] Specific fan-zones would be established where alcohol could be bought [101] [81] [102] Although expatriates may purchase alcohol and certain businesses may sell alcohol with a permit, drinking in public is not permitted as Qatar's legal system is based on Sharia [103]\n\n\nNovember 2022 Infantino communications\nOn 5 November 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to \"respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world\" and to \"focus on the football\" as to \"not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists\" Notably, members of the UEFA Working Group such as Australia, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States were specifically targeted for their involvement in trying to improve the conditions for migrant workers, women, and LGBT people All of the nations criticised the letter, stating \"FIFA acknowledged in their letter that football does not operate in a vacuum, however they seem to be calling for that to be the case History has shown us that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate.\" [111]\n\n\n\"Focus on the football\" letter\nOn 5 November 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to \"respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world\" and to \"focus on the football\" as to \"not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists\" Notably, members of the UEFA Working Group such as Australia, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States were specifically targeted for their involvement in trying to improve the conditions for migrant workers, women, and LGBT people All of the nations criticised the letter, stating \"FIFA acknowledged in their letter that football does not operate in a vacuum, however they seem to be calling for that to be the case History has shown us that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate.\" [111]\n\n\n\"Today I feel\" address\nOn 19 November 2022, Infantino gave an hour-long address to the media during a pre-tournament press conference, during which he defended FIFA's hosting of the tournament in Qatar, and commented upon pre-tournament developments such as the banning of alcohol [112] He opened by declaring that he \"felt\" Qatari, Arabic, African, gay, disabled, and like a migrant worker, because he understood how it felt to be discriminated [112] He argued that criticism of the treatment of migrant workers by Western critics was hypocritical because \"for what we Europeans have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people\" Infantino argued that none of the European companies \"who earn millions and millions from Qatar or other countries in the region\" had taken steps to address the rights of migrant workers like FIFA had, and suggested that Europe needed to be more open to accepting refugees and migrant workers [113] [19] He asked, \"do we want to continue to spit on the others because they look different, or they feel different? We defend human rights We do it our way We obtain results We got women fans in Iran The Women's League was created in Sudan Let's celebrate Don't divide.\" [112] [113] [19] In response to a last-minute prohibition on the sale of alcohol inside the stadiums, Infantino stated that it was a decision made jointly by FIFA and the organising committee, but argued that FIFA was still in \"200% control\" of the event, prohibitions on the sale of alcohol at sporting events were not exclusive to Qatar, and joked that \"if this is the biggest issue we have for the World Cup then I will resign immediately and go to the beach to relax\" [113] [19] He once again argued that people should \"focus on the football\", and direct their criticism to FIFA and \"me if you want\" instead of Qatar [114]\n\n\nOpening ceremony and anthem\nIn the weeks before the tournament began, singers Dua Lipa and Shakira announced that they had refused to perform at the opening ceremony and collaborate on the tournament anthem due to human rights violations implemented by the Emirate's internal policies [117] British singer Rod Stewart said he turned down a substantial offer to perform in the country: \"They offered me a lot of money, more than a million dollars, to perform there  [in Qatar] I turned it down It's not right to go there.\" [118] In addition, the league's ambassador, David Beckham, was criticized by the LGBT community in the United Kingdom for lending his face to the event in exchange for $10 million Discussing Beckham's involvement, former Spice Girls member Melanie C said that it is \"complex\" for sports to change culture when so much money is involved [119]  British singer Robbie Williams defended his choice to participate as a guest at the opening event, stating: \"I don't condone any abuses of human rights anywhere But, that being said, if we're not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known  [...] You get this microscope that goes 'okay, these are the baddies, and we need to rally against them'.. I think that the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world Then if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere\" [120] [121]\n\n\nIranian protests\nIn October 2022, calls were made to ban the Iranian national team from the World Cup for the Iranian government's blocking of Iranian women from their stadiums, their supplying of weapons to Russia during the invasion of Ukraine, and the treatment towards protesters during the Mahsa Amini protests [129] [130] [131]\n\n\nTreatment of fans\nIt was reported that Qatar went back on its word to provide cooked kosher food and public Jewish prayer services at the 2022 World Cup, banning both activities Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar [160]\n\n\nJewish and Israeli fans\nIt was reported that Qatar went back on its word to provide cooked kosher food and public Jewish prayer services at the 2022 World Cup, banning both activities Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar [160]\n\n\nPaid fans\nIn 2020, Qatar began a fan engagement program promising to pay air travel, entrance tickets to matches, housing and even spending money for groups of fans from all competing nations However, fans who are handpicked by the Qatari government are required to sing and chant when asked to, and are required to report any social media posts which are critical of Qatar Many fans reportedly declined the offer [166] On 18 November 2022, it was reported that Qatar had cancelled the daily spending allowances for fans who were paid to attend the World Cup [167]\n\n\nAccommodation\nIn the days leading up to the tournament, videos emerged of the tournament accommodation, which consisted of shipping containers, some with a curtain leading to the exterior instead of four solid walls, and portable air conditioners This accommodation cost over $200 a night A Greek salad which costs $10, consisting of a small amount of lettuce, one slice of cucumber, and no feta, served in a foam container was criticized as expensive and unpalatable These criticisms led to comparisons to the ill-fated Fyre Festival [176] One official fan village, comprising hundreds of shipping containers, still resembled a building site less than two days before the first World Cup match People who had stayed in another village complained about the air conditioning and beds: \"It has been hell The air con in the cabin barely works and sounds like a  [fighter jet] is taking off...  [The beds] are rock hard so you might as well sleep on the floor.\" [177] However, article published by CNN during the World Cup claimed that the supporters who were on a budget and were unable to afford what's on offer from hotels, eight fan villages provide “casual camping and cabin-style” options “There are so many cabins and containers and there's a big screen that we can all watch the games together.” Fei Peng, from China, who was there to watch over 30 World Cup games, told CNN Sport [178]\n\n\nProvisions inside stadium\nThough not connected to any protest against Iran, the official Wales brass band had their instruments confiscated before the Group B Wales vs Iran match The brass band had been allowed to play at the previous Wales match (against the United States) and FIFA officially supported their attendance at the tournament [180]\n\n\nBrass band instrument confiscation\nThough not connected to any protest against Iran, the official Wales brass band had their instruments confiscated before the Group B Wales vs Iran match The brass band had been allowed to play at the previous Wales match (against the United States) and FIFA officially supported their attendance at the tournament [180]\n\n\nTicketing\nMany England supporters missed the start of the Group B England vs Iran match due to problems with FIFA's ticketing app [181] That day also, the FIFA app caused tickets belonging to fans of the United States team to disappear [182] [183]\n\n\nMedia incidents\nPrior to the tournament, there were several reported incidents of altercations between broadcasters and Qatari security officials Rasmus Tantholdt of Denmark's TV 2 was interrupted by a group of security guards during a live broadcast from the Katara Cultural Village, who threatened him and attempted to break their camera Tantholdt responded to the group, saying \"You have invited the whole world here Why can't we film?

complaints about its coverage of the World Cup opener between hosts Qatar and Ecuador, and some users described the BBC's coverage of the World Cup as \"racist\" [216] [217]\nAl Thawadi said since February, he had tried several times to have a meeting between the officials organising the World Cup and the hosts and pundits of the BBC, especially Lineker, but there was never any desire to listen to the Qatari side of the story He claimed that Lineker never wanted to engage In response to Al Thawadi, Lineker tweeted that he and his representative had not received any requests to engage with anyone involved in Qatar 2022 The Daily Telegraph reported on emails showing efforts to arrange a meeting between Al Thawadi and BBC hosts and pundits ahead of the World Cup draw in April A BBC spokesperson denied Al Thawadi's claims and said they had a duty to cover legitimate issues related to the World Cup without fear or favour [218] Lineker would go on to end his commentary of the tournament by stating that the United States, one of the co-hosts of the following World Cup, is “extraordinarily racist” in an attempt to show that he was willing to criticise any host country and had not only singled out Qatar for its issues while also mentioning that “every country has problems” [219]\n\n\nIsraeli media\nIsraeli journalists tried to interview some Arab people but they were

Krajina, which resulted in a mass exodus and war crimes against number of Krajina's Serb civilians [242] [243] Serbs generally consider it an act of ethnic cleansing, [244] [242] however, in a

third despite securing a 4-2 victory over Costa Rica in the group's other game [258] An image was later released showing that the ball had not fully crossed the line, by the narrowest of margins

produced a FIFA World Cup record of 18 yellow cards, including two people who were sitting on the bench and thus not involved in the game [263] [264] After the end of the game, Mateu Lahoz issued a red card to Netherlands player Denzel Dumfries, however no TV commentator picked up on this, leaving viewers who checked the match reports afterwards puzzled [262] [265] During the extra time period (which resulted from Netherlands striker Wout Weghorst scoring an equalising goal with the last kick of normal time, which itself went on for ten minutes extra due to the number of stoppages), BBC

Cup controversies\n\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar was marred by several controversies, including human rights concerns, climate change, and criticism of the host nation's labor laws.\n\nHuman rights concern\n\nThe FIFA World Cup has been criticized for its human rights record in Qatar, where the tournament is being held. The country has been accused of exploiting migrant workers, who make up a significant portion of the country's workforce. In a December 2021 interview with Al Jazeera, FIFA's secretary-general Fatma Samoura said that FIFA had developed a general framework to structure and guide the implementation of its human rights responsibilities and commitment, published in 2017. However, a thorough investigation by the International Labour Organization claimed the figures \"misleading\" and said they had been wrongly linked to World Cup sites without proper context in November 2022.\n\nLGBT issues\n\nQatar is an Islamic country where homosexuality is criminalized, and there are no LGBT rights. When Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation sparked criticism. The security of fans, as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion.\n\nPre-tournament\n\nThe notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial. FIFA president Blatter ruled out a January or February event to avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics. Others expressed concerns over a November or December event, which might clash with the Christmas season. The Premier League voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues.\n\nClimate\n\nThe World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer. The weather in Qatar was a concern, with temperatures reaching more than 50°C (122°F). Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital said the climate would be an issue, stating that it would affect performance levels from a health point of view, recovery times between games would be longer, and more mistakes would be made on the field.\n\nCost\n\nThe World Cup is set to cost Qatar approximately US$220 billion. This is about 60 times the $3.5 billion that South Africa spent on the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Nicola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, estimated that $107 billion would be spent on stadiums and facilities and $31 billion on transport infrastructure.\n\nCorruption\n\nThere have been allegations of bribery or corruption in the Qatar's 2022 World Cup selection process involving members of FIFA's executive committee. An email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar \"bought\" the 2022 World Cup through bribery via Mohammed bin Hammam, who was president of the Asian Football Confederation at the time. Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nPossible Israeli qualification\n\nThe head of the Qatar bid delegation stated that if Israel were to qualify, they would be able to compete in the World Cup despite Qatar not recognizing the state of Israel. Israel ultimately were eliminated during FIFA World Cup qualification, and thus did not compete at the tournament in Qatar.\n\nRussia's participation following its invasion of Ukraine\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, FIFA stated that matches would not be held in Russia, though Russia would still be able to continue its participation in World Cup qualifying. Russia would still be able to continue its participation in World Cup qualifying, where it had reached Path B.\n\nQatari football record\n\nAt the time of being awarded the tournament in 2010, Qatar was ranked 113 in the world, and had never qualified for the World Cup before. The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the Arabian Gulf Cup twice, both times hosting.\n\nAlcohol\n\nHassan Abdulla al Thawadi, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the event. Specific fan-zones would be established where alcohol could be bought.\n\nNovember 2022 Infantino communications\n\nOn November 5, 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to \"respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world\" and to \"focus on the football\". Notably, members of the UEFA Working Group such as Australia, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States were specifically targeted for their involvement in trying to improve the conditions for migrant workers, women, and LGBT people.\n\nFIFA acknowledged in their letter that football does not operate in a vacuum, however they seem to be calling for that to be the case. History has shown us that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate.\n\n\"Today I feel\" address\n\nOn November 19, 2022, Infantino gave an hour-long address to the media during a pre-tournament press conference, during which he defended FIFA's hosting of the tournament in Qatar, and commented upon pre-tournament developments such as the banning of alcohol. Infantino argued that criticism of the treatment of migrant workers by Western critics was hypocritical because \"for what we Europeans have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people\".\n\nOpening ceremony and anthem\n\nIn the weeks before the tournament began, singers Dua Lipa and Shakira announced that they had refused to perform at the opening ceremony and collaborate on the tournament anthem due to human rights violations implemented by the Emirate's internal policies.\n\nGrant Wahl's death\n\nAmerican soccer journalist Grant Wahl collapsed and died while covering the Netherlands vs Argentina match in the early morning of December 10, 2022.\n\nChinese censorship\n\nCCTV, the state broadcaster and the official broadcaster of FIFA World Cup in mainland China, replaced footage of maskless audiences with close-ups of coaches, officials, or players, or birds-eye view of stadiums in its broadcast, as scenes of maskless audiences fueled unrest with China's zero-COVID policy during ongoing protests.\n\nMatch incidents\n\nDuring the Group G Serbia vs Switzerland match on December 2, midfielder Granit Xhaka twice provoked the entire Serbian team.

reimbursed US$320 million this year alone to  victims through the Insurance Fund stated the ILO in November 2022 Furthermore, according to a statement by ITUC (International Trade Union Confederation) General Secretary Sharan Burrow, who had previously been a harsh critic of Qatar's labour laws, workers can now obtain justice in the country She praised \"the amazing change of the labour legislation in Qatar In an article, which was published in September 2020, experts from the OHCHR (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights) added, \"We are very encouraged by the bold steps Qatar is taking to increase the protection of migrant workers' rights and ensure adequate living and working conditions for all.\" [23]\n\n\nLGBT issues\nBecause of Islamic sharia law, there are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalised As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy The security of fans, [24] as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion

numerous allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and FIFA members and executives, some of whom—including Theo Zwanziger and Sepp Blatter—were later recorded regretting awarding Qatar the tournament [33] [34] [35] [36]\n\n\n2011\nIn May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup being held in Qatar According to then vice-president Jack Warner, an email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar 'bought' the 2022 World Cup through bribery via Mohammed bin Hammam who was president of the Asian Football Confederation at the time Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing [37] A whistleblower, revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5m by Qatar [38] She later retracted her claims of bribery, stating she had fabricated them in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid team for relieving her of her job with them She also denied being put under any pressure to make her retraction FIFA confirmed receiving an email from her which stated her retraction [39] [40]\n\n\n2014–15\nIn March 2014, it was alleged that a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign paid committee member Jack Warner and his family almost $2 million The Daily Telegraph reported that it understands that the U.S FBI is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid [41]\n\n\nFIFA ethics investigation report\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar, the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup respectively Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids and spoke to all persons connected to the bids and appealed for witnesses to come forward with evidence [46] At the end of investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report in September 2015 FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge Hans Joachim Eckert who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process [47]\n\n\n2020\nIn January, Bonita Mersiades, a whistle-blower from inside Australia's 2022 World Cup bid published a book which alleges that in the months before the vote in December 2010, FIFA executives were privately worried that a Qatar win would leave a financial shortfall for the governing body in 2022 which Al Jazeera (now beIN Sports) agreed a secret deal to pay $100 million if Qatar won the vote According to the book, the deal took place with the involvement and knowledge of Jérôme Valcke, secretary general of FIFA at the time who was later banned for nine years from football for corruption The Mail on Sunday asked beIN Sports about the allegations, in which a spokesman characterised the bonus as \"production contributions\" which were \"standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders\" [49]\n\n\nScheduling\nThe notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial; Blatter ruled out a January or February event because it may clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics, [55] while others expressed concerns over a November or December event, because it might clash with the Christmas season (even though Qatar is predominantly Muslim, the players in the tournament are predominantly Christian) [56] The Premier League voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues FA Chairman Greg Dyke said, shortly after he took his job in 2013, that he was open to either a winter tournament or moving the tournament to another country [57] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar's desert state was a \"blatant mistake\", and that any potential shift to a winter event would be unmanageable due to the effect on major European domestic leagues [33]\n\n\nClimate\nAs the World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer, the weather in Qatar was a concern with temperatures reaching more than 50 °C (122 °F) Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital in Doha who gave an interview in November 2010 to Qatar Today magazine said the climate would be an issue, stating that the region's climate would \"affect performance levels from a health point of view\" of professional athletes, specifically footballers, that \"recovery times between games would be longer\" than in a temperate climate and that, on the field of play, \"more mistakes would be made\" One of the doctors said that \"total acclimation (to the Qatari climate) is impossible\" [73]\n\n\nCost\nBy some estimates, the World Cup is set to cost Qatar approximately US$220 billion (£184 billion) This is about 60 times the $3.5 billion that South Africa spent on the 2010 FIFA World Cup [74] Nicola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, told an investors' summit held in Munich that £107 billion would be spent on stadiums and facilities plus a further £31 billion on transport infrastructure Ritter said £30 billion would be spent on building air-conditioned stadiums with £48 billion on training facilities and accommodation for players and fans A further £28 billion will be spent on creating a new city called Lusail that will surround the stadium that will host the opening and final matches of the tournament [75]\n\n\nPossible Israeli qualification\nThe head of the Qatar bid delegation stated that if Israel were to qualify, they would be able to compete in the World Cup despite Qatar not recognising the state of Israel [80] [81] [82] Israel ultimately were eliminated during FIFA World Cup qualification, and thus did not compete at the tournament in Qatar.\n\n\nRussia's participation following its invasion of Ukraine\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, FIFA stated that matches would not be held in Russia, though Russia would still be able to continue its participation in World Cup qualifying, where it had reached Path B Also in Path B were Poland, the Czech Republic and Sweden, all of which refused to play against Russia in any form (as did England, which had already qualified for the tournament) [83]\n\n\nQatari football record\nAt the time of being awarded the tournament in 2010, Qatar was ranked 113 in the world, [91] and had never qualified for the World Cup before The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the Arabian Gulf Cup twice, both times hosting Since being awarded the tournament, they have also won the Arabian Gulf Cup for a third time in 2014 and the AFC Asian Cup in 2019 Qatar became the smallest country by land area to host the World Cup (less than half the size of 1954 hosts Switzerland, when the tournament consisted of 16 teams) These facts led some to question the strength of football culture in Qatar and if that made them unsuitable World Cup hosts.\n\n\nAlcohol\nHassan Abdulla al Thawadi, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the event [100] [80] Specific fan-zones would be established where alcohol could be bought [101] [81] [102] Although expatriates may purchase alcohol and certain businesses may sell alcohol with a permit, drinking in public is not permitted as Qatar's legal system is based on Sharia [103]\n\n\nNovember 2022 Infantino communications\nOn 5 November 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to \"respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world\" and to \"focus on the football\" as to \"not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists\" Notably, members of the UEFA Working Group such as Australia, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States were specifically targeted for their involvement in trying to improve the conditions for migrant workers, women, and LGBT people All of the nations criticised the letter, stating \"FIFA acknowledged in their letter that football does not operate in a vacuum, however they seem to be calling for that to be the case History has shown us that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate.\" [111]\n\n\n\"Focus on the football\" letter\nOn 5 November 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to \"respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world\" and to \"focus on the football\" as to \"not

that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate.\" [111]\n\n\n\"Today I feel\" address\nOn 19 November 2022, Infantino gave an hour-long address to the media during a pre-tournament press conference, during which he defended FIFA's hosting of the tournament in Qatar, and commented upon pre-tournament developments such as the banning of alcohol [112] He opened by declaring that he \"felt\" Qatari, Arabic, African, gay, disabled, and like a migrant worker, because he understood how it felt to be discriminated [112] He argued that criticism of the treatment of migrant workers by Western critics was hypocritical because \"for what we Europeans have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people\" Infantino argued that none of the European companies \"who earn millions and millions from Qatar or other countries in the region\" had taken steps to address the rights of migrant workers like FIFA had, and suggested that Europe needed to be more open to accepting refugees and migrant workers [113] [19] He asked, \"do we want to continue to spit on the others because they look different, or they feel different? We defend human rights We do it our way We obtain results We got women fans in Iran The Women's League was created in Sudan Let's celebrate Don't divide.\" [112] [113] [19] In response to a last-minute prohibition on the sale of alcohol inside the stadiums, Infantino stated that it was a decision made jointly by FIFA and the organising committee, but argued that FIFA was still in \"200% control\" of the event, prohibitions on the sale of alcohol at sporting events were not exclusive to Qatar, and joked that \"if this is the biggest issue we have for the World Cup then I will resign immediately and go to the beach to relax\" [113] [19] He once again argued that people should \"focus on the football\", and direct their criticism to FIFA and \"me if you want\" instead of Qatar [114]\n\n\nOpening ceremony and anthem\nIn the weeks before the tournament began, singers Dua Lipa and Shakira announced that they had refused to perform at the opening ceremony and collaborate on the tournament anthem due to human rights violations implemented by the Emirate's internal policies [117] British singer Rod Stewart said he turned down a substantial offer to perform in the country: \"They offered me a lot of money, more than a million dollars, to perform there  [in Qatar] I turned it down It's not right to go there.\" [118] In addition, the league's ambassador, David Beckham, was criticized by the LGBT community in the United Kingdom for lending his face to the event in exchange for $10 million Discussing Beckham's involvement, former Spice Girls member Melanie C said that it is \"complex\" for sports to change culture when so much money is involved [119]  British singer Robbie Williams defended his choice to participate as a guest at the opening event, stating: \"I don't condone any abuses of human rights anywhere But, that being said, if we're not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known  [...] You get this microscope that goes 'okay, these are the baddies, and we need to rally against them'.. I think that the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world Then if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere\" [120] [121]\n\n\nIranian protests\nIn October 2022, calls were made to ban the Iranian national team from the World Cup for the Iranian government's blocking of Iranian women from their stadiums, their supplying of weapons to Russia during the invasion of Ukraine, and the treatment towards protesters during the Mahsa Amini protests [129] [130] [131]\n\n\nTreatment of fans\nIt was reported that Qatar went back on its word to provide cooked kosher food and public Jewish prayer services at the 2022 World Cup, banning both activities Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar [160]\n\n\nJewish and Israeli fans\nIt was reported that Qatar went back on its word to provide cooked kosher food and public Jewish prayer services at the 2022 World Cup, banning both activities Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar [160]\n\n\nPaid fans\nIn 2020, Qatar began a fan engagement program promising to pay air travel, entrance tickets to matches, housing and even spending money for groups of fans from all competing nations However, fans who are handpicked by the Qatari government are required to sing and chant when asked to, and are required to report any social media posts which are critical of Qatar Many fans reportedly declined the offer [166] On 18 November 2022, it was reported that Qatar had cancelled the daily spending allowances for fans who were paid to attend the World Cup [167]\n\n\nAccommodation\nIn the days leading up to the tournament, videos emerged of the tournament accommodation, which consisted of shipping containers, some with a curtain leading to the exterior instead of four solid walls, and portable air conditioners This accommodation cost over $200 a night A Greek salad which costs $10, consisting of a small amount of lettuce, one slice of cucumber, and no feta, served in a foam container was criticized as expensive and unpalatable These criticisms led to comparisons to the ill-fated Fyre Festival [176] One official fan village, comprising hundreds of shipping containers, still resembled a building site less than two days before the first World Cup match People who had stayed in another village complained about the air conditioning and beds: \"It has been hell The air con in the cabin barely works and sounds like a  [fighter jet] is taking off...  [The beds] are rock hard so you might as well sleep on the floor.\" [177] However, article published by CNN during the World Cup claimed that the supporters who were on a budget and were unable to afford what's on offer from hotels, eight fan villages provide “casual camping and cabin-style” options “There are so many cabins and containers and there's a big screen that we can all watch the games together.” Fei Peng, from China, who was there to watch over 30 World Cup games, told CNN Sport [178]\n\n\nProvisions inside stadium\nThough not connected to any protest against Iran, the official Wales brass band had their instruments confiscated before the Group B Wales vs Iran match The brass band had been allowed to play at the previous Wales match (against the United States) and FIFA officially supported their attendance at the tournament [180]\n\n\nBrass band instrument confiscation\nThough not connected to any protest against Iran, the official Wales brass band had their instruments confiscated before the Group B Wales vs Iran match The brass band had been allowed to play at the previous Wales match (against the United States) and FIFA officially supported their attendance at the tournament [180]\n\n\nTicketing\nMany England supporters missed the start of the Group B England vs Iran match due to problems with FIFA's ticketing app [181] That day also, the FIFA app caused tickets belonging to fans of the United States team to disappear [182] [183]\n\n\nMedia incidents\nPrior to the tournament, there were several reported incidents of altercations between broadcasters and Qatari security officials Rasmus Tantholdt of Denmark's TV 2 was interrupted by a group of security guards during a live broadcast from the Katara Cultural Village, who threatened him and attempted to break their camera Tantholdt responded to the group, saying \"You have invited the whole world here Why can't we film?

covering the Netherlands vs Argentina match in the early morning of 10 December 2022 [193]\n\n\nChinese censorship\nCCTV, the state broadcaster and the official broadcaster of FIFA World Cup in mainland China, replaced footage of maskless audiences with close-ups of coaches, officials or players, or birds-eye view of stadiums in its broadcast, as scenes of maskless audiences fueled unrest with China's zero-COVID policy during ongoing protests [201] Following the protests, the Chinese government began to relax pandemic control measures and more images of audience without masks appeared on live telecast [202]\n\n\nAlgerian censorship\nState-run TV2 of Algeria avoided coverage of the Group F Belgium vs Morocco match and Morocco's subsequent win, due to tensions between Algeria and Morocco [203] In addition, Algeria's state TV channel and the Algeria Press Service never mentioned Morocco's defeating Spain in the round of 16, although many Algerians celebrated Morocco's victory [204]\n\n\nWestern media coverage perceived as racist\nMiddle East Eye, a web news portal accused of being funded and operated by Qatar, though the nation denies this, [207] [208] has described several Western media publications as racist, and criticised the nations from which they originate It highlighted the French satirical newspaper Le Canard enchaîné, which published a cartoon of bearded men wearing Qatar football jerseys holding knives, guns, and rocket launchers; [209] and the German television network Welt, on which a presenter described the Tawhid Islamic salute performed by Moroccan players after they defeated Portugal as \"the signature hand gesture of members of ISIS\" [210]\n\n\nBBC controversies\nHassan Al Thawadi, the head of the Qatar World Cup, called some of the BBC's coverage of the tournament \"extremely racist\" and charged Gary Lineker with not engaging with the organisers before criticising them directly The BBC said it had received more than 1,000 complaints about its coverage of the World Cup opener between hosts Qatar and Ecuador, and some users described the BBC's coverage of the World Cup as \"racist\" [216] [217]\nAl Thawadi said since February, he had tried several times to have a meeting between the officials organising the World Cup and the hosts and pundits of the BBC, especially Lineker, but there was never any desire to listen to the Qatari side of the story He claimed that Lineker never wanted to engage In response to Al Thawadi, Lineker tweeted that he and his representative had not received any requests to engage with anyone involved in Qatar 2022 The Daily Telegraph reported on emails showing efforts to arrange a meeting between Al Thawadi and BBC hosts and pundits ahead of the World Cup draw in April A BBC spokesperson denied Al Thawadi's claims and said they had a duty to cover legitimate issues related to the World Cup without fear or favour [218] Lineker would go on to end his commentary of the tournament by stating that the United States, one of the co-hosts of the following World Cup, is “extraordinarily racist” in an attempt to show that he was willing to criticise any host country and had not only singled out Qatar for its issues while also mentioning that “every country has problems” [219]\n\n\nIsraeli media\nIsraeli journalists tried to interview some Arab people but they were ignored and the interviewees just walked away once the former's nationality became known [220]\n\n\nBoycotts\nTromsø IL of Norway released a statement calling for a boycott of the 2022 World Cup, in

chants against Serbians, with both players going into the referee's book [236]\n\n\nCroatian incidents\nXenophobic chants were reported during the course of the Group F Croatia vs Canada match on 27 November During the match, Croatian fans chanted xenophobic anti-Serb slogans against Canadian goalkeeper Milan Borjan, an ethnic Croatian Serb who fled Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence [241] They also displayed a modified John Deere banner making a reference to Operation Storm, a military operation that ended the war and abolished the separatist proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina, which resulted in a mass exodus and war crimes against number of Krajina's Serb civilians [242] [243] Serbs generally consider it an act of ethnic cleansing, [244] [242] however, in a controversial decision, the ICTY appeals court in the 2012 final verdict ruled that \"there had been no joint criminal enterprise, or conspiracy, to force out the Serbs from the Krajina region.\" [245] Borjan's phone number was leaked among Croatian fans who sent him over 2,500 hateful messages during and after the game [246] His wife was also insulted during the game and targeted with hateful

midfielder Ao Tanaka scored a controversial goal (his team's second), the ball ending up in Unai Simón's net shortly after it seemed to have gone out of play After a lengthy delay the goal was eventually awarded by VAR [255] [256] [257] The decision proved critical in both Japan's surprise topping of Group E and the elimination of Germany from the tournament, with Die Mannschaft finishing third despite securing a 4-2 victory over Costa Rica in the group's other game [258] An image was later released showing that the ball had not fully crossed the line, by the narrowest of margins Qatari-owned network beIN Sports showed a virtual bird's eye view of the ball: the section of the ball which was in contact with the pitch was outside the field of play, but its curvature meant the side of the ball was still marginally over the line [259] Spain's coach Luis Enrique claimed that the image had been \"manipulated\" [260] On December 3, FIFA released video and images to provide an official explanation to show that the VAR decision was correct [261]\n\n\nNetherlands vs Argentina quarter-final\nSpanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz officiated the second quarter-final, held on 9

produced a FIFA World Cup record of 18 yellow cards, including two people who were sitting on the bench and thus not involved in the game [263] [264] After the end of the game, Mateu Lahoz issued a red card to Netherlands player Denzel Dumfries, however no TV commentator picked up on this, leaving viewers who checked the match reports afterwards puzzled [262] [265] During the extra time period (which resulted from Netherlands striker Wout Weghorst scoring an equalising goal with the last kick of normal time, which itself went on for ten minutes extra due to the number of stoppages), BBC commentator Martin Keown remarked: \"I think the referee is losing the plot here.\" [266]\n\n\nPost-match incidents\nShortly after the Group G Brazil vs Serbia match on 24 November, a flag showing

Despite these challenges, Ma's determination and hard work eventually paid off, and he went on to graduate from Hangzhou Normal University in 1988.\n\n**Business Career**\n\nAfter graduating from Hangzhou Normal University, Ma applied for 31 different odd entry-level jobs and was rejected for every single one. \"I went for a job with the KFC; they said, 'you're no good,'\" Ma told interviewer Charlie Rose. \"I even went to KFC when it came to my city. Twenty-four people went for the job. Twenty-three were accepted. I was the only guy [rejected].\"\n\nMa's rejection from KFC was not the only setback he faced in his early career. During this period, China was nearing the end of its first decade following Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms, and the job market was highly competitive. However, Ma did not give up on his dreams of becoming a successful entrepreneur.\n\n**Chairman of Alibaba Group**\n\nIn 1999, Ma co-founded Alibaba Group, which has remained one of China's most prominent high-technology holding companies in the two decades since its inception. Ma served as the executive chairman of Alibaba Group, presiding over nine major subsidiaries: Alibaba.com, Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, eTao, Alibaba Cloud Computing, Juhuasuan, 1688.com, AliExpress.com, and Alipay.\n\nUnder Ma's leadership, Alibaba Group has grown to become a global e-commerce powerhouse, with a market value of over $500 billion. In 2010, Ma announced that Alibaba Group would begin earmarking 0.3% of annual revenue to environmental protection, particularly on water- and air-quality improvement projects. \"Our challenge is to help more people to make healthy money, 'sustainable money', money that is not only good for themselves but also good for the society,\" Ma said in an interview.\n\n**During Tech Crackdown**\n\nIn 2020, Ma's businesses were subject to a regulatory crackdown by the Chinese government. News outlets noted a lack of public appearances from Ma between October 2020 and January 2021. The Financial Times reported that the disappearance may have been connected to a speech given by Ma at the annual People's Bank of China financial markets forum, in which he criticized China's regulators and banks.\n\nMa described state banks as operating with a pawn shop mentality and criticized the Basel Accords as a \"club for the elderly.\" Ma's comments were widely reported in the media and sparked controversy in China's financial circles.\n\n**Teaching**\n\nIn May 2023, Tokyo College, a research institute at the University of Tokyo, announced that Ma had been appointed visiting professor and would work at the institute until at least October 2023. Ma's research focus would include sustainable agriculture, food production, and lectures on entrepreneurship. The Financial Times described the announcement as \"a rare public statement of the billionaire's commitments outside China.\"\n\n**Entertainment Career**\n\nIn 2017, Ma made his acting debut with his first kung fu short film, Gong Shou Dao, directed by Wen Zhang and produced by Jet Li. The film stars Ma, Li, Donnie Yen, Wu Jing, Tony Jaa, Jacky Heung, Asashōryū Akinori, Zou Shiming, and Natasha Liu Bordizzo. It was filmed in collaboration with the Double 11 Shopping Carnival Singles' Day.\n\nMa also participated in a singing festival and performed dances during Alibaba's 18th-anniversary party in 2017.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nMa is an adherent of both Buddhism and Taoism.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nMa is the founder of the Jack Ma Foundation, a philanthropic organization focused on improving education, the environment, and public health.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jack_Ma\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nMa was born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, on 10 September 1964, as Ma Yun [17] He became interested in learning the English language as a young boy and began practicing it with English-speaking visitors who frequented the Hangzhou International Hotel At the age of 12, Ma bought a pocket radio and began listening to English radio stations frequently For nine years, Ma rode 27 km (17 miles) on his bicycle every day to work as a tour guide of Hangzhou for foreigners in order to practice his English He became pen pals with one of those foreigners, who nicknamed him \"Jack\" because he found it hard to pronounce his Chinese name [18] When Ma was 13 years old, he was forced to transfer to Hangzhou No 8 Middle School as he kept getting in fights In his primary school days, Ma struggled scholastically, and it took two years for him to gain acceptance at an ordinary Chinese high school, as he only got 31 points in mathematics on the Chinese high school entrance exam.\n\n\nBusiness career\nAccording to Ma's autobiographical speech, [25] after graduating from Hangzhou Normal University in 1988, Ma applied for 31 different odd entry-level jobs and was rejected for every single one \"I went for a job with the KFC;

two-year Test cricket tournament contested by the top nine teams in the ICC Test rankings.

Each series consisted of between two and five Test matches, resulting in all participants playing the same number of series but not the same number of Tests.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe tournament was played over two years, with each team scheduled to play six other opponents, three at home and three away. Each series consisted of between two and five Test matches, resulting in all participants playing the same number of series but not the same number of Tests. The teams were divided into two groups of five and six, with the top two teams in each group competing in the final.\n\n**Point Scoring**\n\nThe ICC decided that the same number of points would be available from each series, regardless of series length, so that countries that played fewer Tests were not disadvantaged. Points would not be awarded for series results, but for match results only. These would be split equally between all the matches in the series, regardless of whether or not a match was a dead rubber, so that every match counted. In a five-match series, 20% of the points would be available each match, while in a two-match series, 50% of the points would be available each match.\n\n**Participants**\n\nThe nine full members of the ICC participated in the tournament:\n\n1.

competitive athlete\nFrederick Carlton Lewis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927–1987) [3] and Evelyn née Lawler Lewis His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team [4] His elder brother Cleveland Lewis played professional soccer for the Memphis Rogues [5] His parents ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both him and his sister, Carol [6] She became an elite long jumper, finishing ninth at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships [7]\n\n\nBreakthrough in 1981 and 1982\nAt the start of 1981, Lewis's best legal long jump was his high school record from 1979 On June 20, Lewis improved his personal best by almost half a meter by leaping 8.62 m (28 ft 3+1⁄4 in) at the TAC Championships while still a teenager [14]\n\n\n1983 and the inaugural World Championships\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized the first World Championships in 1983 Lewis' chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks But though Myricks had joined Lewis in surpassing 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) the year before, he failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease His winning leap of 8.55 m (28 ft 1⁄2 in) defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by 0.26 m (10 in) [22]\n\n\n1984 Summer Olympics: emulating Jesse Owens\nAt the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Lewis was entered into four events with realistic prospects of winning each of them and thereby matching the achievement of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Games in Berlin [33]\n\n\nLack of endorsements and public perception\nAlthough Lewis had achieved what he had set out to do, matching Jesse Owens' feat of winning four gold medals in the same events at a single Olympic Games, he did not receive the lucrative endorsement offers that he had expected The long jump controversy was one reason and his self-congratulatory conduct did not impress several other track stars [37] Further, Lewis's agent Joe Douglas compared him to pop star Michael Jackson, a comparison which did not go over well Douglas said he was inaccurately quoted, but the impression that Lewis was aloof and egotistical was firmly planted in the public's perception by the end of the 1984 Olympic Games [38]\n\n\nBen Johnson and the 1987 World Championships\nAfter the 1984 Olympics, Lewis continued to dominate track and field, especially in the long jump, in which he would remain undefeated for the next seven years, but others started to challenge his dominance in the 100 m sprint His low-altitude record had been surpassed by fellow American Mel Lattany with a time of 9.96 s shortly before the 1984 Olympics, [42] but his biggest challenger would prove to be Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics Johnson would beat Lewis once in 1985, but Lewis also lost to others, while winning most of his races Lewis retained his number one rank that year; Johnson would place second [13] In 1986, Johnson defeated Lewis convincingly at the Goodwill Games in Moscow, clocking a new low-altitude record of 9.95 s At year's end, Johnson was ranked number one, while Lewis slipped to number three, having lost more races than he won He even seemed vulnerable in the long jump, an event he did not lose in 1986, or the year before, though he competed sparingly Lewis ended up ranked second behind Soviet Robert Emmiyan, who had the longest legal jump of the year at 8.61 m (28 ft 2+3⁄4 in) [10]\n\n\n1988 Summer Olympics\nLewis not only lost the most publicized showdown in track and field in 1987, he also lost his father When William Lewis died of cancer at age 60, Lewis placed the gold medal he won for the 100 m in 1984 in his hand to be buried with him \"Don't worry\", he told his mother \"I'll get another one.\" [51] Lewis repeatedly referred to his father as a motivating factor for the 1988 season \"A lot happened to me last year, especially the death of my father That caused me to re-educate myself to being the very best I possibly can be this season\", he said, after defeating Johnson in Zürich on August 17 [52]\n\n\n1991 World Championships: Lewis' greatest performances\nTokyo was the venue for the 1991 World Championships In the 100 m final, Lewis faced the two men who ranked number one in the world the past two years: Burrell and Jamaican Raymond Stewart [13] In what would be the deepest 100 meters race ever to that time, with six men finishing in under ten seconds, Lewis not only defeated his opponents, he reclaimed the world record with a clocking of 9.86 s [60] Though previously a world-record holder in this event, this was the first time he

Championships are perhaps best remembered for the long jump final, considered by some to have been one of the greatest competitions ever in any sport [61] Lewis was up against his main rival of the last few years, Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990 Lewis had at that point not lost a long jump competition in a decade, winning the 65 consecutive meets in which he competed Powell had been unable to defeat Lewis, despite sometimes putting in jumps near world-record territory, only to see them ruled fouls [62] or, as with other competitors such as Larry Myricks, putting in leaps that Lewis himself had only rarely surpassed, only to see Lewis surpass them on his next or final attempt [63] [64]\n\n\nFinal years and retirement\nAfter the heights reached in 1991, Lewis started to lose his dominance in both the sprints and the long jump Though he anchored a world record 1:19.11 in the rarely run 4 × 200 m relay with the Santa Monica Track Club early in 1992, [72] he failed to qualify for the Olympic team in the 100 m or 200 m In the latter race, he finished fourth at the Olympic trials behind rising star Michael Johnson who set a personal best of 19.79 s It was the first time the two had ever met on the track [73] Lewis did, however, qualify for the long jump, finishing second behind Powell, and was eligible for the 4 × 100 m relay team At the Games in Barcelona, Lewis jumped 8.67 m (28 ft 5+1⁄4 in) in the first round of the long jump, beating Powell who did a final-round 8.64 m (28 ft 4 in) In

that revealed that some 100 American athletes had failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete Before showing the documents to Sports Illustrated, Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests His case was summarily dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence The USOC claimed his case \"baseless\" as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules [83] [84]\n\n\nAchievements and honors\nIn 1999, Lewis was voted

a renowned American athlete, Olympic champion, and former world record holder in the 100 meters and long jump events. Born on July 1, 1961, in Birmingham, Alabama, Lewis is widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time.\n\nAthletic Career\n----------------\n\nFrederick Carlton Lewis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927–1987) and Evelyn née Lawler Lewis. His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team, while his elder brother Cleveland Lewis played professional soccer for the Memphis Rogues. His parents ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both him and his sister, Carol, who became an elite long jumper, finishing ninth at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.\n\nFame as a Competitive Athlete\n-----------------------------\n\nLewis's athletic prowess began to emerge in his teenage years, with his best legal long jump of 7.67 meters set in 1979. However, he improved his personal best by almost half a meter, leaping 8.62 meters (28 feet 3 1/4 inches) at the TAC Championships in 1981, while still a teenager.\n\nBreakthrough in 1981 and 1982\n-----------------------------\n\nAt the start of 1981, Lewis's best legal long jump was his high school record from 1979. However, Lewis improved his personal best by almost half a meter by leaping 8.62 meters (28 feet 3 1/4 inches) at the TAC Championships while still a teenager. This marked the beginning of his rise to fame as a competitive athlete.\n\n1983 and the Inaugural World Championships\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) organized the first World Championships in 1983. Lewis's chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be Larry Myricks, but Myricks failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease. His winning leap of 8.55 meters (28 feet 1/2 inch) defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by 0.26 meters (10 inches).\n\n1984 Summer Olympics: Emulating Jesse Owens\n------------------------------------------\n\nAt the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Lewis was entered into four events with realistic prospects of winning each of them, thereby matching the achievement of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Games in Berlin. Lewis won four gold medals in the 100 meters, 200 meters, 4x100 meters relay, and long jump events, cementing his status as one of the greatest athletes of all time.\n\nLack of Endorsements and Public Perception\n------------------------------------------\n\nAlthough Lewis had achieved what he had set out to do, matching Jesse Owens' feat of winning four gold medals in the same events at a single Olympic Games, he did not receive the lucrative endorsement offers that he had expected. The long jump controversy was one reason, and his self-congratulatory conduct did not impress several other track stars. Further, Lewis's agent Joe Douglas compared him to pop star Michael Jackson, a comparison that did not go over well.\n\nBen Johnson and the 1987 World Championships\n------------------------------------------\n\nAfter the 1984 Olympics, Lewis continued to dominate track and field, especially in the long jump, in which he would remain undefeated for the next seven years. However, others started to challenge his dominance in the 100 meters event. Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics, beat Lewis once in 1985, but Lewis also lost to others while winning most of his races. Lewis retained his number one rank that year; Johnson would place second.\n\n1986 was a turning point for Lewis, as he lost to Johnson convincingly at the Goodwill Games in Moscow, clocking a new low-altitude record of 9.95 seconds. At year's end, Johnson was ranked number one, while Lewis slipped to number three, having lost more races than he won. He even seemed vulnerable in the long jump, an event he did not lose in 1986 or the year before, though he competed sparingly.\n\n1988 Summer Olympics\n-------------------\n\nLewis not only lost the most publicized showdown in track and field in 1987 but also lost his father when William Lewis died of cancer at age 60. Lewis placed the gold medal he won for the 100 meters in 1984 in his hand to be buried with him. \"Don't worry,\" he told his mother. \"I'll get another one.\"\n\nLewis repeatedly referred to his father as a motivating factor for the 1988 season. \"A lot happened to me last year, especially the death of my father. That caused me to re-educate myself to being the very best I possibly can be this season,\" he said, after defeating Johnson in Zurich on August 17.\n\n1991 World Championships: Lewis's Greatest Performances\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nTokyo was the venue for the 1991 World Championships. In the 100 meters final, Lewis faced the two men who ranked number one in the world the past two years: Burrell and Jamaican Raymond Stewart. In what would be the deepest 100 meters race ever to that time, with six men finishing in under ten seconds, Lewis not only defeated his opponents but reclaimed the world record with a clocking of 9.86 seconds.\n\nAlthough previously a world-record holder in this event, this was the first time he had crossed the line with \"WR\" beside his name on the giant television screens, and the first time he could savor his achievement at the moment it occurred. He could be seen with tears in his eyes afterwards. \"The best race of my life,\" Lewis said. \"The best technique, the fastest. And I did it at thirty.\"\n\nLewis's world record would stand for nearly three years. Lewis also anchored the 4x100 meters relay team to another world record, 37.50 seconds, the third time that year he had anchored a 4x100 meters squad to a world record.\n\nLong Jump Showdown versus Powell\n---------------------------------\n\nThe 1991 World Championships are perhaps best remembered for the long jump final, considered by some to have been one of the greatest competitions ever in any sport. Lewis was up against his main rival of the last few years, Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990.\n\nLewis had at that point not lost a long jump competition in a decade, winning the 65 consecutive meets in which he competed. Powell had been unable to defeat Lewis, despite sometimes putting in jumps near world-record territory, only to see them ruled fouls or, as with other competitors such as Larry Myricks, putting in leaps that Lewis himself had only rarely surpassed, only to see Lewis surpass them on his next or final attempt.\n\nFinal Years and Retirement\n---------------------------\n\nAfter the heights reached in 1991, Lewis started to lose his dominance in both the sprints and the long jump. Although he anchored a world record 1:19.11 in the rarely run 4x200 meters relay with the Santa Monica Track Club early in 1992, he failed to qualify for the Olympic team in the 100 meters or 200 meters.\n\nIn the latter race, he finished fourth at the Olympic trials behind rising star Michael Johnson, who set a personal best of 19.79 seconds. It was the first time the two had ever met on the track. Lewis did, however, qualify for the long jump, finishing second behind Powell, and was eligible for the 4x100 meters relay team.\n\nAt the Games in Barcelona, Lewis jumped 8.67 meters (28 feet 5 1/4 inches) in the first round of the long jump, beating Powell, who did a final-round 8.64 meters (28 feet 4 inches). In the 4x100 meters relay, Lewis anchored another world record, in 37.40 seconds, a time which stood for 16 years. He covered the final leg in 9.85 seconds, the fastest officially recorded anchor leg.\n\nDrug Testing Exoneration\n---------------------\n\nIn 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to Sports Illustrated that revealed that some 100 American athletes had failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete.\n\nBefore showing the documents to Sports Illustrated, Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests.

It is a day to recognize and honor the contributions and achievements of American workers. The holiday has a rich history that dates back to the late 19th century, and it has evolved over time to become a widely celebrated event in the United States.\n\n**# History**\n\nThe history of Labor Day is closely tied to the labor movement in the United States. In the late 19th century, workers were facing long hours, low wages, and poor working conditions. In response to these conditions, labor unions began to form and advocate for better working conditions and higher wages. As the labor movement grew, so did the demand for a national holiday to recognize the contributions of workers.\n\nIn the United States, a September holiday called Labor Day was first proposed in the early 1880s. The first Labor Day parade was held in New York City on September 5, 1882, and it was organized by the Central Labor Union. The parade was a huge success, and it helped to raise awareness about the importance of labor unions and the need for better working conditions.\n\n**# Origin**\n\nThe idea of Labor Day was initially met with resistance from employers and government officials. Many saw the holiday as a threat to business and industry, and they argued that it would be too expensive to give workers a day off. However, the labor movement continued to grow, and the demand for a national holiday became increasingly vocal.\n\nIn 1887, Oregon became the first state to make Labor Day an official public holiday. Other states soon followed, and by 1894, thirty states were already officially celebrating Labor Day. The federal government finally passed a bill recognizing the first Monday of September as Labor Day and making it an official federal holiday. President Grover Cleveland signed the bill into law on June 28, 1894.\n\n**# Legal Recognition**\n\nThe popularity of Labor Day spread rapidly across the country, and by the 1930s, all states, the District of Columbia, and the United States territories had made Labor Day a statutory holiday. The federal law, however, only made it a holiday for federal workers. As late as the 1930s, unions were encouraging workers to strike to make sure they got the day off.\n\nThe legal recognition of Labor Day marked a significant milestone in the labor movement. It recognized the importance of workers and the contributions they made to the economy and society. The holiday also provided a much-needed break for workers, who were often working long hours and facing poor working conditions.\n\n**# Labor Day versus May Day**\n\nThe date of May 1 emerged in 1886 as an alternative holiday for the celebration of labor. This date had its origins in the 1885 convention of the American Federation of Labor, which passed a resolution calling for the adoption of the eight-hour day effective May 1, 1886. While negotiation was envisioned for the achievement of the shortened workday, the use of the strike to enforce this demand was recognized, and May 1 was advocated as a date for coordinated strike action.\n\nThe proximity of the date to the bloody Haymarket affair of May 4, 1886, further accentuated May First's radical reputation. May 1 became known as International Workers' Day, and it was celebrated by workers around the world. In contrast, Labor Day was seen as a more moderate and mainstream celebration of labor.\n\n**# Unofficial End of Summer**\n\nLabor Day is often referred to as the \"unofficial end of summer.\" It marks the end of the U.S culture's nominal summer season, and it signals the beginning of autumn. Many people take their vacations during the two weeks ending Labor Day weekend, and the holiday provides a much-needed break from the heat and long hours of the summer.\n\nFall activities, such as school and sports, particularly football, begin about this time. The holiday also provides a time for families and friends to come together and enjoy the outdoors. Many people attend outdoor events, such as concerts and parades, and it is a popular time for barbecues and picnics.\n\n**# Labor Day Sales**\n\nTo take advantage of large numbers of potential customers with time to shop, Labor Day has become an important weekend for discounts and allowances by many retailers in the United States, especially for back-to-school sales. Some retailers claim it is one of the largest sale dates of the year, second only to the Christmas season's Black Friday.\n\nThe holiday provides a much-needed boost to the economy, and it is a critical time for retailers to clear out inventory and make room for new products. Many people take advantage of the sales and discounts, and it is a popular time for shopping and browsing.\n\n**# See Also**\n\n* Federal holidays\n* State/territorial holidays\n* Religious holidays\n* Holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority\n* Week-long holidays\n* Month-long holidays\n* Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n**# External Links**\n\n* Federal holidays\n* State/territorial holidays\n* Religious holidays\n* Holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority\n* Week-long holidays\n* Month-long holidays\n* Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Labor_Day\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nBeginning in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, diverse groups of trade unionists chose a variety of days on which to celebrate labor In the United States, a September holiday called Labor Day was first proposed in the early 1880s.\n\n\nOrigin\nBeginning in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, diverse groups of trade unionists chose a variety of days on which to celebrate labor In the United States, a September holiday called Labor Day was first proposed in the early 1880s.\n\n\nLegal recognition\nThe popularity of the event spread across the country In 1887, Oregon became the first state of the United States to make Labor Day an official public holiday By 1894, thirty U.S states were already officially celebrating Labor Day In that year, shortly after the Pullman Strike, the Congress passed a bill recognizing the first Monday of September as Labor Day and making it an official federal holiday President Grover Cleveland signed the bill into law on June 28 [14] [4] The federal law, however, only made it a holiday for federal workers As late as the 1930s, unions were encouraging workers to strike to make sure they got the day off [15] All U.S states, the District of Columbia, and the United States territories have subsequently made Labor Day a statutory holiday [16]\n\n\nLabor Day versus May Day\nThe date of May 1 (an ancient European folk holiday known as May Day) emerged in 1886 as an alternative holiday for the celebration of labor, later becoming known as International Workers' Day The date had its origins at the 1885 convention of the American Federation of Labor, which passed a resolution calling for adoption of the eight-hour day effective May 1, 1886 [17] While negotiation was envisioned for achievement of the shortened work day, use of the strike to enforce this demand was recognized, with May 1 advocated as a date for coordinated strike action [17] The proximity of the date to the bloody Haymarket affair of May 4, 1886, further accentuated May First's radical reputation [13]\n\n\nUnofficial end of summer\nLabor Day is called the \"unofficial end of summer\" [22] because it marks the end of the U.S culture's nominal summer season Of the 7% of Americans who take two-week vacations, many take their vacations during the two weeks ending Labor Day weekend [23] [24] Many fall activities, such as school and sports (particularly football), begin about this time.\n\n\nLabor Day sales\nTo take advantage of large numbers of potential customers with time to shop, Labor Day has become an important weekend for discounts and allowances by many retailers in the United States, especially for back-to-school sales Some retailers claim it is one of the largest sale dates of the year, second only to the Christmas season's Black Friday [40]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nCitations\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nExternal links\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film tells the story of an indigenous couple, Bomman and Bellie, who are entrusted with the care of an orphaned baby Indian elephant named Raghu.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Elephant Whisperers is a heartwarming and educational documentary that explores the unique bond between humans and elephants in the wild. The film follows the story of Bomman and Bellie, a couple from the Kattunayakan tribe who live in the Mudumalai National Park in the border of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states of India. The couple is tasked with caring for Raghu, a fragile and injured infant elephant who is struggling to survive. As the couple works tirelessly to nurse Raghu back to health, a strong bond develops between them and the elephant.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the Mudumalai National Park, a 321-square-kilometer forest reserve that is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including elephants, tigers, and leopards. Bomman and Bellie, who are both in their 50s, live in a small village on the outskirts of the park. They are members of the Kattunayakan tribe, a indigenous community that has lived in the region for generations. The couple has been involved in elephant conservation for many years and has a deep understanding of the behavior and needs of these magnificent creatures.\n\nRaghu, the orphaned elephant, is found by the couple when he is just three months old. He is injured and malnourished, and the couple must work quickly to nurse him back to health. They provide Raghu with a steady diet of milk and food, and they spend hours each day playing with him and teaching him how to interact with other elephants.\n\nAs Raghu grows and develops, he becomes increasingly dependent on the couple. They adopt another elephant, Ammukutty, who becomes Raghu's companion and confidant. However, as Raghu grows stronger and more independent, the couple is forced to consider releasing him back into the wild.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe documentary follows the story of Bomman and Bellie over a period of several years. The film was shot on location in the Mudumalai National Park, and it features stunning footage of the couple and the elephants in their natural habitat. The director, Kartiki Gonsalves, spent many hours with the couple, learning about their lives and their relationship with the elephants.\n\nGonsalves has said that she was inspired to make the film after meeting Raghu when he was just three months old. She spent many hours with the couple, and she became deeply invested in their story. \"I met Raghu when he was exactly three months old,\" she said. \"I spent about a year and a half with him when he was a tiny baby before this became a documentary.\"\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Elephant Whisperers has received widespread critical acclaim. The film has an approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.7/10 based on five reviews. Critics have praised the film for its beautiful cinematography, its engaging storyline, and its informative and educational content.\n\n**Controversy**\n\nHowever, the film has also been the subject of controversy. In an interview with The Hindu, Bomman and Bellie alleged that they were exploited while making the film. They claimed that the filmmakers did not remunerate them or deliver on the promises made, and that the director became distant after the film won fame.\n\nBomman subsequently backtracked on his complaint in a video reported by India Today. He stated that he did not know who sent the legal notice, nor did he know the advocate or have any evidence.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe Elephant Whisperers has won several awards and accolades, including the award for Best Documentary at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival. The film has also been selected as the Indian entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 95th Academy Awards.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Elephant conservation\n* Wildlife conservation\n* Documentary film\n* Indian cinema\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film's title, \"The Elephant Whisperers,\" refers to the unique bond between humans and elephants in the wild.\n* The Mudumalai National Park is a 321-square-kilometer forest reserve that is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including elephants, tigers, and leopards.\n* Bomman and Bellie are members of the Kattunayakan tribe, a indigenous community that has lived in the region for generations.\n* The film was shot on location in the Mudumalai National Park, and it features stunning footage of the couple and the elephants in their natural habitat.\n\n**References**\n\n* Gonsalves, K.

best of 5.80 m (19 ft 1⁄2 in), while his Swedish mother, Helena (née Hedlund), is a former heptathlete and volleyball player [9] Duplantis grew up primarily speaking English, but also learned Swedish as a second language [10] He spent summers with his Swedish grandparents [11]\n\n\nEarly career\nDuplantis first tried pole vaulting as a four-year-old at the family's home in Lafayette, Louisiana, and took to the event rapidly [16] He set his first age group world best at age seven, and his jump of 3.86 m (12 ft 8 in) as a 10-year-old surpassed the previous world bests for ages 11 and 12 as well [16] [17] As of July 2015 [update], he holds the world best in all age groups from age seven to age 12; he held the age 13 record until it was broken in May 2015 [16] [18]\n\n\n2015–2016: U18 world champion and competing for Sweden\nDuring his freshman year at Lafayette High School in 2015, Duplantis set national freshman records both indoors and outdoors and was named Gatorade Louisiana Boys Track & Field Athlete of the Year [20]\n\n\n2017: U20 world record and U20 European title\nOn 11 February 2017, at the Millrose Games, Duplantis cleared 5.75 m (18 ft 10+1⁄2 in) to set the world indoor junior record [31] That mark was ratified by IAAF [32] [33]\n\n\n2018: U20 World champion, first major senior title and first jump over 6.00 m\nOn 12 January, Duplantis began his 2018 season with an indoor personal record by clearing 5.83 m (19 ft 1+1⁄2 in)  at the Pole Vault Summit in Reno, Nevada [42] The 5.83m jump could have been ratified as a world indoor junior record if not for violation of some  overlooked IAAF rules In 2003, the IAAF changed the standard length of the pegs that the pole-vaulting crossbar rests on from 75 mm to 55 mm Performances in the elite men's competition at the summit were invalidated two days later when it was discovered that 75 mm crossbar pegs were used on the pit for the men's elite competition instead of 55 mm mandated by IAAF The elite women on a separate pit pole vaulted with the correct 55mm pegs In addition, IAAF was unable to ratify the 5.83 m record because on-site doping control was absent in a similar reason IAAF did not ratify his best indoor mark of 5.82 m last year at the New Balance Narionals indoor event IAAF rule requires an immediate test on site Although Duplantis submitted to a drug test administered by a USADA official, it was only done the next morning and not at the Reno-Sparks Livestock Events Center where the meet was held [43] [36] [33]\n\n\n2019: Collegiate season at LSU, turning pro\nDuplantis

Lavillenie's younger brother Valentin, who went on to claim bronze and silver respectively — the latter with a personal best Duplantis however set a new championship record of 6.05 m (19 ft 10 in) before making three unsuccessful attempts at 6.19 m (20 ft 3+1⁄2 in), his second narrowly missing the world record [71]\n\n\n2022: New world records, first world titles and second European title\nOn

achievements in 2021 Duplantis won the    European indoor and Olympic gold medals and cleared 6.00m or higher in 12 of his 17 competitions in 2021 [74]\n\n\n2023: Second world title and two more world

a Swedish pole vaulter who has achieved numerous records and accolades throughout his career. Born into an athletic family in Lafayette, Louisiana, Duplantis has made a name for himself in the world of track and field.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDuplantis was born into an athletic family in Lafayette, Louisiana. His American father, Greg Duplantis, is a former pole vaulter with a personal best of 5.80 m (19 ft 1⁄2 in), while his Swedish mother, Helena (née Hedlund), is a former heptathlete and volleyball player. Duplantis grew up primarily speaking English, but also learned Swedish as a second language. He spent summers with his Swedish grandparents.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nDuplantis first tried pole vaulting as a four-year-old at the family's home in Lafayette, Louisiana, and took to the event rapidly. He set his first age group world best at age seven, and his jump of 3.86 m (12 ft 8 in) as a 10-year-old surpassed the previous world bests for ages 11 and 12 as well. As of July 2015, he holds the world best in all age groups from age seven to age 12; he held the age 13 record until it was broken in May 2015.\n\n**2015–2016: U18 World Champion and Competing for Sweden**\n\nDuring his freshman year at Lafayette High School in 2015, Duplantis set national freshman records both indoors and outdoors and was named Gatorade Louisiana Boys Track & Field Athlete of the Year.\n\n**2017: U20 World Record and U20 European Title**\n\nOn 11 February 2017, at the Millrose Games, Duplantis cleared 5.75 m (18 ft 10+1⁄2 in) to set the world indoor junior record. That mark was ratified by IAAF.\n\n**2018: U20 World Champion, First Major Senior Title, and First Jump Over 6.00 m**\n\nOn 12 January, Duplantis began his 2018 season with an indoor personal record by clearing 5.83 m (19 ft 1+1⁄2 in) at the Pole Vault Summit in Reno, Nevada. The 5.83 m jump could have been ratified as a world indoor junior record if not for violation of some overlooked IAAF rules.\n\n**2019: Collegiate Season at LSU, Turning Pro**\n\nDuplantis enrolled at Louisiana State University in 2018. During his freshman year at LSU in 2019, Duplantis competed 10 times in the pole vault event. He set both the indoor and outdoor collegiate records, won indoor and outdoor SEC Championships titles, and won the NCAA Division I indoor title. The only defeat of his collegiate career came at the NCAA Division I outdoor championships when he took second place.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nOn 24 August 2019, Duplantis cleared 6.00 m to equal his season's best to take gold in the Finnkampen (an annual international athletics competition between Sweden and Finland) held in Stockholm, Sweden as hosts Sweden beat Finland in both the men's and women's competition. Duplantis' 6.00 m vault broke the competition record of 5.85 m held by Patrik Kristiansson of Finland since 2002. His teammate Melker Svärd Jacobsson came in second with a clearance of 5.36 m.\n\n**2021: Olympic Title in Tokyo and European Indoor Title**\n\nOn 6 March, Duplantis competed at the 2021 European Indoor Championships. He was the overwhelming favorite to win the title after the late withdrawal of Renaud Lavillenie with injury. Duplantis was still tested by Piotr Lisek and Lavillenie's younger brother Valentin, who went on to claim bronze and silver respectively. Duplantis, however, set a new championship record of 6.05 m (19 ft 10 in) before making three unsuccessful attempts at 6.19 m (20 ft 3+1⁄2 in), his second narrowly missing the world record.\n\n**2022: New World Records, First World Titles, and Second European Title**\n\nOn 17 January, still only 22 and having won the award previously in 2019 and 2021, Duplantis was crowned Sportsman of the Year for the third time at the Swedish Sports Awards ceremony for his achievements in 2021. Duplantis won the European indoor and Olympic gold medals and cleared 6.00 m or higher in 12 of his 17 competitions in 2021.\n\n**2023: Second World Title and Two More World Records (Sixth and Seventh)**\n\nDuplantis got his 2023 campaign off to a strong start at the Mondo Classic in Uppsala, the meet named after his nickname. His winning height of 6.10 m (20 ft 0 in) represented not only his best ever season opener but also the highest season-opening performance of any pole vaulter in history. He also broke Bubka's record of 11 vaults of 6.10 m or higher (including indoors and outdoors).\n\n**2024: Second World Indoor Title, Third European Title, Second Olympic Title in Paris, and Three More World Records**\n\nAt the 2024 World Athletics Indoor Championships in Glasgow, in March, Duplantis made a vault of 6.05 m, winning the gold medal.\n\n**\"Karsten vs. Mondo\"**\n\nOn 4 September, the day before the Zürich Diamond League, Duplantis competed in an exhibition 100 m event against 400 m hurdles world record holder Karsten Warholm.

on the pit for the men's elite competition instead of 55 mm mandated by IAAF The elite women on a separate pit pole vaulted with the correct 55mm pegs In addition, IAAF was unable to ratify the 5.83 m record because on-site doping control was absent in a similar reason IAAF did not ratify his best indoor mark of 5.82 m last year at the New Balance Narionals indoor event IAAF rule requires an

Born on October 3, 1949, in Palo Alto, California, he rose to fame as the lead guitarist and vocalist of the rock band Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham's music career spans over five decades, with a successful solo career and numerous accolades, including multiple Grammy nominations.\n\nEarly Life\n----------\n\nBuckingham was born in Palo Alto, California, to Rutheda (née Elliott) and Morris Buckingham. He had two older brothers, Jeffrey and Gregory. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area community of Atherton, Buckingham attended Menlo-Atherton High School, where he was encouraged to swim competitively. Although he dropped out of athletics to pursue music, his brother Gregory went on to win a silver medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.\n\nBuckingham attended San José State University, like his brother Greg and father Morris. However, he did not graduate, focusing instead on his music career.\n\nMusic Career\n------------\n\n### 1966-1971: Early Beginnings\n\nFrom 1966 to 1971, Buckingham performed psychedelic and folk rock with the high school rock band Fritz Rabyne Memorial Band as a bassist and vocalist. The band regrouped in 1967 due to band member changes and shortened their name to Fritz. Buckingham invited friend Stevie Nicks to join Fritz as a backing vocalist. Their romantic relationship began after both left Fritz five years later.\n\n1973-1974: Buckingham Nicks\n---------------------------\n\nBuckingham and his then-girlfriend Stevie Nicks recorded seven demos in 1972 on a half-inch 4-track Ampex recorder kept at his father's coffee-roasting plant in Daly City. They drove to Los Angeles to pursue a recording contract. In 1973, Polydor Records signed the pair. Their studio album, produced by Keith Olsen and second engineer Richard Dashut, Buckingham Nicks, was released in September 1973. However, soon after its release Polydor dropped the duo because of poor sales.\n\nTo help make ends meet, Buckingham toured with Don Everly's backing band, singing Phil Everly's parts.\n\n1975-1980: Fleetwood Mac and Mainstream Success\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWhile investigating Sound City recording studio in California, Mick Fleetwood heard the song \"Frozen Love\" from the Buckingham Nicks studio album. Impressed, he asked who the guitarist was. By chance, Buckingham and Nicks were also in Sound City recording demos. Buckingham and Fleetwood were introduced. When Bob Welch left Fleetwood Mac in December 1974, Fleetwood immediately contacted Buckingham and offered him the vacant guitar slot in his band. Buckingham told Fleetwood that he and Nicks were a team and that he didn't want to work without her. Fleetwood agreed to hire both of them, without an audition.\n\nBuckingham and Nicks then began a short tour to promote the Buckingham Nicks album. The touring band included drummers Bob Aguirre and Gary Hodges (playing simultaneously) and bassist Tom Moncrieff, who later played bass on Nicks' debut solo studio album Bella Donna (1981).\n\n1981: Going Solo and Law and Order\n-----------------------------------\n\nDuring the time he worked on Tusk, Buckingham also produced studio albums for Walter Egan and John Stewart in the late 1970s. He began work on his own solo studio album.\n\n1982: Mirage\n------------\n\nAfter a large world tour that ended in 1980, Fleetwood Mac took a year-long break before reconvening to record their next studio album Mirage (1982). A more pop-friendly work, Mirage returned the band to the top of the US album chart. However, by this time, various members of the band were enjoying success as solo artists (particularly Nicks), and the next Fleetwood Mac album was not released until five years later.\n\n1983-1986: Go Insane and Other Solo Projects\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIn 1983, Buckingham wrote and performed the songs \"Holiday Road\" and \"Dancin' Across the USA\" for the film National Lampoon's Vacation. \"Holiday Road\" was released as a single and reached No 82 on Billboard's Hot 100.\n\n1987: Tango In the Night and Departure from Fleetwood Mac\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nBuckingham's fifth studio album with Fleetwood Mac, Tango in the Night, was released in 1987. He had already released two solo studio albums and had given up much of the material for what would have been his third solo studio album for the project. Buckingham had already released two solo studio albums and had given up much of the material for what would have been his third solo studio album for the project. \"Big Love,\" released as the first single from the album, became a top ten hit in the US and the UK.\n\nBuckingham departed from Fleetwood Mac in 1987.\n\n1988-1992: Out of the Cradle\n-----------------------------\n\nFollowing his departure from Fleetwood Mac in 1987, Buckingham spent much of the next five years in the studio, working on his third solo studio album, Out of the Cradle, which was released in 1992. Many of the songs deal with his relationship with Nicks and his decision to leave the band.\n\n\"There were things lingering for years having to do with relationships and the band, hurtful things, that were impossible to deal with until I left,\" Buckingham said. \"If you were in a relationship and split up, then had to see that person every day for the next 15 years, it might keep you from dealing with some of those things.\"\n\n1993-2004: Return to Fleetwood Mac\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn 1993, newly elected president Bill Clinton asked Fleetwood Mac to come together to perform the song \"Don't Stop,\" which was written by Christine McVie, at his inauguration on January 20, 1993. Buckingham agreed to be part of the performance, but the experience was something of a one-off for the band, who were still very much at odds with one another and had no plans to reunite officially.\n\n2006-2008: Continuing Solo\n---------------------------\n\nOn his 57th birthday, October 3, 2006, Buckingham's fourth solo studio album, an acoustic album now titled Under the Skin, was released. Under the Skin features Buckingham on almost all instruments, with the exception of two tracks that feature Fleetwood Mac's rhythm section of John McVie and Mick Fleetwood. The album includes a cover of the Rolling Stones classic \"I Am Waiting.\" Three days after the album's release, Buckingham embarked on a tour in support of the album that lasted until the end of June 2007.\n\n2009: Unleashed Tour\n-------------------\n\nFleetwood Mac toured in 2009, with the first date of the \"UNLEASHED\" Tour as March 1, 2009, in Mellon Arena (Pittsburgh).

Buckingham had finished recording the studio album, titled Seeds We Sow, in April, and on April 22, 2011, he filmed a concert for DVD release to support the album. Seeds We Sow was released on September 6, 2011. On September 10, Buckingham kicked off the Seeds We Sow Tour in Reno, Nevada; the tour ended in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on November 14.

There really are dozens of songs And they're really good So we'll see.\n\n2018-Present: Firing from Fleetwood Mac, Solo Anthology, and Lindsey Buckingham\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing Fleetwood Mac's performance at the MusiCares Person of the Year in January 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band. The reason was said to have been a disagreement about the nature of the tour, particularly the question of whether newer or less well-known material would be included, as Buckingham wanted.\n\nPersonal Life\n------------\n\nBuckingham was in the same high school as Stevie Nicks but a year behind her. He started a relationship with Nicks after the breakup of their band Fritz. He then suffered from a bout of mononucleosis, which delayed their move to Los Angeles in 1971. They recorded a studio album together before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1975, while their relationship had broken down by 1977. The breakup was chronicled in a number of songs written by the two, such as \"Silver Springs\" and \"Dreams\" by Nicks and \"Go Your Own Way\" and \"Second Hand News\" by Buckingham.\n\nMusical Style\n-------------\n\nUnlike most rock guitarists, Buckingham does not play with a pick; instead, he almost exclusively plays fingerstyle and tends to strum with his middle and ring fingers. Initially after joining Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham used a Gibson Les Paul Custom. Before the band, a Fender Telecaster was his main guitar, and was used on his first Fleetwood Mac studio album alongside Fender Stratocasters fitted with an Alembic Blaster. In 1978, he worked with Rick Turner, future owner and founder of The Renaissance Guitar Company, to create the Model One guitar. He has used it extensively since, both with Fleetwood Mac and for his solo efforts.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\n### Studio Albums\n\n* Buckingham Nicks (1973)\n* Law and Order (1981)\n* Go Insane (1984)\n* Out of the Cradle (1992)\n* Under the Skin (2006)\n* Seeds We Sow (2011)\n\n### Live Albums\n\n* Live at the Bass Performance Hall (2007)\n\n### Compilation Albums\n\n* Solo Anthology: The Best of Lindsey Buckingham (2008)\n\n### Singles\n\n* \"Somebody's Baby\" (1982)\n* \"Holiday Road\" (1983)\n* \"Dancin' Across the USA\" (1983)\n* \"Big Love\" (1987)\n* \"I Keep It Dark\" (1987)\n\n### Soundtrack Appearances\n\n* National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) - \"Holiday Road\"\n* Tango in the Night (1987) - \"Big Love\"\n\n### Other Appearances\n\n* Various artists - \"Don't Stop\" (1993)\n\n### Music Videos\n\n* \"Holiday Road\" (1983)\n* \"Big Love\" (1987)\n* \"I Keep It Dark\" (1987)\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lindsey_Buckingham\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nLindsey Adams Buckingham was born on October 3, 1949, in Palo Alto, California, to Rutheda (née Elliott) and Morris Buckingham [3] [4] [5] [6] He had two older brothers, Jeffrey and Gregory Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area community of Atherton, he attended Menlo-Atherton High School where Buckingham and his brothers were encouraged to swim competitively Though Buckingham dropped out of athletics to pursue music, his brother Gregory went on to win a silver medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City Though he did not graduate, Lindsey attended San José State University, [7] [8] like his brother Greg and father Morris [9]\n\n\nMusic career\nFrom 1966 to 1971, Buckingham performed psychedelic and folk rock with the high school rock band originally named the Fritz Rabyne Memorial Band as a bassist and vocalist [12] [13] [10] The band regrouped in 1967 due to band member changes and shortened their name to Fritz [14] Buckingham invited friend Stevie Nicks to join Fritz as a backing vocalist Their romantic relationship began after both left Fritz five years later [15]\n\n\n1973–1974: Buckingham Nicks\nBuckingham and his then-girlfriend Stevie Nicks recorded seven demos in 1972 on a half-inch 4-track Ampex recorder kept at his father's coffee-roasting plant in Daly City, then drove to Los Angeles to pursue a recording contract [5] [16] In 1973, Polydor Records signed the pair Their studio album, produced by Keith Olsen and second engineer Richard Dashut, Buckingham Nicks, was released in September 1973;
