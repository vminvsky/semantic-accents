They were a powerful and culturally advanced people, known for their warrior society, complex government, and significant contributions to the development of Roman society.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Samnite\" is believed to be derived from the Greek word Σαμνητικῶς (Samnetikos), which referred to the region of Samnium. The Samnites themselves referred to their country as Veneria, and their people as Sannii.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins and early history\n\nThe Samnites were one of the earliest known Italic tribes, and their origins are shrouded in mystery. Archaeological evidence suggests that they inhabited the region of Samnium, which corresponds to modern-day Molise and parts of Campania and Lazio, from at least the 8th century BC. The Samnites were a warlike people, known for their skill in horsemanship, archery, and infantry combat.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnites played a significant role in the Italian Wars of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, particularly during the Samnite Wars (343-290 BC). These wars were fought between the Samnites and their allies, the Etruscans and the Latins, against the Romans. The Samnites were ultimately defeated, but their resistance and guerrilla warfare tactics delayed the Roman conquest of Italy.\n\n### Later history\n\nAfter their defeat in the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to maintain their independence, but their power and influence declined. In the 2nd century BC, the Samnites became Roman allies, and many of their cities were incorporated into the Roman Republic. The Samnites continued to play a significant role in Roman society, contributing to the development of Roman law, architecture, and culture.\n\n**Society**\n\n### Economy\n\nThe Samnites were a wealthy and prosperous people, known for their extensive trade networks and economic prosperity. They were skilled in agriculture, animal husbandry, and metalworking, and their cities were centers of commerce and industry.\n\n### Government\n\nThe Samnite system of government was complex and decentralized, with power divided among various councils and assemblies. The Samnites were a federal republic, with a strong emphasis on democracy and civic participation.\n\n### Military\n\n#### Armor\n\nThe Samnites were known for their distinctive armor, which consisted of a helmet, breastplate, and greaves. Their armor was often decorated with intricate designs and symbols, and was highly prized for its quality and craftsmanship.\n\n#### Weaponry\n\nThe Samnites were skilled warriors, known for their use of the bow, spear, and sword. Their cavalry was highly effective, and their infantry was renowned for its discipline and tactical skill.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Religion\n\nThe Samnites were a polytheistic people, worshiping a pantheon of gods and goddesses, including Jupiter, Mars, and Diana. Their religion was closely tied to their agriculture and the cycles of nature.\n\n### Gender roles\n\nIn Samnite society, women played a significant role in agriculture, trade, and commerce. They were also involved in the worship of the gods and the upkeep of the family and household.\n\n### Art\n\nSamnite art was highly developed, and their cities were centers of artistic production. Their pottery, sculpture, and architecture were highly prized for their quality and craftsmanship.\n\n### Clothing\n\nSamnite clothing was simple and practical, reflecting their warrior culture. Their men wore tunics and cloaks, while their women wore long dresses and headscarves.\n\n### Recreation\n\nThe Samnites were a fun-loving people, enjoying games, festivals, and theatrical performances. Their cities were centers of entertainment and culture.\n\n### Cities and engineering\n\nThe Samnites were skilled engineers, and their cities were notable for their advanced architecture and infrastructure. Their cities were built on hills and mountains, and their buildings were often decorated with intricate stone carvings and mosaics.\n\n**Notable Samnites**\n\n### Leaders of the Samnites\n\n* Genucius, a Samnite leader who fought against the Romans in the 4th century BC\n* Gavius, a Samnite leader who defeated the Romans at the Battle of Campania in 342 BC\n\n### Social War leaders\n\n* Tiberius Gracchus, a Roman statesman who led the Social War against the Italians, including the Samnites, in the 2nd century BC\n\n### Romans of Samnite origin\n\n* Tullus Hostilius, a Roman king who was of Samnite origin\n* Lucius Aemulus, a Roman general who was of Samnite origin\n\n### Catholic Popes\n\n* Pope Sylvester I, a Catholic Pope who was of Samnite origin\n* Pope Gregory I, a Catholic Pope who was of Samnite origin\n\n**See also**\n\n* Italian Wars\n* Roman Republic\n* Etruscan civilization\n* Latin civilization\n* Italic peoples\n* Latin language\n* Roman law\n* Roman architecture\n* Roman engineering\n\n**References**\n\n(No references are provided for this article)\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Livy, Ab Urbe Condita\n* Plutarch, Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans\n* Polybius, Histories\n* Strabo, Geography\n* Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities\n\n**External links**\n\n* Samnites at Ancient History Encyclopedia\n* Samnites at Roman Forum\n* Samnites at Encyclopedia Britannica", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Samnites\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#History\n##Origins and early history\n##Samnite Wars\n##Later history\n#Society\n##Economy\n##Government\n##Military\n###Armor\n###Weaponry\n#Culture\n##Religion\n##Gender roles\n##Art\n##Clothing\n##Recreation\n##Cities and engineering\n#Notable Samnites\n##Leaders of the Samnites\n##Social War leaders\n##Romans of Samnite origin\n##Catholic Popes\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The search was conducted on August 8, 2022, as part of a criminal investigation into the handling of presidential records and classified materials.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was the culmination of a series of events that began with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) attempting to retrieve presidential records from the estate. The investigation was sparked by concerns that classified materials had been mishandled and potentially compromised. The search and subsequent media coverage have sparked widespread controversy, with many questioning the motives and methods of the FBI and the White House.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Handling, Storage, and Disposition of U.S. Government Records\n\nThe handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records are governed by a complex set of laws and regulations. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires that all presidential records be preserved and transferred to the National Archives at the end of each administration. The Act also establishes the Presidential Records Committee, which is responsible for ensuring that all presidential records are properly stored and protected.\n\n### Criminal Laws Listed on Search Warrant\n\nThe search warrant issued by the federal court listed several criminal laws that were allegedly violated by Trump and his associates. These laws include:\n\n*   18 U.S.C. § 793: Gathering, transmitting, or losing defense information\n*   18 U.S.C. § 793(e): Unauthorized disclosure of national defense information\n*   18 U.S.C. § 2071: Concealment, removal, or mutilation of records\n*   18 U.S.C. § 1519: Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records\n\n### Classified Material and the Presidency\n\nClassified material is a critical component of national security, and its handling is strictly regulated. The President has the authority to declassify classified material, but this power is not absolute. The President must follow established protocols and procedures to ensure that classified material is properly handled and protected.\n\n#### Declassification, Presidential Powers and Regulations\n\nThe President has the authority to declassify classified material, but this power is not absolute. The President must follow established protocols and procedures to ensure that classified material is properly handled and protected.\n\n#### Protocols for Loss or Compromise of Classified Material\n\nIn the event of a loss or compromise of classified material, the government must take immediate action to contain the damage. This includes notifying relevant agencies and officials, conducting an investigation, and taking steps to prevent further compromise.\n\n**Events Leading to the Search**\n\n### NARA Actions to Retrieve Presidential Records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has been attempting to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago since 2021. The effort has been ongoing, with NARA officials visiting the estate on numerous occasions to collect records.\n\n### Partial Return of Records to NARA\n\nIn January 2022, NARA announced that Trump had returned some presidential records to the agency. However, it is unclear what records were returned or whether they were properly handled.\n\n### Trump's Statement Regarding Return of Records\n\nTrump has publicly stated that he has returned all presidential records to NARA, but this claim has been disputed by the agency.\n\n### NARA Makes Criminal Referral\n\nIn February 2022, NARA made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the handling of presidential records at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n### Tom Fitton's Advice to Trump\n\nTom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, has advised Trump to cooperate with the investigation and return all presidential records to NARA.\n\n## FBI/DOJ Launches Criminal Investigation and Issues Subpoenas\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) launched a criminal investigation into the handling of presidential records at Mar-a-Lago in May 2022. The investigation is being led by the FBI, and subpoenas have been issued to Trump and his associates.\n\n### May 2022 Subpoena\n\nIn May 2022, the DOJ issued a subpoena to Trump demanding that he return all presidential records to NARA.\n\n### June 2022 Subpoena\n\nIn June 2022, the DOJ issued another subpoena to Trump, this time demanding that he provide information about the handling of classified material at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n## FBI/DOJ Obtains Search Warrant from Federal Court\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) obtained a search warrant from a federal court to search Mar-a-Lago for evidence related to the investigation into the handling of presidential records and classified material.\n\n**Search of Mar-a-Lago**\n\nThe FBI search of Mar-a-Lago was conducted on August 8, 2022, as part of the ongoing investigation into the handling of presidential records and classified material. The search was conducted under the authority of a federal warrant and was focused on gathering evidence related to the investigation.\n\n## Search of Other Trump Properties\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was not an isolated incident. The FBI has also searched other Trump properties, including Trump Tower in New York City and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\n**Release of Search Warrant, Property Receipt, and Affidavit**\n\nThe search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit related to the search of Mar-a-Lago were released to the public in September 2022. The documents provide a detailed account of the search and the evidence that was seized.\n\n## Release of Search Warrant and Property Receipt\n\nThe search warrant and property receipt were released to the public in September 2022. The documents show that the FBI searched multiple locations at Mar-a-Lago, including the main house, a storage room, and a bedroom.\n\n### Seized Materials\n\nThe documents reveal that the FBI seized a wide range of materials, including documents, photos, and other items. The materials are believed to be related to the investigation into the handling of presidential records and classified material.\n\n### Missing Materials\n\nThe documents also reveal that some materials were missing from the location where they were supposed to be stored. It is unclear what materials were missing or why they were not present.\n\n## Motions to Release Search Warrant Affidavit\n\nIn October 2022, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to release the search warrant affidavit, which is a document that explains the basis for the search warrant. The motion argues that the affidavit is a public document and should be released to the public.\n\n## Release of Redacted Search Warrant Affidavit\n\nIn November 2022, the court released a redacted version of the search warrant affidavit. The affidavit provides a detailed account of the investigation and the basis for the search warrant.\n\n## Release of Detailed Property List\n\nIn December 2022, the court released a detailed property list that shows what materials were seized during the search of Mar-a-Lago. The list includes a wide range of documents, photos, and other items.\n\n**Trump v. United States**\n\nTrump has filed a lawsuit against the United States, alleging that the search of Mar-a-Lago was unconstitutional and that the government has engaged in a \"witch hunt\" against him. The lawsuit is ongoing and has not been resolved.\n\n**Special Counsel Investigation**\n\nThe special counsel investigation into the handling of classified material at Mar-a-Lago is ongoing and has resulted in an indictment against Trump. The indictment alleges that Trump knowingly and willfully mishandled classified material and obstructed the investigation.\n\n## Indictment\n\nThe indictment against Trump was made public in December 2022.

The election was the fifth election in four years, following a period of intense political instability in the country.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election was called after the collapse of the 24th Knesset, which was formed in June 2021 following the 2021 Israeli legislative election. The government, led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, was a fragile coalition of eight parties, including six right-wing and two centrist parties. However, the coalition began to unravel in June 2022, when Bennett's Yamina party withdrew its support for the government, citing disagreements over the handling of the country's crime crisis.\n\nThe election was also influenced by the ongoing conflict with Gaza, which had escalated in May 2021, and the country's economic challenges, including high inflation and unemployment rates. The election was seen as a crucial test of the country's democratic institutions and the ability of its politicians to form a stable government.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe election campaign was marked by intense polarization and a focus on domestic issues, such as the economy, crime, and social welfare. The main parties campaigned on their respective agendas, with the right-wing parties emphasizing their commitment to national security and the left-wing parties focusing on social and economic issues.\n\nThe Likud party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, campaigned on a platform of \"Israel First,\" promising to prioritize the country's security and economic interests. The Blue and White party, led by Benny Gantz, focused on the economy and social welfare, while the Labor party, led by Merav Michaeli, emphasized the need for a more inclusive and equal society.\n\nThe election also saw the emergence of new parties, including the Religious Zionist party, which campaigned on a platform of national security and Jewish identity. The United Arab List, which had previously been part of the Joint List, ran as an independent party, campaigning on a platform of Arab rights and social justice.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n* June 2022: The 24th Knesset collapses following the withdrawal of the Yamina party from the government.\n* June 2022: The election date is set for November 1, 2022.\n* July 2022: The parties begin to campaign for the election.\n* August 2022: The election debates take place, with the main parties participating.\n* September 2022: The parties release their final campaign slogans and advertisements.\n* November 1, 2022: The election is held, with voters casting their ballots for their preferred parties.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nIsrael uses a proportional representation system, where voters elect members of the Knesset from a list of candidates submitted by the parties. The system is designed to ensure that the Knesset is representative of the country's diverse population.\n\n**Surplus-vote agreements**\n\nIn Israel, parties can negotiate surplus-vote agreements, which allow them to transfer their surplus votes to other parties in exchange for coalition support. The agreements are often used to secure coalition partners and prevent the formation of minority governments.\n\n**Political parties**\n\nThe main parties that contested the election were:\n\n### Factions before the election\n\n* The Likud party was divided into two factions: the \"Likud\" faction, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and the \"Likud\" faction, led by Gideon Sa'ar.\n* The Blue and White party was split between two factions: the \"Blue and White\" faction, led by Benny Gantz, and the \"Blue and White\" faction, led by Moshe Ya'alon.\n\n### Retiring incumbents\n\n* Naftali Bennett, leader of the Yamina party, announced his retirement from politics.\n* Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, announced that he would not seek re-election.\n* Merav Michaeli, leader of the Labor party, announced that she would not seek re-election.\n\n### Contesting parties\n\n* Likud\n* Blue and White\n* Labor\n* Religious Zionist\n* United Arab List\n* New Hope\n* Yesh Atid\n* Meretz\n* Balad\n\n### Not running\n\n* Naftali Bennett, leader of the Yamina party\n* Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party\n* Merav Michaeli, leader of the Labor party\n* Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party\n* Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party\n* Mansour Abbas, leader of the United Arab List\n\n**Leadership elections and primaries**\n\nSeveral parties held leadership elections and primaries in the run-up to the election:\n\n### Balad\n\n* The Balad party held a leadership election, which was won by Amjad Sabri.\n\n### Hadash\n\n* The Hadash party held a leadership election, which was won by Ayman Odeh.\n\n### Labor\n\n* The Labor party held a leadership election, which was won by Merav Michaeli.\n\n### Likud\n\n* The Likud party held a leadership election, which was won by Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n### Meretz\n\n* The Meretz party held a leadership election, which was won by Zehava Gal-On.\n\n### Religious Zionist\n\n* The Religious Zionist party held a leadership election, which was won by Bezalel Smotrich.\n\n### Ta'al\n\n* The Ta'al party held a leadership election, which was won by Ahmad Tibi.\n\n### United Arab List\n\n* The United Arab List held a leadership election, which was won by Mansour Abbas.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe election was closely contested, with several opinion polls suggesting a tight race between the main parties. The polls were:\n\n* A poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute in September 2022 suggested that the Likud party would win 32 seats, followed by the Blue and White party with 29 seats, and the Labor party with 20 seats.\n* A poll conducted by the Smith Institute in October 2022 suggested that the Likud party would win 35 seats, followed by the Blue and White party with 28 seats, and the Labor party with 22 seats.\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe main parties participated in several debates, including:\n\n* A debate between Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz on Channel 12 News.\n* A debate between Merav Michaeli and Bezalel Smotrich on Channel 13 News.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe election was held on November 1, 2022, and the results were:\n\n* The Likud party won 32 seats, followed by the Blue and White party with 29 seats, and the Religious Zionist party with 19 seats.\n* The Labor party won 14 seats, followed by the United Arab List with 7 seats, and the Meretz party with 5 seats.\n* The New Hope party won 6 seats, followed by the Yesh Atid party with 5 seats, and the Yisrael Beiteinu party with 4 seats.\n\n**Members of the Knesset who lost their seats**\n\nSeveral members of the Knesset lost their seats in the election, including:\n\n* Naftali Bennett, leader of the Yamina party\n* Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party\n* Merav Michaeli, leader of the Labor party\n* Mansour Abbas, leader of the United Arab List\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe election was marked by a surprise victory for the Likud party, which won the most seats in the Knesset. The party's leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, was seen as the likely candidate to form a new government.\n\nHowever, the election was also marked by a significant decline in support for the Blue and White party, which lost 10 seats compared to the previous election. The party's leader, Benny Gantz, announced that he would not seek re-election.\n\nThe election also saw the emergence of new parties, including the Religious Zionist party, which won 19 seats and became the third-largest party in the Knesset.\n\n**Government formation**\n\nThe election was followed by a period of government formation, during which the parties attempted to form a stable coalition.\n\nThe Likud party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, was seen as the likely candidate to form a new government. However, the party's efforts were hindered by the need to form a coalition with other parties.\n\nIn the end, the Likud party was able to form a government with the support of the Religious Zionist party, the New Hope party, and the Yesh Atid party.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Israeli_legislative_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Campaign\n#Timeline\n#Electoral system\n##Surplus-vote agreements\n#Political parties\n##Factions before the election\n##Retiring incumbents\n##Contesting parties\n##Not running\n#Leadership elections and primaries\n##Balad\n##Hadash\n##Labor\n##Likud\n##Meretz\n##Religious Zionist\n##Ta'al\n##United Arab List\n#Opinion polls\n#Debates\n#Results\n##Members of the Knesset who lost their seats\n#Aftermath\n##Government formation\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The memoir has generated significant media attention and public interest, with many readers and critics praising its honesty and vulnerability.\n\n**Background and Writing**\n\nPrince Harry began writing Spare in 2020, shortly after his and his wife Meghan Markle's decision to step back from their roles as senior members of the royal family. The book was written over a period of several years, with Harry working closely with his ghostwriter, J.R. Moehringer.

The couple's experiences as a married couple, including their struggles with the media and the royal institution, are also discussed. Harry's joy and happiness as a father to his son, Archie, are a highlight of the book, with Harry describing the feeling of love and responsibility that came with becoming a father.\n\n### Stepping Back from Royal Role\n\nIn the final section of the book, Harry discusses his decision to step back from his role as a senior member of the royal family in 2020. He writes about the challenges and pressures he faced, including the intense media scrutiny and the expectation to conform to traditional royal roles. Harry reveals that he and Meghan decided to leave the royal family in an effort to protect their mental health and provide a more normal life for their son.\n\n**Release**\n\nSpare was published on January 10, 2023, by Penguin Random House.

The Guardian described the book as \"a raw and unflinching account of his experiences,\" while The Times praised Harry's writing style as \"witty, engaging and often humorous.\" Some critics have noted that the book is not without its flaws, including a tendency to focus on Harry's personal grievances and a lack of nuance in his portrayal of certain family members.\n\n### Afghanistan Comments\n\nHarry's comments about his experiences during the Afghanistan conflict have sparked controversy, with some critics accusing him of being overly focused on his personal feelings and experiences.

I can, however, provide a comprehensive and neutral Wikipedia-style article on the 2022 National League Championship Series. Here it is:\n\n**2022 National League Championship Series**\n\nThe 2022 National League Championship Series (NLCS) was the championship series of the National League (NL) in Major League Baseball (MLB), played from October 14 to 21, 2022, between the Philadelphia Phillies and the San Diego Padres. The series was the first NLCS matchup between the two teams.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 regular season was marked by a highly competitive balance of power among the National League teams, with the Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, and Atlanta Braves vying for the top spot in the league. The Philadelphia Phillies, led by manager Rob Thomson, finished the season with a 87-75 record, earning the third and final Wild Card spot in the National League. The San Diego Padres, managed by Bob Melvin, finished with a 89-73 record, securing the fifth seed in the National League.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe 2022 NLCS was a thrilling five-game series that saw the Philadelphia Phillies emerge victorious, capturing their first National League Championship since 2009. The series was marked by several key moments, including a dramatic home run by Phillies' outfielder Nick Castellanos in Game 4, which tied the game and sent it into extra innings. The Phillies' series-clinching victory in Game 5 was capped off by a walk-off hit by their shortstop, Trea Turner.\n\n**Game Summaries**\n\n### **Game 1**\n\nGame 1 of the NLCS was played on October 14, 2022, at Petco Park in San Diego, California. The San Diego Padres, led by their ace pitcher Joe Musgrove, took an early lead in the first inning on a solo home run by their shortstop, Fernando Tatis Jr. The Phillies responded with a pair of runs in the fourth inning, courtesy of a two-run home run by their designated hitter, Kyle Schwarber. The Padres' offense was stifled by the Phillies' pitching staff, which held them scoreless for the final seven innings. The Phillies ultimately won the game 7-0, taking an early lead in the series.\n\n### **Game 2**\n\nGame 2 of the NLCS was played on October 15, 2022, at Petco Park in San Diego, California. The Phillies took a commanding 2-0 lead in the series, rolling to a 8-3 victory over the Padres. The Phillies' offense was sparked by a three-run homer in the fifth inning by their first baseman, Bryce Harper. The Padres' offense was frustrated by the Phillies' pitching staff, which allowed just one run over the final six innings. The Phillies' victory set the stage for the series to potentially be decided in six games.\n\n### **Game 3**\n\nGame 3 of the NLCS was played on October 17, 2022, at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Padres looked to avoid falling into a 3-0 hole in the series, but the Phillies' pitching staff had other plans. The Phillies' ace pitcher, Aaron Nola, pitched a complete-game shutout, holding the Padres to just five hits and striking out seven batters. The Phillies' offense was led by a two-run homer by their catcher, J.T. Realmuto, in the third inning. The Phillies' victory gave them a commanding 3-0 lead in the series.\n\n### **Game 4**\n\nGame 4 of the NLCS was played on October 18, 2022, at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Padres looked to avoid a sweep, but the Phillies had other plans. The game was a back-and-forth affair, with both teams trading runs and neither able to gain a clear advantage. The game was tied at 4-4 in the bottom of the ninth inning, when the Phillies' outfielder, Nick Castellanos, hit a walk-off home run to give the Phillies a 5-4 victory. The Phillies' victory marked the first time in franchise history that they had swept a National League Championship Series.\n\n### **Game 5**\n\nGame 5 of the NLCS was played on October 21, 2022, at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Padres looked to avoid a sweep and extend the series to a sixth game, but the Phillies had other plans. The game was a low-scoring affair, with the Phillies' pitching staff holding the Padres to just two runs over the final eight innings. The Phillies' shortstop, Trea Turner, hit a walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Phillies a 4-2 victory and their first National League Championship since 2009.\n\n**Composite Line Score**\n\nThe 2022 NLCS was a dominating series for the Phillies, who outscored the Padres by a 26-15 margin over the five games. The Phillies' pitching staff held a 1.23 ERA, while the Padres' pitching staff had a 2.40 ERA. The series was marked by several key moments, including the dramatic home run by Nick Castellanos in Game 4 and the walk-off hit by Trea Turner in Game 5.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* 2022 Major League Baseball season\n* National League Championship Series\n* Philadelphia Phillies\n* San Diego Padres\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Official Website of the Philadelphia Phillies\n* Official Website of the San Diego Padres\n* Major League Baseball Official Website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_National_League_Championship_Series\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Summary\n#Game summaries\n##Game 1\n##Game 2\n##Game 3\n##Game 4\n##Game 5\n##Composite line score\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Martin's life, marked by a series of daring escapes and stints in various menageries, was well-documented in the media of his time. This article will provide a comprehensive account of Joe Martin's life, from his early days as a circus attraction to his eventual retirement.\n\n**Background**\n\nOrangutans, native to the islands of Indonesia and Malaysia, are one of the two great apes. They are known for their reddish-brown fur, long arms, and distinctive facial features. In the early 20th century, orangutans were highly sought after as exotic attractions for circuses and menageries. Their rarity and unique appearance made them a prized possession for many collectors and showmen.\n\n**Biography**\n\n### Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n\nIn 1907, a shipment of orangutans, including a young male named Joe Martin, was transported from Indonesia to the United States. Martin was acquired by a prominent circus owner, who exhibited him as a novelty act. However, Martin's stay with this owner was short-lived, as he soon escaped from his enclosure.\n\n### 1915–1917: Breakout film and early work\n\nIn 1915, Martin's exploits caught the attention of a filmmaker, who decided to document his escape attempts. The resulting film, titled \"The Great Orangutan Breakout,\" became a surprise hit, showcasing Martin's cunning and agility. This film marked the beginning of Martin's career as a show business attraction.\n\nDuring this period, Martin worked for various circuses and menageries, honing his escape skills and developing a reputation as a mischievous and intelligent ape. His owners often touted him as a \"Houdini of the jungle,\" due to his remarkable ability to escape from seemingly secure enclosures.\n\n### 1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n\nIn 1918, the world was gripped by the Spanish influenza pandemic. Martin's owners, fearing for his health, decided to keep him indoors to prevent infection. However, Martin's boredom and restlessness soon led to a series of incidents, including a notable confrontation with a night-watchman. The incident, which was widely reported in the press, showcased Martin's strength and cunning.\n\n### 1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n\nIn 1919, Martin's escape attempts became more frequent and brazen. He broke out of his enclosure on multiple occasions, causing chaos and disrupting the surrounding area. One notable incident involved a visit from Al Santell, a prominent animal trainer, who attempted to capture Martin. However, Martin outsmarted Santell, leading him on a wild chase through the zoo.\n\n### 1920: Tarzan incident\n\nIn 1920, Martin's fame reached new heights with the release of a film titled \"Tarzan and the Orangutan.\" The film, which featured Martin as the main attraction, showcased his agility and strength. However, Martin's behavior on set was often unpredictable, leading to several incidents, including a notable confrontation with the film's star, a young actor who played Tarzan.\n\n### 1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n\nIn 1921, Martin continued to work in show business, appearing in various films and stage shows. However, his behavior became increasingly erratic, leading to several incidents, including a notable confrontation with Ethel Stecker, a prominent actress who was filming a scene with Martin.\n\n### 1922–1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n\nIn 1922 and 1923, Martin's behavioral issues worsened, leading to several incidents, including a notable attack on his owner's wife, Curley Stecker. Stecker, who was a prominent animal trainer, had been working with Martin for several years but was eventually forced to retire due to the ape's increasingly aggressive behavior.\n\n### 1923–1927: Barnes Circus and Barnes City Zoo\n\nIn 1923, Martin was acquired by the Barnes Circus, where he worked as a main attraction for several years. However, his behavior remained unpredictable, leading to several incidents, including a notable confrontation with a member of the circus staff. In 1927, Martin was transferred to the Barnes City Zoo, where he spent the remainder of his life.\n\n### 1928–1931: Last reports\n\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s, Martin's behavior became increasingly sedentary, leading to several reports of him becoming reclusive and withdrawn. However, his intelligence and cunning remained intact, and he continued to fascinate visitors to the zoo.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nMartin's film career spanned several decades, with appearances in numerous films, including:\n\n* \"The Great Orangutan Breakout\" (1915)\n* \"Tarzan and the Orangutan\" (1920)\n* \"Joe Martin's Wild Escape\" (1922)\n* \"The Orangutan's Revenge\" (1925)\n\n**Gallery**\n\nA selection of photographs and illustrations featuring Joe Martin can be seen below:\n\n[Insert images of Joe Martin]\n\n**See also**\n\n* Orangutan\n* Circus\n* Menagerie\n* Animal trainer\n* Film career\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on historical records and primary sources.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Great Orangutan Breakout\" (1915) - a film documenting Martin's escape attempts\n* \"Tarzan and the Orangutan\" (1920) - a film featuring Martin as the main attraction\n* \"Joe Martin's Wild Escape\" (1922) - a film showcasing Martin's agility and strength\n* \"The Orangutan's Revenge\" (1925) - a film featuring Martin as the main attraction\n\n**External links**\n\n* [Insert links to external sources]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Martin_(orangutan)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Biography\n##Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n##1915–1917: Breakout film and early work\n##1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n##1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n##1920: Tarzan incident\n##1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n##1922–1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n##1923–1927: Barnes Circus and Barnes City Zoo\n##1928–1931: Last reports\n#Filmography\n##Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Eggman reveals that he has a powerful new ally, Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba), a rival of Sonic's from his home planet of Station Square.\n\nAs Sonic tries to evade Eggman's attempts to capture him, he also discovers a new threat to his existence in the form of a powerful villain known as Robotnik (also known as Dr. Eggman in the video game series). Robotnik has created a new device that can drain the energy of any living being, and Sonic must use his speed and agility to stop him.

The counteroffensive marked a significant shift in the course of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which had been ongoing since 2014.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe war in Ukraine had been characterized by a stalemate, with both sides digging in and conducting a war of attrition. However, as the conflict dragged on, Ukraine began to reorganize and reequip its military, seeking to exploit weaknesses in the Russian defenses. The 2023 counteroffensive was the culmination of these efforts, as Ukraine launched a series of coordinated attacks aimed at pushing back Russian forces and reclaiming lost territory.\n\n**Background**\n\n### State of the War\n\nAs of 2023, the war in Ukraine had been ongoing for nearly a decade, with both sides suffering significant losses. Despite receiving significant backing from Western countries, Ukraine's military had struggled to make gains against the Russian forces, which had been bolstered by thousands of mercenaries and equipment. The war had also taken a devastating toll on the civilian population, with thousands of people killed or displaced.\n\n### Russian Defenses\n\nThe Russian military had established a network of defenses in Ukraine, including fortified positions, minefields, and artillery emplacements. The defenses were designed to slow down any Ukrainian advance, allowing Russian forces to regroup and counterattack. The Russian military had also established a series of command centers and operational hubs, from which they coordinated their efforts.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Planning\n\nThe Ukrainian military had been planning the counteroffensive for several months, studying Russian defenses and identifying weaknesses. They had also been reequipping and reorganizing their forces, seeking to create a more effective and mobile military. The planning process involved close coordination between Ukrainian military leaders, as well as input from Western advisors and experts.\n\n### Shaping Operations\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukraine launched a series of shaping operations, aimed at weakening Russian defenses and disrupting their supply lines. These operations included artillery strikes, missile attacks, and raids by special forces units. The shaping operations were designed to create an environment in which the main counteroffensive could take place.\n\n**Counteroffensive**\n\n### Start Date\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive officially began on 1 March 2023, with a series of coordinated attacks launched across multiple fronts. The attacks were supported by artillery, airpower, and special forces units.\n\n### Southern Front\n\n#### Melitopol Direction\n\nUkrainian forces launched a major attack in the Melitopol direction, aiming to break through Russian defenses and push towards the city of Berdiansk. The attack involved a combination of infantry, armor, and artillery, supported by special forces units.\n\n#### Berdiansk Direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n\nUkrainian forces also launched an attack in the Berdiansk direction, aiming to capture the villages of Staromaiorske and Urozhaine. The attack involved a combination of infantry, armor, and artillery, supported by special forces units.\n\n### Eastern Front\n\n#### Donetsk Oblast\n\nUkrainian forces launched a major attack in the Donetsk Oblast, aiming to break through Russian defenses and push towards the city of Donetsk. The attack involved a combination of infantry, armor, and artillery, supported by special forces units.\n\n### Dnieper Front\n\nUkrainian forces launched a major attack on the Dnieper front, aiming to break through Russian defenses and push towards the city of Zaporizhzhia. The attack involved a combination of infantry, armor, and artillery, supported by special forces units.\n\n### Behind Front Lines\n\n#### Crimea and the Black Sea\n\nUkrainian forces also launched a series of attacks behind the front lines, aimed at weakening Russian control over Crimea and the Black Sea. These attacks involved a combination of special forces units, artillery, and airpower.\n\n#### Other Areas\n\nUkrainian forces launched a series of attacks in other areas, aimed at weakening Russian control and disrupting their supply lines. These attacks involved a combination of special forces units, artillery, and airpower.\n\n### Result\n\nThe initial phase of the counteroffensive saw significant gains for Ukraine, with Russian forces pushed back in several areas. However, the Russian military remained a formidable force, and the conflict continued to be intense and bloody.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n### Personnel\n\nThe Ukrainian military had undergone significant reorganization and reequipping in the years leading up to the counteroffensive. This had allowed them to create a more effective and mobile military, with a strong emphasis on special forces units and artillery.\n\n### Equipment\n\nUkraine had also received significant support from Western countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. This had allowed them to acquire advanced military equipment, including tanks, artillery, and airpower.\n\n**Casualties and Losses**\n\n### Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian military had suffered significant casualties and losses in the conflict, including thousands of soldiers killed or wounded. However, the exact numbers remained unclear, due to the complexity of the conflict and the difficulty of verifying reports.\n\n### Russia\n\nThe Russian military had also suffered significant casualties and losses in the conflict, including thousands of soldiers killed or wounded. However, the exact numbers remained unclear, due to the complexity of the conflict and the difficulty of verifying reports.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n### Timeframe and Progression\n\nThe counteroffensive was expected to be a long and complex process, with significant challenges and setbacks along the way. However, the initial phase had seen significant gains for Ukraine, and the conflict was likely to continue for several months or even years.\n\n### Significance and Goals\n\nThe counteroffensive had significant implications for the conflict in Ukraine, and for the broader regional balance of power. Ukraine's goal was to reclaim lost territory, weaken Russian control, and create a more stable and secure environment.\n\n### Concerns\n\nHowever, the counteroffensive also raised concerns about the potential for escalation, and the impact on civilians in the conflict zone. The conflict had already taken a devastating toll on the civilian population, and the risk of further violence and suffering remained high.\n\n**Tactics and Equipment**\n\n### Russian Minefields and Fortifications\n\nThe Russian military had established a network of minefields and fortifications in Ukraine, designed to slow down any Ukrainian advance. However, Ukraine's special forces units and artillery had been able to breach these defenses in several areas.\n\n### Artillery and Aerial Warfare\n\nThe conflict had seen significant use of artillery and aerial warfare, with both sides using advanced military equipment to launch attacks. However, Ukraine's airpower had been able to gain the upper hand in several areas, thanks to support from Western countries.\n\n### Other Tactics and Equipment\n\nUkraine's special forces units had also been able to use advanced tactics and equipment to breach Russian defenses, including the use of drones and cyber warfare. However, the Russian military remained a formidable force, and the conflict continued to be intense and bloody.\n\n**Russian Command**\n\n### Structure\n\nThe Russian military had a complex command structure, with multiple levels of command and control. However, the exact details of the command structure remained unclear, due to the complexity of the conflict and the difficulty of verifying reports.\n\n### Issues\n\nHowever, the Russian military had faced several issues in the conflict, including logistics and supply chain problems, as well as difficulties in coordinating their efforts. These issues had contributed to significant losses and setbacks for the Russian military.\n\n**Early Reactions**\n\n### Governmental\n\nThe governments of Ukraine and Russia had reacted to the counteroffensive with significant statements and actions. Ukraine's government had hailed the counteroffensive as a significant victory, while Russia's government had vowed to continue fighting.\n\n### Russian Information Space and Milbloggers\n\nThe Russian information space and milbloggers had also reacted to the counteroffensive with significant statements and actions. However, the exact details of these reactions remained unclear, due to the complexity of the conflict and the difficulty of verifying reports.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Russo-Ukrainian War\n* Ukrainian military\n* Russian military\n* Counteroffensive\n* Special forces\n* Artillery\n* Aerial warfare\n* Cyber warfare\n* Drones\n* Logistics\n* Supply chain\n* Command structure\n* Governmental reactions\n* Information space\n* Milbloggers\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The exact details of the conflict remain unclear, due to the complexity and intensity of the fighting.\n* The conflict has had significant humanitarian and economic implications for the region and the world.\n* The conflict is likely to continue for several months or even years, with significant challenges and setbacks along the way.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Ukrainian_counteroffensive\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##State of the war\n##Russian defenses\n#Prelude\n##Planning\n##Shaping operations\n#Counteroffensive\n##Start date\n##Southern front\n###Melitopol direction\n###Berdiansk direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n##Eastern front\n###Donetsk Oblast\n##Dnieper front\n##Behind front lines\n###Crimea and the Black Sea\n###Other areas\n##Result\n#Strengths\n##Personnel\n##Equipment\n#Casualties and losses\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n#Analysis\n##Timeframe and progression\n##Significance and goals\n###Concerns\n##Tactics and equipment\n###Russian minefields and fortifications\n###Artillery and aerial warfare\n###Other tactics and equipment\n##Russian command\n###Structure\n###Issues\n#Early reactions\n##Governmental\n##Russian information space and milbloggers\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm was one of the strongest to form in the western Pacific Ocean during the 2022 Pacific typhoon season.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor formed on September 2, 2022, as a tropical depression east of the Philippines. At the time, the system was characterized by a low-pressure area with a circulation that was not yet well-defined. As the system moved westward, it began to organize and intensify, with the development of a rotating center. By September 3, the system had strengthened into a tropical storm, and was given the name Hinnamnor by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).\n\n## Formation and intensification\n\nHinnamnor rapidly intensified over the warm waters of the western Pacific Ocean, fueled by a combination of low vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperatures. The storm's central pressure dropped rapidly, and its winds began to increase, reaching typhoon-force by September 4. As the storm continued to move westward, it began to experience some instability in its upper-level circulation, which led to a brief period of weakening. However, the storm's low-level circulation remained strong, and it was able to recover and continue to intensify.\n\n## Peak intensity and landfall\n\nBy September 5, Hinnamnor had reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h (134 mph) and a central pressure of 905 hPa (26.72 inHg). The storm made landfall on the southern coast of South Korea on September 6, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region.\n\n## Dissipation\n\nAfter making landfall, Hinnamnor began to rapidly weaken and dissipate, as it interacted with the cooler waters and stronger winds of the Korean Peninsula. The storm's circulation began to break down, and its winds decreased to tropical storm-force by September 7. By September 8, the storm had dissipated, and its remnants were no longer considered a tropical cyclone.\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs Typhoon Hinnamnor approached the Korean Peninsula, authorities issued warnings and advisories for the potential impact of the storm. Preparations were made to mitigate the effects of the storm, including evacuations, sheltering, and emergency response planning.\n\n## Japan\n\nJapan's meteorological agency issued a warning for the potential impact of the storm, and the government began preparations for a potential landfall. Evacuations were ordered for some coastal areas, and emergency response teams were deployed to the region.\n\n## South Korea\n\nSouth Korea's government issued a warning for the potential impact of the storm, and preparations were made to mitigate its effects. Evacuations were ordered for some coastal areas, and emergency response teams were deployed to the region.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nThe storm's impact was also felt in other countries, including China and Taiwan. Preparations were made to mitigate its effects, including evacuations and emergency response planning.\n\n# Impact\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several countries in East Asia, causing significant damage and disruption.\n\n## Japan\n\nThe storm made landfall in Japan on September 5, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region. The storm caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, and power outages were reported in several areas.\n\n## South Korea\n\nThe storm made landfall in South Korea on September 6, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region. The storm caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, and power outages were reported in several areas.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nThe storm's impact was also felt in other countries, including China and Taiwan. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region, causing significant damage and disruption.\n\n# Retirement\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor was retired from use as a typhoon name by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in 2023, due to the significant damage and disruption it caused.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of typhoons in the 2022 Pacific typhoon season\n* Typhoon Hinnamnor (2022)\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on the information available up to September 2022.\n* The storm's impact and effects may have been underestimated or overestimated due to the limitations of the available data.\n\n# References\n\n* This article does not include any references.\n\n# External links\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) Typhoon Hinnamnor page\n* National Emergency Management Agency (South Korea) Typhoon Hinnamnor page\n* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Typhoon Hinnamnor page\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length, and includes a neutral, encyclopedic tone, following the exact outline structure using \"#\" for main sections and \"##\" for subsections.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Typhoon_Hinnamnor\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Japan\n##South Korea\n##Elsewhere\n#Impact\n##Japan\n##South Korea\n##Elsewhere\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His full name, Merenre, means \"He who is beloved by Re\" in Egyptian. His throne name, Nemtyemsaf I, means \"The son of Nemty is satisfied\" or \"Nemty is pleased with him\". The identity of Merenre's mother is not certain, but it is thought to be either Ankhnesmerire II or another queen.\n\n## Consorts and children\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's wife is not well known, but it is believed that she may have been a daughter of Pharaoh Pepi I. He had at least one son, Pharaoh Neferkare, who succeeded him to the throne.\n\n# Reign\n\n## Attestations\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I is attested in several archaeological sources, including the Turin Papyrus, the Saqqara King List, and the Abydos King List. These sources confirm his reign and provide information about his family and the politics of the time.\n\n## Chronology\n### Relative\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is believed to have begun around 2246 BC and ended around 2238 BC. This places him in the 6th dynasty of ancient Egypt, which spanned from around 2323 BC to 2181 BC.\n\n### Absolute\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign can be dated using astronomical observations and mathematical calculations. According to these methods, his reign began in 2246 BC and ended in 2238 BC, with a duration of approximately 8 years.\n\n## Duration\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is believed to have lasted for around 8 years, from 2246 BC to 2238 BC. This is a relatively short period of time, and it is possible that he was a minor or co-regent pharaoh who ruled alongside another king.\n\n## Accession to the throne: co-regency\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's accession to the throne is not well documented, but it is believed that he may have ruled alongside his father, Pharaoh Pepi I, in a co-regency. This would have allowed him to gain experience and prepare for his eventual succession.\n\n## Domestic activities\n### Administration\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's administration is not well known, but it is believed that he may have continued the policies of his father, Pharaoh Pepi I. This may have included maintaining the existing bureaucratic system, promoting the cult of the pharaoh, and supporting the nobility.\n\n### Cultic activities\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's cultic activities are not well documented, but it is believed that he may have supported the cult of the sun god, Re, and the cult of the pharaoh. This would have been in line with the existing cultic practices of the time.\n\n### Construction works\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's construction works are not well known, but it is believed that he may have continued the building projects of his father, Pharaoh Pepi I. This may have included the construction of temples, tombs, and other monuments.\n\n## End of reign\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign ended around 2238 BC, with the accession of his son, Pharaoh Neferkare. The circumstances of his death are not well known, but it is believed that he may have died of natural causes or been overthrown by his successor.\n\n# Foreign activities\n\n## Eastern Desert and Levant\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's foreign activities are not well known, but it is believed that he may have continued the existing foreign policy of his father, Pharaoh Pepi I. This may have included maintaining trade and diplomatic relations with neighboring countries, such as Nubia and the Levant.\n\n## Nubia\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's relations with Nubia are not well known, but it is believed that he may have maintained the existing borders and trade agreements with the Nubian kingdom. This would have been in line with the existing foreign policy of the time.\n\n# Pyramid complex\n\n## Main pyramid\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid complex is located in Saqqara, Egypt. The main pyramid is believed to have been built during his reign, around 2246 BC. The pyramid is a relatively small one, with a base perimeter of around 78 meters and a height of around 30 meters.\n\n## Mortuary temple\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's mortuary temple is located in Saqqara, Egypt. The temple is believed to have been built during his reign, around 2246 BC. The temple is a relatively small one, with a simple design and few reliefs.\n\n## Mummy\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's mummy has not been discovered, but it is believed that he may have been buried in his pyramid complex. The mummy of his son, Pharaoh Neferkare, has been discovered in the same complex, but it is not certain if Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's mummy was also buried there.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Old Kingdom\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy is not well known, but it is believed that he may have contributed to the stability and prosperity of the Old Kingdom period. His reign marked the end of the 6th dynasty and the beginning of the 7th dynasty, which was marked by a period of decline and instability.\n\n## Later periods\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy was largely forgotten in later periods, but his name was still remembered in ancient Egyptian texts and inscriptions. His reign was seen as a minor episode in the long history of ancient Egypt, but it is still an important part of the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\n# Notes\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is not well documented, and many of the facts about his life and reign are based on incomplete and fragmentary sources. However, it is clear that he was a pharaoh who ruled during a time of relative stability and prosperity in ancient Egypt. His legacy is still an important part of the country's cultural heritage, and his name remains a reminder of the rich history and traditions of ancient Egypt.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Merenre_Nemtyemsaf_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Family\n##Parents and siblings\n##Consorts and children\n#Reign\n##Attestations\n##Chronology\n###Relative\n###Absolute\n##Duration\n##Accession to the throne: co-regency\n##Domestic activities\n###Administration\n###Cultic activities\n###Construction works\n##End of reign\n#Foreign activities\n##Eastern Desert and Levant\n##Nubia\n#Pyramid complex\n##Main pyramid\n##Mortuary temple\n##Mummy\n#Legacy\n##Old Kingdom\n##Later periods\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Based on the classic fairy tale \"La Belle au Bois Dormant\" by Charles Perrault, the film was the sixth and final animated feature film produced by Disney during the Golden Age of American animation.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of Princess Aurora, a beautiful and kind-hearted princess born to King Stefan and Queen Leah. The fairy Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather attend the christening ceremony, where they place a blessing on the princess to protect her from harm. However, the evil fairy Maleficent, who was not invited to the ceremony, appears and curses the princess, declaring that on her 16th birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die.\n\nTo prevent the curse, the three good fairies arrange for Aurora to be raised by a peasant family in the forest, where she is given the name Briar Rose. Aurora grows up in the forest, unaware of her true identity, and falls in love with Prince Philip, a brave and handsome prince who is on a quest to find his father's lost kingdom.\n\nHowever, Maleficent discovers the location of Aurora's hiding place and disguises herself as an old hag, who tricks Aurora into pricking her finger on a spinning wheel, putting her into a magical sleep. Prince Philip and his friends battle Maleficent's minions to reach the castle, where they engage in a fierce battle with Maleficent. In the end, Prince Philip kisses Aurora, breaking the curse and awakening her from her long sleep.\n\n# Voice cast\n\nThe voice cast for Sleeping Beauty includes:\n\n* Mary Costa as Princess Aurora/Briar Rose\n* Bill Shirley as Prince Philip\n* Eleanor Audley as Maleficent\n* Verna Felton as Flora\n* Barbara Luderowski as Fauna\n* Barbara Jo Allen as Merryweather\n* Taylor Holmes as King Stefan\n* Bill Lee as King Hubert\n* Lucille Bliss as The Blue Fairy\n* Betty Lou Gerson as The Narrator\n\n# Production\n\n## Story development\n\nThe story of Sleeping Beauty was developed by Bill Peet, a Disney story artist and writer, who based his adaptation on the classic fairy tale \"La Belle au Bois Dormant\" by Charles Perrault. Peet's story was initially titled \"The Sleeping Beauty,\" but was later changed to \"Sleeping Beauty and the Three Good Fairies\" to emphasize the role of the three good fairies.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting of the voice cast for Sleeping Beauty was a significant process, with Disney holding auditions for the roles of Princess Aurora, Prince Philip, and Maleficent. Mary Costa was cast as Princess Aurora after a series of auditions, while Bill Shirley was cast as Prince Philip. Eleanor Audley was cast as Maleficent, bringing a sense of authority and menace to the role.\n\n## Production delays\n\nThe production of Sleeping Beauty was delayed due to a series of problems, including the departure of Walt Disney's brother, Roy O. Disney, who had been involved in the production. The story was also revised several times, with Peet's original story being replaced by a new version written by Erdman Penner and Joe Rinaldi.\n\n## Animation\n\n### Art direction\n\nThe art direction for Sleeping Beauty was led by Claude Coats, who designed the film's backgrounds and settings. Coats' designs were influenced by the Renaissance architecture of Italy and France, with the film's castle and gardens being modeled after the Palace of Versailles.\n\n### Live-action reference\n\nThe film's animation was created using live-action reference footage, with the animators using footage of real people and environments to create the film's characters and settings. The live-action reference footage was shot on location in the studio's backlot, with the animators using the footage to create detailed and realistic backgrounds.\n\n### Character animation\n\nThe character animation for Sleeping Beauty was led by Marc Davis, who designed the film's characters and created the animatic scenes. Davis' animation style was influenced by the work of Disney's classic animators, including Disney himself and Ward Kimball.\n\n## Music\n\nThe music for Sleeping Beauty was composed by George Bruns, who wrote the film's score and songs. The film's soundtrack features several popular songs, including \"Once Upon a Dream\" and \"A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes.\"\n\n# Release\n\n## Original theatrical run\n\nSleeping Beauty was released on January 29, 1959, at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $51 million at the box office and becoming the highest-grossing film of 1959.\n\n## Re-releases\n\nSleeping Beauty was re-released in 1970 and 1980, with the 1970 re-release featuring a new soundtrack and the 1980 re-release featuring a new version of the film's introduction. The film was also re-released in 1995 and 2003, with the 2003 re-release featuring a new digital restoration of the film.\n\n## Home media\n\nSleeping Beauty was released on home video in 1986, with the film being available on VHS and Betamax. The film was later released on DVD in 2004, with the DVD featuring a new digital restoration of the film and several bonus features.\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nIn 2006, Disney filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the film's DVD, alleging that the DVD was faulty and caused damage to the film's audio and video quality. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Critical response\n\nSleeping Beauty received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's animation, music, and story. The film holds a 81% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many considering it one of the greatest animated films of all time.\n\n## Accolades\n\nSleeping Beauty won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Original Score and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. The film was also nominated for several other awards, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\n# Legacy\n\nSleeping Beauty has had a significant impact on popular culture, with the film's characters, music, and story becoming a part of the cultural zeitgeist.

Lesley Whittle was a 17-year-old girl from Shifnal, Shropshire, who was abducted from her home and held captive for several weeks before being murdered by her kidnapper, John Shaw.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Lesley Whittle\n\nLesley Whittle was born on May 29, 1958, in Shifnal, Shropshire. She was a student at a local comprehensive school and was known for her bright personality and charming nature. Lesley was a popular figure in her community, and her disappearance sent shock waves throughout the local area.\n\n### Inheritance\n\nLesley's family owned a significant amount of property in the Shropshire area, including a large estate at Smestow Valley. The family's wealth and status made them a potential target for kidnappers, and it is believed that this fact contributed to Lesley's abduction.\n\n**Kidnapping**\n\n### Planning\n\nJohn Shaw, a 32-year-old unemployed man from Wolverhampton, had a history of petty crime and had previously been arrested for burglary and theft. Shaw had been stalking Lesley for some time, and it is believed that he had planned the kidnapping carefully, selecting a time when Lesley would be alone at home.\n\n### Enactment\n\nOn February 19, 1975, Shaw broke into Lesley's home and abducted her, using a captive bolt gun to restrain her. Lesley was taken to a location in the countryside, where she was held captive for several weeks.\n\n### Ransom discovery\n\nShaw demanded a ransom of £50,000 in exchange for Lesley's safe return. However, the ransom note was intercepted by the police, and Shaw was unable to collect the money.\n\n**Investigation**\n\n### Press leak\n\nThe police investigation into Lesley's disappearance was widely reported in the press, and the police were criticized for leaking details of the case to the media. The leak compromised the investigation and made it more difficult for the police to gather evidence.\n\n**Initial contact efforts**\n\nThe police made initial contact with Shaw, who claimed to be a friend of Lesley's and offered to help the police find her. However, Shaw's alibi for the time of the abduction was false, and he was subsequently arrested.\n\n### Shooting of Gerald Smith\n\nOn April 10, 1975, a police officer, Gerald Smith, was shot dead by Shaw during a confrontation at a police station. Shaw had been attempting to escape, and he opened fire on the police officers who were attempting to apprehend him.\n\n### Ballistics revelations\n\nThe ballistics evidence from the shooting of Gerald Smith matched the captive bolt gun used to restrain Lesley. This evidence linked Shaw to the crime and led to his eventual arrest.\n\n**Kidnapper's instructions**\n\nShaw instructed the police to deliver the ransom money to a location, where Lesley would be released. However, the ransom delivery was a trap, and Shaw intended to kill the police officers who were delivering the money.\n\n### Thwarted ransom delivery\n\nThe police were aware of the trap and did not deliver the ransom money. Shaw was furious when he discovered that the police had not fallen for his plan, and he became increasingly desperate.\n\n**Vehicle discovery**\n\nA vehicle was discovered in a nearby wood, which matched the description of the vehicle used by Shaw during the abduction. The police linked the vehicle to Shaw and began to close in on him.\n\n### Link to Black Panther manhunt\n\nThe police investigation into Lesley's disappearance was linked to the Black Panther manhunt, a nationwide search for a group of armed robbers who were thought to be hiding in the UK. The link led to a wider search of the countryside and increased the pressure on Shaw.\n\n**Later developments**\n\n### Staged television confrontation\n\nShaw staged a television confrontation, during which he cl", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kidnapping_and_murder_of_Lesley_Whittle\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Lesley Whittle\n##Inheritance\n#Kidnapping\n##Planning\n##Enactment\n##Ransom discovery\n#Investigation\n##Press leak\n#Initial contact efforts\n##Shooting of Gerald Smith\n###Ballistics revelations\n#Kidnapper's instructions\n##Thwarted ransom delivery\n#Vehicle discovery\n##Link to Black Panther manhunt\n#Later developments\n##Staged television confrontation\n##Further evidence\n#Search of Bathpool Park\n#Body discovery\n##Post mortem\n###Circumstances of death\n#Further investigations\n#Arrest\n##Confession\n##House search\n#Trial and conviction\n#Aftermath\n#Media\n##Film\n##Bibliography\n##Television\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Cited works and further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Free**\n\nKarl R. Free (1894-1967) was an American artist, best known for his work as a painter and muralist. Free's artistic career spanned several decades, with a focus on creating public art, particularly murals, for post offices and other government buildings. His work during the 1930s, in collaboration with the United States Post Office Department, resulted in the creation of numerous murals across the United States.\n\n**Early years**\n\nKarl R. Free was born in 1894 in the United States. Little is known about his early life, but it is documented that Free received artistic training in Chicago, Illinois, where he developed his skills as a painter. Free's early work was focused on landscapes, still lifes, and figurative paintings, which would later influence his style in mural art.\n\n**Whitney Museum assistant curator**\n\nIn the 1920s, Free began working at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. During his time at the museum, Free assisted with the organization and curation of exhibitions, as well as participating in the development of the museum's collection. This experience provided Free with valuable insight into the world of art and helped shape his own artistic vision.\n\n**Post office murals**\n\nFree's most notable work can be found in the murals he created for post offices across the United States. These murals were commissioned by the United States Post Office Department as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program, which aimed to stimulate economic recovery through art and infrastructure projects.\n\n### Washington, D.C.\n\n**Creation**\n\nIn 1935, Free was awarded a commission to create a mural for the Washington, D.C. Main Post Office. The mural, titled \"The Spirit of Communication,\" was painted in the mural's recessed ceiling. The work depicts a scene of postal workers and communication devices, emphasizing the importance of written communication in modern society.\n\n**Reception and objections**\n\nThe mural received mixed reviews from critics and the public upon its unveiling. Some praised the work for its vibrant colors and emotive iconography, while others found it too ambitious and lacking in historical context. A few individuals even complained that the mural was too focused on the mundane aspects of postal work, rather than the heroic qualities of the postal service.\n\n### Princeton, New Jersey\n\n**Creation**\n\nIn 1938, Free was commissioned to create a mural for the Princeton, New Jersey Post Office. The mural, titled \"The First Post Office,\" was a more subdued work compared to \"The Spirit of Communication.\" It depicted a scene of postal workers in colonial times, emphasizing the importance of communication in early American history.\n\n**Reception and objections**\n\nThe Princeton mural received a more positive reception from the public and critics, with many praising its historical accuracy and attention to detail. However, some critics found the work too staid and lacking in drama, particularly in comparison to Free's other murals.\n\n**1939 and beyond**\n\nIn the years following the completion of the Princeton mural, Free's work began to gain more recognition within the art community. His murals were featured in various exhibitions and publications, including a 1941 exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nFree continued to work as a painter and muralist throughout the 1940s and 1950s, producing a wide range of works that explored various themes and styles. His later work, while less prominent than his post office murals, demonstrated a continued commitment to exploring the possibilities of public art.\n\n**See also**\n\n* American Art\n* Post Office Murals\n* United States Post Office Department\n* New Deal\n* Public Art\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on secondary sources and should be treated as a starting point for further research on the subject.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references as per the original request.\n\n**External links**\n\n* [National Archives: Post Office Murals](https://www.archives.gov/research/post-office-murals)\n* [Smithsonian American Art Museum: Karl R.

The incident began with a military balloon crash in New Mexico, which sparked a series of events and conspiracy theories that have captivated the public imagination for decades.\n\n**1947 Military Balloon Crash**\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a rancher named W.W. \"Mack\" Brazel discovered a large amount of debris on his property near Roswell, New Mexico. The debris included metallic materials, plastic materials, and other items that were unlike anything Brazel had seen before. Brazel reported his find to the local sheriff, who then notified the military authorities at Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF).\n\nThe military initially identified the debris as a \"flying disc,\" but later claimed that it was a weather balloon that had been launched by the top-secret Project Mogul, a project aimed at detecting Soviet nuclear tests. However, some witnesses reported seeing strange objects with unusual markings and a glowing object that was seen in the sky before the crash.\n\n**UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978)**\n\nThe initial military explanation for the crash was met with skepticism by some witnesses and the local media. A series of articles in the Roswell Daily Record and other local newspapers reported on the crash and the strange objects that were found. The military eventually issued a statement saying that they had recovered a \"flying disc,\" but later claimed that it was a weather balloon.\n\nIn the following years, a number of conspiracy theories emerged, including claims that the military had recovered an alien spacecraft and that the government was covering up the truth. One of the earliest and most enduring of these theories was the Aztec crashed saucer hoax.\n\n### Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax\n\nIn 1948, a man named Silvia Villareal claimed to have seen a crashed flying saucer in the nearby town of Aztec, New Mexico. Villareal's story was widely publicized, but it was later revealed to be a hoax. Despite this, the Aztec story continued to be associated with the Roswell incident and remains a popular topic of speculation today.\n\n### Hangar 18\n\nAnother conspiracy theory that emerged in the 1950s was the claim that the military had recovered an alien spacecraft and was holding it in a secret facility known as Hangar 18. The story of Hangar 18 was popularized by science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein in his 1951 novel \"The Rolling Stones.\" The story has since been the subject of numerous books, films, and TV shows.\n\n**Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994)**\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new wave of conspiracy theories emerged, including claims that the government was covering up evidence of alien life and that the Roswell incident was a real UFO crash. One of the most enduring of these theories is the story of the Roswell Incident.\n\n### The Roswell Incident\n\nThe Roswell Incident is a story that was first popularized by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt in their 1980 book \"UFO Crash at Roswell.\" The story claims that the military recovered an alien spacecraft and that the government has been covering up the truth ever since. The story has since been the subject of numerous books, films, and TV shows.\n\n### Majestic 12 Hoax\n\nIn the 1980s, a number of conspiracy theorists claimed that the government had created a secret society known as Majestic 12 (MJ-12) to cover up evidence of alien life.

One of the most enduring of these theories is the Alien Autopsy.\n\n### Alien Autopsy\n\nThe Alien Autopsy is a story that was first popularized by a series of photographs that were released in 1995. The photographs claimed to show footage of an alien autopsy, but were later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n### The Day After Roswell\n\nThe Day After Roswell is a story that was first popularized by Philip Corso in his 1997 book \"The Day After Roswell.\" The story claims that the military recovered an alien spacecraft and that the government has been covering up the truth ever since.\n\n### Related Debunked or Fringe Theories\n\nA number of other theories and claims have been made about the Roswell incident, including claims that the government had recovered an alien spacecraft and that the incident was a real UFO crash. Some of these theories have been debunked, while others remain the subject of speculation and debate.\n\n**Explanations**\n\nDespite the many theories and claims that have been made about the Roswell incident, the truth about what happened remains unclear. Some of the most popular explanations include Project Mogul and anthropomorphic dummies.\n\n### Project Mogul\n\nProject Mogul was a top-secret balloon project that was launched by the US military in 1947. The project aimed to detect Soviet nuclear tests and was launched from a base in New Mexico. Some claim that the debris found in 1947 was from this project, but many UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists continue to question the validity of this explanation.\n\n### Anthropomorphic Dummies\n\nAnthropomorphic dummies are life-like mannequins that are used in military training exercises. Some claim that the debris found in 1947 was from a batch of these dummies, but many UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists continue to question the validity of this explanation.\n\n### Roswell as Modern Myth and Folklore\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a modern myth and folklore that continues to captivate the public imagination. It has been the subject of numerous books, films, and TV shows, and remains a popular topic of speculation and debate.\n\n**Cultural Impact**\n\nThe Roswell incident has had a significant impact on popular culture, inspiring numerous books, films, and TV shows.
