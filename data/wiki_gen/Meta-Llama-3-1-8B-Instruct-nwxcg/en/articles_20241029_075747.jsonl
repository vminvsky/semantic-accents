Testate succession is governed by the Wills Act 7 of 1953 and the Succession Act 8 of 1959. These laws provide the framework for executing a valid will, dealing with the testator's capacity, and distributing the estate among the beneficiaries.\n\n**Freedom of Testation**\n\nThe freedom of testation allows individuals to dispose of their estate as they see fit, provided that their will does not contravene the law. However, this freedom is not absolute, and there are several limitations that apply.\n\n### Limitations\n\n#### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nThe law does not permit individuals to make dispositions that are illegal or against public policy. This includes dispositions that are contrary to the principles of natural justice, morality, or public policy. For example, a will that excludes a spouse or child from inheriting is not valid.\n\n#### Subdivision of Agricultural Land\n\nThe Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act 70 of 1970 regulates the subdivision of agricultural land. This act requires that agricultural land be subdivided in accordance with specific rules and regulations. A will that attempts to subdivide agricultural land in contravention of these rules is not valid.\n\n#### Subdivision of Mineral Rights\n\nThe Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 regulates the subdivision of mineral rights.

A will that attempts to subdivide mineral rights in contravention of these rules is not valid.\n\n#### Fideicommissum Multiplex\n\nA fideicommissum multiplex is a bequest that is subject to multiple conditions or limitations. The law requires that these conditions be clearly expressed in the will.

A will that fails to provide for a surviving spouse is not valid.\n\n#### Maintenance and Education of Minor Children\n\nThe law requires that minor children be provided for in the will. This includes provision for their maintenance and education. A will that fails to provide for minor children is not valid.\n\n#### Pension Funds\n\nThe Pension Funds Act 24 of 1956 regulates pension funds. This act requires that pension funds be distributed in accordance with specific rules and regulations. A will that attempts to distribute pension funds in contravention of these rules is not valid.\n\n### Delegation\n\nThe law permits individuals to delegate their decision-making powers to another person. This can include delegating the power to execute a will or to make decisions regarding the distribution of the estate.\n\n### Customary Law\n\nCustomary law applies to individuals who are subject to customary law.

This includes influence that is exerted by another person, such as a family member or a friend.

This includes the use of a certain form, the signing of the will, and the witnessing of the will.\n\n### Requirements for a Testamentary Disposition\n\nA testamentary disposition is a provision in the will that disposes of a specific asset or property. The law requires that these dispositions be clearly expressed in the will.\n\n### Methods of Executing a Valid Will\n\nA will can be executed in several ways, including:\n\n* Writing and signing the will\n* Making a holographic will (a will that is written and signed by the testator)\n* Making a nuncupative will (a will that is made orally and witnessed by two or more people)\n\n### Signing and Signature\n\nA will must be signed by the testator. The signature must be made in the presence of the witnesses.\n\n### Certificate\n\nA certificate is a document that is issued by the Master of the High Court.

(Facebook, Inc.). It was announced in February 2023 and launched on July 5, 2023, as a standalone app for mobile devices. Threads allows users to share text updates, similar to Twitter, but with a focus on longer-form content and a more conversational interface.\n\n## History\n\n### Predecessor\n\nThreads is the successor to Notes, a feature introduced by Instagram in 2017 that allowed users to share longer-form content. However, Notes was not widely adopted and was eventually discontinued. The decision to create Threads was reportedly made in response to the growing popularity of other social media platforms, such as Twitter and Mastodon, which offer similar features.\n\n### Development and announcement\n\nThreads was in development for several months before its announcement in February 2023. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, announced the new app in a post on his Facebook page, stating that it was designed to be a more conversational and interactive alternative to traditional social media platforms. The announcement generated significant interest and curiosity among tech enthusiasts and social media users.\n\n### Launch\n\nThreads launched on July 5, 2023, as a free download for mobile devices. The app was initially available in 100 countries and supported 17 languages. The launch was accompanied by a series of promotional events and social media campaigns to raise awareness and drive user adoption.\n\n## Appearance and features\n\nThreads has a clean and minimalistic design, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The app's interface is centered around a scrolling feed of text updates, similar to Twitter. However, Threads allows users to share longer-form content, up to 500 characters per post, and supports a range of multimedia formats, including images, videos, and links.\n\n### Possibility of open interoperability\n\nOne of the key features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability, allowing users to share content across multiple platforms. In an interview with a leading tech publication, Zuckerberg stated that the company is exploring ways to enable seamless sharing between Threads and other social media platforms.\n\n### Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads allows users to seamlessly integrate their Instagram accounts, enabling them to share content from one platform to the other. This integration has been seen as a key advantage of the new app, making it easier for users to share content and connect with their followers across different platforms.\n\n### Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on both iOS and Android devices, and can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play Store. The app is optimized for mobile devices, with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.\n\n### Censorship attempts\n\nIn the weeks following its launch, Threads faced criticism and censorship attempts from several countries, including China and Iran. The app was blocked in these countries due to concerns over its potential for free speech and open communication.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThreads has a robust advertising system, which allows businesses and brands to reach their target audiences through sponsored content and targeted ads. The app's advertising model is based on a cost-per-click (CPC) model, making it easier for businesses to reach their target audiences.\n\n## Userbase\n\n### Decline in the months after launch\n\nIn the months following its launch, Threads experienced a decline in user adoption and engagement. The app's average daily active users (DAU) decreased by 20% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the previous quarter. This decline was attributed to several factors, including the app's lack of clear direction and purpose, as well as competition from other social media platforms.\n\n### Popularity in Taiwan\n\nDespite its decline in other regions, Threads remains popular in Taiwan, where it has gained a significant following among young users. The app's popularity in Taiwan can be attributed to its ease of use and the fact that it allows users to share content in the Taiwanese language.\n\n## Responses\n\n### Intellectual property dispute\n\nIn September 2023, Threads faced an intellectual property dispute with a rival social media platform, which claimed that the app's name and logo infringed on its trademark. The dispute was eventually resolved through mediation, with Threads agreeing to change its name and logo.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThreads has faced criticism over its data privacy policies, which some have accused of being overly broad and invasive. In response, the app's developers have stated that they are committed to transparency and user control over their data.\n\n### State media\n\nThreads has been criticized by state media outlets for its potential to promote \"fake news\" and \"disinformation.\" In response, the app's developers have stated that they are committed to promoting accurate and trustworthy content.\n\n### Imitating other platforms\n\nThreads has been accused of imitating other social media platforms, including Twitter and Mastodon. In response, the app's developers have stated that they are inspired by these platforms, but are committed to creating a unique and innovative user experience.\n\n## See also\n\n* Social media\n* Social networking\n* Online communities\n* User-generated content\n* Content sharing\n\n## Further reading\n\n* \"Threads: A New Social Media Platform from Meta\" (2023)\n* \"The Future of Social Media: An Interview with Mark Zuckerberg\" (2023)\n* \"Threads: A Review of the App's Features and Functionality\" (2023)\n\n## External links\n\n* Official website of Threads\n* Threads on Twitter\n* Threads on Instagram", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Threads_(social_network)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Predecessor\n##Development and announcement\n##Launch\n#Appearance and features\n##Possibility of open interoperability\n##Account integration with Instagram\n##Device compatibility\n##Censorship attempts\n##Advertising\n#Userbase\n##Decline in the months after launch\n##Popularity in Taiwan\n#Responses\n##Intellectual property dispute\n##Data privacy\n##State media\n##Imitating other platforms\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Naru lives with her tribe, which is constantly under attack by a rival tribe. One day, a strange and terrifying creature, known as the Yautja, arrives in the tribe's hunting grounds. The Yautja is a technologically advanced alien species that has been hunting humans for sport. Naru must use her skills and ingenuity to protect her tribe from the Yautja and its deadly technology.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Amber Midthunder as Naru\n* Dakota Beavers as Taabe\n* Dane DiLiegro as Gronk\n* Storm Reid as Ute\n* Colson Baker as Kwar\n* Michelle Thrush as Tainee\n* Julian Black Antelope as Thor\n* Rory Culkin as Noland\n\nProduction\n-----------\n\n### Development and casting\n\nThe film was in development for several years before production began.

The story revolves around Lakhminder (Akshay Kumar), a young man from a wealthy family who is deeply devoted to his sister, Durga (Bhumi Pednekar). Despite their family's wealth and status, Lakhminder's family is forced to flee their home in Lahore due to the partition violence. The siblings' bond is tested as they face numerous challenges and hardships during their journey to India.\n\nLakhminder's family is also joined by a Muslim army officer, Major Khan (Jackie Shroff), who is tasked with protecting them from the rioters. As they navigate through the treacherous landscape, Lakhminder and Durga find solace in each other's company, and their bond grows stronger.

The film's trailer was released in July 2017, and it received a positive response from audiences.\n\n# Controversy\n\nRaksha Bandhan faced controversy in August 2017, when the film's director, Ananth Mahadevan, was accused of making derogatory comments about the Sikh community. Mahadevan denied the allegations, stating that his comments were taken out of context and that he was committed to promoting interfaith understanding.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nRaksha Bandhan was released on August 11, 2017, in India and other countries.

The tournament was organized by the World Chess Federation (FIDE) and served as a qualification event for the 2022 World Chess Championship.\n\n**Participants**\n\nThe tournament featured eight participants, who qualified through various methods.\n\n### Qualification of Radjabov\n\nTeimour Radjabov, an Azerbaijani grandmaster, qualified for the tournament as the winner of the 2021 FIDE World Cup. Radjabov defeated Radosław Wojtaszek in the final of the tournament, winning the match with a score of 3.5-0.5. This was Radjabov's first appearance in the Candidates Tournament.\n\n### Disqualification of Karjakin\n\nSergey Karjakin, a Russian grandmaster, was originally scheduled to participate in the tournament. However, due to a doping ban imposed by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, Karjakin was disqualified from the tournament. Karjakin had served a 16-month suspension for a doping offense in 2018 and was not eligible to participate in FIDE events until his ban was lifted.\n\n### Qualification of Ding Liren\n\nDing Liren, a Chinese grandmaster, qualified for the tournament as the winner of the 2021 FIDE Grand Prix. Ding defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi in the final of the tournament, winning the match with a score of 3.5-0.5. Ding had previously won the 2020 Candidates Tournament and was seeking to qualify for the World Chess Championship for the second time.\n\n**Organization**\n\nThe tournament was organized by FIDE and the Madrid Chess Club. The tournament was played under the FIDE Laws of Chess and the FIDE Tournament Rules.\n\n### Regulations\n\nThe tournament was a round-robin event, with each player competing against every other player. The tournament was played over 14 rounds, with the winner being the player with the highest score at the end of the tournament. In the event of a tie, the winner was determined by the FIDE tiebreak rules.\n\nThe tournament had a rating floor of 2800, and players with a rating below this threshold were not eligible to participate. The tournament also had a time control of 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 50 minutes for the next 20 moves, and then 15 minutes for the remainder of the game, with a 30-second increment per move.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe tournament was won by Ding Liren, who scored 8.5 points out of 14.

The film serves as a sequel to Black Panther (2018) and the 29th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The movie continues to explore the rich culture and traditions of the fictional African nation of Wakanda, while delving deeper into the complexities of grief, identity, and power.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place after the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019) and follows King T'Challa's sister, Shuri, as she navigates the challenges of leading Wakanda in the wake of her brother's death. The story introduces Namor, the anti-heroic king of the underwater kingdom of Talokan, who seeks to protect his people from the threats of the surface world. As tensions rise between Wakanda and Talokan, Shuri must confront her own grief and uncertainty, while also facing the challenges of her new role as queen.\n\nMeanwhile, the film explores the complex relationships between the characters, particularly the bond between Shuri and her sister, Ramonda, as they struggle to come to terms with the loss of their loved one. The movie also delves into the themes of identity, as Shuri grapples with her own sense of purpose and belonging in a world that is rapidly changing.\n\nThroughout the film, the action sequences are fast-paced and visually stunning, with a blend of traditional African aesthetics and cutting-edge technology. The movie's score, composed by Ludwig Göransson, is a beautiful and haunting tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, who played T'Challa in the original film.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an all-star cast, including:\n\n* Letitia Wright as Shuri\n* Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia\n* Danai Gurira as Okoye\n* Winston Duke as M'Baku\n* Angela Bassett as Ramonda\n* Tenoch Huerta as Namor\n* Dominique Thorne as Riri Williams\n* Michaela Coel as Aneka\n* Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross\n\n**Production**\n\n**Development**\n\nThe idea for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever was first conceived in 2019, shortly after the release of Avengers: Endgame. Ryan Coogler, who had directed the original Black Panther, was approached by Marvel Studios to develop a sequel that would explore the themes and characters introduced in the first film.\n\nCoogler worked closely with the Marvel Studios team to develop the script, which would eventually become the foundation of the film. The story was influenced by Coogler's own experiences as a black man in America, as well as his love of African culture and history.\n\n**Pre-production**\n\nPre-production for the film began in 2020, with Coogler and his team working on the script and developing the storyboards. The film's visual effects were also a major focus during this period, with the team working to create a blend of live-action and CGI elements that would bring the world of Wakanda to life.\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography for the film took place in Atlanta, Georgia, and Mexico, from March to October 2021. The film's production was marked by several challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the death of Chadwick Boseman, who had been cast as T'Challa in the original film.\n\nDespite these challenges, the film's cast and crew worked tirelessly to bring the story to life, with Coogler pushing the boundaries of what was possible in terms of action, drama, and visual effects.\n\n**Post-production**\n\nPost-production for the film was a long and complex process, involving several months of editing, visual effects, and sound design. The film's visual effects were created by a team of artists and technicians at Marvel Studios, who worked to bring the world of Wakanda to life in a way that was both authentic and visually stunning.\n\nThe film's score, composed by Ludwig Göransson, was also a major focus during post-production, with Göransson working closely with Coogler to create a soundtrack that would complement the film's themes and action sequences.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was composed by Ludwig Göransson, who had previously worked with Coogler on the original Black Panther. The score is a beautiful and haunting tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, who played T'Challa in the original film.\n\nThe film's soundtrack features a blend of traditional African music and contemporary electronic elements, with Göransson working closely with Coogler to create a soundtrack that would complement the film's themes and action sequences.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever was a major focus for Marvel Studios, with the team working to create a sense of excitement and anticipation around the film's release.\n\nThe film's trailer, released in September 2022, was a major hit, with millions of views on social media and YouTube. The trailer featured a blend of action, drama, and visual effects, with a focus on the film's themes of identity, power, and grief.\n\n**Release**\n\n**Theatrical**\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever was released in theaters on November 11, 2022, in the United States and other countries. The film was distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and was released in IMAX, 3D, and standard formats.\n\n**Home media**\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms, including Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, and Google Play, on December 13, 2022. The film was later released on Blu-ray and DVD on January 31, 2023.\n\n**Reception**\n\n**Box office**\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever was a major commercial success, grossing over $1.4 billion at the global box office.

These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures. The effects of climate change are far-reaching and varied, impacting different aspects of the environment, human health, and economies.\n\n**Changes in Temperature**\n\nOne of the most notable effects of climate change is the increase in global temperatures. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century. This warming trend is expected to continue, with projections suggesting an additional 2-5°C rise by the end of this century.\n\n**Weather**\n\nClimate change has significant impacts on weather patterns, leading to more frequent and intense extreme weather events.\n\n### Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes\n\nHeat waves are becoming more frequent and prolonged, particularly in urban areas. This can lead to increased mortality, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. Temperature extremes can also have devastating impacts on crops, infrastructure, and ecosystems.\n\n### Rain\n\nChanges in precipitation patterns are also a key impact of climate change. Some regions are experiencing more frequent and intense rainfall events, while others are experiencing droughts. This can lead to flooding, landslides, and other hazards.\n\n### Extreme Storms\n\nExtreme storms, such as hurricanes and typhoons, are becoming more intense and frequent due to climate change. These storms can cause widespread destruction, displacement, and loss of life.\n\n**Land**\n\nClimate change has significant impacts on land ecosystems and human settlements.\n\n### Floods\n\nFloods are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change. This can lead to displacement, loss of infrastructure, and damage to crops and ecosystems.\n\n### Droughts\n\nDroughts are also becoming more frequent and prolonged, particularly in regions with limited water resources. This can lead to water scarcity, crop failures, and food insecurity.\n\n### Wildfires\n\nWildfires are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, particularly in regions with dry vegetation. This can lead to loss of life, property damage, and air quality impacts.\n\n**Oceans**\n\nClimate change has significant impacts on the world's oceans.\n\n### Sea Level Rise\n\nSea level rise is a key impact of climate change, with global sea levels projected to rise by up to 1 meter by 2100. This can lead to coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.\n\n**Ice and Snow**\n\nClimate change is causing significant changes to ice and snow cover worldwide.\n\n### Glaciers Decline\n\nGlaciers are melting at an alarming rate, particularly in the Arctic and Antarctica. This can lead to sea level rise, changes in ocean currents, and impacts on global weather patterns.\n\n### Ice Sheets Decline\n\nIce sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are also melting at an alarming rate, contributing to sea level rise and changes in global weather patterns.\n\n### Sea Ice Decline\n\nSea ice in the Arctic is declining at an alarming rate, particularly in the summer months. This can lead to changes in ocean currents, impacts on global weather patterns, and increased access to shipping and resource extraction.\n\n### Permafrost Thawing\n\nPermafrost is also thawing at an alarming rate, particularly in the Arctic. This can lead to the release of methane and other greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change.\n\n**Wildlife and Nature**\n\nClimate change has significant impacts on ecosystems and wildlife populations.\n\n### Ecosystems on Land\n\nEcosystems on land are being disrupted by climate change, leading to changes in species composition, distribution, and abundance. This can lead to loss of biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human well-being.\n\n### Marine Ecosystems\n\nMarine ecosystems are also being impacted by climate change, particularly through ocean acidification, warming, and changes in ocean currents. This can lead to changes in species composition, distribution, and abundance, as well as impacts on fisheries, coastal ecosystems, and human well-being.\n\n**Tipping Points and Irreversible Impacts**\n\nClimate change has the potential to trigger tipping points, leading to irreversible impacts on the environment, human health, and economies.\n\n**Health, Food Security, and Water Security**\n\nClimate change has significant impacts on human health, food security, and water security.\n\n### Health\n\nClimate change can lead to increased mortality, morbidity, and disease outbreaks, particularly in vulnerable populations.\n\n### Food Security\n\nClimate change can lead to crop failures, reduced crop yields, and food insecurity, particularly in regions with limited agricultural resources.\n\n### Water Security\n\nClimate change can lead to water scarcity, droughts, and changes in water quality, particularly in regions with limited water resources.\n\n**Human Settlements**\n\nClimate change has significant impacts on human settlements, particularly in low-lying coastal regions and areas with limited infrastructure.\n\n### Impacts from Heat\n\nHeat waves can lead to increased mortality, morbidity, and displacement, particularly in urban areas.\n\n### Low-Lying Coastal Regions\n\nLow-lying coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, flooding, and saltwater intrusion, leading to displacement, loss of infrastructure, and damage to ecosystems.\n\n**Impacts on Societies**\n\nClimate change has significant impacts on societies, particularly on vulnerable populations and communities.\n\n### Displacement and Migration\n\nClimate change can lead to displacement, migration, and refugee crises, particularly in regions with limited resources and infrastructure.\n\n### Conflict\n\nClimate change can lead to increased conflict over resources, particularly in regions with limited resources and infrastructure.\n\n### Social Impacts on Vulnerable Groups\n\nClimate change can lead to increased social and economic vulnerability, particularly among indigenous populations, women, and children.\n\n### Possibility of Societal Collapse\n\nClimate change has the potential to lead to societal collapse, particularly in regions with limited resources, infrastructure, and resilience.\n\n**Economic Impacts**\n\nClimate change has significant economic impacts, particularly on industries and sectors with high greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Economic Inequality\n\nClimate change can exacerbate economic inequality, particularly in regions with limited resources and infrastructure.\n\n### Highly Affected Sectors\n\nClimate change has significant impacts on highly affected sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and energy.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **Climate Change Mitigation**\n* **Climate Change Adaptation**\n* **Renewable Energy**\n* **Sustainable Development**\n* **Ecosystem Services**\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include citations or references.

She was the longest-reigning British monarch in history, serving for over 70 years.\n\n#Early life\n\nElizabeth Alexandra Mary was born on April 21, 1926, in London, England, to Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). She was the first child of the couple and had one younger sister, Princess Margaret. Elizabeth's early life was marked by a series of family tragedies, including the death of her paternal grandfather, King George V, in 1936, and the abdication of her uncle, King Edward VIII, later that year.\n\nElizabeth's education was overseen by her mother, who ensured that her daughter received a comprehensive education, including instruction in history, language, and music. Elizabeth also developed a strong interest in animals, particularly dogs, and was an accomplished horse rider. Her childhood was also marked by the outbreak of World War II, which had a profound impact on the British monarchy and the country as a whole.\n\n#Heir presumptive\n\nElizabeth was born into a world where her uncle, Edward, Prince of Wales, was the heir apparent. However, Edward's decision to abdicate the throne in 1936, and his subsequent marriage to Wallis Simpson, led to his brother, Albert, becoming the new heir apparent. Elizabeth's mother, Elizabeth, Duchess of York, became the new queen consort, and Elizabeth became the heir presumptive.\n\n##Second World War\n\nElizabeth's role as heir presumptive was tested during World War II, when she was tasked with undertaking various royal duties, including visiting troops and factories, and inspecting air raid shelters. Her experiences during this time had a profound impact on her, and she developed a strong sense of duty and responsibility. In 1944, Elizabeth joined the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service, where she learned to drive and repair military trucks.\n\n##Marriage\n\nElizabeth married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on November 20, 1947, at Westminster Abbey. The couple had four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. Elizabeth's marriage to Philip was a long and happy one, and the couple remained together until Philip's death in 2021.\n\n#Reign\n\n##Accession and coronation\n\nElizabeth ascended to the throne on February 6, 1952, following the death of her father, King George VI. She was crowned queen on June 2, 1953, in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey. The coronation was a grand affair, with Elizabeth wearing a stunning coronation gown and being crowned with the Imperial State Crown.\n\n##Early reign\n\nElizabeth's early reign was marked by a series of challenges, including the Suez Crisis in 1956 and the decolonization of Africa and Asia. She also faced criticism for her handling of the Royal Family's finances, which were criticized for being out of touch with the economic realities of the time.\n\n##Political reforms and crises\n\nElizabeth faced several major crises during her reign, including the Suez Crisis in 1956, the Aberfan disaster in 1966, and the Falklands War in 1982. She also faced criticism for her handling of the Royal Family's finances, which were criticized for being out of touch with the economic realities of the time.\n\n##Perils and dissent\n\nElizabeth faced several major perils during her reign, including the IRA bombing campaign in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Lockerbie bombing in 1988. She also faced criticism for her handling of the Royal Family's finances, which were criticized for being out of touch with the economic realities of the time.\n\n##Turbulent years\n\nElizabeth's reign was marked by a series of turbulent years, including the miners' strike in 1984-1985, and the Poll Tax riots in 1990. She also faced criticism for her handling of the Royal Family's finances, which were criticized for being out of touch with the economic realities of the time.\n\n##Dawn of the new millennium\n\nElizabeth marked the dawn of the new millennium with a series of events, including a Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace, and a tour of the Commonwealth. She also marked the 50th anniversary of her accession to the throne with a series of events, including a tour of the UK and a private visit to South Africa.\n\n##Diamond Jubilee and milestones\n\nElizabeth marked her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 with a series of events, including a tour of the UK, and a private visit to the Falkland Islands. She also celebrated her 60th wedding anniversary with Prince Philip in 2017, and marked the 60th anniversary of her accession to the throne in 2012.\n\n##Pandemic and widowhood\n\nElizabeth faced a series of challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the closure of Buckingham Palace, and the cancellation of several royal engagements. She also faced the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in 2021, and the subsequent period of mourning.\n\n##Platinum Jubilee and beyond\n\nElizabeth marked her Platinum Jubilee in 2022 with a series of events, including a tour of the UK, and a private visit to Northern Ireland. She also celebrated her 70th wedding anniversary with Prince Philip, although she did so in private.\n\n#Death\n\nElizabeth II died on September 8, 2022, at the age of 96, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Her death was announced by Buckingham Palace, and she was succeeded by her son, Charles, Prince of Wales.\n\n#Legacy\n\nElizabeth's legacy is complex and multifaceted. She was a dedicated public servant, who served the British people for over 70 years. She was also a patron of the arts, and a supporter of charitable causes. Her commitment to the Commonwealth was a defining feature of her reign, and she played a key role in promoting British interests around the world.\n\n##Beliefs, activities, and interests\n\nElizabeth was a devout Christian, and her faith played an important role in her life and reign. She was also an accomplished horse rider, and enjoyed dogs.

The scheme proposes to attract young and skilled individuals to join the armed forces on a short-term basis, with a four-year tenure, followed by a period of three years of mandatory reserve service.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been grappling with issues related to recruitment, infrastructure, and modernization for several years. The government sought to revamp the recruitment process to make it more efficient, cost-effective, and technologically advanced. The Agnipath Scheme was conceptualized to address these challenges and provide an opportunity for young individuals to serve in the armed forces and gain valuable skills and experience.\n\n# Overview\n\nUnder the Agnipath Scheme, the recruitment process will be based on a 'One Rank, One Pension' (OROP) system, where individuals will be recruited as Agniveers, with a four-year tenure. During this period, they will undergo training and be deployed on various military operations, with opportunities for promotion and career advancement. After completing their four-year tenure, Agniveers will be eligible for a one-time tax-free gratuity, a non-contributory life insurance cover of ₹11 lakhs, and a skills-based employment assistance package.\n\nThe scheme proposes to reduce the financial burden on the government by providing a one-time package to Agniveers who opt out of the service after completing their four-year tenure. This package includes a lump sum amount, a non-contributory life insurance cover, and a skills-based employment assistance package. Agniveers who choose to continue their service beyond their initial four-year tenure will be eligible for a one-time bonus and a 25% increase in their basic pay.\n\n# Reservation and welfare benefits\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme proposes to provide reservation benefits to eligible candidates, including:\n\n*   10% reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS)\n*   10% reservation for wards of serving and retired defence personnel\n*   5% reservation for wards of ex-servicemen\n*   5% reservation for wards of SC/ST candidates\n*   5% reservation for wards of OBC candidates\n\nIn addition, the scheme proposes to provide various welfare benefits to Agniveers, including:\n\n*   A non-contributory life insurance cover of ₹11 lakhs\n*   A one-time tax-free gratuity\n*   Skills-based employment assistance package\n*   A one-time bonus for Agniveers who choose to continue their service beyond their initial four-year tenure\n\n## Criticism\n\n### By political parties and activists\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has faced criticism from various political parties and activists, who have raised concerns about the scheme's implications for the Indian Armed Forces and the country's national security.

It is a variation of the bit tree and is also known as a binary indexed tree or a cart tree. The data structure is named after its creator, Peter Fenwick.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nIn many applications, it is necessary to compute the prefix sum of an array, which is the sum of all elements up to a given index. The Fenwick tree provides a way to update and query the prefix sum of an array in O(log n) time, where n is the size of the array. This is a significant improvement over the naive approach of recomputing the prefix sum from scratch, which would take O(n) time.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThe Fenwick tree was originally designed to solve a particular problem in digital signal processing, where it was necessary to compute the sum of all bits in a binary image up to a given point. The data structure was later generalized to work with arrays of arbitrary numbers, and it has since become a widely used tool in many areas of computer science.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThe Fenwick tree consists of three main components: the interrogation tree, the update tree, and the search tree.\n\nThe interrogation tree\n--------------------\n\nThe interrogation tree is used to compute the prefix sum of an array. It is a binary tree where each node represents a range of indices in the array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a subset of the indices represented by its parent node. The nodes are labeled with the sum of the prefix of the array up to the given index.\n\nThe interrogation tree is constructed by iterating through the array and adding each element to the sum of its parent node. The leaf nodes of the tree represent the individual elements of the array.\n\nThe update tree\n----------------\n\nThe update tree is used to update the prefix sum of an array. It is a binary tree where each node represents a range of indices in the array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a subset of the indices represented by its parent node. The nodes are labeled with the difference between the current value of the prefix sum and the previous value of the prefix sum.\n\nThe update tree is constructed by iterating through the array and adding each element to the difference of its parent node. The leaf nodes of the tree represent the individual elements of the array.\n\nThe search tree\n-----------------\n\nThe search tree is used to query the prefix sum of an array. It is a binary tree where each node represents a range of indices in the array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a subset of the indices represented by its parent node. The nodes are labeled with the sum of the prefix of the array up to the given index.\n\nThe search tree is constructed by iterating through the array and adding each element to the sum of its parent node. The leaf nodes of the tree represent the individual elements of the array.\n\nPseudocode\n-----------\n\n### Construction\n\nThe construction of the Fenwick tree can be done using the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction construct_fenwick_tree(arr):\n    n = length(arr)\n    tree = new array of size n + 1\n    for i from 1 to n:\n        tree[i] = arr[i - 1]\n        for j from i + (i & -i) to i:\n            tree[j] += tree[j - (j & -j)]\n    return tree\n```\n\nThis pseudocode constructs the Fenwick tree by iterating through the array and adding each element to the sum of its parent node. The leaf nodes of the tree represent the individual elements of the array.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Binary indexed tree\n* Cart tree\n* Digital signal processing\n* Data structure\n* Algorithm\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\n* Wikipedia: Fenwick tree", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fenwick_tree\" following this outline:\n\n#Motivation\n#Description\n##The interrogation tree\n##The update tree\n##The search tree\n#Pseudocode\n##Construction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Robert Oppenheimer**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was a prominent American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, the secret research and development project that produced the atomic bomb during World War II. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.\n\n**Early life**\n\n### Childhood and education\n\nJulius Robert Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer. His father was a textile importer, and the family was of Jewish German descent. Oppenheimer's early life was marked by a strong interest in science and mathematics, which was encouraged by his parents. He attended the Ethical Culture Society School in New York City, where he excelled academically and developed a passion for chemistry and physics.\n\nIn 1921, Oppenheimer enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied chemistry and physics. He graduated in 1925 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and then traveled to Europe to continue his studies. Oppenheimer spent several years at the University of Cambridge, the University of Göttingen, and the University of Munich, where he worked under the guidance of prominent physicists such as J.J. Thomson and Max Born.\n\n### Studies in Europe\n\nOppenheimer's time in Europe had a profound impact on his scientific development. He was exposed to the latest research and ideas in physics, and he began to develop his own research interests in quantum mechanics and relativity. In 1927, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and began teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a rising star in the physics community.\n\n**Early career**\n\n### Teaching\n\nIn 1929, Oppenheimer was appointed as a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught theoretical physics. He quickly gained a reputation for his teaching skills and his ability to communicate complex scientific ideas to his students. In 1934, Oppenheimer was appointed as a professor of theoretical physics at Berkeley, and he became one of the leading figures in American physics.\n\n### Scientific work\n\nOppenheimer's scientific work during the 1930s focused on the development of quantum mechanics and the study of relativity. He made significant contributions to the understanding of electron spin, the behavior of particles at high energies, and the nature of black holes. In 1935, Oppenheimer published a paper on the \"Theory of the Atom,\" which provided a comprehensive overview of the latest research in atomic physics.\n\n**Private and political life**\n\n### Politics\n\nOppenheimer was a vocal advocate for liberal politics and was an active supporter of the Democratic Party. In 1936, he attended the Democratic National Convention, where he met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other prominent Democrats. Oppenheimer's politics were shaped by his experiences as a Jew in Nazi Germany and his concern about the rise of fascism in Europe.\n\n### Relationships and children\n\nIn 1940, Oppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen, a Russian-born actress, and the couple had two children, Toni and Peter. The marriage was marked by turmoil and infidelity, and the couple eventually divorced in 1949.\n\n### Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was deeply interested in mysticism and the nature of consciousness. He was fascinated by the concept of the Bhagavad Gita and the philosophy of Hinduism. In his later years, Oppenheimer became increasingly interested in the spiritual dimensions of science and the human experience.\n\n**Manhattan Project**\n\n### Los Alamos\n\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development project that aimed to produce the atomic bomb. He was tasked with leading a team of scientists and engineers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where they worked on the development of the bomb.\n\n### Bomb design\n\nOppenheimer played a crucial role in the design of the atomic bomb, working closely with other scientists such as Enrico Fermi and Ernest Lawrence. He was involved in the development of the first nuclear reactor and the design of the first atomic bomb, which was tested at Trinity Site in 1945.\n\n### Trinity\n\nOn July 16, 1945, Oppenheimer witnessed the first nuclear test, known as Trinity, at Alamogordo, New Mexico. He famously described the event as \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds,\" quoting the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n**Postwar activities**\n\n### Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter the war, Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where he continued to work on the development of quantum field theory. He was also a vocal advocate for the development of nuclear energy and the control of nuclear proliferation.\n\n### Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he played a crucial role in shaping the commission's policies on nuclear energy and nuclear proliferation.\n\n### Panels and study groups\n\nOppenheimer was a member of several panels and study groups, including the National Academy of Sciences and the Science Advisory Committee to the President. He was also a vocal advocate for the development of the nation's scientific and technological capabilities.\n\n### Security hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was subjected to a security hearing by the Atomic Energy Commission, which accused him of being a security risk due to his past associations with communist sympathizers. The hearing was a public relations disaster for Oppenheimer, and he was eventually stripped of his security clearance.\n\n**Final years**\n\n### Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to nuclear research and his leadership in the development of the atomic bomb.\n\n**Death**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, due to throat cancer. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, and his contributions to the development of quantum mechanics and relativity are still studied and debated by scientists today. His leadership in the Manhattan Project and his role in the development of the atomic bomb have had a profound impact on the world and on the course of human history.\n\n**Publications**\n\nOppenheimer published numerous papers and articles on physics and politics during his lifetime. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n* \"On the Quantum Theory of the Atom\" (1935)\n* \"The Theory of the Atom\" (1936)\n* \"The Science of the Atom\" (1940)\n* \"The Development of Quantum Mechanics\" (1947)\n* \"The Politics of Science\" (1954)\n\n**Notes**\n\nOppenheimer's papers and correspondence are held at the Library of Congress and the Center for History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including Oppenheimer's own writings and correspondence, as well as biographies and histories of the Manhattan Project.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* Heilbroner, Robert L.

Throughout the post-World War II era, Finland has maintained a delicate balance between its commitment to neutrality and its desire to maintain good relations with its Western neighbors.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n\nFollowing World War II, Finland found itself in a unique position. Having fought against the Soviet Union in the Continuation War, Finland was forced to cede significant territory and accept a peace treaty that limited its sovereignty. In order to maintain its independence, Finland adopted a policy of neutrality, which would remain a cornerstone of its foreign policy for the next several decades.\n\n### 1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n\nDuring the early years of the Cold War, Finland's neutrality was put to the test as it navigated a complex web of alliances and rivalries between the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. Finland's proximity to the Soviet Union and its reliance on Soviet trade and economic assistance made it vulnerable to Soviet pressure. In 1948, Finland signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union, which further solidified its neutrality.\n\nDespite its neutrality, Finland's relations with the Western powers remained warm. Finland was a founding member of the Nordic Council and cooperated closely with other Nordic countries on issues of trade, defense, and security. Finland also maintained a strong relationship with the United States, which provided significant economic and military aid to the country.\n\n### 1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point in Finland's relations with NATO. With the Soviet Union's demise, Finland's security situation changed dramatically, and the country began to reevaluate its relationship with the Western alliance. In 1992, Finland signed the Partnership for Peace (PfP) agreement with NATO, which marked the beginning of a closer relationship between Finland and the alliance.\n\nDuring this period, Finland also began to expand its cooperation with other European countries, including Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. Finland's participation in the European Union's (EU) Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the European Economic Area (EEA) further strengthened its ties to the European mainland.\n\n### 1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, Finland's foreign policy underwent a significant shift. With its EU membership in 1995, Finland became part of a larger European community, which provided a framework for cooperation and integration. Finland's EU membership also led to increased cooperation with other EU member states, particularly in areas such as trade, security, and defense.\n\nIn 2008, Finland participated in the Czech Republic's presidency of the EU, which marked a significant milestone in Finland's EU integration. Finland's participation in EU-led missions and operations, such as the EUFOR Althea mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, also demonstrated its commitment to EU foreign policy.\n\n### 2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which marked a significant turning point in Finland's relations with NATO. In the aftermath of the invasion, Finland's government announced its intention to apply for NATO membership, citing concerns about national security and the need for closer cooperation with other European countries.\n\nIn May 2022, Finland and Sweden submitted their joint application for NATO membership, which was hailed as a significant step towards greater European security and cooperation. The accession process was marked by a series of meetings and negotiations between Finland, Sweden, and NATO member states, including Turkey.\n\nIn June 2022, the Finnish parliament voted in favor of NATO membership, marking a significant milestone in the country's accession process. In April 2023, Finland's parliament approved the NATO Accession Protocol, paving the way for Finland's membership in the alliance.\n\n**Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states**\n\nFinland's relations with other NATO member states have been characterized by close cooperation and coordination. Finland has participated in a range of NATO-led operations and missions, including the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan and the NATO-led Operation Allied Force in Kosovo.\n\nFinland has also maintained close relations with other Nordic countries, including Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. Finland's participation in the Nordic Council and the Nordic Cooperation on Defense and Security (NORDCO) has facilitated cooperation and coordination on issues of defense and security.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Finland–Russia relations\n* Finland–European Union relations\n* NATO enlargement\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any references or citations)\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n(Note: This article does not include a bibliography)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Finland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* NATO's website on Finland's accession process", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Finland–NATO_relations\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n##1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n###1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n###1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n###1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n###2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n####February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n####May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n####June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n##2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n#Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The term has been used to describe various medical procedures, including abortion, euthanasia, and other clandestine medical interventions.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe use of euphemisms to describe medical procedures that are not sanctioned by the law or medical establishment has a long history. In many cases, these euphemisms have been used to avoid detection by authorities or to conceal the true nature of the procedure from patients or their families.\n\n### \"The thing that had no name\"\n\nIn the 1960s, the term \"the thing that had no name\" was used by activists and medical professionals to refer to the underground abortion movement in the United States. This term was used to describe the clandestine and often deadly procedures that were performed by unlicensed practitioners, as well as the secretive and often coercive nature of the procedures themselves.\n\n### Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n\nThe use of euphemisms to describe abortion has been a common practice in many countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, the term \"termination of pregnancy\" has been used to describe abortion, while in Australia, the term \"termination of a pregnancy\" is often used. In some cases, these euphemisms have been used to avoid detection by authorities or to conceal the true nature of the procedure from patients or their families.\n\n**Law**\n\nIn many countries, the law prohibits or heavily restricts certain medical procedures, such as abortion and euthanasia. In these cases, the use of euphemisms can be seen as a way to circumvent the law and avoid detection by authorities. However, the use of euphemisms can also be seen as a way to challenge or subvert the law, particularly in cases where the law is seen as unjust or inhumane.\n\n**Art**\n\nThe use of euphemisms in art can be seen as a way to challenge or subvert societal norms and expectations. In the context of medical procedures, euphemisms can be used to create a sense of ambiguity or uncertainty, which can be a powerful tool for artistic expression.\n\n### Film\n\nIn film, euphemisms are often used to create a sense of tension or suspense. For example, in the 1994 film \"The Piano,\" the character Ada McGrath is forced to undergo a clandestine abortion, which is referred to as \"the thing that had no name.\" This use of euphemism creates a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, which is a key element of the film's themes.\n\n### Television\n\nIn television, euphemisms are often used to create a sense of realism or authenticity. For example, in the 2013 TV series \"The Americans,\" the characters use euphemisms to refer to their clandestine activities, such as \"the thing that had no name\" to refer to an abortion. This use of euphemism creates a sense of realism and authenticity, which is a key element of the show's themes.\n\n### Sculpture\n\nIn sculpture, euphemisms can be used to create a sense of ambiguity or uncertainty. For example, the 1990s sculptor Rachel Whiteread created a series of sculptures that referred to the human body in a way that was both explicit and implicit. In one sculpture, she created a cast of a fetus, which was referred to as \"the thing that had no name.\" This use of euphemism creates a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, which is a key element of the sculpture's themes.\n\n### Fiction\n\nIn fiction, euphemisms are often used to create a sense of ambiguity or uncertainty. For example, in the 2010 novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" by Margaret Atwood, the character Offred is forced to undergo a clandestine abortion, which is referred to as \"the thing that had no name.\" This use of euphemism creates a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, which is a key element of the novel's themes.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of euphemisms to describe medical procedures that are not sanctioned by the law or medical establishment has a long history. From the 1960s underground abortion movement to modern-day fiction and art, euphemisms have been used to create a sense of ambiguity or uncertainty, which can be a powerful tool for artistic expression and social commentary.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Illegal_operation_(euphemism)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background\n##\"The thing that had no name\"\n##Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n#Law\n#Art\n##Film\n##Television\n##Sculpture\n##Fiction\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

SRM technologies, such as injecting aerosols into the stratosphere or using mirrors in space to reflect sunlight, are being researched and debated as potential tools for mitigating climate change.\n\n**Emission Trends and Pledges**\n\nGlobal greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise over the past few decades, with the highest emissions coming from the energy sector. To mitigate climate change, significant reductions in emissions are necessary. The following sections discuss the needed emissions cuts and the pledges made by countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Needed Emissions Cuts\n\nStudies have shown that to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050. This requires a drastic reduction in fossil fuel use and a significant increase in the use of low-carbon energy sources.\n\n### Pledges\n\nCountries have made various pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, including the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The agreement encourages countries to submit their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which outline their emissions reduction targets and actions.\n\n**Low-Carbon Energy**\n\nLow-carbon energy is a critical component of climate change mitigation efforts. The following sections discuss the different types of low-carbon energy sources and their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Solar and Wind Energy\n\nSolar and wind energy are two of the most promising low-carbon energy sources. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems convert sunlight into electricity, while wind turbines convert wind energy into electricity. These technologies have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels, making them an attractive option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Other Renewables\n\nIn addition to solar and wind energy, other low-carbon energy sources include hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass energy. These technologies have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide energy security, particularly in regions with abundant renewable resources.\n\n### Integrating Variable Renewable Energy\n\nVariable renewable energy sources like solar and wind power can be integrated into the grid through a variety of technologies, including energy storage systems and smart grids. These technologies enable the efficient and reliable integration of variable renewable energy sources, reducing the need for fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Nuclear Power\n\nNuclear power is a low-carbon energy source that can provide a significant portion of the world's electricity. Nuclear power plants generate electricity through nuclear fission, a process that releases energy from the splitting of atomic nuclei. While nuclear power has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it also poses significant safety and waste management concerns.\n\n### Replacing Coal with Natural Gas\n\nNatural gas is a fossil fuel that can be used to generate electricity and heat. Replacing coal with natural gas can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as natural gas emits less CO2 per unit of energy produced than coal. However, natural gas production and transportation can also release methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.\n\n**Demand Reduction**\n\nDemand reduction refers to the strategies and technologies used to reduce energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The following sections discuss the different approaches to demand reduction.\n\n### Energy Conservation and Efficiency\n\nEnergy conservation and efficiency measures can reduce energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions. These measures include improving building insulation, installing energy-efficient lighting and appliances, and optimizing energy usage in industries.\n\n### Lifestyle Changes\n\nLifestyle changes, such as reducing air travel, driving electric or hybrid vehicles, and using public transportation, can also contribute to demand reduction and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Dietary Change\n\nDietary changes, such as reducing meat consumption and adopting plant-based diets, can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Animal agriculture is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane and nitrous oxide.\n\n### Family Size\n\nFamily size can also impact greenhouse gas emissions. Larger families tend to consume more energy and resources, leading to higher greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Preserving and Enhancing Carbon Sinks**\n\nCarbon sinks are natural systems that absorb and store CO2 from the atmosphere. Preserving and enhancing carbon sinks can help mitigate climate change by reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\n### Forests\n\nForests are a critical carbon sink, as they absorb CO2 through photosynthesis and store it in trees and other biomass. Forest conservation and reforestation efforts can help preserve and enhance this carbon sink.\n\n#### Conservation\n\nConserving forests can help preserve the carbon sink function, as well as provide habitat for biodiversity and support local communities.\n\n#### Afforestation and Reforestation\n\nAfforestation and reforestation efforts involve planting new trees in areas where forests have been degraded or cleared. These efforts can help restore the carbon sink function and provide other ecosystem benefits.\n\n### Soils\n\nSoils can also act as a carbon sink, as they absorb and store CO2 through processes like photosynthesis and microbial decomposition. Soil conservation and management practices can help preserve and enhance this carbon sink.\n\n### Wetlands\n\nWetlands are also a critical carbon sink, as they absorb and store CO2 through processes like photosynthesis and decomposition. Wetland conservation and restoration efforts can help preserve and enhance this carbon sink.\n\n### Deep Ocean\n\nThe deep ocean is a significant carbon sink, as it absorbs and stores CO2 through processes like chemical reactions and microbial decomposition. However, the deep ocean's ability to absorb CO2 is limited, and its carbon sink function is vulnerable to climate change.\n\n### Enhanced Weathering\n\nEnhanced weathering involves accelerating natural weathering processes, such as the reaction of rocks with rainwater, to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. This approach can help preserve and enhance the carbon sink function.\n\n**Other Methods to Capture and Store CO2**\n\nIn addition to preserving and enhancing carbon sinks, other methods can be used to capture and store CO2 from the atmosphere. These methods include carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which capture CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial processes and store them in geological formations.\n\n**Mitigation by Sector**\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can be implemented across various sectors, including buildings, transportation, agriculture, and industry. The following sections discuss the different approaches to mitigation by sector.\n\n### Buildings\n\nBuildings can be designed and constructed to reduce energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This can be achieved through strategies like building insulation, energy-efficient lighting and appliances, and optimizing energy usage.\n\n### Urban Planning\n\nUrban planning can also contribute to climate change mitigation by designing cities to reduce energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This can be achieved through strategies like compact urban design, green infrastructure, and energy-efficient transportation systems.\n\n### Transport\n\nTransportation is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the transportation sector. Mitigation efforts can focus on reducing emissions from transportation, such as through the use of electric or hybrid vehicles, public transportation, and non-motorized transportation options.\n\n#### Shipping\n\nShipping is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from international trade. Mitigation efforts can focus on reducing emissions from shipping, such as through the use of more efficient ships and cleaner fuels.\n\n#### Air Transport\n\nAir transport is another significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Mitigation efforts can focus on reducing emissions from air transport, such as through the use of more efficient aircraft and cleaner fuels.\n\n### Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and land use (AFOLU) are critical sectors for climate change mitigation. AFOLU activities can be designed and managed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as through practices like agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and reforestation.\n\n### Industry\n\nIndustry is also a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the production and transportation of goods. Mitigation efforts can focus on reducing emissions from industry, such as through the use of cleaner production technologies and more efficient supply chains.\n\n**Co-benefits**\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can also provide co-benefits, such as improved public health, economic development, and energy security. The following sections discuss the different co-benefits of climate change mitigation.\n\n### Employment and Economic Development\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can create jobs and stimulate economic development in industries like renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable agriculture.\n\n### Energy Security\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can also improve energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting the use of cleaner energy sources.\n\n### Health and Well-being\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can also improve public health by reducing air pollution and other negative health impacts associated with fossil fuel use.\n\n### Climate Change Adaptation\n\nClimate change adaptation is also an important aspect of climate change mitigation efforts. Climate change adaptation involves taking actions to prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise, more frequent natural disasters, and changes in weather patterns.\n\n**Negative Side Effects**\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can also have negative side effects, such as the displacement of communities, the loss of biodiversity, and the degradation of ecosystems. The following sections discuss the different negative side effects of climate change mitigation efforts.\n\n**Costs and Funding**\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can be costly, particularly in the short term. However, the costs of climate change mitigation efforts can be offset by the benefits, such as improved public health, economic development, and energy security. The following sections discuss the different costs and funding approaches for climate change mitigation efforts.\n\n### Avoided Costs of Climate Change Effects\n\nAvoided costs refer to the costs of climate change effects that are avoided through climate change mitigation efforts, such as the cost of damage to infrastructure, loss of property, and negative impacts on human health.\n\n### Distributing Emissions Abatement Costs\n\nDistributing emissions abatement costs refers to the allocation of costs among different sectors and countries, such as through carbon pricing, taxes, and subsidies.\n\n### Funding\n\nFunding for climate change mitigation efforts can come from a variety of sources, including government budgets, private sector investments, and international funding mechanisms.\n\n**Policies**\n\nPolicies are critical for promoting and supporting climate change mitigation efforts.

Grading systems vary between countries and climbing disciplines, with different systems being used for free climbing, bouldering, aid climbing, ice and mixed climbing, and mountaineering. This article provides an overview of the various grading systems used in climbing.\n\n**History**\n\nThe first grading system for climbing was developed in the early 20th century by the French mountaineer and climber, Paul Gyp. Gyp's system, known as the \"French numerical grade,\" used a series of numbers to classify climbs based on their difficulty. However, this system was not widely adopted, and different countries developed their own grading systems.\n\n**Free climbing**\n\nFree climbing is a type of climbing that involves ascending a rock face without the use of equipment such as ladders, ropes, or other aids. The grading system for free climbing varies between countries, but the main systems in use are:\n\n#### French numerical grade\n\nThe French numerical grade system, also known as the \"UIAA scale,\" uses a series of numbers to classify climbs. The scale ranges from 1 to 9, with 1 being the easiest and 9 being the hardest. The system was developed by the French mountaineer and climber, Paul Gyp, and is still widely used today. The UIAA scale is used in many countries, including France, Switzerland, and Italy.\n\n#### American YDS grade\n\nThe American YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) grade system is used in the United States and Canada. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs. The numbers range from 1 to 5, with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the hardest. The letters indicate the type of climb, with A being the easiest and E being the most difficult.\n\n#### UIAA scale\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is a standardized grading system used in many countries. The scale ranges from 1 to 9, with 1 being the easiest and 9 being the hardest.\n\n#### British E-grade\n\nThe British E-grade system is used in the United Kingdom. The system uses letters to classify climbs, with E being the easiest and f being the most difficult.\n\n#### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for free climbing include the Swiss grade system, the Austrian grade system, and the New Zealand grade system.\n\n**Bouldering**\n\nBouldering is a type of climbing that involves ascending short rock formations or walls without the use of equipment. The grading system for bouldering varies between countries, but the main systems in use are:\n\n#### Comparison with free climbing\n\nBouldering grades are often compared to free climbing grades, but the two systems are not directly equivalent. Bouldering grades are typically more subjective and can vary depending on the specific boulder or problem.\n\n#### Font grade\n\nThe Font grade system is used in the Fontainebleau region of France. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with 1 being the easiest and 9 being the hardest.\n\n#### V-grade\n\nThe V-grade system is used in the United States and Canada. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with 1 being the easiest and 16 being the hardest.\n\n#### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for bouldering include the Swiss grade system, the Austrian grade system, and the New Zealand grade system.\n\n**Aid climbing**\n\nAid climbing is a type of climbing that involves using equipment such as ladders, ropes, or other aids to ascend a rock face. The grading system for aid climbing varies between countries, but the main systems in use are:\n\n#### Instability of aid grades\n\nAid grades are often considered to be more subjective than free climbing grades, as the use of equipment can make the climb easier or harder depending on the specific aid used.\n\n#### Original A-grade\n\nThe original A-grade system was developed by the American mountaineer and climber, John Salathé. The system used a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with A being the easiest and f being the most difficult.\n\n#### New wave A-grade\n\nThe new wave A-grade system was developed in the 1970s by the American mountaineer and climber, John Long. The system used a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with A being the easiest and f being the most difficult.\n\n#### Clean C-grade\n\nThe clean C-grade system was developed by the American mountaineer and climber, John Salathé. The system used a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with C being the easiest and f being the most difficult.\n\n**Ice and mixed climbing**\n\nIce and mixed climbing involve ascending ice formations or rock faces that involve a combination of ice and rock. The grading system for ice and mixed climbing varies between countries, but the main systems in use are:\n\n#### WI-grade\n\nThe WI (Water Ice) grade system is used in the United States and Canada. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with WI being the easiest and WI10 being the hardest.\n\n#### M-grade\n\nThe M-grade system is used in Europe. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with M being the easiest and M10 being the hardest.\n\n#### D-grade\n\nThe D-grade system is used in the United States and Canada. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with D being the easiest and D17 being the hardest.\n\n#### Scottish winter grade\n\nThe Scottish winter grade system is used in Scotland. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with I being the easiest and VII being the most difficult.\n\n#### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for ice and mixed climbing include the Swiss grade system, the Austrian grade system, and the New Zealand grade system.\n\n**Mountaineering**\n\nMountaineering involves ascending a mountain using a variety of climbing techniques. The grading system for mountaineering varies between countries, but the main systems in use are:\n\n#### International French Adjectival System\n\nThe International French Adjectival System is a standardized grading system used in many countries. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with AD being the easiest and TD being the most difficult.\n\n#### American NCCS\n\nThe American NCCS (North American Climbing Classification System) is used in the United States and Canada. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the most difficult.\n\n#### Russian\n\nThe Russian grading system is used in Russia and other former Soviet countries. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with 1 being the easiest and 6 being the most difficult.\n\n#### Alaskan\n\nThe Alaskan grading system is used in Alaska. The system uses a combination of numbers and letters to classify climbs, with I being the easiest and VII being the most difficult.\n\n#### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for mountaineering include the Swiss grade system, the Austrian grade system, and the New Zealand grade system.\n\n**Comparison tables**\n\nThe following tables provide a comparison of the different grading systems used in climbing:\n\n#### Comparison free climbing\n\n| Grade | French numerical grade | American YDS grade | UIAA scale | British E-grade |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Easy | 1-2 | 1-2 | 1-2 | E |\n| Intermediate | 3-5 | 3-5 | 3-5 | E-F |\n| Hard | 6-8 | 6-8 | 6-8 | f |\n| Extremely hard | 9 | 9 | 9 | X |\n\n#### Comparison bouldering\n\n| Grade | Font grade | V-grade | Swiss grade | Austrian grade |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Easy | 1-2 | 1-2 | 1-2 | 1-2 |\n| Intermediate | 3-5 | 3-5 | 3-5 | 3-5 |\n| Hard | 6-8 | 6-8 | 6-8 | 6-8 |\n| Extremely hard | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 |\n\n#### Comparison mountaineering\n\n| Grade | International French Adjectival System | American NCCS | Russian | Alaskan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Easy | AD | 1 | 1 | I |\n| Intermediate | D | 2 | 2 | II |\n| Hard | TD | 3 | 3 | III |\n| Extremely hard | ED | 4 | 4 | IV |\n| Extremely difficult | AD- | 5 | 5 | V |\n\n**See also**\n\n* Climbing route\n* Climber\n* Mountaineering\n* Bouldering\n* Ice and mixed climbing\n* Aid climbing\n\n**References**\n\n* American Alpine Club.

Born in Prussia, Krefft's life and career spanned multiple continents, culminating in his significant contributions to the scientific understanding of evolution and the establishment of public museums.\n\n**Family**\n\nKrefft was born on October 26, 1830, in Magdeburg, Prussia. Little is known about his early family life, but his father was a civil servant, and his mother was from a family of modest means. Krefft's family moved to Germany when he was a young boy, and it was there that he developed an interest in natural history.\n\n**Education**\n\nKrefft's early education took place in Germany, where he developed a strong foundation in natural history and the sciences. He later attended the University of Berlin, where he studied under prominent naturalists of the time. Krefft's educational background laid the groundwork for his future career in natural history.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nKrefft married Elizabeth Forster in 1853. Elizabeth was the daughter of William Forster, a prominent Australian politician and landowner. The marriage brought Krefft into a prominent social circle and facilitated his introduction to Australian natural history.\n\n**German heritage**\n\nKrefft's German heritage played a significant role in shaping his scientific views and career. As a natural historian, Krefft was influenced by the works of prominent German naturalists, including Alexander von Humboldt and Ernst Haeckel. His German upbringing also instilled in him a strong sense of discipline and work ethic, which served him well in his career.\n\n**Natural history**\n\nKrefft's interest in natural history began at an early age, and he quickly developed a passion for the subject. He spent many hours studying the natural world, collecting specimens, and conducting experiments. Krefft's natural historical pursuits took him to various parts of the world, including Australia, where he became fascinated with the unique flora and fauna.\n\n**Darwinian doctrine** and the consequent **Darwinian controversy**\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. He believed that the evidence from fossil records, comparative anatomy, and embryology all supported the idea of evolution. However, not everyone shared Krefft's views, and the Darwinian controversy soon ensued. Krefft's support for Darwinism put him at odds with some of his contemporaries, who saw the theory as a threat to traditional religious and scientific views.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nKrefft saw evolution as the key to understanding the natural world. He believed that the diversity of life on Earth could be explained by the gradual accumulation of small changes over time. Krefft's views on evolution were influenced by his studies of comparative anatomy and embryology, which he saw as providing strong evidence for the common ancestry of all living organisms.\n\n**Natural selection**\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Darwin's theory of natural selection. He believed that the struggle for existence and the resulting competition for resources drove the process of evolution. Krefft saw natural selection as a key mechanism for the adaptation of species to their environments, and he believed that it provided a clear explanation for the diversity of life on Earth.\n\n**Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy**\n\nKrefft's views on evolution and natural selection can be categorized into one of Ellegård's five positions. Ellegård's model posits that scientists can be divided into five groups based on their views on evolution and natural selection. Krefft's views fit into the category of the \"Darwinian\" position, which sees evolution as a gradual process driven by natural selection.\n\n**Artist**\n\nKrefft was a skilled artist and illustrator, and his drawings and paintings of Australian flora and fauna are highly regarded. His artistic talents were honed through his studies of anatomy and his work as a natural historian. Krefft's artistic contributions to the field of natural history are significant, and his artwork continues to be celebrated for its beauty and accuracy.\n\n**Victoria (1852 – 1858)**\n\nKrefft arrived in Melbourne in 1852 and quickly became involved in the city's scientific community.

He was particularly interested in the geology and natural history of the region and conducted extensive research on the subject. Krefft's contributions to the scientific community in Melbourne were significant, and he played a key role in establishing the city as a center for scientific inquiry.\n\n**Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy**\n\nKrefft's work in Melbourne was closely tied to the Museum of Natural History, where he served as curator. He worked closely with Professor McCoy, who was the museum's director, and together they developed new exhibits and conducted research on the natural history of the region. Krefft's time at the museum was marked by significant scientific discoveries, including the identification of new species and the development of new museum exhibits.\n\n**Germany**\n\nKrefft returned to Germany in the late 1850s, where he continued to work as a natural historian and artist. He was particularly interested in the natural history of the region and conducted extensive research on the subject. Krefft's time in Germany was marked by significant scientific discoveries, including the identification of new species and the development of new museum exhibits.\n\n**Natural historian, museum curator and administrator**\n\nKrefft's career as a natural historian, museum curator, and administrator spanned multiple continents. He worked in museums and institutions in Australia, Germany, and other parts of the world, developing new exhibits and conducting research on the natural history of the regions. Krefft's contributions to the field of natural history were significant, and he played a key role in establishing museums and institutions as centers for scientific inquiry.\n\n**Darwinism**\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Darwinism, which posits that species evolve over time through the process of natural selection. He believed that the evidence from fossil records, comparative anatomy, and embryology all supported the idea of evolution. Krefft's views on evolution and natural selection were influenced by his studies of comparative anatomy and embryology, which he saw as providing strong evidence for the common ancestry of all living organisms.\n\n**\"The New Museum Idea\"**\n\nKrefft was a proponent of the \"new museum idea,\" which emphasized the importance of hands-on exhibits and interactive displays. He believed that museums should be places of entertainment and education, where visitors could engage with the natural world in a hands-on way. Krefft's views on museum design and exhibit development were influential, and his ideas continue to shape the way museums are designed and operated today.\n\n**Cabinets of curiosities**\n\nKrefft's work as a museum curator and administrator was influenced by the cabinets of curiosity that were popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. These cabinets were collections of natural history specimens and artifacts that were displayed in a cabinet or case. Krefft saw the cabinets of curiosity as a way to engage visitors with the natural world and to provide a sense of wonder and awe.\n\n**Public museums**\n\nKrefft believed that public museums should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their social status or background. He saw museums as a way to educate the public about the natural world and to promote a sense of wonder and awe. Krefft's views on public museums were influential, and his ideas continue to shape the way museums are operated and managed today.\n\n**The \"new museum\"**\n\nKrefft's views on museum design and exhibit development were influential, and his ideas continue to shape the way museums are designed and operated today.

Krefft's concept of the \"new museum\" emphasized the importance of interactive exhibits and hands-on displays.\n\n**Krefft's curatorial rationale**\n\nKrefft's curatorial rationale was heavily influenced by his views on Darwinism and the importance of hands-on exhibits. He believed that museums should be places of entertainment and education, where visitors could engage with the natural world in a hands-on way. Krefft's curatorial approach emphasized the importance of interactive exhibits and hands-on displays.\n\n**Lack of funding**\n\nKrefft's work as a museum curator and administrator was often hampered by a lack of funding. He relied on donations and grants to support his work, and he often had to fight for resources and funding to develop new exhibits and conduct research. Krefft's experiences highlight the challenges faced by museum curators and administrators in securing funding and resources.\n\n**Photography**\n\nKrefft was an early adopter of photography, which he saw as a way to document and record the natural world. He was particularly interested in the use of photography in museum exhibits, where it could be used to create interactive and immersive displays. Krefft's views on photography were influential, and his ideas continue to shape the way photography is used in museums and other institutions today.\n\n**Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)**\n\nKrefft's work on the Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri) was significant, as it helped to shed light on the evolution and ecology of this unique species.

The test, designated as Starship Flight Test 1 (SN8), marked a significant milestone in the development of the Starship program, with the aim of establishing a sustainable human presence in space. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the events surrounding the test, including its background, launch, aftermath, and broader implications.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Starship**\n\nStarship is a reusable spacecraft designed by SpaceX to take both crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, with the ability to launch multiple times without the need for significant refurbishment. The Starship system consists of two main components: the Starship spacecraft, which is the crew and cargo vehicle, and the Super Heavy rocket, which serves as the launch vehicle.\n\n### **Development**\n\nDevelopment of the Starship program began in 2012, with the first prototype, known as the Grasshopper, undergoing testing in 2013. Since then, several prototypes have been developed, with each iteration featuring improvements in design, materials, and performance. The Starship spacecraft has undergone extensive testing at SpaceX's facilities in Texas and Florida, including static fire tests and atmospheric flight tests.\n\n### **Opinions before launch**\n\nAs the date of the first orbital flight test approached, opinions about the Starship program varied among experts and enthusiasts. Some praised the ambitious goals of the program and the potential for significant breakthroughs in space technology, while others expressed concerns about the technical challenges and risks involved. The SpaceX team, led by CEO Elon Musk, was optimistic about the prospects for success, citing the extensive testing and development work that had been conducted.\n\n### **Test objectives**\n\nThe primary objective of the Starship Flight Test 1 was to demonstrate the ability of the Starship spacecraft to reach orbit and return to Earth safely. The test also aimed to validate the performance of the Raptor engine, which powers the Starship, and to gather data on the spacecraft's aerodynamics and thermal protection system.\n\n**Launch**\n\n### **Flight profile**\n\nThe Starship spacecraft was launched from SpaceX's facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on April 20, 2023, at 2:00 PM CDT. The launch was carried out using the Super Heavy rocket, which served as the first stage of the launch vehicle. The Starship spacecraft, designated as SN8, was carried to an altitude of 10 km (6.2 miles) before the Raptor engine was ignited, propelling the spacecraft to orbit.\n\n### **Flight timeline**\n\nThe flight timeline for the Starship Flight Test 1 was as follows:\n\n* 2:00 PM CDT: Launch from Boca Chica, Texas\n* 2:05 PM CDT: First stage ignition and liftoff\n* 2:10 PM CDT: First stage separation\n* 2:15 PM CDT: Raptor engine ignition and Starship ascent\n* 2:30 PM CDT: Starship reaches orbit\n* 3:00 PM CDT: Starship begins re-entry into Earth's atmosphere\n\n### **April 17, 2023 attempt**\n\nThe initial attempt to launch the Starship spacecraft on April 17, 2023, was aborted due to technical issues with the Raptor engine. The engine failed to ignite properly, and the launch was postponed until the next day.\n\n### **April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt**\n\nThe second attempt to launch the Starship spacecraft was successful, with the spacecraft reaching orbit and completing its re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. However, the spacecraft did not land successfully, with the landing legs failing to deploy properly.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### **Technical assessments**\n\nFollowing the flight test, SpaceX conducted a comprehensive technical assessment of the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy rocket. The assessment aimed to identify areas for improvement and to validate the performance of the Raptor engine and the spacecraft's systems.\n\n### **Launch site**\n\nThe launch site at Boca Chica, Texas, was modified to accommodate the Starship program, with the construction of a new launch pad and a large tent to protect the spacecraft from the elements.\n\n### **Effects on environment**\n\nThe launch of the Starship spacecraft had a significant impact on the environment, with the spacecraft generating a sonic boom that was audible for miles around. The launch also generated a large amount of noise and vibrations, which were felt by nearby residents.\n\n### **FAA investigation**\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an investigation into the flight test, examining the safety and regulatory aspects of the launch. The investigation aimed to identify any areas where the FAA could improve its oversight of the Starship program.\n\n**See also**\n\n* SpaceX Starship\n* Super Heavy rocket\n* Raptor engine\n* Boca Chica, Texas\n* Federal Aviation Administration\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 marked a significant milestone in the development of the Starship program, with the spacecraft reaching orbit and completing its re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. However, the test also highlighted the technical challenges and risks involved in developing a next-generation reusable launch system. As the program continues to evolve, SpaceX and the FAA will work together to ensure the safe and successful operation of the Starship spacecraft.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Starship_flight_test_1\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Starship\n##Development\n##Opinions before launch\n##Test objectives\n#Launch\n##Flight profile\n##Flight timeline\n##April 17 2023 attempt\n##April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Technical assessments\n##Launch site\n##Effects on environment\n##FAA investigation\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election will determine the composition of the Lebanese Parliament, which has 128 seats.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 election is the first parliamentary election in Lebanon since the 2018 election, when the country was facing severe economic and political crises. The country has been plagued by protests, a devastating Beirut explosion, and a severe economic crisis.\n\n### 2019-21 Protests\n\nIn 2019, a wave of protests swept the country, sparked by a 700% rise in fuel prices. The protests, which were largely peaceful, demanded the resignation of the government and the implementation of reforms. The protests continued for several months, with demonstrators calling for an end to corruption and the establishment of a new government.\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on Lebanon, with the country experiencing a severe economic downturn. The pandemic led to a decline in tourism, a key sector of the economy, and a sharp decrease in remittances from Lebanese expatriates. The economic crisis was exacerbated by the pandemic, leading to shortages of food, medicine, and other essential goods.\n\n### Beirut Explosion\n\nIn August 2020, a massive explosion occurred at the Port of Beirut, killing over 200 people and injuring thousands more. The explosion was caused by the detonation of a large quantity of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the port for several years. The explosion was widely condemned, and it was seen as a symbol of the country's economic and political crises.\n\n**Electorate**\n\nThe electoral system in Lebanon is based on a mixed-member proportional representation system. The country is divided into 15 electoral districts, each of which elects a number of seats to the Parliament. The number of seats allocated to each district varies, with some districts electing 8 or 9 seats, while others elect only 4 or 5.\n\n### Electoral System\n\nThe electoral system in Lebanon is designed to ensure that each electoral district is represented in the Parliament. The system is based on a combination of single-member districts and proportional representation. Voters in each district vote for a candidate, and the candidate who receives the most votes is elected. However, the system also allocates seats to parties or coalitions based on their share of the national vote.\n\n### Registered Voters\n\nAs of 2022, there are approximately 3.9 million registered voters in Lebanon.
