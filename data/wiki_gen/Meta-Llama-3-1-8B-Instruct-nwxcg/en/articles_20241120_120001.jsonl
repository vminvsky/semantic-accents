Sprecher has been instrumental in shaping the digital currency and commodities markets through his company's innovative ventures, including Bakkt.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJeffrey Sprecher was born in Madison, Wisconsin, to a family with a background in business and healthcare. His father, Peter Sprecher, was an insurance broker, while his mother, Phyllis (née Willingham), was a medical technologist. Sprecher's sisters, Karen and Jill, are filmmakers, and his upbringing likely instilled in him a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Sprecher attended Madison's James Madison Memorial High School, where he was initiated into the Wisconsin Alpha Chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He went on to receive a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1978. Sprecher's academic background in chemical engineering would later influence his career in the commodities market.\n\n## Career in the Commodities Market\n\nSprecher's first job was at Trane, a leading manufacturer of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. At Trane, Sprecher met William Prentice, who was developing power plants following deregulation. Prentice's work in the commodities market likely exposed Sprecher to the opportunities and challenges of the industry. In 1983, Prentice offered Sprecher a job at Western Power Group, a company that traded in power and energy futures. Sprecher's experience at Western Power Group would lay the foundation for his future success in the commodities market.\n\n**Bakkt**\n\nIn 2018, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), led by Sprecher, formed Bakkt, a pioneering marketplace in digital currency futures. Bakkt aimed to provide a regulated and secure platform for traders to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company's innovative approach to digital currency trading was designed to address the concerns of institutional investors, who were hesitant to enter the market due to regulatory uncertainty and security risks. Sprecher's vision for Bakkt was to create a platform that would facilitate the growth of the digital currency market while ensuring the highest standards of security and transparency.\n\n## Bakkt's Acquisition and Integration\n\nIn January 2021, Bakkt announced that it would be absorbed into a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Chicago investment fund Victory Park Capital. The acquisition marked a significant milestone in Bakkt's history, as it would provide the company with the necessary resources to expand its operations and improve its services. Sprecher's leadership and vision for Bakkt had positioned the company as a leader in the digital currency market, and the acquisition would enable it to continue its growth trajectory.\n\n**Stock Sales During the COVID-19 Pandemic**\n\nOn March 19, 2020, federal financial-disclosure documents revealed that Sprecher and his wife, Kelly Loeffler, had sold millions of dollars of stock in companies vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The sales began on the same day Loeffler and other senators received a private briefing from federal officials about the looming crisis. The documents showed that the couple had purchased stock in Citrix Systems, a company that would potentially benefit from the increase in remote work due to the stay-at-home orders issued to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. At least some of the stocks that Loeffler sold were owned jointly with Sprecher and would have required his knowledge and authorization to sell.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nSprecher has been married to Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S senator, since 2004. They reside in Tuxedo Park, Atlanta, in a $10,500,000, 15,000 square foot estate named Descante. However, the property was later reappraised for around $4 million, resulting in far lower property taxes.\n\nIn conclusion, Jeffrey Sprecher is a successful businessman and investor who has made significant contributions to the digital currency and commodities markets through his company, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). His leadership and vision have positioned Bakkt as a leader in the digital currency market, and his personal life reflects his success and wealth.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jeffrey_Sprecher\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nSprecher was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of insurance broker Peter Sprecher and medical technologist Phyllis (née Willingham) His sisters are the filmmakers Karen and Jill Sprecher [1] [2] [3] He attended Madison's James Madison Memorial High School, [4] and was initiated to the Wisconsin Alpha Chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon [5] Sprecher received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1978 and a Master of Business Administration from Pepperdine University in 1984 [6] [7]\n\n\nCareer\nSprecher's first job was at Trane, where he met William Prentice who was developing power plants following deregulation Prentice offered him a job at Western Power Group in 1983 [8]\n\n\nBakkt\nIn 2018, Intercontinental Exchange formed Bakkt, “a pioneering marketplace in digital currency futures.” In January 2021, the company announced that “Bakkt’s being absorbed into a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Chicago investment fund Victory Park Capital.” Sprecher was quoted in Fortune that “the lofty costs of processing payments by credit card  [are] one of the prime targets for disruption in financial services Bakkt    could play a central role in wrestling down costs.”  [13]\n\n\nStock sales during COVID-19 pandemic\nOn March 19, 2020, the public release of federal financial-disclosure documents revealed that Sprecher and his wife, interim U.S Senator Kelly Loeffler sold millions of dollars of stock the couple owned in companies vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic The sales began the same day Loeffler and other senators received a private briefing from federal officials about the looming crisis [14] The documents also showed that the couple purchased stock in Citrix Systems, a company that would potentially benefit from the increase in remote work due to the stay-at-home orders issued to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic [14] At least some of the stocks that Loeffler sold were owned jointly with Sprecher and would have required his knowledge and authorization to sell, documents show [14] [15]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSprecher has been married to former U.S senator Kelly Loeffler since 2004 [19] [20] They reside in Tuxedo Park, Atlanta in a $10,500,000, 15,000 square foot estate named Descante, though the property was later reappraised for around $4 million, resulting in far lower property taxes [21] [22]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Andy_Warhol", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nWarhol was born on August 6, 1928, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [11] He was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola Sr.; 1889–1942) [12] [13] and Julia Warhola (née Zavacká, 1891–1972) [14] His parents were working-class Rusyn emigrants from Mikó, Austria-Hungary (now called Miková, located in today's northeastern Slovakia) [15] [16]\n\n\nCareer\nWarhol's early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising art, where his first commission had been to draw shoes for Glamour magazine in 1949 [29] [30] In the 1950s, Warhol worked as a designer for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller [30] [31] While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his \"blotted line\" technique, applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a printmaking process on the most rudimentary scale His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme [30] American photographer John Coplans recalled that \"nobody drew shoes the way Andy did He somehow gave each shoe a temperament of its own, a sort of sly, Toulouse-Lautrec kind of sophistication, but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle was always in the right place The kids in the apartment  [which Andy shared in New York – note by Coplans] noticed that the vamps on Andy's shoe drawings kept getting longer and longer but  [Israel] Miller didn't mind Miller loved them.\"\n\n\n1950s\nWarhol's early career was dedicated to

and longer but  [Israel] Miller didn't mind Miller loved them.\"\n\n\n1960s\nAs a commercial artist, Warhol worked with high-end advertising clients such as Tiffany & Co [42]\n\n\n1970s\nCompared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the early 1970s were much quieter years, as he became more entrepreneurial He was generally regarded as quiet, shy and a meticulous observer Art critic Robert Hughes called him \"the white mole of Union Square\" [99] His fashion evolved from what Warhol called his \"leather look\" to his \"Brook Brothers look,\" which included a Brooks Brothers shirt and tie, DeNoyer blazer, and Levi jeans [100] [101]\n\n\n1980s\n\nWarhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the \"bull market\" of 1980s New York art: Jean-Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, David Salle and other so-called Neo-Expressionists, as well as members of the Transavantgarde movement in Europe, including Francesco Clemente and Enzo Cucchi Warhol also earned street credibility and graffiti artist Fab Five Freddy paid homage to him by painting an entire train with Campbell soup cans [142]\n\nDeath\nWarhol died at age 58 following gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital in Manhattan on February 22, 1987 [164] Reportedly, he had been making a good recovery from the surgery before dying in his sleep at 6:32 a.m from a sudden post-operative irregular heartbeat [165] Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors [166]\n\n\nWrongful death lawsuit\nIn December 1991, Warhol's family sued the hospital in the New York Supreme Court for inadequate care, before judge Ira Gammerman, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water intoxication [171] The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money [172]\n\n\nArt works\nBy the beginning of the 1960s, pop art was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as Roy Lichtenstein, would later become synonymous with the movement Warhol, who would become famous as the \"Pope of Pop\", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette His early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists such as Willem de Kooning.\n\n\nPaintings\nBy the beginning of the 1960s, pop art was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some

expressionists such as Willem de Kooning.\n\n\nDrawings\nAccording to a 2023 Artnet article, \"Though he is often associated with printmaking—specifically silkscreen—Warhol was also an incredibly talented illustrator and draughtsman, and drawing was an integral part of his practice throughout his career His early drawings on paper bare a resemblance to both continuous line and blind contour drawing techniques, giving his work a sense of ease and immediacy While working primarily within commercial advertisement, he pioneered the blotted line technique, which synthesized graphite drawing on paper with elements of printmaking Warhol continued his practice of drawing through the last years of his life and career, and the work from this later period exemplifies a long and storied career's worth of honed skill and technique.\" [201]\n\n\nArt market\nIn 1970, screens and film matrixes that had been used to produce original Warhol works in the 1960s were taken to Europe for the production of Warhol screenprints under the name \"Sunday B Morning\" Warhol signed and numbered one edition of 250 before subsequent unauthorized unsigned versions were produced [202] The unauthorized works were the result of a falling out between Warhol and some of his New York City studio employees who went to Brussels where they produced work stamped with \"Sunday B Morning\" and \"Add Your Own Signature Here\" [203] Since the works began as a collaboration, Warhol facilitated exact duplication by providing the photo negatives and precise color codes [204] Some of the unauthorized productions bore the markings \"This is not by me, Andy Warhol\" [202] The most famous unauthorized reproductions are 1967 Marilyn Monroe portfolio screenprints These \"Sunday B Morning\" Marilyn Monroe prints were among those still under production as of 2013 [205] Art galleries and dealers also market Sunday B Morning reprint versions of several other screenprint works including Flowers, Campbell's Soup I, Campbell's Soup Cans II,Gold Marilyn Monroe Mao and Dollare bill prints [206] Although the original Sunday B Morning versions had black stamps on the back, by the 1980s, they switched to blue [207]\n\n\nCollectors\nAmong Warhol's early collectors and influential supporters were Emily and Burton Tremaine Among the over 15 artworks purchased, [238] Marilyn Diptych (now at Tate Modern, London) [239] and A boy for Meg (now at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC), [240] were purchased directly out of Warhol's studio in 1962 One Christmas, Warhol left a small Head of Marilyn Monroe by the Tremaine's door at their New York apartment in gratitude for their support and encouragement [241]\n\n\nWorks\nWarhol was a fan of \"Business Art\", as he stated in his book The Philosophy of Andy Warhol from A to B and Back Again \"I went into business art I wanted to be an art business man or a business artist Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art,\" he said His transformation into a mere business artist was a point of criticism [242] In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as \"the most brilliant mirror of our times\", contending that \"Warhol had captured something irresistible about the zeitgeist of American culture in the 1970s.\" [141]\n\n\nFilmography\nWarhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by La Monte Young called Trio for Strings and subsequently created his famous series of static films Filmmaker Jonas Mekas, who accompanied Warhol to the premiere, claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by that performance [243] Between 1963 and 1968, Warhol made more than 600 underground films, including short black-and-white \"screen test\" portraits of Factory visitors [244] [245] Many of his films premiered at the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre in Greenwich Village and 55th Street Playhouse in Midtown Manhattan [246] [247]\n\n\nMusic\nWarhol strongly influenced the new wave/punk rock band Devo, as well as David Bowie Bowie recorded a song called \"Andy Warhol\" for his 1971 album Hunky Dory [369] Lou Reed wrote the song \"Andy's Chest\" in response to the attempted assassination of Warhol [261] The song was originally recorded by the Velvet Underground in 1969, but it wasn't released until a version appeared on Reed's solo album Transformer in 1972 The band Triumph also wrote a song about Andy Warhol, \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" off their 1984 album Thunder Seven.\n\n\nBooks and print\nBeginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work The first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was 25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy, printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand-colored copies, using Dr Martin's ink washes Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends Copy No 4, inscribed \"Jerry\" on the front cover and given to Geraldine Stutz, was used for a facsimile printing in 1987, [271] and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US$35,000 by Doyle New York [272]\n\n\nOther media\nAlthough Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.\n\n\nPersonal life\nWarhol lived as a gay man before the gay liberation movement, but he often veiled his personal life in the press In 1980, Warhol proclaimed that he was still a virgin Former Interview editor Bob Colacello felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably \"a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use  [Andy's] word abstract.\" [301] However, Warhol's assertion of virginity is contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease [302] His friend Charles Lisanby, whom Warhol had unrequited romantic feelings for, said Warhol told him sex was \"messy and distasteful.\" [34] \"He told me he'd had sex a few times, he had tried it and didn't really like it,\" said Lisanby [303] Furthermore, some of Warhol's friends from his early career claimed to have either witnessed Warhol having sex or heard him boasting about his sexual relations [303]\n\n\nSexuality\nWarhol lived as a gay man before the

of Renaissance Paintings (1984) and The Last Supper (1986) In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate [316]\n\n\nCollections\nWarhol was an avid collector His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story townhouse, but also a nearby storage unit, as \"Andy's Stuff\" The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his \"Stuff\".\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 1991, the Warhol Family Museum of Modern Art was established in Medzilaborce, Slovakia by Warhol's family and the Slovak Ministry of Culture In 1996, it was renamed the Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art [323]\n\n\nWarhol Foundation\nWarhol's will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to the \"advancement of the visual arts\" Warhol had so many possessions that it took Sotheby's nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than $20 million [332]\n\n\nRevelation in Brooklyn\nFrom November 19, 2021 – June 19, 2022, the Brooklyn Museum

with her son in New York City [342]\n\n\nIn pop culture\nWarhol founded Interview, a stage for celebrities he \"endorsed\" and a business staffed by his friends One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian \"Superstar\" and the Warholian portrait) Warhol endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and

producer who was a leading figure in the American pop art movement of the 1960s. His work explored the relationship between art and commerce, as well as the role of celebrity culture in society.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nAndy Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Ondrej Warhola, a Slovak immigrant, and Julia Warhola, a homemaker. He was the fourth of five children. Warhol's family was of Slovak descent, and his parents were both devout Catholics. Warhol's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and the arts. He attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and studied pictorial design. After graduating, he moved to New York City and began working as a commercial illustrator.\n\n**Career**\n\nWarhol's early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising art, where his first commission had been to draw shoes for Glamour magazine in 1949. In the 1950s, Warhol worked as a designer for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller. While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his \"blotted line\" technique, applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a printmaking process on the most rudimentary scale. This technique allowed him to repeat the basic image and create endless variations on the theme.\n\n**1950s**\n\nWarhol's early career was marked by a focus on commercial art and advertising. He worked as a designer for various companies, including shoe manufacturers and department stores. During this time, he developed his signature style, which was characterized by bold colors and graphic designs. Warhol's work during this period was largely focused on creating eye-catching and attention-grabbing advertisements.\n\n**1960s**\n\nAs a commercial artist, Warhol worked with high-end advertising clients such as Tiffany & Co. He began to explore new styles and techniques, including the use of silkscreen printing and pop art. Warhol's work during this period was characterized by a focus on consumer culture and the role of celebrity in society. He created works that celebrated the mundane and the ordinary, such as Campbell's Soup Cans and Marilyn Monroe's face.\n\n**1970s**\n\nCompared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the early 1970s were much quieter years, as he became more entrepreneurial. Warhol generally regarded as quiet, shy and a meticulous observer. Art critic Robert Hughes called him \"the white mole of Union Square.\" His fashion evolved from what Warhol called his \"leather look\" to his \"Brook Brothers look,\" which included a Brooks Brothers shirt and tie, DeNoyer blazer, and Levi jeans.\n\n**1980s**\n\nWarhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the \"bull market\" of 1980s New York art: Jean-Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, David Salle and other so-called Neo-Expressionists, as well as members of the Transavantgarde movement in Europe, including Francesco Clemente and Enzo Cucchi. Warhol also earned street credibility and graffiti artist Fab Five Freddy paid homage to him by painting an entire train with Campbell soup cans.\n\n**Death**\n\nWarhol died at age 58 following gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital in Manhattan on February 22, 1987. Reportedly, he had been making a good recovery from the surgery before dying in his sleep at 6:32 a.m from a sudden post-operative irregular heartbeat. Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors.\n\n**Wrongful Death Lawsuit**\n\nIn December 1991, Warhol's family sued the hospital in the New York Supreme Court for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water intoxication. The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.\n\n**Art Works**\n\nBy the beginning of the 1960s, pop art was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as Roy Lichtenstein, would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the \"Pope of Pop\", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists such as Willem de Kooning.\n\n**Paintings**\n\nWarhol's paintings were a key part of his artistic output. He began making paintings in the early 1960s, and continued to do so throughout his career. His paintings often featured everyday objects and celebrities, such as Campbell's Soup Cans and Marilyn Monroe's face. Warhol's paintings were characterized by their bright colors and bold graphic designs.\n\n**Drawings**\n\nWarhol was also a skilled draughtsman, and his drawings are highly regarded by art historians and collectors. His drawings often featured everyday objects and celebrities, and were characterized by their bold lines and graphic designs.\n\n**Art Market**\n\nIn 1970, screens and film matrixes that had been used to produce original Warhol works in the 1960s were taken to Europe for the production of Warhol screenprints under the name \"Sunday B Morning\". Warhol signed and numbered one edition of 250 before subsequent unauthorized unsigned versions were produced.\n\n**Collectors**\n\nWarhol was an avid collector of art and artifacts. His collections included works by other artists, as well as rare and unusual objects. Warhol's collections were highly regarded by art historians and collectors, and many of the works he collected are now housed in museums and private collections around the world.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nWarhol's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as one of the most important artists of the 20th century, and his work continues to be celebrated and studied by art historians and collectors around the world. Warhol's impact on popular culture is also significant, and his influence can be seen in a wide range of fields, from fashion to music to film.\n\n**Revelation in Brooklyn**\n\nFrom November 19, 2021 – June 19, 2022, the Brooklyn Museum displayed the Andy Warhol: Revelation exhibition. Revelation examines themes such as life and death, power and desire, the role and representation of women, Renaissance imagery, family and immigrant traditions and rituals, depictions and duplications of Christ and the Catholic body and queer desire.

A biography written by art critic Blake Gopnik was published in 2020 under the title Warhol.\n\n**Comic Books**\n\nWarhol is featured as a character in the Miracleman series of comics. It is first mentioned that he was resurrected by the alien scientist Mors and subsequently convinces the latter to mass-produce copies of himself.

and drawing was an integral part of his practice throughout his career His early drawings on paper bare a resemblance to both continuous line and blind contour drawing techniques, giving his work a sense of ease and immediacy While working primarily within commercial advertisement, he pioneered the blotted line technique, which synthesized graphite drawing on paper with elements of printmaking Warhol continued his practice of drawing through the last years of his life and career, and the work from this later period exemplifies a long and storied career's worth of honed skill and technique.\" [201]\n\n\nArt market\nIn 1970, screens and film matrixes that had been used to produce original Warhol works in the 1960s were taken to Europe for the production of Warhol screenprints under the name \"Sunday B Morning\" Warhol signed and numbered one edition of 250 before subsequent unauthorized unsigned versions were produced [202] The unauthorized works were the result of a falling out between Warhol and some of his New York City studio employees who went to Brussels where they produced work stamped with \"Sunday B Morning\" and \"Add Your Own Signature Here\" [203] Since the works began as a collaboration, Warhol facilitated exact duplication by providing the photo negatives and precise color codes [204] Some of the unauthorized productions bore the markings \"This is not by me, Andy Warhol\" [202] The most famous unauthorized reproductions are 1967 Marilyn Monroe portfolio screenprints These \"Sunday B Morning\" Marilyn Monroe prints were among those still under production as of 2013 [205] Art galleries and dealers also market Sunday B Morning reprint versions of several other screenprint works including Flowers, Campbell's Soup I, Campbell's Soup

said His transformation into a mere business artist was a point of criticism [242] In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as \"the most

media.\n\n\nPersonal life\nWarhol lived as a gay man before the gay liberation movement, but he often veiled his personal life in the press In 1980, Warhol proclaimed that he was still a virgin Former Interview editor Bob Colacello felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably \"a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use  [Andy's] word abstract.\" [301] However, Warhol's assertion of virginity is contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease [302] His friend Charles Lisanby, whom Warhol had unrequited romantic feelings for, said Warhol told him sex was \"messy and distasteful.\" [34] \"He told me he'd had sex a few times, he had tried it and didn't really like it,\" said Lisanby [303] Furthermore, some of Warhol's friends from his early career claimed to have either witnessed Warhol having sex or heard him boasting about his sexual relations [303]\n\n\nSexuality\nWarhol lived as a gay man before the gay liberation movement, but he often veiled his personal life in the press In 1980, Warhol proclaimed that he was still a virgin Former Interview editor Bob Colacello felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably \"a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use  [Andy's] word abstract.\" [301] However, Warhol's assertion of virginity is contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease [302] His friend Charles Lisanby, whom Warhol had unrequited romantic feelings for, said Warhol told him sex was \"messy and distasteful.\" [34] \"He told me he'd had sex a few times, he had tried it and didn't really like it,\" said Lisanby [303] Furthermore, some of Warhol's friends from his early career claimed to have either witnessed Warhol having sex or heard him boasting about his sexual relations [303]\n\n\nReligion\nWarhol was a practicing Ruthenian Catholic He regularly volunteered at homeless shelters in New York City, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person [316] Many of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, Details of Renaissance Paintings (1984) and The Last Supper (1986) In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate [316]\n\n\nCollections\nWarhol was an avid collector His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story townhouse, but also a nearby storage unit, as \"Andy's Stuff\" The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his \"Stuff\".\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 1991, the Warhol Family Museum of Modern Art was established in Medzilaborce, Slovakia by Warhol's family and the Slovak Ministry of Culture In 1996, it was renamed the Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art [323]\n\n\nWarhol Foundation\nWarhol's will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to the \"advancement of the visual arts\" Warhol had so many possessions that it took Sotheby's nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than $20 million [332]\n\n\nRevelation in Brooklyn\nFrom November 19, 2021 – June 19, 2022, the Brooklyn Museum displayed the Andy Warhol: Revelation exhibition [341] Revelation examines themes such as life and death, power and desire, the role and representation of women, Renaissance imagery, family and immigrant traditions and rituals, depictions and duplications of Christ and the Catholic body and queer desire Among the more than one hundred objects on view were rare source materials and newly discovered items that provide a fresh and intimate look at Warhol's creative process, as well as major paintings from his epic Last Supper series (1986), the experimental film The Chelsea Girls (1966), an unfinished film depicting the setting sun commissioned by the de Menil family and funded by the Roman Catholic Church and drawings created by Warhol's mother, Julia Warhola, when she lived with her son in New York City [342]\n\n\nIn pop culture\nWarhol founded Interview, a stage for celebrities he \"endorsed\" and a business staffed by his friends One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian \"Superstar\" and the Warholian portrait) Warhol endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and films.\n\n\nFilms\nWarhol appeared as himself in the films Dynamite Chicken (1971), Cocaine Cowboys (1979) and Tootsie (1982) [343] [344]\n\n\nDocumentaries\nIn 1965, Warhol and his muse Edie Sedgwick appeared on The Merv Griffin Show [359] Warhol doesn't say much save for bashful gestures and whispering \"yes\" or \"no,\" while Sedgwick mediates a conversation on how Pop Art is art without any sense of emotion [360]\n\n\nTelevision\nIn 1965, Warhol and his muse Edie Sedgwick appeared on The Merv Griffin Show [359] Warhol doesn't say much save for bashful gestures and whispering \"yes\" or \"no,\" while Sedgwick mediates a conversation on how Pop Art is art without any sense of emotion [360]\n\n\nMusic\nWarhol strongly influenced the new wave/punk rock band Devo, as well as David Bowie Bowie recorded a song called \"Andy Warhol\" for his 1971 album Hunky Dory [369] Lou Reed wrote the song \"Andy's Chest\" in response to the attempted assassination of Warhol [261] The song was originally recorded by the Velvet Underground in 1969, but it wasn't released until a version appeared on Reed's solo album Transformer in 1972 The band Triumph also wrote a song about Andy Warhol, \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" off their 1984 album Thunder Seven.\n\n\nBooks\nMany books have been written about Warhol In 1989, the biography The Life and Death of Andy Warhol by author Victor Bockris was published [370] Bockris expanded the book in 2003 for the 75th anniversary of Warhol's birth and called it Warhol: The Biography [371] Former Interview editor Bob Colacello wrote the book Holy Terror: Andy Warhol Close Up, which was published in 1990 [372] A biography written by art critic Blake Gopnik was published in 2020 under the title Warhol [373] [374] [375]\n\n\nComic books\nWarhol is featured as a character in the Miracleman series of comics It is first mentioned that he was resurrected by the alien scientist Mors and subsequently convinces the latter to mass-produce copies of himself [376] Later on, 18 copies of Warhol are seen in the underworld beneath the pyramid structure Olympus, where they produce pop art relating to the new superhuman regime One Warhol clone numbered 6 is assigned to and develop a friendship with a clone of Emil Gargunza (Miracleman's creator) before the latter's betrayal and attempted escape [377]\n\n\nVideo games\nWarhol makes an appearance in the 2003 video game The Sims: Superstar as the photographer in Studio Town [378] Warhol (played by Jeff Grace) makes a cameo appearance in the 2022 video game Immortality [379] [380]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on August 19, 1982, in Euclid, Ohio, Miocic is the son of Croatian immigrants Kathy and Bojan Miocic. His father originates from Rtina, while his mother is from Cetingrad, Croatia.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMiocic was born and raised in Euclid, Ohio, a city located in Cuyahoga County. His early life was marked by a tumultuous home environment, with his parents separating when he was still a child. Despite this, Miocic's mother played a crucial role in his upbringing, initially living with grandparents and later with her new partner and younger half-brother Jonathan.\n\nGrowing up, Miocic was a multifaceted individual, excelling in various sports, including wrestling and baseball. He began training in mixed martial arts at the Strong Style MMA Training Centre in Independence, Ohio, where he met his future coach, Marcus Marinelli. Miocic's initial focus was on wrestling and baseball, but he eventually transitioned to mixed martial arts, eventually becoming a champion in both boxing and MMA.\n\n**Mixed Martial Arts Career**\n\nMiocic's journey in mixed martial arts began in 2005, when he started training at the Strong Style MMA Training Centre. Initially, he trained in mixed martial arts, quickly achieving a 5-0 amateur record with all five wins coming by first-round stoppage. However, he soon decided to take a foray into amateur boxing bouts, winning the Cleveland Golden Gloves and making it to the nationals. Miocic's record in Golden Gloves boxing matches stands at 4-1, with 2 victories by knockout.\n\nAfter only eight months of training, Miocic began his MMA career, winning his first six professional fights by knockout. He initially fought for the NAAFS (an Ohio-based MMA promotion), where he won the NAAFS Heavyweight Championship.\n\n**Ultimate Fighting Championship**\n\nOn June 14, 2011, Miocic signed a multi-fight deal with the UFC, marking a significant milestone in his career. He made his UFC debut in 2011, competing in the Heavyweight division. Miocic's early UFC career was marked by a series of victories, including a win over Roy Nelson in 2012.\n\nIn 2016, Miocic faced Fabricio Werdum at UFC 198 on May 14, 2016. He caught Werdum with a short right hook counter while backpedaling away from a flurry of punches in the first round, earning the championship and giving Werdum his first defeat since June 2011. Miocic was also awarded a Performance of the Night bonus.\n\n**UFC Heavyweight Championship**\n\nMiocic's victory over Werdum marked a significant milestone in his career, as he became the new UFC Heavyweight Champion. He successfully defended his title against Alistair Overeem at UFC 203, winning by TKO in the first round. Miocic's victory cemented his status as one of the top Heavyweight champions in the world.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMiocic works as a full-time firefighter and paramedic, becoming full-time in 2022 after many years of part-time work in Oakwood and Valley View, Ohio. The reason he stated he switched to full-time was for health care and insurance coverage for his family long-term. When asked by Joe Rogan why he still works as a firefighter despite being a UFC champion, he stated that he needs something to fall back to after his fighting career is over.\n\n**Championships and Accomplishments**\n\nMiocic has achieved numerous accolades throughout his career, including:\n\n* UFC Heavyweight Champion (2 times)\n* NAAFS Heavyweight Championship\n* Cleveland Golden Gloves Champion\n* NCAA Division I Wrestler at Cleveland State\n\n**Mixed Martial Arts Record**\n\nMiocic's professional mixed martial arts record stands at 20-4, with 15 victories by knockout.\n\n**Pay-Per-View Bouts**\n\nMiocic has competed in several high-profile pay-per-view bouts, including UFC 203 and UFC 218.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of UFC Heavyweight Champions\n* List of Cleveland Golden Gloves Champions\n* List of NCAA Division I Wrestlers at Cleveland State", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Stipe_Miocic\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHe was born and raised in Euclid, Ohio, on August 19, 1982, the son of Croatian immigrants Kathy and Bojan Miocic [12] (Croatian: Miočić, pronounced  [mîotʃitɕ];

He was the first Chief of Defence Staff of the Indian Armed Forces, serving from January 2020 until his death in December 2021.\n\nEarly Life and Education\nBipin Rawat was born on 16 March 1958 in Pauri town of Pauri Garhwal district, present-day Uttarakhand state. He hails from a Hindu Garhwali Rajput family that has a long history of serving in the Indian Army. His father, Lakshman Singh Rawat, was commissioned into the 3/11 Gorkha Rifles in 1951 and retired as Deputy Chief of the Army Staff in 1988. Rawat's mother was from the Uttarkashi district and was the daughter of Kishan Singh Parmar, an ex-Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Uttarkashi.\n\nMilitary Career\nRawat was commissioned into the 5th battalion, the 11 Gorkha Rifles (5/11 GR) on 16 December 1978, the same unit as his father. During the 1987 Sino-Indian skirmish in the Sumdorong Chu valley, then Captain Rawat's battalion was deployed against the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The standoff was the first military confrontation along the disputed McMahon Line after the 1962 war.\n\nUN Mission in Congo\nRawat commanded MONUSCO (a Multinational Brigade in a Chapter VII mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Within two weeks of deployment in the DRC, the Brigade faced a major offensive in the east that threatened the regional capital of North Kivu, Goma. The situation demanded a rapid response, and North Kivu Brigade was reinforced, with Rawat responsible for over 7,000 men and women, representing nearly half of the total MONUSCO force. While simultaneously engaged in offensive kinetic operations against the CNDP and other armed groups, Rawat carried out tactical support to the Congolese Army (FARDC) and sensitized programmes with the local population to ensure that all were informed about the situation and worked together in the progress of operations. He was responsible for the protection of the vulnerable population.\n\nGeneral Officer\nAfter promotion to Major General, Rawat took over as the General Officer Commanding 19th Infantry Division (Uri). For his command of the Dagger Division, as the 19th Infantry Division is called, he was awarded the Ati Vishisht Seva Medal on 26 January 2013. He subsequently served as the Major General General Staff (MGGS) of the Eastern Command.\n\n2015 Myanmar Strikes\nPromoted to the rank of Lieutenant General, he was appointed General Officer Commanding III Corps, headquartered in Dimapur. In June 2015, eighteen Indian soldiers were killed in an ambush by militants belonging to the United Liberation Front of Western South East Asia (UNLFW) in Manipur. The Indian Army responded with cross-border strikes in which units of the 21st battalion of the Parachute Regiment struck an NSCN-K base in Myanmar. 21 Para was under the operational control of the Dimapur-based III Corps, which was then commanded by Rawat. For his command of III Corps, he was awarded the Uttam Yudh Seva Medal on 26 January 2016.\n\nArmy Commander\nAfter relinquishing command of III Corps, Rawat was appointed General Officer Commanding Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Goa Area, headquartered in Mumbai. After a short stint, he was promoted to the Army Commander grade and assumed the post of General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) Southern Command on 1 January 2016. After an eight-month tenure, he assumed the post of Vice Chief of the Army Staff on 1 September 2016.\n\nChief of the Army Staff\nOn 17 December 2016, the Government of India appointed Rawat as the 27th Chief of the Army Staff, superseding two more senior Lieutenant Generals, Praveen Bakshi (Eastern Army Commander) and P M Hariz (Southern Army Commander). The appointment made by the NDA-ruled Government was politically controversial. Rawat was accused of nepotism and gratuitously politicizing the appointment by senior serving and retired military officers.\n\nDoklam Standoff with Chinese Army\nIn 2017, at Doklam, a 73-day military border standoff happened between the Indian Armed Forces and the People's Liberation Army of China over Chinese construction of a road in Doklam near a trijunction border area between Bhutan, China, and India. After the standoff ended, Rawat said China had begun 'flexing its muscles' and was trying to 'nibble away' territory held by India in a gradual manner to test the limits of thresholds. He stated, India had to be \"wary about\" China, \"and remain prepared for situations that could develop into conflicts.\"\n\nOn Pakistan\nRawat said that India did not \"see any scope for reconciliation with Pakistan as its military, polity, and people have decided that India wants to break their country into pieces.\" Rawat suspected Pakistan could \"swing into action to take advantage of India's preoccupation with China\" and thus highlighted a two-front war situation without offering a solution or remedy.\n\nTwo-Front War\nUntil 2019, Rawat had given statements warning India to be prepared for a simultaneous war on two fronts against China and Pakistan. In September 2017, during a seminar in Delhi, Rawat said that \"warfare lies within the realm of reality\" along India's borders with China and Pakistan, even though all three countries have nuclear arms. According to critics, Rawat neither prepared for such an outcome nor initiated measures to thwart it.\n\nBilateral Visits as Chief of the Army Staff\nHe served as the first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) of the Indian Armed Forces from January 2020 until his death in December 2021.\n\nChief of Defence Staff\nHe served as the first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) of the Indian Armed Forces from January 2020 until his death in December 2021.\n\nComments on Supremacy of Army\nRawat put emphasis on the 'supremacy and primacy' of the Indian Army over the Air Force and Navy, in fighting wars. Rawat had stated, \"Wars will be fought on land, and therefore the primacy of the army must be maintained over the air force and navy. The statement had antagonized the Air Force and Navy.\n\nLadakh Standoff with Chinese Army\nOn 15 September 2021, while speaking at an event in the capacity of the CDS at the India International Centre in New Delhi, General Rawat touched upon the theory of clash of civilizations with regards to the western civilization and China's growing relations with countries like Iran and Turkey. The next day, on 16 September 2021, India's Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar conveyed to his Chinese counterpart that India does not subscribe to any clash of civilizations theory.\n\nPersonal Life\nIn 1985, Rawat married Madhulika Rawat (née Raje Singh). A descendant of an erstwhile princely family, she was the daughter of Kunwar Mrigendra Singh, sometime Riyasatdar of the pargana of Sohagpur (Shahdol) Riyasat in Shahdol district and an Indian National Congress MLA from the district in 1967 and 1972. She was educated at Scindia Kanya Vidyalaya in Gwalior and graduated in psychology at the University of Delhi. The couple had two daughters, Kritika and Tarini.\n\nDeath and Legacy\nOn 8 December 2021, Rawat, his wife, and members of his staff were amongst 10 passengers and 4 crew members aboard an Indian Air Force Mil Mi-17 helicopter flight en route from the Sulur Air Force Base to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC), Wellington, where Rawat was to deliver a lecture. At around 12:10 p.m. local time, the aircraft crashed near a residential colony of private tea estate employees on the outskirts of the hamlet of Nanjappachatiram, Bandishola panchayat, in the Katteri-Nanchappanchathram area of Coonoor taluk, Nilgiris district. The crash site was 10 kilometers (6.2 mi; 5.4 nmi) from the flight's intended destination. Rawat's death – and those of his wife and 11 others – was later confirmed by the Indian Air Force. Rawat's liaison officer, Group Captain Varun Singh, initially survived the incident, but later succumbed to injuries on 15 December. Rawat was 63 at the time of his death.\n\nHonours and Decorations\nDuring his career of nearly 43 years, he was awarded multiple times for gallantry and distinguished service.

that he was a heavy drinker; and that he had threatened Betsy, who had considered leaving him [2] At Hupp's behest, police searched Betsy's laptop and found a document in which she purportedly expressed fears that her husband would kill her It was later revealed that the document was written in Word 97, software that had not been installed on the laptop; it was the only document on the laptop with an \"unknown\" author [2] [22] On January 4, 2012, the day after Betsy's funeral, Russ was charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action [6] Unable to make $250,000 bail (equivalent to $332,000 in 2023), he was held in the county jail until his trial began on November 18, 2013 [21]\n\n\nRetrial and acquittal of Russ Faria\nAn initial motion for a new trial was rejected by Judge Christina Mennemeyer in December 2013 [29] In January 2014, KTVI partnered with the St Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper to review the case The next month, the Post-Dispatch reported that Hupp had kept the $150,000 rather than put it into a trust for Betsy's daughters She had also contradicted herself during police interviews, such as initially claiming she had not entered the Faria house after driving Betsy home but later revising this account twice The 9-1-1 operator who had taken Russ' call believed he had been genuinely shocked and upset The article alleged that Askey, the prosecutor, had been in a relationship with Mike Lang, the captain of investigations for the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office and one of the investigating officers in the Faria murder case, as well as a prosecution witness [2] [14] [31] Two members of the jury in Russ' trial informed the media that this information had been withheld [23] [32] In August 2015, Robin Taylor of Le Mars, Iowa was charged with misdemeanor harassment of Hupp by phoning her and accusing her of having killed Betsy [33]\n\n\nCharging of Pam Hupp\nIn June 2019, after Hupp entered an Alford plea to the murder of Louis Gumpenberger, Lincoln County prosecuting attorney Mike Wood announced that he would be reopening the Betsy Faria homicide investigation [54] [55] In October 2019, Wood requested a case review by the Major Case Squad of Greater St Louis [56] In August 2020, newly elected Lincoln County Sheriff Rick Harrell said that the Faria case had inspired him to run for the job [57] In February 2021, Wood stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had slowed the investigation, but that he expected \"significant announcements\" in the summer or fall [58] On July 8, 2021, Hupp was interviewed in connection with the murder of Betsy for the first time [59]\n\n\nDeath of Shirley Neumann\nShirley Mae Neumann, Hupp's mother, a widow since 2000, was living alone in a third-floor apartment in the Lakeview Park Independent Senior Living Community in Fenton, [80] suffering from dementia and arthritis [81] She spent the night of October 29, 2013, with Hupp following a hospital visit At approximately 5 p.m on October 30, Hupp dropped Neumann off at her apartment, instructing staff not to expect her for dinner that evening or breakfast the following day [2] A housekeeper found Neumann dead beneath the balcony of her home at 2:30 p.m the next day The aluminum balcony railing was broken Following a police investigation, assistant medical examiner Raj Nanduri concluded that Neumann had died from blunt trauma to the chest resulting from an accidental fall [80] An autopsy found that she had .84 mcg of the sedative Zolpidem in her blood, over eight times the expected concentration for someone having taken a normal dose [2]\n\n\nMurder of Louis Gumpenberger\nLouis Royse Gumpenberger was a resident of Union, Missouri, 33 years old at his death [86] He had mental and physical disabilities after a car crash in 2005 [2] [87]\nShortly after 12:00 noon on August 16, 2016, Louis Gumpenberger died after Hupp shot him five times in the hallway of her home at 1260 Little Brave Drive in O'Fallon [88] [89] $900 (equivalent to $1,143 in 2023) was found on Gumpenberger's body along with a note bearing instructions to \"kidnap Hupp, get Russ's money from Hupp at her bank, and kill Hupp\" and to, \"Take Hupp back to house and get rid of her Make it look like Russ' wife Make sure knife sticking out of neck\" in return for a reward of $10,000 (equivalent to $12,696 in 2023) [90] As Hupp had placed two calls to 9-1-1 shortly before the shooting to report a burglary in progress, the audio of the incident was recorded [86] [88] [91]\n\n\nGuilty plea\nOn August 23, 2016, Hupp was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action [86] Upon being arrested, she asked to visit a bathroom, where she used a ballpoint pen to stab her neck and wrists in an apparent suicide attempt; [2] St Charles County assistant prosecutor Phil Groenweghe described the act as \"consciousness of guilt\" [107] Bail for Hupp was set at $2,000,000 (equivalent to $2,539,000 in 2023) [86] [98] On December 16, a grand jury indicted Hupp on the charges [108] She appeared in court on January 31, 2017, pleading not guilty In March 2017, prosecutors stated that they would seek the death penalty due to the apparently arbitrary choice of Gumpenberger as the victim [95] In May 2018, 11th Circuit Court judge Jon Cunningham ruled that prosecutors could not present evidence relating to the death of Hupp's mother; [109] the following month, Cunningham ruled that prosecutors could present evidence relating to the killing of Betsy Faria [110] In August 2018, Hupp's trial date was set for June 2019 [111]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nSt Louis station KTVI broke the Betsy Faria story, reporting continuously on the case from December 28, 2011, through 2022, generating more than fifty reports and investigations Chris Hayes of KTVI was the only reporter to attend Russ' first trial in November 2013, and the first to report questions about Hupp that same month;

The 9-1-1 operator who took Russ' call believed that he was genuinely shocked and upset. Despite this, Russ was held in the county jail until his trial began on November 18, 2013. An initial motion for a new trial was rejected, and Russ was eventually acquitted.\n\n**Retrial and Acquittal of Russ Faria**\n\nAfter Russ' acquittal, questions arose about the credibility of Hupp's testimony. It was revealed that Hupp had kept $150,000 from Betsy's estate rather than putting it into a trust for her daughters. Additionally, Hupp had been in a relationship with an officer involved in the investigation, which raised concerns about bias. As a result, Russ was retried, and on August 8, 2015, he was acquitted of all charges.\n\n**Charging of Pam Hupp**\n\nOn June 14, 2019, after Hupp entered an Alford plea to the murder of Louis Gumpenberger, Lincoln County prosecuting attorney Mike Wood announced that he would be reopening the Betsy Faria homicide investigation. In October 2019, Wood requested a case review by the Major Case Squad of Greater St. Louis. On July 8, 2021, Hupp was interviewed in connection with the murder of Betsy for the first time.\n\n**Death of Shirley Neumann**\n\nShirley Mae Neumann, Hupp's mother, was living alone in a third-floor apartment in the Lakeview Park Independent Senior Living Community in Fenton. She spent the nigh", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Pam_Hupp\" following this outline:\n\n\nPrior life\nPamela Marie Neumann (\"Pam\") was born on October 10, 1958 [1] She grew up in Dellwood, Missouri (a suburb of St Louis) where she attended Riverview Gardens High School In her young adulthood she held several jobs in the life insurance industry; on two occasions, she was fired for forging signatures In 2001, Hupp and her husband settled in O'Fallon, Missouri, where she worked as an administrator for State Farm and flipped houses on the side via a company called H2 Partners LLC By 2010, Hupp had stopped working and was claiming disability benefits for back, leg, and neck pain [2] [3]\n\n\nDeath of Betsy Faria\nElizabeth Kay Meyer Faria (\"Betsy\") was a coworker of Hupp at State Farm She lived on Sumac Drive in Troy, Missouri, with her husband, Russell Scott Faria (\"Russ\"), and two daughters from a previous relationship [5] In 2010, she was diagnosed with breast cancer In October 2011, Betsy learned the cancer had metastasized to her liver [6] and was terminal [7]\n\n\nConviction of Russ Faria\nRuss was arrested the day after his wife's death [17] His initial assertion that Betsy had killed herself was considered \"ludicrous\" by first responders who saw her body A police search of the house unearthed a bloodstained pair of slippers in his closet His agitated emotional state was regarded as \"suspicious\" by police, and he ostensibly failed a polygraph test When interviewed by police, Hupp claimed that Russ had a \"violent temper\"; that he was a heavy drinker; and that he had threatened Betsy, who had considered leaving him [2] At Hupp's behest, police searched Betsy's laptop and found a document in which she purportedly expressed fears that her husband would kill her It was later revealed that the document was written in Word 97, software that had not been installed on the laptop; it was the only document on the laptop with an \"unknown\" author [2] [22] On January 4, 2012, the day after Betsy's funeral, Russ was charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action [6] Unable to make $250,000 bail (equivalent to $332,000 in 2023), he was held in the county jail until his trial began on November 18, 2013 [21]\n\n\nRetrial and acquittal of Russ Faria\nAn initial motion for a new trial was rejected by Judge Christina Mennemeyer in December 2013 [29] In January 2014, KTVI partnered with the St Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper to review the case The next month, the Post-Dispatch reported that Hupp had kept the $150,000 rather than put it into a trust for Betsy's daughters She had also contradicted herself during police interviews, such as initially claiming she had not entered the Faria house after driving Betsy home but later revising this account twice The 9-1-1 operator who had taken Russ' call believed he had been genuinely shocked and upset The article alleged that Askey, the prosecutor, had been in a relationship with Mike Lang, the captain of investigations for the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office and one of the investigating officers in the Faria murder case, as well as a prosecution witness [2] [14] [31] Two members of the jury in Russ' trial informed the media that this information had been withheld [23] [32] In August 2015, Robin Taylor of Le Mars, Iowa was charged with misdemeanor harassment of Hupp by phoning her and accusing her of having killed Betsy [33]\n\n\nCharging of Pam Hupp\nIn June 2019, after Hupp entered an Alford plea to the murder of Louis Gumpenberger, Lincoln County prosecuting attorney Mike Wood announced that he would be reopening the Betsy Faria homicide investigation [54] [55] In October 2019, Wood requested a case review by the Major Case Squad of Greater St Louis [56] In August 2020, newly elected Lincoln County Sheriff Rick Harrell said that the Faria case had inspired him to run for the job [57] In February 2021, Wood stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had slowed the investigation, but that he expected \"significant announcements\" in the summer or fall [58] On July 8, 2021, Hupp was interviewed in connection with the murder of Betsy for the first time [59]\n\n\nDeath of Shirley Neumann\nShirley Mae Neumann, Hupp's mother, a widow since 2000, was living alone in a third-floor apartment in the Lakeview Park Independent Senior Living Community in Fenton, [80] suffering from dementia and arthritis [81] She spent the night of October 29, 2013, with Hupp following a hospital visit At approximately 5 p.m on October 30, Hupp dropped Neumann off at her apartment, instructing staff not to expect her for dinner that evening or breakfast the following day [2] A housekeeper found Neumann dead beneath the balcony of her home at 2:30 p.m the next day The aluminum balcony railing was broken Following a police investigation, assistant medical examiner Raj Nanduri concluded that Neumann had died from blunt trauma to the chest resulting from an accidental fall [80] An autopsy found that she had .84 mcg of the sedative Zolpidem in her blood, over eight times the expected concentration for someone having taken a normal dose [2]\n\n\nMurder of Louis Gumpenberger\nLouis Royse Gumpenberger was a resident of Union, Missouri, 33 years old at his death [86] He had mental and physical disabilities after a car crash in 2005 [2] [87]\nShortly after 12:00 noon on August 16, 2016, Louis Gumpenberger died after Hupp shot him five times in the hallway of her home at 1260 Little Brave Drive in O'Fallon [88] [89] $900 (equivalent to $1,143 in 2023) was found on Gumpenberger's body along with a note bearing instructions to \"kidnap Hupp, get Russ's money from Hupp at her bank, and kill Hupp\" and to, \"Take Hupp back to house and get rid of her Make it look like Russ' wife Make sure knife sticking out of neck\" in return for a reward of $10,000 (equivalent to $12,696 in 2023) [90] As Hupp had placed two calls to 9-1-1 shortly before the shooting to report a burglary in progress, the audio of the incident was recorded [86] [88] [91]\n\n\nGuilty plea\nOn August 23, 2016, Hupp was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action [86] Upon being arrested, she asked to visit a bathroom, where she used a ballpoint pen to stab her neck and wrists in an apparent suicide attempt; [2] St Charles County assistant prosecutor Phil Groenweghe described the act as \"consciousness of guilt\" [107] Bail for Hupp was set at $2,000,000 (equivalent to $2,539,000 in 2023) [86] [98] On December 16, a grand jury indicted Hupp on the charges [108] She appeared in court on January 31, 2017, pleading not guilty In March 2017, prosecutors stated that they would seek the death penalty due to the apparently arbitrary choice of Gumpenberger as the victim [95] In May 2018, 11th Circuit Court judge Jon Cunningham ruled that prosecutors could not present evidence relating to the death of Hupp's mother; [109] the following month, Cunningham ruled that prosecutors could present evidence relating to the killing of Betsy Faria [110] In August 2018, Hupp's trial date was set for June 2019 [111]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nSt Louis station KTVI broke the Betsy Faria story, reporting continuously on the case from December 28, 2011, through 2022, generating more than fifty reports and investigations Chris Hayes of KTVI was the only reporter to attend Russ' first trial in November 2013, and the first to report questions about Hupp that same month; upon his release from prison, Russ thanked Hayes for his coverage [126]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

than was typical at the time [7] Franklin had a half-brother, James Roosevelt \"Rosy\" Roosevelt, from his father's previous marriage [4]\n\n\nEducation and early career\nAs a child, Roosevelt learned to ride, shoot, sail, and play polo, tennis, and golf [8] [9] Frequent trips to Europe—beginning at age two and from age seven to fifteen—helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French Except for attending public school in Germany at age nine, [10] Roosevelt was homeschooled by tutors until age 14 He then attended Groton School, an Episcopal boarding school in Groton, Massachusetts [11] He was not among the more popular Groton students, who were better athletes and had rebellious streaks [12] Its headmaster, Endicott Peabody, preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service Peabody remained a strong influence throughout Roosevelt's life, officiating at his wedding and visiting him as president [13] [14]\n\n\nMarriage, family, and extramarital affairs\nDuring his second year of college, Roosevelt met and proposed to Boston heiress Alice Sohier, who turned him down [12] Franklin then began courting his childhood acquaintance and fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt, a niece of Theodore Roosevelt [28] In 1903, Franklin proposed to Eleanor Despite resistance from his mother, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were married on March 17, 1905 [12] [29] Eleanor's father, Elliott, was deceased; Theodore, who was then president, gave away the bride [30] The young couple moved into Springwood Franklin's mother, Sara Roosevelt, also provided a townhouse for the newlyweds in New York City, and had a house built for herself alongside that townhouse Eleanor never felt at home in the houses at Hyde Park or New York; however, she loved the family's vacation home on Campobello Island, which was also a gift from Sara [31]\n\n\nEarly political career (1910–1920)\nRoosevelt cared little for the practice of law and told friends he planned to enter politics [45] Despite his admiration for cousin Theodore, Franklin shared his father's bond with the Democratic Party, and in preparation for the 1910 elections, the party recruited Roosevelt to run for a seat in the New York State Assembly [46] Roosevelt was a compelling recruit: he had the personality and energy for campaigning and the money to pay for his own campaign [47] But Roosevelt's campaign for the state assembly ended after the Democratic incumbent, Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, chose to seek re-election Rather than putting his political hopes on hold, Roosevelt ran for a seat in the state senate [48] The senate district, located in Dutchess, Columbia, and Putnam, was strongly Republican [49] Roosevelt feared that opposition from Theodore could end his campaign, but Theodore encouraged his candidacy despite their party differences [46] Acting as his own campaign manager, Roosevelt traveled throughout the senate district via automobile at a time when few could afford a car [50] Due to his aggressive campaign, [51] his name gained recognition in the Hudson Valley, and in the Democratic landslide in the 1910 United States elections, Roosevelt won a surprising victory [52]\n\n\nNew York state senator (1910–1913)\nRoosevelt cared little for the practice of law and told friends he planned to enter politics [45] Despite his admiration for cousin Theodore, Franklin shared his father's bond with the Democratic Party, and in preparation for the 1910 elections, the party recruited Roosevelt to run for a seat in

his aggressive campaign, [51] his name gained recognition in the Hudson Valley, and in the Democratic landslide in the 1910 United States elections, Roosevelt won a surprising victory [52]\n\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Navy (1913–1919)\nRoosevelt's support of Wilson led to his appointment in March 1913 as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, the second-ranking official in the Navy Department after Secretary Josephus Daniels who paid it little attention [60] Roosevelt had an affection for the Navy, was well-read on the subject, and was an ardent supporter of a large, efficient force [61] [62] With Wilson's support, Daniels and Roosevelt instituted a merit-based promotion system and extended civilian control over the autonomous departments of the Navy [63] Roosevelt oversaw the Navy's civilian employees and earned the respect of union leaders for his fairness in resolving disputes [64] No strikes occurred during his seven-plus years in the office, [65] as he gained valuable experience in labor issues, wartime management, naval issues, and logistics [66]\n\n\nCampaign for vice president (1920)\nRoosevelt's plan for Hoover to run fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself to be a Republican, but Roosevelt decided to seek the 1920 vice presidential nomination After Governor James M Cox of Ohio won the party's presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the convention nominated him by acclamation [82] Although his nomination surprised most people, he balanced the ticket as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a prohibitionist with a famous name [83] [84] Roosevelt, then 38, resigned as Assistant Secretary after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the party ticket [85]\n\n\nParalytic illness and political comeback (1921–1928)\n Roosevelt sought to build support for a political comeback in the 1922 elections, but his career was derailed by an illness [90] It began while the Roosevelts were vacationing at Campobello Island in August 1921 His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down and was diagnosed with polio A 2003 study strongly favored a diagnosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome, [91] but historians have continued to describe his paralysis according to the initial diagnosis [92] [93] [94] [95]\n\n\nGovernor of New York (1929–1932)\nSmith, the Democratic presidential nominee in the 1928 presidential election, asked Roosevelt to run for governor of New York in the 1928 state election [113] Roosevelt initially resisted, as he was reluctant to leave Warm Springs and feared a Republican landslide [114] Party leaders eventually convinced him only he could defeat the Republican gubernatorial nominee, New York Attorney General Albert Ottinger [115] He won the party's gubernatorial nomination by acclamation and again turned to Howe to lead his campaign Roosevelt was joined on the campaign trail by associates Samuel Rosenman, Frances Perkins, and James Farley [116] While Smith lost the presidency in a landslide, and was defeated in his home state, Roosevelt was elected governor by a one-percent margin, [117] and became a contender in the next presidential election [118]\n\n\n1932 presidential election\nAs the 1932 presidential election approached, Roosevelt turned his attention to national politics, established a campaign team led by Howe and Farley, and a \"brain trust\" of policy advisers, primarily composed of Columbia University and Harvard University professors [131] Some were not so sanguine about his chances, such as Walter Lippmann, the dean of political commentators, who observed: \"He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.\" [132]\n\n\nTransition and assassination attempt\nRoosevelt was elected in November 1932 but like his predecessors did not take office until the following March [d] After the election, President Hoover sought to convince Roosevelt to renounce much of his campaign platform and to endorse the Hoover administration's policies [143] Roosevelt refused Hoover's request to develop a joint program to stop the economic decline, claiming that it would tie his hands and that Hoover had the power to act [144]\n\n\nPresidency (1933–1945)\nAs president, Roosevelt appointed powerful men to top positions in government However, he made all of his administration's major decisions himself, regardless of any delays, inefficiencies, or resentments doing so may have caused Analyzing the president's administrative style, Burns concludes:\n\n\nFirst and second terms (1933–1941)\nWhen Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, the U.S was at the nadir of the worst depression in its history A quarter of the workforce was unemployed, and farmers were in deep trouble as prices had fallen by 60% Industrial production had fallen by more than half since 1929 Two million people were homeless By the evening of March 4, 32 of the 48 states—as well as the District of Columbia—had closed their banks [149]\n\n\nFirst New Deal (1933–1934)\nOn his second day in office, Roosevelt declared a four-day national \"bank holiday\", to end the run by depositors seeking to withdraw funds [152] He called for a special session of Congress on March 9, when Congress passed, almost sight unseen, the Emergency Banking Act [152] The act, first developed by the Hoover administration and Wall Street bankers, gave the president the power to determine the opening and closing of banks and authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to issue banknotes [153] The \"first 100 Days\" of the 73rd United States Congress saw an unprecedented amount of legislation and set a benchmark against which future presidents have been compared [154] [155] When the banks reopened on Monday, March 15, stock prices rose by 15 percent and in the following weeks over $1 billion was returned to bank vaults, ending the bank panic [152] On March 22, Roosevelt signed the Cullen–Harrison Act, which brought Prohibition to a close [156]\n\n\nSecond New Deal (1935–1936)\nRoosevelt expected that his party would lose seats in the 1934 Congressional elections, as the president's party had done in most previous midterm elections; the Democrats gained seats instead Empowered by the public's vote of confidence, the first item on Roosevelt's agenda in the 74th Congress was the creation of a social insurance program [167] The Social Security Act established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor, and the sick Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, \"We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.\" [168] Compared with the social security systems in Western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative But for the first time, the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and disabled people [169] Against Roosevelt's original intention for universal coverage, the act excluded farmers, domestic workers, and other groups, which made up about forty percent of the labor force [170]\n\n\nElection of 1936\nEight million workers remained unemployed in 1936, and though economic conditions had improved since 1932, they remained sluggish By 1936, Roosevelt had lost the backing he once held in the business community because of his support for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Social Security Act [132] The Republicans had few alternative candidates and nominated Kansas Governor Alf Landon, a little-known bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover [179] While Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs and continued to attack Hoover, Landon sought to win voters who approved of the goals of the New Deal but disagreed with its implementation [180]\n\n\nSupreme Court fight and second term legislation\nThe Supreme Court became Roosevelt's primary domestic focus during his second term after the court overturned many of his programs, including NIRA The more conservative members of the court upheld the principles of the Lochner era, which saw numerous economic regulations struck down on the basis of freedom of contract [186] Roosevelt proposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70; in 1937, there were six Supreme Court Justices over the age of 70 The size of the Court had been set at nine since the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1869, and Congress had altered the number of Justices six other times throughout U.S history [187] Roosevelt's \"court packing\" plan ran into intense political opposition from his own party, led by Vice President Garner since it upset the separation of powers [188] A bipartisan coalition of liberals and conservatives of both parties opposed the bill, and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes broke with precedent by publicly advocating the defeat of the bill Any chance of passing the bill ended with the death of Senate Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson in July 1937 [189]\n\n\nConservation and the environment\nRoosevelt had a lifelong interest in the environment and conservation starting with his youthful interest in forestry on his family estate Although he was never an outdoorsman or sportsman on Theodore Roosevelt's scale, his growth of the national systems was comparable [200] [201] When Franklin was Governor of New York, the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration was essentially a state-level predecessor of the federal Civilian Conservation Corps, with 10,000 or more men building fire trails, combating soil erosion and planting tree seedlings in marginal farmland in New York [202] As President, Roosevelt was active in expanding, funding, and promoting the National Park and National Forest systems [203] Their popularity soared, from three million visitors a year at the start of the decade to 15.5 million in 1939 [204] The Civilian Conservation Corps enrolled 3.4 million young men and built 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometers) of trails, planted two billion trees, and upgraded 125,000 miles (201,000 kilometers) of dirt roads Every state had its own state parks, and Roosevelt made sure that WPA and CCC projects were set up to upgrade them as well as the national systems [205] [206] [207]\n\n\nGNP and unemployment rates\nGovernment spending increased from 8.0% of the gross national product (GNP) under Hoover in 1932 to 10.2% in 1936 The national debt as a percentage of the GNP had more than doubled under Hoover from 16% to 40% of the GNP in early 1933 It held steady at close to 40% as late as fall 1941, then grew rapidly during the war [209] The GNP was 34% higher in 1936 than in 1932 and 58% higher in 1940 on the eve of war That is, the economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940, and then grew 56% from 1940 to 1945 in five years of wartime [209] Unemployment fell dramatically during Roosevelt's first term It increased in 1938 (\"a depression within a depression\") but continually declined after 1938 [208] Total employment during Roosevelt's term expanded by 18.31 million jobs, with an average annual increase in jobs during his administration of 5.3% [210] [211]\n\n\nForeign policy (1933–1941)\nThe main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt's first term was the Good Neighbor Policy, which was a re-evaluation of U.S policy toward Latin America The United States frequently intervened in Latin America following the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, and occupied several Latin American nations during the Banana Wars that occurred following the Spanish–American War of 1898 After Roosevelt took office, he withdrew U.S forces from Haiti and reached new treaties with Cuba and Panama, ending their status as U.S protectorates In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the Montevideo Convention, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries [212] Roosevelt also normalized relations with the Soviet Union, which the United States had refused to recognize since the 1920s [213] He hoped to renegotiate the Russian debt from World War I and open trade relations, but no progress was made on either issue and \"both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord.\" [214]\n\n\nElection of 1940\nIn the months prior to the July 1940 Democratic National Convention, there was much speculation as to whether Roosevelt would run for an unprecedented third term The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the Constitution, [i] had been established by George Washington when he refused to run for a third term in 1796 Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination Farley and Vice President John Garner were not pleased with Roosevelt when he ultimately made the decision to break from Washington's precedent [132] [235] As Germany swept through Western Europe and menaced Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee [236]\n\n\nThird and fourth terms (1941–1945)\nWorld War II dominated Roosevelt's attention, with far more time devoted to world affairs than ever before Domestic politics and relations with Congress were largely shaped by his efforts to achieve total mobilization of the nation's economic, financial, and institutional resources for the war effort Even relationships with Latin America and Canada were structured by wartime demands Roosevelt maintained close personal control of all major diplomatic and military decisions, working closely with his generals and admirals, the war and Navy departments, the British, and even the Soviet Union His key advisors on diplomacy were Harry Hopkins in the White House, Sumner Welles in the State Department, and Henry Morgenthau Jr at Treasury In military affairs, Roosevelt worked most closely with Secretary Henry L Stimson at the War Department, Army Chief of Staff George Marshall, and Admiral William D Leahy [243] [244] [245]\n\n\nLead-up to the war\nBy late 1940, re-armament was in high gear, partly to expand and re-equip the Army and Navy and partly to become the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" for Britain and other countries [246] With his Four Freedoms speech in January 1941, which proposed four fundamental freedoms that people \"everywhere in the world\" ought to enjoy: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear, Roosevelt laid out the case for an Allied battle for basic rights throughout the world Assisted by Willkie, Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the Lend-Lease program, which directed massive military and economic aid to Britain and China [247] In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I, there would be no repayment [248] As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against Japan, Germany, and Italy, American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee vehemently attacked Roosevelt as an irresponsible warmonger [249] When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend-Lease to the Soviets Thus, Roosevelt had committed the U.S to the Allied side with a policy of \"all aid short of war\" [250] By July 1941, Roosevelt authorized the creation of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to counter perceived propaganda efforts in Latin America by Germany and Italy [251] [252]\n\n\nPearl Harbor and declarations of war\nAfter the German invasion of Poland, the primary concern of both Roosevelt and his top military staff was on the war in Europe, but Japan also presented foreign policy challenges Relations with Japan had continually deteriorated since its invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and worsened further with Roosevelt's support of China [257] After Roosevelt announced a $100 million loan (equivalent to $2.2 billion in 2023) to China in reaction to Japan's occupation of northern French Indochina, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy; Germany, Japan, and Italy became known as the Axis powers [258] In July 1941, after Japan occupied the remainder of French Indochina, Roosevelt cut off the sale of oil to Japan, depriving Japan of more than 95 percent of its oil supply [259] He also placed the Philippine military under American command and reinstated General Douglas MacArthur into active duty to command U.S forces in the Philippines [260]\n\n\nWar plans\nIn late December 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met at the Arcadia Conference, which established a joint strategy between the U.S and Britain.\nBoth agreed on a Europe first strategy that prioritized the defeat of Germany before Japan The U.S and Britain established the Combined Chiefs of Staff to coordinate military policy and the Combined Munitions Assignments Board to coordinate the allocation of supplies [269] An agreement was also reached to establish a centralized command in the Pacific theater called ABDA, named for the American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces in the theater [270] On January 1, 1942, the United States and the other Allied Powers issued the Declaration by United Nations, in which each nation pledged to defeat the Axis powers [271]\n\n\nNuclear program\nIn August 1939, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein sent the Einstein–Szilárd letter to Roosevelt, warning of the possibility of a German project to develop nuclear weapons Szilard realized that the recently discovered process of nuclear fission could be used to create a weapon of mass destruction [276] Roosevelt feared the consequences of allowing Germany to have sole possession of the technology and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons [l] After Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration secured funding to continue research and selected General Leslie Groves to oversee the Manhattan Project, which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to jointly pursue the project, and Roosevelt helped ensure that American scientists cooperated with their British counterparts [278]\n\n\nWartime conferences\nRoosevelt coined the term \"Four Policemen\" to refer to the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II: the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China The \"Big Three\" of Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, together with Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West; Soviet troops fought on the Eastern front; and Chinese, British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific The United States also continued to send aid via the Lend-Lease program to the Soviet Union and other countries The Allies formulated strategy in a series of high-profile conferences as well as by contact through diplomatic and military channels [279] Beginning in May 1942, the Soviets urged an Anglo-American invasion of German-occupied France to divert troops from the Eastern front [280] Concerned that their forces were not yet ready, Churchill and Roosevelt decided to delay such an invasion until at least 1943 and instead focus on a landing in North Africa, known as Operation Torch [281]\n\n\nCourse of the war\nThe Allies invaded French North Africa in November 1942, securing the surrender of Vichy French forces within days of landing [289] At the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, the Allies agreed to defeat Axis forces in North Africa and then launch an invasion of Sicily, with an attack on France to take place in 1944 At the conference, Roosevelt also announced that he would only accept the unconditional surrender of Germany, Japan, and Italy [290] In February 1943, the Soviet Union won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, and in May 1943, the Allies secured the surrender of over 250,000 German and Italian soldiers in North Africa, ending the North African Campaign [291] The Allies launched an invasion of Sicily in July 1943, capturing the island the following month [292] In September 1943, the Allies secured an armistice from Italian prime minister Pietro Badoglio, but Germany quickly restored Mussolini to power [292] The Allied invasion of mainland Italy commenced in September 1943, but the Italian Campaign continued until 1945 as German and Italian troops resisted the Allied advance [293]\n\n\nHome front\nThe home front was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war, though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt's most urgent policy concern The military buildup spurred economic growth Unemployment fell from 7.7 million in spring 1940 to 3.4 million in fall 1941 and to 1.5 million in fall 1942, out of a labor force of 54 million [m] There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded [300] The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal withholding tax [301] In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation to tax all \"unreasonable\" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures Congress overrode Roosevelt's veto to pass a smaller revenue bill raising $2 billion [302]\n\n\nDeclining health\nRoosevelt, a chain-smoker throughout his adult life, [311] [312] had been in declining health since at least 1940 In March 1944, shortly after his 62nd birthday, he underwent testing at Bethesda Hospital and was found to have hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease causing angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure [313] [314] [315]\n\n\nElection of 1944\nWhile some Democrats had opposed Roosevelt's nomination in 1940, the president faced little difficulty in securing his re-nomination at the 1944 Democratic National Convention Roosevelt made it clear before the convention that he was seeking another term, and on the lone presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt won the vast majority of delegates, although a minority of Southern Democrats voted for Harry F Byrd Party leaders prevailed upon Roosevelt to drop Vice President Wallace from the ticket, believing him to be an electoral liability and a poor potential successor in case of Roosevelt's death Roosevelt preferred Byrnes as Wallace's replacement but was convinced to support Senator Harry S Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party On the second vice presidential ballot of the convention, Truman defeated Wallace to win the nomination [318]\n\n\nFinal months and death\nWhen Roosevelt returned to the United States from the Yalta Conference, many were shocked to see how old, thin and frail he looked He spoke while seated in the well of the House, an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity [321] During March 1945, he sent strongly worded messages to Stalin accusing him of breaking his Yalta commitments over Poland, Germany, prisoners of war and other issues When Stalin accused the Western Allies of plotting behind his back a separate peace with Hitler, Roosevelt replied: \"I cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers, whoever they are, for such vile misrepresentations of my actions or those of my trusted subordinates.\" [322] On March 29, 1945, Roosevelt departed for the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest before his anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations [323]\n\n\nCivil rights, repatriation, internment, and the Holocaust\nRoosevelt was viewed as a hero by many African Americans, Catholics, and Jews, and he was highly successful in attracting large majorities of these voters into his New Deal coalition [332] From his first term until 1939, the Mexican Repatriation started by President Herbert Hoover continued under Roosevelt, which scholars today contend was a form of ethnic cleansing towards Mexican Americans Roosevelt ended federal involvement in the deportations After 1934, deportations fell by approximately 50 percent [333] However, Roosevelt did not attempt to suppress the deportations on a local or state level [334] [335] Mexican Americans were the only group explicitly excluded from New Deal benefits The deprival of due process for Mexican Americans is cited as a precedent for Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II [336] Roosevelt won strong support from Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans, but not Japanese Americans, as he presided over their internment during the war [337] African Americans and Native Americans fared well in two New Deal relief programs, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Indian Reorganization Act, respectively Sitkoff reports that the WPA \"provided an economic floor for the whole black community in the 1930s, rivaling both agriculture and domestic service as the chief source\" of income [338]\n\n\nLynching and civil rights\nIn contrast to Presidents Harding and Coolidge, Roosevelt stopped short of joining NAACP leaders in pushing for federal anti-lynching legislation He asserted that such legislation was unlikely to pass and that his support for it would alienate Southern congressmen, though by 1940 even his conservative Texan vice-president, Garner, supported federal action against lynching [339]\n\n\nJapanese Americans\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor raised concerns among the public regarding the possibility of sabotage by Japanese Americans This suspicion was fed by long-standing racism against Japanese immigrants and the findings of the Roberts Commission, which concluded that the attack on Pearl Harbor had been assisted by Japanese spies On February 19, 1942, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which relocated 110,000 Japanese-American citizens and immigrants, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast [152] They were forced to liquidate their properties and businesses and interned in hastily built camps in interior, harsh locations.\n\n\nThe Holocaust\nThere is controversy among historians about Roosevelt's attitude to Jews and the Holocaust Arthur M Schlesinger Jr says Roosevelt \"did what he could do\" to help Jews; David Wyman says Roosevelt's record on Jewish refugees and their rescue is \"very poor\" and one of the worst failures of his presidency [346] In 1923, as a member of the Harvard University board of directors, Roosevelt decided there were too many Jewish students at Harvard and helped institute a quota to limit the number of Jews admitted [347] After Kristallnacht in 1938, Roosevelt had his ambassador to Germany recalled to Washington He did not loosen immigration quotas but did allow German Jews already in the U.S on visas to stay indefinitely [348] According to Rafael Medoff, Roosevelt could have saved 190,000 Jewish lives by telling his State Department to fill immigration quotas to the legal limit, but his administration discouraged and disqualified Jewish refugees based on its prohibitive requirements that left less than 25% of the quotas filled [347]\n\n\nLegacy\nRoosevelt is widely considered to be one of the most important figures in U.S history, [353] and one of the most influential figures of the 20th century [354] Historians and political scientists consistently rank Roosevelt, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln as the three greatest presidents, although the order varies [355] [356] [357] [358] Reflecting on Roosevelt's presidency, \"which brought the United States through the Great Depression and World War II to a prosperous future\", biographer Jean Edward Smith said in 2007, \"He lifted himself from a wheelchair to lift the nation from its knees.\" [359]\n\n\nHistorical reputation\nRoosevelt is widely considered to be one of the most important figures in U.S history, [353] and one of the most

his Presidential library Washington, D.C., hosts two memorials: the 7+1⁄2-acre (3-hectare) Roosevelt Memorial, located next to the Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin, [373] and a more modest memorial, a block of marble in front of the National Archives building suggested by Roosevelt himself, erected in 1965 [374] Roosevelt's leadership in the March of Dimes is one reason he is commemorated on the American dime [375] Roosevelt has also appeared on several U.S Postage stamps [376] On April 29, 1945, seventeen days after Roosevelt's death, the carrier USS Franklin D Roosevelt was launched and served from 1945 to 1977 [377] London's Westminster Abbey also has a stone tablet memorial to Roosevelt that was unveiled by Attlee and Churchill in 1948 [378] Welfare Island was

Hyde Park's historic center Roosevelt's father, James, graduated from Harvard Law School but chose not to practice law after receiving an inheritance from his grandfather [4] James, a prominent Bourbon Democrat, once took Franklin to meet President Grover Cleveland, who said to him: \"My little man, I am making a strange wish for you It is that you may never be President of the United

had a half-brother, James Roosevelt \"Rosy\" Roosevelt, from his father's previous marriage [4]\n\n\nEducation and early career\nAs a child, Roosevelt learned to ride, shoot, sail, and play polo, tennis, and golf [8] [9] Frequent trips to Europe—beginning at age two and from age seven to fifteen—helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French Except for attending public school in Germany at age nine, [10] Roosevelt was homeschooled by tutors until age 14 He then attended Groton School, an Episcopal boarding school in Groton, Massachusetts [11] He was not among the more popular Groton students, who were better athletes and had rebellious streaks [12] Its headmaster, Endicott Peabody, preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service Peabody remained a strong influence throughout Roosevelt's life, officiating at his wedding and visiting him as president [13] [14]\n\n\nMarriage, family, and extramarital affairs\nDuring his second year of college, Roosevelt met and proposed to Boston heiress Alice Sohier, who turned him down [12] Franklin then began courting his childhood acquaintance and fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt, a niece of Theodore Roosevelt [28] In 1903, Franklin proposed to Eleanor Despite resistance from his mother, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were married on March 17, 1905 [12] [29] Eleanor's father, Elliott, was deceased; Theodore, who was then president, gave away the bride [30] The young couple moved into Springwood Franklin's mother, Sara Roosevelt, also provided a townhouse for the newlyweds in New York City, and had a house built for herself alongside that townhouse Eleanor never felt at home in the houses at Hyde Park or New York; however, she loved the family's vacation home on Campobello Island, which was also a gift from Sara [31]\n\n\nEarly political career (1910–1920)\nRoosevelt cared little for the practice of law and told friends he planned to enter politics [45] Despite his admiration for cousin Theodore, Franklin shared his father's bond with the Democratic Party, and in preparation for the 1910 elections, the party recruited Roosevelt to run for a seat in the New York State Assembly [46] Roosevelt was a compelling recruit: he had the personality and energy for campaigning and the money to pay for his own campaign [47] But Roosevelt's campaign for the state assembly ended after the Democratic incumbent, Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, chose to seek re-election Rather than putting his political hopes on hold, Roosevelt ran for a seat in the state senate [48] The senate district, located in Dutchess, Columbia, and Putnam, was strongly Republican [49] Roosevelt feared that opposition from Theodore could end his campaign, but Theodore encouraged his candidacy despite their party differences [46] Acting as his own campaign manager, Roosevelt traveled throughout the senate district via automobile at a time when few could afford a car [50] Due to his aggressive campaign, [51] his name gained recognition in the Hudson Valley, and in the Democratic landslide in the 1910 United States elections, Roosevelt won a surprising victory [52]\n\n\nNew York state senator (1910–1913)\nRoosevelt cared little for the practice of law and told friends he planned to enter politics [45] Despite his admiration for cousin Theodore,

his name gained recognition in the Hudson Valley, and in the Democratic landslide in the 1910 United States elections, Roosevelt won a surprising victory [52]\n\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Navy (1913–1919)\nRoosevelt's support of Wilson led to his appointment in March 1913 as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, the second-ranking official in the Navy Department after Secretary Josephus Daniels who paid it little attention [60] Roosevelt had an affection for the Navy, was well-read on the subject, and was an ardent supporter of a large, efficient force [61] [62] With Wilson's support, Daniels and Roosevelt instituted a merit-based promotion system and extended civilian control over the autonomous departments of the Navy [63] Roosevelt oversaw the Navy's civilian employees and earned the respect of union leaders for his fairness in resolving disputes [64] No strikes occurred during his seven-plus years in the office, [65] as he gained valuable experience in labor issues, wartime management, naval issues, and logistics [66]\n\n\nCampaign for vice president (1920)\nRoosevelt's plan for Hoover to run fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself to be a Republican, but Roosevelt decided to seek the 1920 vice presidential nomination After Governor James M Cox of Ohio won the party's presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the convention nominated him by acclamation [82] Although his nomination surprised most people, he balanced the ticket as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a prohibitionist with a famous name [83] [84] Roosevelt, then 38, resigned as Assistant Secretary after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the party ticket [85]\n\n\nParalytic illness and political comeback (1921–1928)\n Roosevelt sought to build support for a political comeback in the 1922 elections, but his career was derailed by an illness [90] It began while the Roosevelts were vacationing at Campobello Island in August 1921 His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down and was diagnosed with polio A 2003 study strongly favored a diagnosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome, [91] but historians have continued to describe his paralysis according to the initial diagnosis [92] [93] [94] [95]\n\n\nGovernor of New York (1929–1932)\nSmith, the Democratic presidential nominee in the 1928 presidential election, asked Roosevelt to run for governor of New York in the 1928 state election [113] Roosevelt initially resisted, as he was reluctant to leave Warm Springs and feared a Republican landslide [114] Party leaders eventually convinced him only he could defeat the Republican gubernatorial nominee, New York Attorney General Albert Ottinger [115] He won the party's gubernatorial nomination by acclamation and again turned to Howe to lead his campaign Roosevelt was joined on the campaign trail by associates Samuel Rosenman, Frances Perkins, and James Farley [116] While Smith lost the presidency in a landslide, and was defeated in his home state, Roosevelt was elected governor by a one-percent margin, [117] and became a contender in the next presidential election [118]\n\n\n1932 presidential election\nAs the 1932 presidential election approached, Roosevelt turned his attention to national politics, established a campaign team led by Howe and Farley, and a \"brain trust\" of policy advisers, primarily composed of Columbia University and Harvard University professors [131] Some were not so sanguine about his chances, such as Walter Lippmann, the dean of political commentators, who observed: \"He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.\" [132]\n\n\nTransition and assassination attempt\nRoosevelt was elected in November 1932 but like his predecessors did not take office until the following March [d] After the election, President Hoover sought to convince Roosevelt to renounce much of his campaign platform and to endorse the Hoover administration's policies [143] Roosevelt refused Hoover's request to develop a joint program to stop the economic decline, claiming that it would tie his hands and that Hoover had the power to act [144]\n\n\nPresidency (1933–1945)\nAs president, Roosevelt appointed powerful men to top positions in government However, he made all of his administration's major decisions himself, regardless of any delays, inefficiencies, or resentments doing so may have caused Analyzing the president's administrative style, Burns concludes:\n\n\nFirst and second terms (1933–1941)\nWhen Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, the U.S was at the nadir of the worst depression in its history A quarter of the workforce was unemployed, and farmers were in deep trouble as prices had fallen by 60% Industrial production had fallen by more than half since 1929 Two million people were homeless By the evening of March 4, 32 of the 48 states—as well as the District of Columbia—had closed their banks [149]\n\n\nFirst New Deal (1933–1934)\nOn his second day in office, Roosevelt declared a four-day national \"bank holiday\", to end the run by depositors seeking to withdraw funds [152] He called for a special session of Congress on March 9, when Congress passed, almost sight unseen, the Emergency Banking Act [152] The act, first developed by the Hoover administration and Wall Street bankers, gave the president the power to determine the opening and closing of banks and authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to issue banknotes [153] The \"first 100 Days\" of the 73rd United States Congress saw an unprecedented amount of legislation and set a benchmark against which future presidents have been compared [154] [155] When the banks reopened on Monday, March 15, stock prices rose by 15 percent and in the following weeks over $1 billion was returned to bank vaults, ending the bank panic [152] On March 22, Roosevelt signed the Cullen–Harrison Act, which brought Prohibition to a close [156]\n\n\nSecond New Deal (1935–1936)\nRoosevelt expected that his party would lose seats in the 1934 Congressional elections, as the president's party had done in most previous midterm elections; the Democrats gained seats instead Empowered by the public's vote of confidence, the first item on Roosevelt's agenda in the 74th Congress was the creation of a social insurance program [167] The Social Security Act established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor, and the sick Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, \"We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.\" [168] Compared with the social security systems in Western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative But for the first time, the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and disabled people [169] Against Roosevelt's original intention for universal coverage, the act excluded farmers, domestic workers, and other groups, which made up about forty percent of the labor force [170]\n\n\nElection of 1936\nEight million workers remained unemployed in 1936, and though economic conditions had improved since 1932, they remained sluggish By 1936, Roosevelt had lost the backing he once held in the business community because of his support for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Social Security Act [132] The Republicans had few alternative candidates and nominated Kansas Governor Alf Landon, a little-known bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover [179] While Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs and continued to attack Hoover, Landon sought to win voters who approved of the goals of the New Deal but disagreed with its implementation [180]\n\n\nSupreme Court fight and second term legislation\nThe Supreme Court became Roosevelt's primary domestic focus during his second term after the court overturned many of his programs, including NIRA The more conservative members of the court upheld the principles of the Lochner era, which saw numerous economic regulations struck down on the basis of freedom of contract [186] Roosevelt proposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70; in 1937, there were six Supreme Court Justices over the age of 70 The size of the Court had been set at nine since the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1869, and Congress had altered the number of Justices six other times throughout U.S history [187] Roosevelt's \"court packing\" plan ran into intense political opposition from his own party, led by Vice President Garner since it upset the separation of powers [188] A bipartisan coalition of liberals and conservatives of both parties opposed the bill, and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes broke with precedent by publicly advocating the defeat of the bill Any chance of passing the bill ended with the death of Senate Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson in July 1937 [189]\n\n\nConservation and the environment\nRoosevelt had a lifelong interest in the environment and conservation starting with his youthful interest in forestry on his family estate Although he was never an outdoorsman or sportsman on Theodore Roosevelt's scale, his growth of the national systems was comparable [200] [201] When Franklin was Governor of New York, the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration was essentially a state-level predecessor of the federal Civilian Conservation Corps, with 10,000 or more men building fire trails, combating soil erosion and planting tree seedlings in marginal farmland in New York [202] As President, Roosevelt was active in expanding, funding, and promoting the National Park and National Forest systems [203] Their popularity soared, from three million visitors a year at the start of the decade to 15.5 million in 1939 [204] The Civilian Conservation Corps enrolled 3.4 million young men and built 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometers) of trails, planted two billion trees, and upgraded 125,000 miles (201,000 kilometers) of dirt roads Every state had its own state parks, and Roosevelt made sure that WPA and CCC projects were set up to upgrade them as well as the national systems [205] [206] [207]\n\n\nGNP and unemployment rates\nGovernment spending increased from 8.0% of the gross national product (GNP) under Hoover in 1932 to 10.2% in 1936 The national debt as a percentage of the GNP had more than doubled under Hoover from 16% to 40% of the GNP in early 1933 It held steady at close to 40% as late as fall 1941, then grew rapidly during the war [209] The GNP was 34% higher in 1936 than in 1932 and 58% higher in 1940 on the eve of war That is, the economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940, and then grew 56% from 1940 to 1945 in five years of wartime [209] Unemployment fell dramatically during Roosevelt's first term It increased in 1938 (\"a depression within a depression\") but continually declined after 1938 [208] Total employment during Roosevelt's term expanded by 18.31 million jobs, with an average annual increase in jobs during his administration of 5.3% [210] [211]\n\n\nForeign policy (1933–1941)\nThe main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt's first term was the Good Neighbor Policy, which was a re-evaluation of U.S policy toward Latin America The United States frequently intervened in Latin America following the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, and occupied several Latin American nations during the Banana Wars that occurred following the Spanish–American War of 1898 After Roosevelt took office, he withdrew U.S forces from Haiti and reached new treaties with Cuba and Panama, ending their status as U.S protectorates In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the Montevideo Convention, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries [212] Roosevelt also normalized relations with the Soviet Union, which the United States had refused to recognize since the 1920s [213] He hoped to renegotiate the Russian debt from World War I and open trade relations, but no progress was made on either issue and \"both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord.\" [214]\n\n\nElection of 1940\nIn the months prior to the July 1940 Democratic National Convention, there was much speculation as to whether Roosevelt would run for an unprecedented third term The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the Constitution, [i] had been established by George Washington when he refused to run for a third term in 1796 Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination Farley and Vice President John Garner were not pleased with Roosevelt when he ultimately made the decision to break from Washington's precedent [132] [235] As Germany swept through Western Europe and menaced Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee [236]\n\n\nThird and fourth terms (1941–1945)\nWorld War II dominated Roosevelt's attention, with far more time devoted to world affairs than ever before Domestic politics and relations with Congress were largely shaped by his efforts to achieve total mobilization of the nation's economic, financial, and institutional resources for the war effort Even relationships with Latin America and Canada were structured by wartime demands Roosevelt maintained close personal control of all major diplomatic and military decisions, working closely with his generals and admirals, the war and Navy departments, the British, and even the Soviet Union His key advisors on diplomacy were Harry Hopkins in the White House, Sumner Welles in the State Department, and Henry Morgenthau Jr at Treasury In military affairs, Roosevelt worked most closely with Secretary Henry L Stimson at the War Department, Army Chief of Staff George Marshall, and Admiral William D Leahy [243] [244] [245]\n\n\nLead-up to the war\nBy late 1940, re-armament was in high gear, partly to expand and re-equip the Army and Navy and partly to become the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" for Britain and other countries [246] With his Four Freedoms speech in January 1941, which proposed four fundamental freedoms that people \"everywhere in the world\" ought to enjoy: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear, Roosevelt laid out the case for an Allied battle for basic rights throughout the world Assisted by Willkie, Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the Lend-Lease program, which directed massive military and economic aid to Britain and China [247] In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I, there would be no repayment [248] As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against Japan, Germany, and Italy, American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee vehemently attacked Roosevelt as an irresponsible warmonger [249] When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend-Lease to the Soviets Thus, Roosevelt had committed the U.S to the Allied side with a policy of \"all aid short of war\" [250] By July 1941, Roosevelt authorized the creation of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to counter perceived propaganda efforts in Latin America by Germany and Italy [251] [252]\n\n\nPearl Harbor and declarations of war\nAfter the German invasion of Poland, the primary concern of both Roosevelt and his top military staff was on the war in Europe, but Japan also presented foreign policy challenges Relations with Japan had continually deteriorated since its invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and worsened further with Roosevelt's support of China [257] After Roosevelt announced a $100 million loan (equivalent to $2.2 billion in 2023) to China in reaction to Japan's occupation of northern French Indochina, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy; Germany, Japan, and Italy became known as the Axis powers [258] In July 1941, after Japan occupied the remainder of French Indochina, Roosevelt cut off the sale of oil to Japan, depriving Japan of more than 95 percent of its oil supply [259] He also placed the Philippine military under American command and reinstated General Douglas MacArthur into active duty to command U.S forces in the Philippines [260]\n\n\nWar plans\nIn late December 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met at the Arcadia Conference, which established a joint strategy between the U.S and Britain.\nBoth agreed on a Europe first strategy that prioritized the defeat of Germany before Japan The U.S and Britain established the Combined Chiefs of Staff to coordinate military policy and the Combined Munitions Assignments Board to coordinate the allocation of supplies [269] An agreement was also reached to establish a centralized command in the Pacific theater called ABDA, named for the American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces in the theater [270] On January 1, 1942, the United States and the other Allied Powers issued the Declaration by United Nations, in which each nation pledged to defeat the Axis powers [271]\n\n\nNuclear program\nIn August 1939, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein sent the Einstein–Szilárd letter to Roosevelt, warning of the possibility of a German project to develop nuclear weapons Szilard realized that the recently discovered process of nuclear fission could be used to create a weapon of mass destruction [276] Roosevelt feared the consequences of allowing Germany to have sole possession of the technology and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons [l] After Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration secured funding to continue research and selected General Leslie Groves to oversee the Manhattan Project, which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to jointly pursue the project, and Roosevelt helped ensure that American scientists cooperated with their British counterparts [278]\n\n\nWartime conferences\nRoosevelt coined the term \"Four Policemen\" to refer to the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II: the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China The \"Big Three\" of Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, together with Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West; Soviet troops fought on the Eastern front; and Chinese, British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific The United States also continued to send aid via the Lend-Lease program to the Soviet Union and other countries The Allies formulated strategy in a series of high-profile conferences as well as by contact through diplomatic and military channels [279] Beginning in May 1942, the Soviets urged an Anglo-American invasion of German-occupied France to divert troops from the Eastern front [280] Concerned that their forces were not yet ready, Churchill and Roosevelt decided to delay such an invasion until at least 1943 and instead focus on a landing in North Africa, known as Operation Torch [281]\n\n\nCourse of the war\nThe Allies invaded French North Africa in November 1942, securing the surrender of Vichy French forces within days of landing [289] At the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, the Allies agreed to defeat Axis forces in North Africa and then launch an invasion of Sicily, with an attack on France to take place in 1944 At the conference, Roosevelt also announced that he would only accept the unconditional surrender of Germany, Japan, and Italy [290] In February 1943, the Soviet Union won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, and in May 1943, the Allies secured the surrender of over 250,000 German and Italian soldiers in North Africa, ending the North African Campaign [291] The Allies launched an invasion of Sicily in July 1943, capturing the island the following month [292] In September 1943, the Allies secured an armistice from Italian prime minister Pietro Badoglio, but Germany quickly restored Mussolini to power [292] The Allied invasion of mainland Italy commenced in September 1943, but the Italian Campaign continued until 1945 as German and Italian troops resisted the Allied advance [293]\n\n\nHome front\nThe home front was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war, though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt's most urgent policy concern The military buildup spurred economic growth Unemployment fell from 7.7 million in spring 1940 to 3.4 million in fall 1941 and to 1.5 million in fall 1942, out of a labor force of 54 million [m] There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded [300] The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal withholding tax [301] In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation to tax all \"unreasonable\" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures Congress overrode Roosevelt's veto to pass a smaller revenue bill raising $2 billion [302]\n\n\nDeclining health\nRoosevelt, a chain-smoker throughout his adult life, [311] [312] had been in declining health since at least 1940 In March 1944, shortly after his 62nd birthday, he underwent testing at Bethesda Hospital and was found to have hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease causing angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure [313] [314] [315]\n\n\nElection of 1944\nWhile some Democrats had opposed Roosevelt's nomination in 1940, the president faced little difficulty in securing his re-nomination at the 1944 Democratic National Convention Roosevelt made it clear before the convention that he was seeking another term, and on the lone presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt won the vast majority of delegates, although a minority of Southern Democrats voted for Harry F Byrd Party leaders prevailed upon Roosevelt to drop Vice President Wallace from the ticket, believing him to be an electoral liability and a poor potential successor in case of Roosevelt's death Roosevelt preferred Byrnes as Wallace's replacement but was convinced to support Senator Harry S Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party On the second vice presidential ballot of the convention, Truman defeated Wallace to win the nomination [318]\n\n\nFinal months and death\nWhen Roosevelt returned to the United States from the Yalta Conference, many were shocked to see how old, thin and frail he looked He spoke while seated in the well of the House, an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity [321] During March 1945, he sent strongly worded messages to Stalin accusing him of breaking his Yalta commitments over Poland, Germany, prisoners of war and other issues When Stalin accused the Western Allies of plotting behind his back a separate peace with Hitler, Roosevelt replied: \"I cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers, whoever they are, for such vile misrepresentations of my actions or those of my trusted subordinates.\" [322] On March 29, 1945, Roosevelt departed for the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest before his anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations [323]\n\n\nCivil rights, repatriation, internment, and the Holocaust\nRoosevelt was viewed as a hero by many African Americans, Catholics, and Jews, and he was highly successful in attracting large majorities of these voters into his New Deal coalition [332] From his first term until 1939, the Mexican Repatriation started by President Herbert Hoover continued under Roosevelt, which scholars today contend was a form of ethnic cleansing towards Mexican Americans Roosevelt ended federal involvement in the deportations After 1934, deportations fell by approximately 50 percent [333] However, Roosevelt did not attempt to suppress the deportations on a local or state level [334] [335] Mexican Americans were the only group explicitly excluded from New Deal benefits The deprival of due process for Mexican Americans is cited as a precedent for Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II [336] Roosevelt won strong support from Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans, but not Japanese Americans, as he presided over their internment during the war [337] African Americans and Native Americans fared well in two New Deal relief programs, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Indian Reorganization Act, respectively Sitkoff reports that the WPA \"provided an economic floor for the whole black community in the 1930s, rivaling both agriculture and domestic service as the chief source\" of income [338]\n\n\nLynching and civil rights\nIn contrast to Presidents Harding and Coolidge, Roosevelt stopped short of joining NAACP leaders in pushing for federal anti-lynching legislation He asserted that such legislation was unlikely to pass and that his support for it would alienate Southern congressmen, though by 1940 even his conservative Texan vice-president, Garner, supported federal action against lynching [339]\n\n\nJapanese Americans\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor raised concerns among the public regarding the possibility of sabotage by Japanese Americans This suspicion was fed by long-standing racism against Japanese immigrants and the findings of the Roberts Commission, which concluded that the attack on Pearl Harbor had been assisted by Japanese spies On February 19, 1942, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which relocated 110,000 Japanese-American citizens and immigrants, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast [152] They were forced to liquidate their properties and businesses and interned in hastily built camps in interior, harsh locations.\n\n\nThe Holocaust\nThere is controversy among historians about Roosevelt's attitude to Jews and the Holocaust Arthur M Schlesinger Jr says Roosevelt \"did what he could do\" to help Jews; David Wyman says Roosevelt's record on Jewish refugees and their rescue is \"very poor\" and one of the worst failures of his presidency [346] In 1923, as a member of the Harvard University board of directors, Roosevelt decided there were too many Jewish students at Harvard and helped institute a quota to limit the number of Jews admitted [347] After Kristallnacht in 1938, Roosevelt had his ambassador to Germany recalled to Washington He did not loosen immigration quotas but did allow German Jews already in the U.S on visas to stay indefinitely [348] According to Rafael Medoff, Roosevelt could have saved 190,000 Jewish lives by telling his State Department to fill immigration quotas to the legal limit, but his administration discouraged and disqualified Jewish refugees based on its prohibitive requirements that left less than 25% of the quotas filled [347]\n\n\nLegacy\nRoosevelt is widely considered to be one of the most important figures in U.S history, [353] and one of the most influential figures of the 20th century [354] Historians and political scientists consistently rank Roosevelt, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln as the three greatest presidents, although the order varies [355] [356] [357] [358] Reflecting on Roosevelt's presidency, \"which brought the United States through the Great Depression and World War II to a prosperous future\", biographer Jean Edward Smith said in 2007, \"He lifted himself from a wheelchair to lift the nation from its knees.\" [359]\n\n\nHistorical reputation\nRoosevelt is widely considered to be one of the most important figures in U.S history, [353] and one of the most

his Presidential library Washington, D.C., hosts two memorials: the 7+1⁄2-acre (3-hectare) Roosevelt Memorial, located next to the Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin, [373] and a more modest memorial, a block of marble in front of the National Archives building suggested by Roosevelt himself, erected in 1965 [374] Roosevelt's leadership in the March of Dimes is one reason he is commemorated on the American dime [375] Roosevelt has also appeared on several U.S Postage stamps [376] On April 29, 1945, seventeen days after Roosevelt's death, the carrier USS Franklin D Roosevelt was launched and served from 1945 to 1977 [377] London's Westminster Abbey also has a stone tablet memorial to Roosevelt that was unveiled by Attlee and Churchill in 1948 [378] Welfare Island was renamed after Roosevelt in September 1973 [379]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

launches\nSpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with internal funding [24] [25] The Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately $90 million [26] to $100 million [20]: 215 \n\n\n2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts\nSpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5 [36] The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which committed to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006 [37] The overall contract award was $278 million to provide development funding for the Dragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon [37] As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft.\n\n\n2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth\nSpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013 In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide [50] That year Arianespace requested that European governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX [51] [52] Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S military payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA) [53] The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S provider to rise to over $400 million over the years [54] In September 2014, NASA's Director of Commercial Spaceflight, Kevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to finalize the development of the Crew Transportation System The contract included several technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after certification [41]\n\n\n2015–2017: Reusability milestones\nSpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20 [58] In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Ocean [59] By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage [60]\n\n\n2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider\nIn July 2017, the company raised $350 million, which raised its valuation to $21 billion [66] In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts [67] By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about $12 billion in contract revenue [68] The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers [69] This made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches [70]\n\n\nSince 2019: Starship, first crewed launches, Starlink and general\nIn 2019 SpaceX raised $1.33 billion of capital across three funding rounds [75] By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to $33.3 billion [76] and reached $36 billion by March 2020 [77]\n\n\n2024 headquarters move from California to Texas\nOn 16 July 2024, Elon Musk posted on X that SpaceX would move its headquarters from Hawthorne, California, to SpaceX Starbase in Brownsville, Texas Musk said this was because the recently passed California AB1955 bill \"and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies\" [97] This new law in California bans school districts from requiring that teachers notify parents about changes to a student’s sexual orientation and gender identity [98] The headquarters officially moved to Brownsville, Texas in August 2024, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State [99]\n\n\nStarship\nIn January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance the Starship and Starlink projects [101] The purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond [102] SpaceX's Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, with a payload capacity of 100+ tons [103] [104] Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas All Starship construction and testing moved to the new SpaceX South Texas launch site later that year.\n\n\nCrewed launches\nA significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first

launch vehicles, [156] [157] Draco for the reaction control system of the Dragon series of spacecraft, [158] and SuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon [159]\n\n\nDragon spacecraft\nSpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station (ISS) \n\n\nAutonomous spaceport drone ships\nSpaceX routinely returns the first stage of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches The rocket lands at a predetermined landing site using only its propulsion systems [170] When propellant margins do not permit a return to a launch site (RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform in the ocean, called autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS) [171]\n\n\nStarlink\nStarlink is an internet satellite constellation under

[192]\n\n\nCOVID-19 antibody-testing program\nIn collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of a COVID-19 antibody-testing program in 2020 As such, 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood samples resulting in a peer-reviewed scientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus [193] [194]\n\n\nOther\nIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand [195] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\" [196] [197] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand [198] [199] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission [195]\n\n\nFacilities\nSpaceX is headquartered at the SpaceX Starbase near Brownsville, Texas, where it manufactures and launches its Starship vehicle However most of the company's operations are based out of its office in Hawthorne, California where it was previously headquartered, where it builds Falcon rockets and Dragon spacecraft, and where it houses its mission control.\n\n\nHawthorne, CA: Falcon and Dragon manufacturing, mission control\nSpaceX operates a large facility in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, California The three-story building, originally built by Northrop Corporation to build Boeing 747 fuselages, [202] houses SpaceX's office space, mission control, and Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities [203]\n\n\nBoca Chica, TX: Starship manufacturing, launch\nSpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from the SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas, having announced first plans for the launch facility in August 2014 [205] [206] The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the permit in July 2014 [207] SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015, [208] with the first suborbital launches from the facility in 2019 [203] and orbital launches starting in 2023 \n\n\nMcGregor, TX: Rocket Development and Test Facility\nSpaceX's Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas is a rocket engine test facility Every rocket engine and thruster manufactured by SpaceX must pass through McGregor for final testing being used on flight missions [214] [215] The facility also serves as a testing ground for various components and engines during the research and development process [216] In addition to engine testing, after splashdown and recovery, Dragon spacecraft make a stop at McGregor to have their hazardous hypergolic propellant fuels removed, before the capsules continue on to Hawthorne for refurbishment [214]\n\n\nStarlink manufacturing facilities\nSpaceX's Starlink subsidiary operates over two main facilities Satellite manufacturing takes place near Seattle, Washington while user terminal manufacturing takes place near Austin, Texas.\n\n\nLaunch facilities\nSpaceX operates four orbital launch sites, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California for Falcon rockets, and Starbase near Brownsville, Texas for Starship SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad [226] The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral and Kennedy enable orbits of medium inclination (28.5–55°) [227] Larger inclinations, including SSO, are possible from Florida by overflying Cuba [228]\n\n\nContracts\nSpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts from NASA for the International Space Station (ISS) with technology the company developed SpaceX is also certified for U.S military launches of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads With approximately thirty missions on the manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represented over $12 billion under contract [69]\n\n\nCargo to ISS\nIn 2006, SpaceX won a NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible contract option for crew transport [237] Through this contract, designed by NASA to provide \"seed money\" through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX $396 million to develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9 launch vehicle with their resources [238] These Space Act Agreements have been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development 4–10 times less expensive than if produced by NASA alone [239]\n\n\nCrewed\nSpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA astronauts to and from the ISS The NASA contracts started as part of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in 2011, [249] [250] followed by another in 2012 to continue development and testing of its Dragon 2 spacecraft [251]\n\n\nNational defense\nIn 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, allowing the United States Air Force to purchase up to $100 million worth of launches from the company [262] Three years later, NASA announced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to $1 billion, depending on the number of missions awarded [263] In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DoD) The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center awarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Space Test Program 2 (STP-2) DSCOVR was launched on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on a Falcon Heavy on 25 June 2019 [264]\n\n\nLaunch market competition and pricing pressure\nSpaceX's low launch prices, especially for communications satellites flying to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices [18] Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying the Ariane 5) and International Launch Services (flying the Proton) [279] With a published price of $56.5 million per launch to low Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the least expensive in the industry [280] European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of the Ariane 5 and Ariane 6 rockets as a result of competition from SpaceX [281]\n\n\nCorporate affairs\nIn November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice president Mark Juncosa would

for Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company founded in 2002 by Elon Musk. The company is headquartered in Hawthorne, California, with additional facilities in Boca Chica, Texas, and McGregor, Texas.\n\n**History**\n\nIn early 2001, Elon Musk met Robert Zubrin and donated US$100,000 to his Mars Society, joining its board of directors for a short time. He gave a plenary talk at their fourth convention where he announced Mars Oasis, a project to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars. Musk initially attempted to acquire a Dnepr intercontinental ballistic missile for the project through Russian contacts from Jim Cantrell.\n\n**2001–2004: Founding**\n\nIn early 2001, Elon Musk met Robert Zubrin and donated US$100,000 to his Mars Society, joining its board of directors for a short time. He gave a plenary talk at their fourth convention where he announced Mars Oasis, a project to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars. Musk initially attempted to acquire a Dnepr intercontinental ballistic missile for the project through Russian contacts from Jim Cantrell.\n\n**2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches**\n\nSpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with internal funding. The Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle. The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately $90 million to $100 million.\n\n**2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts**\n\nSpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5. The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which committed to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006. The overall contract award was $278 million to provide development funding for the Dragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.\n\n**2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth**\n\nSpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide. Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S military payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA). The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S provider to rise to over $400 million over the years.\n\n**2015–2017: Reusability milestones**\n\nSpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20. In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Ocean. By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage.\n\n**2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider**\n\nIn July 2017, the company raised $350 million, which raised its valuation to $21 billion. In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts. By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about $12 billion in contract revenue. The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.\n\n**Since 2019: Starship, first crewed launches, Starlink, and general**\n\nIn 2019 SpaceX raised $1.33 billion of capital across three funding rounds. By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to $33.3 billion and reached $36 billion by March 2020. In January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance the Starship and Starlink projects.\n\n**Starship**\n\nThe purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. SpaceX's Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, with a payload capacity of 100+ tons. Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas.\n\n**Crewed launches**\n\nA significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American soil in 9 years.\n\n**Starlink**\n\nStarlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceX. The constellation consists of thousands of cross-linked communications satellites in ~550 km orbits. Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilities. Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on the SpaceX Paz satellite mission in 2017.\n\n**Other projects**\n\nIn June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) long subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events.

developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station (ISS) \n\n\nAutonomous spaceport drone ships\nSpaceX routinely returns the first stage of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches The rocket lands at a predetermined landing site using only its propulsion systems [170] When propellant margins do not permit a return to a launch site (RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform in the ocean, called autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS) [171]\n\n\nStarlink\nStarlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceX, [7] [172] that consists of thousands of cross-linked communications satellites in ~550 km orbits Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilities [173] Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on the SpaceX Paz satellite mission in 2017 In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites aboard a Falcon 9 [174] Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020 [175] and first orders were taken in early 2021 [176] Customers were told to expect internet service speeds of 50 Mbit/s to 150 Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms [177] In December 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million subscribers worldwide [178]\n\n\nOther projects\nIn June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) long subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events [190] [191] The company held the annual competition from 2017 to 2019 [192]\n\n\nHyperloop\nIn June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) long subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events [190] [191] The company held the annual competition from 2017 to 2019 [192]\n\n\nCOVID-19 antibody-testing program\nIn collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of a COVID-19 antibody-testing program in 2020 As such, 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood samples resulting in a peer-reviewed scientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus [193] [194]\n\n\nOther\nIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand [195] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\" [196] [197] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand [198] [199] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission [195]\n\n\nFacilities\nSpaceX is headquartered at the SpaceX Starbase near Brownsville, Texas, where it manufactures and launches its Starship vehicle However most of the company's operations are based out of its office in Hawthorne, California where it was previously headquartered, where it builds Falcon rockets and Dragon spacecraft, and where it houses its mission control.\n\n\nHawthorne, CA: Falcon and Dragon manufacturing, mission control\nSpaceX operates a large facility in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, California The three-story building, originally built by Northrop Corporation to build Boeing 747 fuselages, [202] houses SpaceX's office space, mission control, and Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities [203]\n\n\nBoca Chica, TX: Starship manufacturing, launch\nSpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from the SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas, having announced first plans for the launch facility in August 2014 [205] [206] The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the permit in July 2014 [207] SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015, [208] with the first suborbital launches from the facility in 2019 [203] and orbital launches starting in 2023 \n\n\nMcGregor, TX: Rocket Development and Test Facility\nSpaceX's Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas is a rocket engine test facility Every rocket engine and thruster manufactured by SpaceX must pass through McGregor for final testing being used on flight missions [214] [215] The facility also serves as a testing ground for various components and engines during the research and development process [216] In addition to engine testing, after splashdown and recovery, Dragon spacecraft make a stop at McGregor to have their hazardous hypergolic propellant fuels removed, before the capsules continue on to Hawthorne for refurbishment [214]\n\n\nStarlink manufacturing facilities\nSpaceX's Starlink subsidiary operates over two main facilities Satellite manufacturing takes place near Seattle, Washington while user terminal manufacturing takes place near Austin, Texas.\n\n\nLaunch facilities\nSpaceX operates four orbital launch sites, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California for Falcon rockets, and Starbase near Brownsville, Texas for Starship SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad [226] The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral and Kennedy enable orbits of medium inclination (28.5–55°) [227] Larger inclinations, including SSO, are possible from Florida by overflying Cuba [228]\n\n\nContracts\nSpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts from NASA for the International Space Station (ISS) with technology the company developed SpaceX is also certified for U.S military launches of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads With approximately thirty missions on the manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represented over $12 billion under contract [69]\n\n\nCargo to ISS\nIn 2006, SpaceX won a NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible contract option for crew transport [237] Through this contract, designed by NASA to provide \"seed money\" through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX $396 million to develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9 launch vehicle with their resources [238] These Space Act Agreements have been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development 4–10 times less expensive than if produced by NASA alone [239]\n\n\nCrewed\nSpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA astronauts to and from the ISS The NASA contracts started as part of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in 2011, [249] [250] followed by another in 2012 to continue development and testing of its Dragon 2 spacecraft [251]\n\n\nNational defense\nIn 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, allowing the United States Air Force to purchase up to $100 million worth of launches from the company [262] Three years later, NASA announced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to $1 billion, depending on the number of missions awarded [263] In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DoD) The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center awarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Space Test Program 2 (STP-2) DSCOVR was launched on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on a Falcon Heavy on 25 June 2019 [264]\n\n\nLaunch market competition and pricing pressure\nSpaceX's low launch prices, especially for communications satellites flying to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices [18] Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying the Ariane 5) and International Launch Services (flying the Proton) [279] With a published price of $56.5 million per launch to low Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the least expensive in the industry [280] European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of the Ariane 5 and Ariane 6 rockets as a result of competition from SpaceX [281]\n\n\nCorporate affairs\nIn November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice president Mark Juncosa would

{"title": "Carnage_(character)", "content": "\nConception and creation\nThe Carnage symbiote was derived by writer David Michelinie while Mark Bagley designed the character The symbiote was perceived to be a darker version of Venom, and was created due to the writers not wanting a replacement for Eddie Brock as Venom Carnage was in part only created due to Venom's immense popularity with fans The character was originally meant to be named \"Chaos\", [4] until a different company came out with a character with the same name Then \"Ravage\" was considered before Michelinie discovered Ravage 2099 was soon to be released Finally, assistant editor Eric Fein suggested \"Carnage\" Stan Lee would also have some input for the human host, having come up with the name \"Cletus Kasady\", with the idea of Carnage's host being a remorseless psychopath whose bond with his Symbiote was far more complete than Eddie Brock and Venom Symbiote's, and therefore would refer to himself as \"I\" instead of Venom's \"we\", signifying his Symbiote had little agency of its own and acted more as a weapon and extension of Kasady's will, maximizing his ability to murder people in creative and gruesome ways [5]\n\n\nHosts\nWhen Eddie Brock's Venom symbiote soon returned to be bonded again, allowing Venom to escape prison, the symbiote left its offspring in the cell; due to its alien mindset, the symbiote felt no emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never communicated its existence to Brock via their telepathic link The new symbiote then bonded with Cletus Kasady through a cut on his hand, transforming him into Carnage [6] [7] The bond between the Carnage symbiote and Kasady was not as strong as the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote However, Cletus Kasady was also a serial killer and thought of as insane As a result, Carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom [8] Kasady and the symbiote would then be a main antagonist in \"Maximum Carnage\" and Kasady would continually be the most recurring character to use the Carnage symbiote in many publications [9] [10]\n\n\nCletus Kasady\nWhen Eddie Brock's Venom symbiote soon

the most recurring character to use the Carnage symbiote in many publications [9] [10]\n\n\nSpider-Carnage (Ben Reilly)\nThe Carnage symbiote briefly managed to escape Kasady by traveling through the plumbing in his cell It briefly used John Jameson as its host, but eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man— Ben Reilly at the time— when Ben bonded with it to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage Ben's willpower held out against the symbiote's murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft Reilly subsequently attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal blast of microwaves, but it escaped back to Kasady after the microwaves forced it to separate from Reilly [11]\n\n\nSuperior Carnage (Karl Malus)\nAfter Kasady was lobotomized, he was broken out of prison by the Wizard and Klaw, who intended to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their version of Venom After a failed attempt to control Kasady, Wizard transferred the Symbiote to Dr Karl Malus Dr Malus was enraged and under the influence of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renamed him \"Superior Carnage\" and equipped him with weapons [12]\n\n\nRed Goblin (Norman Osborn)\nFollowing the events of Secret Empire, the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D storehouse by the then-powerless Norman Osborn [13] He initially found himself overwhelmed by the symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter when he allowed it to merge with him, [14] but he has been able to 'persuade' the symbiote to let him take control of Carnage's powers to show it something other than 'boring' mindless slaughter [15] Using this combination of powers during the \"Go Down Swinging\" storyline, Norman is easily able to tear through Human Torch, Clash, Silk, Miles Morales, and Agent Anti-Venom, with the combination of the symbiote and the Goblin serum rendering Carnage immune to its traditional weaknesses, eventually transferring part of the symbiote to his grandson Normie enough to turn him into a miniature version of Red Goblin [16] The Carnage symbiote is seemingly destroyed by Spider-Man when he hits it with an exploding gas tank, however, because the symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe's mind Later as Spider-Man visits Norman in Ravencroft, it's revealed that Norman's mind appears to have been completely fried and now believes that Spider-Man is Norman Osborn and he is Cletus Kasady It's not clear whether or not he's faking it or if he had lost his mind Meanwhile, Harry manages to remove the Carnage symbiote from Normie Not all of it has gone [17]\n\n\nEddie Brock\nFollowing the defeat of Cletus Kasady, the Carnage and Grendel symbiotes were absorbed by Eddie Brock, who is later given an offer to join the Avengers However, in the middle of his big day, Carnage can overcome Venom and take over Eddie leaves before things get out of hand, leaving the Avengers with strange reactions Eddie returns home and tries to quiet the Carnage in a way he has done before with Venom, heavy medication Eddie passes out and has a vision of Knull This causes Eddie to take off and head towards the island where he long ago had thought he had killed Spider-Man and where he remained until the emergence of Carnage However, Carnage catches on to Eddie's thoughts and causes the plane to crash land Separated from the Carnage symbiote, Eddie is ready to face it off [18] After a narrow escape that cost him his left hand, [19] Eddie was eventually rescued by the Avengers, who promptly nuked the island to finally eradicate the symbiotes still on it [20] Meanwhile, to find his father, Dylan discovers a unique ability he has to track and control symbiotes, which he uses to find Eddie, and learns a terrible truth: Eddie never left the island at all Instead, he has been bonded against his will to Carnage [21] Using the Venom symbiote and taking the form of a Tyrannosaurus rex, Dylan tries to separate his father from Carnage but only allows the Carnage symbiote to take Dylan to his father's mindscape There, Dylan is able to finally free himself and Eddie from Carnage's control However, the symbiote survives the ordeal, and is also able to leave the island by bonding with a shark [22]\n\n\nArthur Krane\nFollowing the confrontation with the new King in Black, a piece of the symbiote survived and chooses a fish for a host and then attacks a shark It eventually moves up the food chain and arrives on a fishing boat and begins again a killing spree Inspired by what Eddie had done, Carnage formulated a new plan to make a comeback using the power Knull had bequeathed to create a rival Hive with itself as its nexus Carnage slowly made its way back to New York – restoring itself by devouring everyone it came across en route Once back in Manhattan, Carnage bonded to Senator Arthur Krane who was running a campaign to get Earth rid of aliens, both the good and bad type, and is working with Alchemax and the Friends of Humanity Carnage also began to infect many of the symbiotes left behind on Earth with its will, including Phage, Lasher, Riot, and Agony However, Carnage's failed attempt to corrupt the Anti-Venom symbiote alerted Flash Thompson and Iron Man [23]\n\n\nOther hosts\nThere have been other, shorter-term hosts for the symbiote.\n\n\nJohn Jameson\nThough bonded to Kasady's bloodstream the symbiote found a way to abandon its host by travelling through the Ravencroft Institute's water pipes overwhelming Ravencroft's chief, John Jameson Carnage used him to commit further murders before eventually bonding with Spider-Man (who was Ben Reilly at the time) [11]\n\n\nCarnage Cosmic (Norrin Radd)\nDuring a subsequent rampage, the Carnage symbiote briefly attempted to take control of the Silver Surfer, who was visiting Earth at the time to welcome the Fantastic Four after their return to life following the battle with Onslaught As it turned out, Galactus had consumed a planet that many Symbiotes lived on, and the species had made it a race memory so that each future Symbiote could remember it, as well as the Surfer who had been Galactus's herald at the time Upon seeing the Silver Surfer, the Carnage Symbiote abandoned Kasady and bonded with the Silver Surfer, becoming the Carnage Cosmic Spider-Man and the Surfer managed to return the Symbiote to Kasady, who was dying from stomach cancer, and then the Silver Surfer proceeded to seal both host and Symbiote in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force them both to reflect on their sins for eternity [24]\n\n\nScorn (Tanis Nieves)\nAfter Carnage was ripped in half by the Sentry outside the Earth atmosphere [25] it is later discovered that, although the host was presumably killed, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth, where it was discovered by Michael Hall, a competitor of Tony Stark He brought Shriek and her doctor, Tanis Nieves, so he could use Shriek to keep the symbiote alive to use the properties of the symbiote, to create prosthetic limbs and exo-suits which respond in the same ways as a symbiote One such person, Dr Tanis Nieves, is outfitted with one of these prosthetic arms after she is caught in an attack by the Doppelganger, who tried to rescue Shriek [10] When near the symbiote, her arm goes wild and forces her to kill several scientists before the symbiote forcefully bonds to her, becoming the new Carnage [10] After the symbiote uses Tanis to break into a Hall Corporation facility, it is revealed that Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall's prosthetics [10] Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and Iron Man struggle to stop him It is then revealed that Carnage is once again pregnant, and the suit's spawn briefly bonds to Tanis, but she removes it from herself and the symbiote bonds to Shriek before being torn from her Scared of Shriek's malice, the symbiote arm then rebounds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage, but she escapes [10]\n\n\nWizard (Bentley Wittman)\nUltimately, Spider-Man brings out Kasady's body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard However, Klaw's ephemeral spirit focuses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard's and Kasady's brain damage [12]\n\n\nCarla Unger\nAfter the symbiote had died in captivity, a sample of the symbiote was examined by Dr Carla Unger, until the sample entered her body When she went home, the symbiote formed around her and then she with the symbiote killed her abusive husband After that, the symbiote consumed her and went to other hosts to get back to Kasady When the symbiote arrived at an injured Kasady, a scientist, who wanted the symbiote for himself tried to kill Kasady, but the symbiote rebonded to Cletus [26]\n\n\nGoblin Child (Normie Osborn)\nCarnage bonded to a great white shark to escape from the Isla de Huesos, and prowled the ocean for several months as the \"red king of darkness\" Eventually it stumbled upon a boat full of whalers and seizing the opportunity, Carnage caught one of the whalers and bonds to him, climbed aboard and prepared to slaughter the crew, intent on taking its place as the Red Right Hand of the King in Black At that exact moment however, Knull is killed by Eddie Brock, causing the symbiote dome encasing the Earth to shatter into countless symbiotes Through the symbiote hive mind, Eddie, now the new god of the symbiotes, calls out to Carnage, who snarls for her nemesis to get out of his head As symbiotes rain from the sky onto the ship and into the ocean, they bond to the crew of the ship and state that they are Venom, leaving Carnage shocked and incredulous Manifesting an arm-blade, Carnage snarls that she'll kill them all but is unceremoniously booted overboard Interjecting, the Venom symbiote states that Knull is dead and that Eddie is the new King in Black, making Carnage now one of his subjects As Carnage sinks back into the ocean, Eddie says she is not welcome in his reformed Hive and sentences her to execution Countless symbiote-controlled sharks began swarming Carnage and devouring her in a feeding frenzy until the symbiote completely disappeared in the darkness of the ocean [27]\n\n\nThe Crimson Leviathan\nCarnage bonded to a great white shark to escape from the Isla de Huesos, and prowled the ocean for several months as the \"red king of darkness\" Eventually it stumbled upon a boat full of whalers and seizing the opportunity, Carnage caught one of the whalers and bonds to him, climbed aboard and prepared to slaughter the crew, intent on taking its place as the Red Right Hand of the King in Black At that exact moment however, Knull is killed by Eddie Brock, causing the symbiote dome

and devouring her in a feeding frenzy until the symbiote completely disappeared in the darkness of the ocean [27]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nAs Eddie Brock explained, [28] the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it: Earth Carnage endows Cletus Kasady with physical strength greater than that of Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote combined [28] and shape-shifting abilities, allows it to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables it to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote tendril [29] Much like Spider-Man, Carnage has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man's spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to \"see\" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats [30] [31] As a result, Carnage can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces Carnage has abilities similar to those of Spider-Man as a direct result of Venom bonding to Peter Parker who transferred some of Spider-Man's power into the symbiote.\n\n\nReception\nCarnage was used in DC and Marvel's Amalgam Comics, where he was amalgamated with Bizarro into Bizarnage, an adversary of Spider-Boy who appeared in his only issue [43] [44]\n\n\nOther versions\nCarnage was used in DC and Marvel's Amalgam Comics, where he was amalgamated with Bizarro into Bizarnage, an adversary of Spider-Boy who appeared in his only issue

secret hatred and envy for Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman.\n\n\nExiles\nThe Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become the \"Spider\", and becomes a member of Weapon X in Exiles [45] He is killed when Firestar explodes from her powers [46]\n\n\nMarvel 1602\nOn Earth-311, Canice Cassidy believed that he was bonded to a demon and formed the universe's version of Sinister Six called Sinister Sextet with Electro, Hobgoblin, Karnov (Earth-411's version of Kraven the Hunter), Magus (Earth-311's version of Mysterio), and Serpent (who is similar to Lizard) as its members The dimension-hopping Web-Warriors who aid dimensions (who lost its Spider-Man) defeated Sinister Sextet, and as they round up their captives, they notice that Electro escaped, unbeknownst to the group, followed them to the Great Web [47]\n\n\nMarvel 2099\nIn the unified Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-2099, Carnage 2099 appears as a modified version of the Venom symbiote Former Alchemax executive Michael Erick was attacked by some thugs for being a Black Card user The modified Venom symbiote saved him from the thugs where it then killed Michael and took control of the body as Carange [48]\n\n\nMarvel Zombies\nDuring the Secret Wars, when Elsa Bloodstone along with a child was in a world of zombified characters, they run into a zombie Carnage He was killed when Elsa threw Carnage's head to a zombie Sauron [49]\n\n\nMC2\nIn the MC2 future timeline, Carnage, also known as Specimen 297, bonds with Spider-Girl's friend Moose Mansfied, who wants to use the symbiote to cure his father from cancer [50] He also infects Spider-Girl's little brother, turning him into a miniature version of himself Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain Reverb to destroy all traces of the symbiote.\n\n\nSpider-Man and Batman: Disordered Minds\nIn Venomverse, when Venom and Eddie Brock from Prime Earth were recruited into a war between lethal protectors from across the multiverse and the symbiote-eating Poisons, the Venoms from the multiverse were on the ropes until Eddie had the bright idea to recruit the psychopath Carnage to their side They summoned a Carnage that hailed from a world where he had succeeded in killing Venom, and while he was volatile at first, engaging in battle with the Resistance, when he realized he had the opportunity to fight \"a buncha messed-up super-heroes\" he decided to join the Venoms [54] For some reason, Carnage was immune to the Poisons, and he helped tip the scales in their favor as one last-ditch suicide run and was left for dead alongside Poison Deadpool, and was seemingly killed when the Hive's ship was destroyed after the heroes were sent back to their respective dimensions [55]\n\n\nSpider-Verse\nIn Venomverse, when Venom

supervillain in the Marvel Comics universe. He is one of the most iconic and enduring villains in the Marvel Universe, known for his brutal and sadistic nature.\n\n**Conception and Creation**\n\nThe Carnage symbiote was derived by writer David Michelinie while Mark Bagley designed the character. The symbiote was perceived to be a darker version of Venom, and was created due to the writers not wanting a replacement for Eddie Brock as Venom. Carnage was in part only created due to Venom's immense popularity with fans. The character was originally meant to be named \"Chaos\", but a different company came out with a character with the same name. Then \"Ravage\" was considered before Michelinie discovered Ravage 2099 was soon to be released. Assistant editor Eric Fein suggested \"Carnage\" and Stan Lee would also have some input for the human host, having come up with the name \"Cletus Kasady\". The idea of Carnage's host being a remorseless psychopath whose bond with his Symbiote was far more complete than Eddie Brock and Venom Symbiote's, and therefore would refer to himself as \"I\" instead of Venom's \"we\", signifying his Symbiote had little agency of its own and acted more as a weapon and extension of Kasady's will, maximizing his ability to murder people in creative and gruesome ways.\n\n**Hosts**\n\nWhen Eddie Brock's Venom symbiote soon returned to be bonded again, allowing Venom to escape prison, the symbiote left its offspring in the cell. Due to its alien mindset, the symbiote felt no emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never communicated its existence to Brock via their telepathic link. The new symbiote then bonded with Cletus Kasady through a cut on his hand, transforming him into Carnage. The bond between the Carnage symbiote and Kasady was not as strong as the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote. However, Cletus Kasady was also a serial killer and thought of as insane. As a result, Carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom.\n\n**Cletus Kasady**\n\nCletus Kasady is a serial killer and the host of the Carnage symbiote. He is a psychopath who has a complete and utter disregard for human life. Kasady's bond with the Carnage symbiote is unbreakable, and he has become a vessel for the symbiote's violent and destructive tendencies.\n\n**Spider-Carnage (Ben Reilly)**\n\nThe Carnage symbiote briefly managed to escape Kasady by traveling through the plumbing in his cell. It briefly used John Jameson as its host, but eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man—Ben Reilly at the time—when Ben bonded with it to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage. Ben's willpower held out against the symbiote's murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft.\n\n**Superior Carnage (Karl Malus)**\n\nAfter Kasady was lobotomized, he was broken out of prison by the Wizard and Klaw, who intended to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their version of Venom. After a failed attempt to control Kasady, Wizard transferred the Symbiote to Dr. Karl Malus. Dr. Malus was enraged and under the influence of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renamed him \"Superior Carnage\" and equipped him with weapons.\n\n**Red Goblin (Norman Osborn)**\n\nFollowing the events of Secret Empire, the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse by the then-powerless Norman Osborn. He initially found himself overwhelmed by the symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter when he allowed it to merge with him. However, he has been able to 'persuade' the symbiote to let him take control of Carnage's powers to show it something other than 'boring' mindless slaughter. Using this combination of powers during the \"Go Down Swinging\" storyline, Norman is easily able to tear through Human Torch, Clash, Silk, Miles Morales, and Agent Anti-Venom.\n\n**Eddie Brock**\n\nFollowing the defeat of Cletus Kasady, the Carnage and Grendel symbiotes were absorbed by Eddie Brock, who is later given an offer to join the Avengers. In the middle of his big day, Carnage can overcome Venom and take over Eddie leaves before things get out of hand, leaving the Avengers with strange reactions. Eddie returns home and tries to quiet the Carnage in a way he has done before with Venom, heavy medication. Eddie passes out and has a vision of Knull. This causes Eddie to take off and head towards the island where he long ago had thought he had killed Spider-Man and where he remained until the emergence of Carnage.\n\n**Arthur Krane**\n\nArthur Krane is a politician who becomes the host of the Carnage symbiote after it bonds with him. He is a ruthless and cunning individual who uses the symbiote's powers for his own gain.\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nAs Eddie Brock explained, the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it: Earth. Carnage endows Cletus Kasady with physical strength greater than that of Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote combined and shape-shifting abilities, allows it to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables it to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote tendril. Much like Spider-Man, Carnage has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man's spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to \"see\" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats.\n\n**Reception**\n\nCarnage was used in DC and Marvel's Amalgam Comics, where he was amalgamated with Bizarro into Bizarnage, an adversary of Spider-Boy who appeared in his only issue.\n\n**Other Versions**\n\nCarnage has appeared in various other versions, including:\n\n* **Earth-65**: In this universe, Mary Jane Watson is attacked by Knull's symbiotes and is forcibly bonded with them, turning her into Carnage.\n* **Exiles**: In this universe, the Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become

symbiote briefly managed to escape Kasady by traveling through the plumbing in his cell It briefly used John Jameson as its host, but eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man— Ben Reilly at the time— when Ben bonded with it to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage Ben's willpower held out against the symbiote's murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft Reilly subsequently attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal blast of microwaves, but it escaped back to Kasady after the microwaves forced it to separate from Reilly [11]\n\n\nSuperior Carnage (Karl Malus)\nAfter Kasady was lobotomized, he was broken out of prison by the Wizard and Klaw, who intended to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their version of Venom After a failed attempt to control Kasady, Wizard transferred the Symbiote to Dr Karl Malus Dr Malus was enraged and under the influence of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renamed him \"Superior Carnage\" and equipped him with weapons [12]\n\n\nRed Goblin (Norman Osborn)\nFollowing the events of Secret Empire, the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D storehouse by the then-powerless Norman Osborn [13] He initially found himself overwhelmed by the symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter when he allowed it to merge with him, [14] but he has been able to 'persuade' the symbiote to let him take control of Carnage's powers to show it something other than 'boring' mindless slaughter [15] Using this combination of powers during the \"Go Down Swinging\" storyline, Norman is easily able to tear through Human Torch, Clash, Silk, Miles Morales, and Agent Anti-Venom, with the combination of the symbiote and the Goblin serum rendering Carnage immune to its traditional weaknesses, eventually transferring part of the symbiote to his grandson Normie enough to turn him into a miniature version of Red Goblin [16] The Carnage symbiote is seemingly destroyed by Spider-Man when he hits it with an exploding gas tank, however, because the symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe's mind Later as Spider-Man visits Norman in Ravencroft, it's revealed that Norman's mind appears to have been completely fried and now believes that Spider-Man is Norman Osborn and he is Cletus Kasady It's not clear whether or not he's faking it or if he had lost his mind Meanwhile, Harry manages to remove the Carnage symbiote from Normie Not all of it has gone [17]\n\n\nEddie Brock\nFollowing the defeat of Cletus Kasady, the Carnage and Grendel symbiotes were absorbed by Eddie Brock, who is later given an offer to join the Avengers However, in the middle of his big day, Carnage can overcome Venom and take over Eddie leaves before things get out of hand, leaving the Avengers with strange reactions Eddie returns home and tries to quiet the Carnage in a way he has done before with Venom, heavy medication Eddie passes out and has a vision of Knull This causes Eddie to take off and head towards the island where he long ago had thought he had killed Spider-Man and where he remained until the emergence of Carnage However, Carnage catches on to Eddie's thoughts and causes the plane to crash land Separated from the Carnage symbiote, Eddie is ready to face it off [18] After a narrow escape that cost him his left hand, [19] Eddie was eventually rescued by the Avengers, who promptly nuked the island to finally eradicate the symbiotes still on it [20] Meanwhile, to find his father, Dylan discovers a unique ability he has to track and control symbiotes, which he uses to find Eddie, and learns a terrible truth: Eddie never left the island at all Instead, he has been bonded against his will to Carnage [21] Using the Venom symbiote and taking the form of a Tyrannosaurus rex, Dylan tries to separate his father from Carnage but only allows the Carnage symbiote to take Dylan to his father's mindscape There, Dylan is able to finally free himself and Eddie from Carnage's control However, the symbiote survives the ordeal, and is also able to leave the island by bonding with a shark [22]\n\n\nArthur Krane\nFollowing the confrontation with the new King in Black, a piece of the symbiote survived and chooses a fish for a host and then attacks a shark It eventually moves up the food chain and arrives on a fishing boat and begins again a killing spree Inspired by what Eddie had done, Carnage formulated a new plan to make a comeback using the power Knull had bequeathed to create a rival Hive with itself as its nexus Carnage slowly made its way back to New York – restoring itself by devouring everyone it came across en route Once back in Manhattan, Carnage bonded to Senator Arthur Krane who was running a campaign to get Earth rid of aliens, both the good and bad type, and is working with Alchemax and the Friends of Humanity Carnage also began to infect many of the symbiotes left behind on Earth with its will, including Phage, Lasher, Riot, and Agony However, Carnage's failed attempt to corrupt the Anti-Venom symbiote alerted Flash Thompson and Iron Man [23]\n\n\nOther hosts\nThere have been other, shorter-term hosts for the symbiote.\n\n\nJohn Jameson\nThough bonded to Kasady's bloodstream the symbiote found a way to abandon its host by travelling through the Ravencroft Institute's water pipes overwhelming Ravencroft's chief, John Jameson Carnage used him to commit further murders before eventually bonding with Spider-Man (who was Ben Reilly at the time) [11]\n\n\nCarnage Cosmic (Norrin Radd)\nDuring a subsequent rampage, the Carnage symbiote briefly attempted to take control of the Silver Surfer, who was visiting Earth at the time to welcome the Fantastic Four after their return to life following the battle with Onslaught As it turned out, Galactus had consumed a planet that many Symbiotes lived on, and the species had made it a race memory so that each future Symbiote could remember it, as well as the Surfer who had been Galactus's herald at the time Upon seeing the Silver Surfer, the Carnage Symbiote abandoned Kasady and bonded with the Silver Surfer, becoming the Carnage Cosmic Spider-Man and the Surfer managed to return the Symbiote to Kasady, who was dying from stomach cancer, and then the Silver Surfer proceeded to seal both host and Symbiote in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force them both to reflect on their sins for eternity [24]\n\n\nScorn (Tanis Nieves)\nAfter Carnage was ripped in half by the Sentry outside the Earth atmosphere [25] it is later discovered that, although the host was presumably killed, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth, where it was discovered by Michael Hall, a competitor of Tony Stark He brought Shriek and her doctor, Tanis Nieves, so he could use Shriek to keep the symbiote alive to use the properties of the symbiote, to create prosthetic limbs and exo-suits which respond in the same ways as a symbiote One such person, Dr Tanis Nieves, is outfitted with one of these prosthetic arms after she is caught in an attack by the Doppelganger, who tried to rescue Shriek [10] When near the symbiote, her arm goes wild and forces her to kill several scientists before the symbiote forcefully bonds to her, becoming the new Carnage [10] After the symbiote uses Tanis to break into a Hall Corporation facility, it is revealed that Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall's prosthetics [10] Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and Iron Man struggle to stop him It is then revealed that Carnage is once again pregnant, and the suit's spawn briefly bonds to Tanis, but she removes it from herself and the symbiote bonds to Shriek before being torn from her Scared of Shriek's malice, the symbiote arm then rebounds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage, but she escapes [10]\n\n\nWizard (Bentley Wittman)\nUltimately, Spider-Man brings out Kasady's body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard However, Klaw's ephemeral spirit focuses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard's and Kasady's brain damage [12]\n\n\nCarla Unger\nAfter the symbiote had died in captivity, a sample of the symbiote was examined by Dr Carla Unger, until the sample entered her body When she went home, the symbiote formed around her and then she with the symbiote killed her abusive husband After that, the symbiote consumed her and went to other hosts to get back to Kasady When the symbiote arrived at an injured Kasady, a scientist, who wanted the symbiote for himself tried to kill Kasady, but the symbiote rebonded to Cletus [26]\n\n\nGoblin Child (Normie Osborn)\nCarnage bonded to a great white shark to escape from the Isla de Huesos, and prowled the ocean for several months as the \"red king of darkness\" Eventually it stumbled upon a boat full of whalers and seizing the opportunity, Carnage caught one of the whalers and bonds to him, climbed aboard and prepared to slaughter the crew, intent on taking its place as the Red Right Hand of the King in Black At that exact moment however, Knull is killed by Eddie Brock, causing the symbiote dome encasing the Earth to shatter into countless symbiotes Through the symbiote hive mind, Eddie, now the new god of the symbiotes, calls out to Carnage, who snarls for her nemesis to get out of his head As symbiotes rain from the sky onto the ship and into the ocean, they bond to the crew of the ship and state that they are Venom, leaving Carnage shocked and incredulous Manifesting an arm-blade, Carnage snarls that she'll kill them all but is unceremoniously booted overboard Interjecting, the Venom symbiote states that Knull is dead and that Eddie is the new King in Black, making Carnage now one of his subjects As Carnage sinks back into the ocean, Eddie says she is not welcome in his reformed Hive and sentences her to execution Countless symbiote-controlled sharks began swarming Carnage and devouring her in a feeding frenzy until the symbiote completely disappeared in the darkness of the ocean [27]\n\n\nThe Crimson Leviathan\nCarnage bonded to a great white shark to escape from the Isla de Huesos, and prowled the ocean for several months as the \"red king of darkness\" Eventually it stumbled upon a boat full of whalers and seizing the opportunity, Carnage caught one of the whalers and bonds to him, climbed aboard and prepared to slaughter the crew, intent on taking its place as the Red Right Hand of the King in Black At that exact moment however, Knull is killed by Eddie Brock, causing the symbiote dome encasing the Earth to shatter into countless symbiotes Through the symbiote hive mind, Eddie, now the new god of the

sentences her to execution Countless symbiote-controlled sharks began swarming Carnage and devouring her in a feeding frenzy until the symbiote completely disappeared in the darkness of the ocean [27]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nAs Eddie Brock explained, [28] the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it: Earth Carnage endows Cletus Kasady with physical strength greater than that of Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote combined [28] and shape-shifting abilities, allows it to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables it to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote tendril [29] Much like Spider-Man, Carnage has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man's spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to \"see\" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats [30] [31] As a result, Carnage can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces Carnage has abilities similar to those of Spider-Man as a direct result of Venom bonding to Peter Parker who transferred some of Spider-Man's power into the symbiote.\n\n\nReception\nCarnage was used in DC and Marvel's Amalgam Comics, where he was

Parker and Carnage combine to become the \"Spider\", and becomes a member of Weapon X in Exiles [45] He is killed when Firestar explodes from her powers [46]\n\n\nMarvel 1602\nOn Earth-311, Canice Cassidy believed that he was bonded to a demon and formed the universe's version of Sinister Six called Sinister Sextet with Electro, Hobgoblin, Karnov (Earth-411's version of Kraven the Hunter), Magus (Earth-311's version of Mysterio), and Serpent (who is similar to Lizard) as its members The dimension-hopping Web-Warriors who aid dimensions (who lost its Spider-Man) defeated Sinister Sextet, and as they round up their captives, they notice that Electro escaped, unbeknownst to the group, followed them to the Great Web [47]\n\n\nMarvel 2099\nIn the unified Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-2099, Carnage 2099 appears as a modified version of the Venom symbiote Former Alchemax executive Michael Erick was attacked by some thugs for being a Black Card user The modified Venom symbiote saved him from the thugs where it then killed Michael and took control of the body as Carange [48]\n\n\nMarvel Zombies\nDuring the Secret Wars, when Elsa Bloodstone along with a child was in a world of

himself Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain Reverb to destroy all traces of the symbiote.\n\n\nSpider-Man and Batman: Disordered Minds\nIn Venomverse, when Venom and Eddie Brock from

soon she was regularly attending his lectures In 1956, she joined the Nation of Islam, changing her name to Betty X [70] One-on-one dates were contrary to the Nation's teachings, so the couple courted at social events with dozens or hundreds of others, and Malcolm X made a point of inviting her on the frequent group visits he led to New York City's museums and libraries [71]\n\n\nHinton Johnson incident\nThe American public first became aware of Malcolm X in 1957, after Hinton Johnson, [F] a Nation of Islam member, was beaten by two New York City police officers [86] [87] On April 26, Johnson and two other passersby‍—‌also Nation of Islam members‍—‌saw the officers beating an African American man with nightsticks [86] When they attempted to intervene, shouting, \"You're not in Alabama .. this is New York!\" [87] one of the officers turned on Johnson, beating him so severely that he suffered brain contusions and subdural hemorrhaging All four African American men were arrested [86]\n\n\nIncreasing prominence\nBy the late 1950s, Malcolm X was using a new name, Malcolm Shabazz or el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz (\"The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch\"), [93] [94] [95] although he was still widely referred to as Malcolm X [96] His comments on issues and events were being widely reported, in print and on radio and television [97] He was featured in a 1959 New York City television broadcast about the Nation of Islam, The Hate That Hate Produced [97]\n\n\nAdvocacy and teachings while with the Nation\nFrom his adoption of the Nation of Islam in 1952 until he broke with it in 1964, Malcolm X promoted the Nation's teachings These included beliefs:\n\n\nAntisemitism\nMalcolm X has been widely accused of being antisemitic [120] [121] His autobiography contains several \"antisemitic charges and caricatures of Jews\" [122] Alex Haley, the autobiography's co-author, had to rewrite some of the book to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the manuscript [123] Malcolm X believed that the fabricated antisemitic text The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was authentic and introduced it to NOI members, while accusing the Jewish people of \"perfecting the modern evil\" of neo-colonialism [124] [125] He helped change the Black community's image of The Holocaust, engaging in Holocaust trivialization and claiming that the Jews \"brought it on themselves\" [126]\n\n\nEffect on Nation membership\nMalcolm X is widely regarded as the second most influential leader of the Nation of Islam after Elijah Muhammad [129] He is largely credited with helping the group's dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s—from around 1,200 to between 50,000 and 100,000 members, with up to 25,000 actively attending, according to estimates [130] [H] [I]\n\n\nDisillusionment and departure\nDuring 1962 and 1963, events caused Malcolm X to reassess his relationship with the Nation of Islam, and particularly its leader, Elijah Muhammad.\n\n\nLack of Nation of Islam response to LAPD violence\nIn late 1961, there were violent confrontations between the Nation of Islam members and police in South Central Los Angeles, and numerous Muslims were arrested They were acquitted, but tensions had been raised Just after midnight on April 27, 1962, two LAPD officers, unprovoked, shoved and beat several Muslims outside Temple Number 27 A large crowd of angry Muslims emerged from the mosque and the officers attempted to intimidate them [140] [141]\n\n\nSexual misbehavior by Elijah Muhammad\nRumors were circulating that Muhammad was conducting extramarital affairs with young Nation secretaries‍—‌which would constitute a serious violation of Nation teachings After first discounting the rumors, Malcolm X came to believe them after he spoke with Muhammad's son Wallace and with the girls making the accusations Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963, [when?] attempting to justify his behavior by referring to precedents set by Biblical prophets [142]\n\n\nRemarks on Kennedy assassination\nOn December 1, 1963, when asked to comment on the assassination of John F Kennedy, Malcolm X said that it was a case of \"chickens coming home to roost.\" He added that \"chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they've always made me glad.\" [144] Likewise, according to The New York Times: [144]\n\n\nMedia attention to Malcolm X over Elijah Muhammad\nMalcolm X had by now become a media favorite, and some Nation members believed he was a threat to Elijah Muhammad's leadership Publishers had shown interest in Malcolm X's autobiography, and when Louis Lomax wrote his 1963 book about the Nation, When the Word Is Given, he used a photograph of Malcolm X on the cover He also reproduced five of his speeches but featured only one of Muhammad's, which greatly upset Muhammad and made him envious [147]\n\n\nDeparture from Nation of Islam\nOn March 8, 1964, Malcolm X publicly announced his break from the Nation of Islam Though still a Muslim, he felt that the Nation had \"gone as far as it can\" because of its rigid teachings He said he was planning to organize a Black nationalist organization to \"heighten the political consciousness\" of African Americans He also expressed a desire to work with other civil rights leaders, saying that Elijah Muhammad had prevented him from doing so in the past [148]\n\n\nActivity after leaving Nation of Islam\nAfter leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X founded Muslim Mosque, Inc (MMI), a religious organization, [150] [151] and the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), a secular group that advocated Pan-Africanism [152] [153] On March 26, 1964, he briefly met Martin Luther King Jr for the first and only time‍—‌and only long enough for photographs to be taken‍—‌in Washington, D.C., as both men attended the Senate's debate on the Civil Rights bill at the U.S Capitol building [K] [L]\n\n\nPilgrimage to Mecca\nIn April 1964, with financial help from his half-sister Ella Little-Collins, Malcolm X flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as the start of his Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca obligatory for every Muslim who is able to do so He was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S citizenship and inability to speak Arabic caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned [160] [161]\n\n\nVisit to Cairo\nMalcolm X had already visited the United Arab Republic (a short-lived political union between Egypt and Syria), Sudan, Nigeria, and Ghana in 1959 to make arrangements for a tour of Africa by Elijah Muhammad [165] After his pilgrimage to Mecca in April 1964, he visited Africa a second time He returned to the United States in late May [166] and flew to Africa again in July [167] During these visits he met officials, gave interviews, and spoke on radio and television in Egypt, Ethiopia, Tanganyika, Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Senegal, Liberia, Algeria and Morocco [168]\n\n\nFrance and United Kingdom\nOn November 23, 1964, on his way home from Africa, Malcolm X stopped in Paris, where he spoke in the Salle de la Mutualité [175] [176] After his return to the United States, he accused the United States of imperialism in the Congo by supporting Tshombe and \"his hired killers\" as he called the White mercenaries [174] X accused Tshombe and the American president Lyndon B Johnson of \"...sleeping together When I say sleeping together, I don't mean that literally But beyond that, they're in the same bed Johnson is paying the salaries, paying the government, propping up Tshombe's government, this murderer\" [174]\n\n\nReturn to United States\nAfter returning to the U.S., Malcolm X addressed a wide variety of audiences He spoke regularly at meetings held by MMI and the OAAU, and was one of the most sought-after speakers on college campuses [191] One of his top aides later wrote that he \"welcomed every opportunity to speak to college students.\" [192] He also addressed public meetings of the Socialist Workers Party, speaking at their Militant Labor Forum [193] He was interviewed on the subjects of segregation and the Nation of Islam by Robert Penn Warren for Warren's 1965 book Who Speaks for the Negro?

He believed that the police were designed to oppress African Americans and maintain white supremacy.\n\n**Increasing prominence**\n\nBy the late 1950s, Malcolm X had become a prominent figure in the Civil Rights Movement.

These included beliefs in black nationalism, self-reliance, and the importance of separating from white society.\n\n## Antisemitism\n\nMalcolm X has been widely accused of being antisemitic. His autobiography contains several \"antisemitic charges and caricatures of Jews.\" Alex Haley, the autobiography's co-author, had to rewrite some of the book to eliminate negative statements about Jews in the manuscript.\n\n**Effect on Nation membership**\n\nMalcolm X is widely regarded as the second most influential leader of the Nation of Islam after Elijah Muhammad. He is largely credited with helping the group's dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s.\n\n## Membership Growth\n\nMalcolm's charisma and oratory skills made him a compelling figure, and he quickly gained a large following. The Nation of Islam's membership grew dramatically during Malcolm's time with the organization, from around 1,200 to between 50,000 and 100,000 members.\n\n**Disillusionment and departure**\n\nDuring 1962 and 1963, events caused Malcolm X to reassess his relationship with the Nation of Islam, and particularly its leader, Elijah Muhammad.\n\n## Reasons for Departure\n\nMalcolm's disillusionment with the Nation of Islam was caused by several factors, including Elijah Muhammad's extramarital affairs and the Nation's refusal to address the civil rights movement.\n\n**LAPD violence**\n\nIn 1961, there were violent confrontations between the Nation of Islam members and police in South Central Los Angeles.

soon she was regularly attending his lectures In 1956, she joined the Nation of Islam, changing her name to Betty X [70] One-on-one dates were contrary to the Nation's teachings, so the couple courted at social events with dozens or hundreds of others, and Malcolm X made a point of inviting her on the frequent group visits he led to New York City's museums and libraries [71]\n\n\nHinton Johnson incident\nThe American public first became aware of Malcolm X in 1957, after Hinton Johnson, [F] a Nation of Islam member, was beaten by two New York City police officers [86] [87] On April 26, Johnson and two other passersby‍—‌also Nation of Islam members‍—‌saw the officers beating an African American man with nightsticks [86] When they attempted to intervene, shouting, \"You're not in Alabama .. this is New York!\" [87] one of the officers turned on Johnson, beating him so severely that he suffered brain contusions and subdural hemorrhaging All four African American men were arrested [86]\n\n\nIncreasing prominence\nBy the late 1950s, Malcolm X was using a new name, Malcolm Shabazz or el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz (\"The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch\"), [93] [94] [95] although he was still widely referred to as Malcolm X [96] His comments on issues and events were being widely reported, in print and on radio and television [97] He was featured in a 1959 New York City television broadcast about the Nation of Islam, The Hate That Hate Produced [97]\n\n\nAdvocacy and teachings while with the Nation\nFrom his adoption of the Nation of Islam in 1952 until he broke with it in 1964, Malcolm X promoted the Nation's teachings These included beliefs:\n\n\nAntisemitism\nMalcolm X has been widely accused of being antisemitic [120] [121] His autobiography contains several \"antisemitic charges and caricatures of Jews\" [122] Alex Haley, the autobiography's co-author, had to rewrite some of the book to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the manuscript [123] Malcolm X believed that the fabricated antisemitic text The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was authentic and introduced it to NOI members, while accusing the Jewish people of \"perfecting the modern evil\" of neo-colonialism [124] [125] He helped change the Black community's image of The Holocaust, engaging in Holocaust trivialization and claiming that the Jews \"brought it on themselves\" [126]\n\n\nEffect on Nation membership\nMalcolm X is widely regarded as the second most influential leader of the Nation of Islam after Elijah Muhammad [129] He is largely credited with helping the group's dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s—from around 1,200 to between 50,000 and 100,000 members, with up to 25,000 actively attending, according to estimates [130] [H] [I]\n\n\nDisillusionment and departure\nDuring 1962 and 1963, events caused Malcolm X to reassess his relationship with the Nation of Islam, and particularly its leader, Elijah Muhammad.\n\n\nLack of Nation of Islam response to LAPD violence\nIn late 1961, there were violent confrontations between the Nation of Islam members and police in South Central Los Angeles, and numerous Muslims were arrested They were acquitted, but tensions had been raised Just after midnight on April 27, 1962, two LAPD officers, unprovoked, shoved and beat several Muslims outside Temple Number 27 A large crowd of angry Muslims emerged from the mosque and the officers attempted to intimidate them [140] [141]\n\n\nSexual misbehavior by Elijah Muhammad\nRumors were circulating that Muhammad was conducting extramarital affairs with young Nation secretaries‍—‌which would constitute a serious violation of Nation teachings After first discounting the rumors, Malcolm X came to believe them after he spoke with Muhammad's son Wallace and with the girls making the accusations Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963, [when?] attempting to justify his behavior by referring to precedents set by Biblical prophets [142]\n\n\nRemarks on Kennedy assassination\nOn December 1, 1963, when asked to comment on the assassination of John F Kennedy, Malcolm X said that it was a case of \"chickens coming home to roost.\" He added that \"chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they've always made me glad.\" [144] Likewise, according to The New York Times: [144]\n\n\nMedia attention to Malcolm X over Elijah Muhammad\nMalcolm X had by now become a media favorite, and some Nation members believed he was a threat to Elijah Muhammad's leadership Publishers had shown interest in Malcolm X's autobiography, and when Louis Lomax wrote his 1963 book about the Nation, When the Word Is Given, he used a photograph of Malcolm X on the cover He also reproduced five of his speeches but featured only one of Muhammad's, which greatly upset Muhammad and made him envious [147]\n\n\nDeparture from Nation of Islam\nOn March 8, 1964, Malcolm X publicly announced his break from the Nation of Islam Though still a Muslim, he felt that the Nation had \"gone as far as it can\" because of its rigid teachings He said he was planning to organize a Black nationalist organization to \"heighten the political consciousness\" of African Americans He also expressed a desire to work with other civil rights leaders, saying that Elijah Muhammad had prevented him from doing so in the past [148]\n\n\nActivity after leaving Nation of Islam\nAfter leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X founded Muslim Mosque, Inc (MMI), a religious organization, [150] [151] and the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), a secular group that advocated Pan-Africanism [152] [153] On March 26, 1964, he briefly met Martin Luther King Jr for the first and only time‍—‌and only long enough for photographs to be taken‍—‌in Washington, D.C., as both men attended the Senate's debate on the Civil Rights bill at the U.S Capitol building [K] [L]\n\n\nPilgrimage to Mecca\nIn April 1964, with financial help from his half-sister Ella Little-Collins, Malcolm X flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as the start of his Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca obligatory for every Muslim who is able to do so He was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S citizenship and inability to speak Arabic caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned [160] [161]\n\n\nVisit to Cairo\nMalcolm X had already visited the United Arab Republic (a short-lived political union between Egypt and Syria), Sudan, Nigeria, and Ghana in 1959 to make arrangements for a tour of Africa by Elijah Muhammad [165] After his pilgrimage to Mecca in April 1964, he visited Africa a second time He returned to the United States in late May [166] and flew to Africa again in July [167] During these visits he met officials, gave interviews, and spoke on radio and television in Egypt, Ethiopia, Tanganyika, Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Senegal, Liberia, Algeria and Morocco [168]\n\n\nFrance and United Kingdom\nOn November 23, 1964, on his way home from Africa, Malcolm X stopped in Paris, where he spoke in the Salle de la Mutualité [175] [176] After his return to the United States, he accused the United States of imperialism in the Congo by supporting Tshombe and \"his hired killers\" as he called the White mercenaries [174] X accused Tshombe and the American president Lyndon B Johnson of \"...sleeping together When I say sleeping together, I don't mean that literally But beyond that, they're in the same bed Johnson is paying the salaries, paying the government, propping up Tshombe's government, this murderer\" [174]\n\n\nReturn to United States\nAfter returning to the U.S., Malcolm X addressed a wide variety of audiences He spoke regularly at meetings held by MMI and the OAAU, and was one of the most sought-after speakers on college campuses [191] One of his top aides later wrote that he \"welcomed every opportunity to speak to college students.\" [192] He also addressed public meetings of the Socialist Workers Party, speaking at their Militant Labor Forum [193] He was interviewed on the subjects of segregation and the Nation of Islam by Robert Penn Warren for Warren's 1965 book Who Speaks for the Negro? [194]\n\n\nDeath threats and intimidation from Nation of Islam\nThroughout 1964, as his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, Malcolm X was repeatedly threatened [195]\n\n\nAssassination\nOn February 19, 1965, Malcolm X told interviewer Gordon Parks that the Nation of Islam was actively trying to kill him On February 21, 1965, he was preparing to address the OAAU in Manhattan's Audubon Ballroom when someone in the 400-person audience yelled,\n\"Nigger! Get your hand outta my pocket!\" [210] [211] [212]\n\n\nFuneral\nThe public viewing, February 23–26 at Unity Funeral Home in Harlem, was attended by some 14,000 to 30,000 mourners [235]\nFor the funeral on February 27, loudspeakers were set up for the overflow crowd outside Harlem's thousand-seat Faith Temple of the Church of God in Christ, [236] [237] and a local television station carried the service live [238]\n\n\nReactions\nReactions to Malcolm X's assassination were varied In a telegram to Betty Shabazz, Martin Luther King Jr expressed his sadness at \"the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband.\" [243] He said: [243]\n\n\nAllegations of conspiracy\nWithin days the question of who bore responsibility for the assassination was being publicly debated On February 23, James Farmer, leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, announced at a news conference that local drug dealers, and not the Nation of Islam, were to blame [256] Others accused the NYPD, the FBI, or the CIA, citing the lack of police protection, the ease with which the assassins entered the Audubon Ballroom, and the failure of the police to preserve the crime scene [257] [258] Earl Grant, one of Malcolm X's associates who was present at the assassination, later wrote: [259]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nExcept for his autobiography, Malcolm X left no published writings His philosophy is known almost entirely from the many speeches and interviews he gave from 1952 until his death [280] Many of those speeches, especially from the last year of his life, were recorded and have been published [281]\n\n\nBeliefs of the Nation of Islam\nThe white liberal differs from the white con­serv­a­tive only in one way: the liberal is more deceitful than the conservative.\n\n\nPalestine\nIn 1959, Malcolm X visited and met with religious leaders at Al-Aqsa mosque as a representative of Elijah Muhammad [296] In 1964, X visited the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza where he visited a local hospital and dined with religious leaders in Gaza He also met Palestinian poet, Harun Hashem Rashid, who recounted to him how he narrowly escaped the Khan Younis massacre of 1956 A few weeks later, Malcolm X headed to Cairo where he met with members of the Palestinian Liberation Organization [296] These meetings and experiences inspired Malcolm X to write an essay entitled \"Zionist Logic\" that was published in the Egyptian Gazette [296] In this essay Malcolm X explained how the \"present occupation of Arab Palestine has no intelligent or legal basis in history\" and described how Zionism was essentially a colonial and imperialist project: [297]\n\n\nIndependent views\nThe common goal of 22 million Afro-Americans is respect as human beings. .. We can never get civil rights in America until our human rights are first restored We will never be recognized as citizens there until we are first recognized as humans. ...\n\n\nClaims of bisexuality\nIn recent years, some researchers [who?] have alleged that Malcolm X was bisexual These claims are founded upon the work of late Columbia University historian Manning Marable, and his controversial 2011 book Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention In the book, Marable asserted that \"Malcolm X had exaggerated his early criminal career and had engaged in an early homosexual relationship with a White businessman.\" [310]\n\n\nLegacy\nMalcolm X has been described as one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history [313] [314] [315] He is credited with raising the self-esteem of Black Americans and reconnecting them with their African heritage [316] He is largely responsible for the spread of Islam in the Black community in the United States [317] [318] [319] Many African Americans, especially those who lived in cities in the Northern and Western United States, felt that Malcolm X articulated their complaints concerning inequality better than did the mainstream civil rights movement [118] [119] One biographer says that by giving expression to their frustration, Malcolm X \"made clear the price that White America would have to pay if it did not accede to Black America's legitimate demands.\" [320]\n\n\nMemorials and tributes\nThe house that once stood at 3448 Pinkney Street in North Omaha, Nebraska, was the first home of Malcolm Little with his birth family The house was torn down in 1965 by new owners who did not know of its connection with Malcolm X [338] The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 [339] [340] [341] A Nebraska Historical Marker now marks the site The Malcolm X—Ella Little-Collins House in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts, where Malcolm X lived with his half-sister Ella Little-Collins and began getting involved in the Nation of Islam, [342] was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2021 [343] Several archaeological surveys have been performed on the house's grounds, and there are ongoing efforts to preserve the site [344]\n\n\nPortrayal in film, in television, and on stage\nIn 1986, composer Anthony Davis's opera X, The Life and Times of Malcolm X premiered at the New York City Opera It was the first work by Davis, who would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his opera The Central Park Five (2019) [375] In 2023, it was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in a production by Robert O'Hara, with Will Liverman playing the title role It received positive reviews [376]\n\n\nPublished works\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

County was formed from a portion of Orange County, effective June 1, 1777 [29] It was created so that governance could be more localized and efficient [30] The county was named for Richard Caswell who was the first governor of North Carolina after the Declaration of Independence in 1776, a delegate at the First and Second Continental Congresses, and a senior officer of militia in the Southern theater of the Revolutionary War [31] The legislative act creating Caswell ordered its first court to be held at the homestead of Thomas Douglas and appointed commissioners to find a permanent location to build a county courthouse and prison [29]\n\n\nIndustrialization and growth\nIn the early 1800s, Caswell County's wealthy landowners were moving away from diversified farming and accelerating toward tobacco as a single cash crop This agricultural conversion considerably affected the growth of the enslaved population, which rose 54 percent from 1800 to 1810 [10]\n\n\nEarly 19th

and the broader United States returned to civilian life, it became evident that new efforts were needed to overcome old economic barriers County leaders in the 1950s and 1960s understood that economic advancement depended on the development of water resources sufficient for industrial expansion, better infrastructure such as roads, providing new and various county-wide services, increasing cultural resources, and operating local government in a business-like fashion [46] The history of Caswell County in the second half of the 20th century is characterized by much progress in these areas, but critical needs remained What is more, the heritage of the county's earlier Boom Era of bright leaf tobacco and Greek Revival architecture represented both an opportunity and a hindrance

plantation way of life had disappeared Small farmers fell into deeper poverty Abandoned land and eroded soil permeated the landscape The area faced a decreased standard of living and insufficient public revenue for services that governments ordinarily provided [10]\n\n\nCivil rights movement\nBy the end of the 1960s, Caswell County's public schools were beginning to fully integrate A decade and a half earlier in 1954, the U.S Supreme Court ruled in Brown v Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional In a later decision by the Court in May 1955 known as Brown II, school districts were given the ambiguous order to desegregate \"with all deliberate speed.\" [77] Like many school boards in the South at the time, the Caswell County Board of Education interpreted the Court's ambiguity in a manner that served to delay, obstruct, and slow the process of racially integrating its schools [78] [79]\n\n\nPolitical leaders\nCaswell County has produced

Cataracts can be either a cortical cataract with a blue dot appearance, or a posterior subcapsular cataract [6] Other organs affected include the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and brain [5] Insulin resistance can also occur [5] Signs and symptoms vary considerably by severity, unusual phenotype, and form (DM1/DM2) [citation needed] DM1 and DM2 differ in regards to the muscles they affect, age of onset, severity of disease, and extramuscular manifestations [5]\n\n\nDM1\nThe microsatellite expansion responsible for DM1 is of cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) triplet repeats, termed trinucleotide repeat expansion and classifying DM1 as one of several trinucleotide repeat disorders This expansion occurs at the end of the DMPK gene, in the 3' untranslated region DMPK is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 [9] [10] DMPK codes for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, [11] a protein expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle [12]\n\n\nCongenital DM1\nWhen DM1 onsets at birth, it is called congenital DM1 [5] Manifestations that can be present at birth include hypotonia, respiratory failure, feeding difficulty, and club foot (talipes equinovarus), any of which tend to resolve over several years [5] During childhood, intellectual impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can result [5] Gastrointestinal issues can result, which can be severe, manifestations including diarrhea, constipation, and fecal incontinence [5] The symptoms of adult DM often manifest during adolescence [5] Infantile DM1 can be distinguished as another disease category, or it can be grouped with congenital DM1 or childhood-onset DM1 [7] [citation needed]\n\n\nChildhood-onset DM1\nChildhood-onset DM1 is defined as onset of symptoms between ages 1 and 10 years [5] Manifestations include the same intellectual and gastrointestinal symptoms seen in congenital DM1 [5]\n\n\nDM2\nThe microsatellite expansion responsible for DM2 is of cytosine-cytosine-thymine-guanine (CCTG) repeats, classifying it as a tetranucleotide repeat disorder This expansion occurs in the first intron CNBP gene on chromosome 3 [17] [18] [19]\n\n\nGenetics\nMyotonic dystrophy (DM) is a genetic condition that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease The mutation involves satellite DNA, which is tandemly repeated sequences of DNA that do not code for a protein The repeats implicated in myotonic dystrophy are either 3 or 4 nucleotides in length, classified as microsatellites Disease results from an abnormally increased number of these microsatellites, termed microsatellite expansion.\n\n\nDM1\nThe microsatellite expansion responsible for DM1 is of cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) triplet repeats, termed trinucleotide repeat expansion and classifying DM1 as one of several trinucleotide repeat disorders This expansion occurs at the end of the DMPK gene, in the 3' untranslated region DMPK is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 [9] [10] DMPK codes for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, [11] a protein expressed predominantly

expansion occurs in the first intron CNBP gene on chromosome 3 [17] [18] [19]\n\n\nPathophysiology\nMutations of DM1 and DM2 cause production of RNA that sequesters RNA-binding proteins, causing dysregulated RNA splicing [5] This dysregulated RNA splicing is particularly toxic to skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle [20] One example in DM1 involves the chloride channel ClC-1 [5] Mutated DMPK RNA binds to MBNL1, causing ClC-1 pre-mRNA to be spliced into the fetal form instead of the adult form [5] Functional loss of the chloride channel causes myotonia [5]\n\n\nMolecular\nMutations of DM1

of the chloride channel causes myotonia [5]\n\n\nHistology\nIn DM1, there can be increased central nuclei, angular fibers, fiber atrophy, and pyknotic clumps [5] There can be selective atrophy of type 1 muscle fibers [21] Muscle fibers show signs of degeneration and regeneration [21] There is modest fibrosis of the endomysium [21]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of DM1 and DM2 can be difficult due to the large number of neuromuscular disorders, most of which are very rare One study found that diagnosis is made an average of seven years after symptom onset for DM1, and fourteen years for DM2 [22] [5]\n\n\nClassification\nThere are two main types of myotonic dystrophy Type 1 (DM1), also known as Steinert disease, has a severe congenital form and a milder childhood-onset form as well as an adult-onset form [23] This disease is most often in the facial muscles, levator palpebrae superioris, temporalis, sternocleidomastoids, distal muscles of the forearm, hand intrinsic muscles, and ankle dorsiflexors [24] Type 2 (DM2), also known as proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM), is rarer and generally manifests with milder signs and symptoms than DM1 [8]\n\n\nGenetic testing\nGenetic tests, including prenatal testing, are available for both confirmed forms Molecular testing is considered the gold standard of diagnosis.\n\n\nPrenatal testing\nTesting at pregnancy to determine whether an unborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing in a family has identified a DMPK mutation This can be done at 10–12 weeks gestation by a procedure called chorionic villus sampling (CVS) that involves removing a tiny piece of the placenta and analyzing DNA from its cells It can also be done by amniocentesis after 14 weeks gestation by removing a small amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzing the cells in the fluid Each of these procedures has a small risk of miscarriage associated with it and those who are interested in learning more should check with their doctor or genetic counselor.\nThere is also another procedure called preimplantation diagnosis that allows a couple to have a child that is unaffected by the genetic condition in their family This procedure is experimental and not widely available Those interested in learning more about this procedure should check with their doctor or genetic counselor.\n\n\nPredictive testing\nIt is possible to test someone who is at risk for developing DM1 before they are showing symptoms to see whether they inherited an expanded trinucleotide repeat This is called predictive testing Predictive testing cannot determine the age of onset that someone will begin to have symptoms or the course of the disease If the child is not having symptoms, the testing is not possible with an exception of emancipated minors as a policy.\n\n\nAuxiliary testing\nElectrodiagnostic testing (EMG and NCS) can detect the electrical signs of myotonia before myotonia becomes noticeable to the affected individual [5]\n\n\nManagement\nThere is currently no cure for or treatment specific to myotonic dystrophy Management is focused on the complications of the disease, particularly those related to the lungs and heart, which are life-threatening [27] Complications relating to the cardiopulmonary system account for 70% of deaths due to DM1 [13] Compromised lung function can, in turn, contribute to life-threatening complications during anesthesia and pregnancy [27]\n\n\nPhysical activity\nThere is a lack of high-quality evidence to determine the effectiveness and the safety of physical activities for people who have myotonic dystrophy [29] Further research is required to determine if combined strength and aerobic training at moderate intensity is safe for people who have neuromuscular diseases, however the combination of aerobic and strength exercises may increase muscle strength [30] [29] Aerobic exercise via stationary bicycle with an ergometer may be safe and effective in improving fitness in people with DM1 [31] Cardiovascular impairments and myotonic sensitivities to exercise and temperature necessitate close monitoring of people and educating people in self-monitoring during exercise via the Borg scale, heart rate monitors, and other physical exertion measurements [32]\n\n\nOrthotics\nMuscular weakness of dorsiflexors (dorsiflexion) hinders the ability to clear the floor during the swing phase of gait and people may adopt a steppage gait pattern [32] or ankle-foot-orthotics may be indicated [13] Factors such as hand function, skin integrity, and comfort must be assessed prior to prescription Neck braces can also be prescribed for neck muscle weakness [13]\n\n\nMobility aids and adaptive equipment\nUpper and lower limb weakness, visual impairments and myotonia may lead to the need for mobility aids and functional adaptive equipment such as buttonhooks and handled sponges for optimal hand function If assistive devices and home adaptations are needed, physical therapists may refer on to occupational therapist(s) for further assessment [13]\n\n\nPrognosis\nLife expectancy in non-congenital late-onset or adult onset DM1 is in the early 50s, [5] with pulmonary complications being the leading cause of death, followed by cardiac complications [27] DM2 life expectancy has yet to be studied [5]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nThe prevalence of DM1 ranges from 5 to 20 per 100,000 (1:20,000–1:5000) [5] Up to 48 per 100,000 (1:2100) of individuals tested positive for the mutation of DM1 in New York, although not all of these individuals would have become symptomatic [33] Again in New York, premutations for DM1 were found in 191 per 100,000 (1:525) [33] DM2 prevalence is not known, but genetic studies estimate it to be as high as 1:1830 [5] DM affects males and females approximately equally [citation needed] About 30,000 people in the United States are affected [citation needed] In most populations, DM1 appears to be more common than DM2 However, recent studies suggest that type 2 may be as common as type 1 among people in Germany and Finland [1]\n\n\nHistory\nMyotonic dystrophy was first described by a German physician, Hans Gustav Wilhelm Steinert, who first published a series of six cases of the condition in 1909 [34]  Isolated case reports of myotonia had been published previously, including reports by Frederick Eustace Batten and Hans Curschmann, and type 1 myotonic dystrophy is therefore sometimes known as Curschmann-Batten-Steinert syndrome [35] The underlying cause of type 1 myotonic dystrophy was determined in 1992 [2]\n\n\nResearch directions\nAltered splicing of the muscle-specific chloride channel 1 (ClC-1) has been shown to cause the myotonic phenotype of DM1 and is reversible in mouse models using Morpholino antisense to modify splicing of ClC-1 mRNA [36]\n\n\nReferences\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Introduction\n\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects muscle tone and other bodily systems. It is characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness, as well as other symptoms such as cataracts, heart problems, and respiratory issues. Myotonic dystrophy is a complex condition that affects individuals of all ages, from infancy to old age. This article will provide an overview of the signs and symptoms, genetics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, classification, and management of myotonic dystrophy.\n\n# Signs and Symptoms\n\nMyotonic dystrophy causes muscle weakness, early onset of cataracts, and myotonia, which is delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction. Cataracts can be either a cortical cataract with a blue dot appearance, or a posterior subcapsular cataract. Other organs affected include the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and brain. Insulin resistance can also occur. Signs and symptoms vary considerably by severity, unusual phenotype, and form (DM1/DM2). DM1 and DM2 differ in regards to the muscles they affect, age of onset, severity of disease, and extramuscular manifestations.\n\n# DM1\n\nThe microsatellite expansion responsible for DM1 is of cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) triplet repeats, termed trinucleotide repeat expansion and classifying DM1 as one of several trinucleotide repeat disorders. This expansion occurs at the end of the DMPK gene, in the 3' untranslated region. DMPK is located on the long arm of chromosome 19.

Manifestations include the same intellectual and gastrointestinal symptoms seen in congenital DM1.\n\n## Adult-onset DM1\n\nThe symptoms of adult DM often manifest during adolescence. Adult-onset DM1 is the most common form of the disease and is characterized by muscle weakness, cataracts, and other systemic symptoms.\n\n# DM2\n\nThe microsatellite expansion responsible for DM2 is of cytosine-cytosine-thymine-guanine (CCTG) repeats, classifying it as a tetranucleotide repeat disorder. This expansion occurs in the first intron CNBP gene on chromosome 3. CNBP codes for CCHC-type zinc finger nuclear protein, a protein involved in RNA processing.\n\n## Clinical features of DM2\n\nDM2, also known as proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM), is characterized by muscle weakness, cataracts, and other systemic symptoms. The disease typically affects individuals in their 20s to 50s and may be more severe than DM1.\n\n## Diagnostic criteria for DM2\n\nThe diagnosis of DM2 is based on clinical features, including muscle weakness, cataracts, and other systemic symptoms. Genetic testing may also be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n# Genetics\n\nMyotonic dystrophy (DM) is a genetic condition that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.

DM2 is of cytosine-cytosine-thymine-guanine (CCTG) repeats, classifying it as a tetranucleotide repeat disorder This expansion occurs in the first intron CNBP gene on chromosome 3 [17] [18] [19]\n\n\nGenetics\nMyotonic dystrophy (DM) is a genetic condition that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease The mutation involves satellite DNA, which is tandemly repeated sequences of DNA that do not code for a protein The repeats implicated in myotonic dystrophy are either 3 or 4 nucleotides in length, classified as microsatellites Disease results from an abnormally increased number of these microsatellites, termed microsatellite expansion.\n\n\nDM1\nThe microsatellite expansion responsible for DM1 is of cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) triplet repeats, termed trinucleotide repeat expansion and classifying DM1 as one of several trinucleotide repeat disorders This expansion occurs at the end of the DMPK gene, in the 3' untranslated region DMPK is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 [9] [10] DMPK codes for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, [11] a protein expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle [12]\n\n\nDM2\nThe microsatellite expansion responsible for DM2 is of cytosine-cytosine-thymine-guanine (CCTG) repeats, classifying it as a tetranucleotide repeat disorder This expansion occurs in the first intron CNBP gene on chromosome 3 [17] [18] [19]\n\n\nPathophysiology\nMutations of DM1 and DM2 cause production of RNA that sequesters RNA-binding proteins, causing dysregulated RNA splicing [5] This dysregulated RNA splicing is particularly toxic to skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle [20] One example in DM1 involves the chloride channel ClC-1 [5] Mutated DMPK RNA binds to MBNL1, causing ClC-1 pre-mRNA to be spliced into the fetal form instead of the adult form [5] Functional loss of the chloride channel causes myotonia [5]\n\n\nMolecular\nMutations of DM1 and DM2 cause production of RNA that sequesters RNA-binding proteins, causing dysregulated RNA splicing [5] This dysregulated RNA splicing is particularly toxic to skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle [20] One example in DM1 involves the chloride channel ClC-1 [5] Mutated DMPK RNA binds to MBNL1, causing ClC-1 pre-mRNA to be spliced into the fetal form instead of the adult form [5] Functional loss of the chloride channel causes myotonia [5]\n\n\nHistology\nIn DM1, there can be increased central nuclei, angular fibers, fiber atrophy, and pyknotic clumps [5] There can be selective atrophy of type 1 muscle fibers [21] Muscle fibers show signs of degeneration and regeneration [21] There is modest fibrosis of the endomysium [21]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of DM1 and DM2 can be difficult due to the large number of neuromuscular disorders, most of which are very rare One study found that diagnosis is made an average of seven years after symptom onset for DM1, and fourteen years for DM2 [22] [5]\n\n\nClassification\nThere are two main types of myotonic dystrophy Type 1 (DM1), also known as Steinert disease, has a severe congenital form and a milder childhood-onset form as well as an adult-onset form [23] This disease is most often in the facial muscles, levator palpebrae superioris, temporalis, sternocleidomastoids, distal muscles of the forearm, hand intrinsic muscles, and ankle dorsiflexors [24] Type 2 (DM2), also known as proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM), is rarer and generally manifests with milder signs and symptoms than DM1 [8]\n\n\nGenetic testing\nGenetic tests, including prenatal testing, are available for both confirmed forms Molecular testing is considered the gold standard of diagnosis.\n\n\nPrenatal testing\nTesting at pregnancy to determine whether an unborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing in a family has identified a DMPK mutation This can be done at 10–12 weeks gestation by a procedure called chorionic villus sampling (CVS) that involves removing a tiny piece of the placenta and analyzing DNA from its cells It can also be done by amniocentesis after 14 weeks gestation by removing a small amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzing the cells in the fluid Each of these procedures has a small risk of miscarriage associated with it and those who are interested in learning more should check with their doctor or genetic counselor.\nThere is also another procedure called preimplantation diagnosis that allows a couple to have a child that is unaffected by the genetic condition in their family This procedure is experimental and not widely available Those interested in learning more about this procedure should check with their doctor or genetic counselor.\n\n\nPredictive testing\nIt is possible to test someone who is at risk for developing DM1 before they are showing symptoms to see whether they inherited an expanded trinucleotide repeat This is called predictive testing Predictive testing cannot determine the age of onset that someone will begin to have symptoms or the course of the disease If the child is not having symptoms, the testing is not possible with an exception of emancipated minors as a policy.\n\n\nAuxiliary testing\nElectrodiagnostic testing (EMG and NCS) can detect the electrical signs of myotonia before myotonia becomes noticeable to the affected individual [5]\n\n\nManagement\nThere is currently no cure for or treatment specific to myotonic dystrophy Management is focused on the complications of the disease, particularly those related to the lungs and heart, which are life-threatening [27] Complications relating to the cardiopulmonary system account for 70% of deaths due to DM1 [13] Compromised lung function can, in turn, contribute to life-threatening complications during anesthesia and pregnancy [27]\n\n\nPhysical activity\nThere is a lack of high-quality evidence to determine the effectiveness and the safety of physical activities for people who have myotonic dystrophy [29] Further research is required to determine if combined strength and aerobic training at moderate intensity is safe for people who have neuromuscular diseases, however the combination of aerobic and strength exercises may increase muscle strength [30] [29] Aerobic exercise via stationary bicycle with an ergometer may be safe and effective in improving fitness in people with DM1 [31] Cardiovascular impairments and myotonic sensitivities to exercise and temperature necessitate close monitoring of people and educating people in self-monitoring during exercise via the Borg scale, heart rate monitors, and other physical exertion measurements [32]\n\n\nOrthotics\nMuscular weakness of dorsiflexors (dorsiflexion) hinders the ability to clear the floor during the swing phase of gait and people may adopt a steppage gait pattern [32] or ankle-foot-orthotics may be indicated [13] Factors such as hand function, skin integrity, and comfort must be assessed prior to prescription Neck braces can also be prescribed for neck muscle weakness [13]\n\n\nMobility aids and adaptive equipment\nUpper and lower limb weakness, visual impairments and myotonia may lead to the need for mobility aids and functional adaptive equipment such as buttonhooks and handled sponges for optimal hand function If assistive devices and home adaptations are needed, physical therapists may refer on to occupational therapist(s) for further assessment [13]\n\n\nPrognosis\nLife expectancy in non-congenital late-onset or adult onset DM1 is in the early 50s, [5] with pulmonary complications being the leading cause of death, followed by cardiac complications [27] DM2 life expectancy has yet to be studied [5]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nThe prevalence of DM1 ranges from 5 to 20 per 100,000 (1:20,000–1:5000) [5] Up to 48 per 100,000 (1:2100) of individuals tested positive for the mutation of DM1 in New York, although not all of these individuals would have become symptomatic [33] Again in New York, premutations for DM1 were found in 191 per 100,000 (1:525) [33] DM2 prevalence is not known, but genetic studies estimate it to be as high as 1:1830 [5] DM affects males and females approximately equally [citation needed] About 30,000 people in the United States are affected [citation needed] In most populations, DM1 appears to be more common than DM2 However, recent studies suggest that type 2 may be as common as type 1 among people in Germany and Finland [1]\n\n\nHistory\nMyotonic dystrophy was first described by a German physician, Hans Gustav Wilhelm Steinert, who first published a series of six cases of the condition in 1909 [34]  Isolated case reports of myotonia had been published previously, including reports by Frederick Eustace Batten and Hans Curschmann, and type 1 myotonic dystrophy is therefore sometimes known as Curschmann-Batten-Steinert syndrome [35] The underlying cause of type 1 myotonic dystrophy was determined in 1992 [2]\n\n\nResearch directions\nAltered splicing of the muscle-specific chloride channel 1 (ClC-1) has been shown to cause the myotonic phenotype of DM1 and is reversible in mouse models using Morpholino antisense to modify splicing of ClC-1 mRNA [36]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The concept of parents protecting their children appealed to him, especially as his second child with Blunt had recently been born [6] [14]\n\n\nFilming\nThe film was shot in 36 days [17] Production took place from May to November 2017 in Dutchess and Ulster counties in upstate New York Filmmakers spent their budget locally, including a purchase of 20 tons of corn, which they hired local farmers to grow Some filming took place on a soundstage in the town of Pawling in Dutchess County, as well as on-location in the county's city of Beacon [20] Filming also took place on the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail in New Paltz of Ulster County, using the Springtown Truss Bridge [21] Outside Dutchess and Ulster counties, filming took place on Main Street in Little Falls in Herkimer County, New York [22]\n\n\nSound and music\nDuring filming, the crew avoided making noise so diegetic synchronized sounds (e.g., the sound of rolling dice on a game board) could be recorded; the sounds were amplified in post-production [23] A musical score was added, which Krasinski justified in wanting audiences to have a cinematic experience and some familiarity with a traditional film component, instead of feeling like they're part of a \"silence experiment.\" Some music was cut from the film, which Krasinski found more impactful than having the score dominate scenes [23]\n\n\nUse of sign language\nThe characters communicate in American Sign Language (ASL) to avoid making sound, so the filmmakers hired deaf mentor Douglas Ridloff to teach ASL to the actors and to be available to make corrections They also hired an ASL interpreter for deaf actress Simmonds, so that spoken and signed language could be interpreted back and forth on set [28] Simmonds grew up with ASL, and she helped teach her fellow actors to sign [29] She said, \"In the movie, we've been signing together for years and years So it should look fluent.\" [30] She observed that each character's use of sign language reflected their motivations: the father had short and brief signs which showed his survival mentality, while the mother had more expressive signs as part of wanting her children to experience more than survival [31] Krasinski said that Simmonds's character used \"signing that's very defiant, it's very teenage defiant.\" [32]\n\n\nCreature design\nProduction designer Jeffrey Beecroft headed the creature design, and Industrial Light & Magic created the creatures, led by visual effects supervisor Scott Farrar The director wanted the creatures to look like they had evolved to no longer need eyes, and to be \"somewhat humanoid\" in nature Farrar said the initial creature design showed them with rhinoceros-like horns out of their faces, but later redesigns omitted this because it was not scary enough Creature designers referenced prehistoric fish, black snakes, and bats, particularly their movement patterns Inspiration was also drawn from bog people: cadavers that have been mummified in peat, turning the skin black and giving it a sagging, leathery look.\" [35] Krasinski provided motion capture for the creatures [7]\n\n\nMarketing\nParamount Pictures released the first trailer for A Quiet Place in November 2017 [36] It aired a 30-second commercial for the film during the US football championship Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018 [37] Of the seven trailers that aired during the playoff, A Quiet Place and Red Sparrow were shown during the pregame and had the lowest views and social conversations A Quiet Place had 149,000 views on YouTube, 275,000 views on Facebook, and 2,900 social conversations [38] [39] On February 12, 2018, Krasinski appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to present the full trailer for A Quiet Place [40] The studio spent an estimated $86 million on prints and advertisements for the film [41]\n\n\nRelease\nA Quiet Place had its world premiere at the South by Southwest film festival as the opening-night film on March 9, 2018 [42] It was selected

movie is that it starts a conversation The fact that people are leaving and talking about anything is really fun—but certainly about deep stuff like that, is awesome.\" [93] Krasinski, who did not grow up with horror films, said that prior films of the genre such as Don't Breathe (2016) and Get Out (2017) that had societal commentary were part of his research In addition to considering his film a metaphor for parenthood, he compared the premise to US politics in 2018, \"I think in our political situation, that's what's going on now: You can close your eyes and stick your head in the sand, or you can try to participate in whatever's going on.\" He cited Jaws (1975) as an influence, with how the protagonist police officer moved from New York to an island to avoid frightening situations, and was forced to encounter one in his new location with shark attacks [96]\n\n\nHome media\nA Quiet Place was released on Digital HD on June 26, 2018, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on July 10,

commentary the film encouraged, Krasinski said, \"That's not what I was going for, but the best compliment you can get on any movie is that it starts a conversation The fact that people are leaving and talking about anything is really fun—but certainly about deep stuff like that, is awesome.\" [93] Krasinski, who did not grow up with horror films, said that prior films of the genre such as Don't Breathe (2016) and Get Out (2017) that had societal commentary were part of his research In addition to considering his film a metaphor for parenthood, he compared the premise to US politics in 2018, \"I think in our political situation, that's what's going on now: You can close your eyes and stick your head in the sand, or you can try to participate in whatever's going on.\" He cited Jaws (1975) as an influence, with how the protagonist police officer moved from New York to an island to avoid frightening situations, and was forced to encounter one in his new location with shark attacks

recalled feeling ignored by his mother Both of his parents worked long hours and paid little attention to their children at home [10]\n\n\nCase history\nOn January 15, 1974, four members of the Otero family were murdered in Wichita [37] The victims were Joseph Otero Sr (38), Julia Maria \"Julie\" Otero (33), Joseph \"Joey\" Otero II (9) and Josephine \"Josie\" Otero (11) Their bodies were discovered by the family's three older children, who had been at school at the time of the killings [37] [38] After his 2005 arrest, Rader confessed to the Otero murders [39] He claimed that he first targeted the family two months prior, when he spotted Julie leaving to take her children to school and followed them On the morning of January 15, Rader cut the phone lines and entered the Otero

leaving to take her children to school and followed them On the morning of January 15, Rader cut the phone lines and entered the Otero residence when Joey opened the back door for the family dog [39]\n\n\nSuspected murders\nOn August 23, 2023, the Associated Press reported that Rader was considered the prime suspect in two further killings in Oklahoma and Missouri Authorities discovered \"possible trophies\" from victims after launching a search for evidence at Rader's former Park City home, resulting in the investigation of his potential involvement in additional unsolved disappearances and murders: [55]\n\n\nCold case\nBy 2004, the investigation of the BTK killer was considered a cold case However, Rader initiated a series of eleven communications to local media, which led directly to his arrest in February 2005 In March 2004, The Wichita Eagle received a letter from someone using the name \"Bill Thomas Killman\" claiming that he had murdered Vicki Wegerle in 1986 Enclosed with the message were photographs of the crime scene and a photocopy of Wegerle's driver's license, which had been stolen at the time of the crime [60] Prior to this message, it had not been definitively established that Wegerle was killed by BTK [60] DNA collected from under her fingernails provided police with previously unknown evidence They began DNA testing hundreds of men in an effort to find the killer [61] Altogether, more than 1,300 DNA samples were taken and later destroyed by court order [62]\n\n\nArrest\nRader was arrested while driving near his home in Park City shortly after noon on February 25, 2005 [76] An officer asked, \"Mr Rader, do you know why you're going downtown?\" Rader replied, \"Oh, I have suspicions why.\" [77] [78] Wichita Police, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, the FBI and ATF agents searched Rader's home and vehicle, seizing evidence including computer equipment, a pair of black pantyhose retrieved from a shed and a cylindrical

\"The bottom line: BTK is arrested.\" [79] [80]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nOn February 28, 2005, Rader was charged with ten counts of first degree murder [81] Soon afterward, the Associated Press cited an anonymous source alleging that Rader had confessed to other murders in addition to those with which he had been connected [82] However, the Sedgwick County district attorney denied the story, yet refused to say whether Rader had made any confessions or if investigators were looking into his possible involvement in more unsolved killings [83] On March 5, news sources claimed to have verified by multiple sources that Rader had confessed to the ten murders he was charged with, but no other ones [84]\n\n\nFurther investigations\nFollowing Rader's arrest, police in Wichita and several surrounding cities looked into unsolved cases with the cooperation of the state police and the FBI They particularly focused on cases after 1994, when the death penalty was reinstated in Kansas Police in surrounding states also investigated cold cases that fit Rader's pattern After exhaustive investigations, none of these agencies discovered any further murders attributable to Rader, supporting early suspicions that he would have taken responsibility for any additional murders that he had committed As a result, the ten known murders were at that point believed to be the only murders for which Rader was actually responsible, although Wichita police are fairly certain that he stalked and researched a number of other potential victims This includes one person who was saved when Rader called off his planned attack upon his arrival near the target's home due to the presence of construction and road crews nearby Rader stated in his police interview that \"there are a lot of lucky people\", meaning that he had thought about and developed various levels of murder plans for other victims [21]\n\n\nEvaluation by Robert Mendoza\nMassachusetts psychologist Robert Mendoza was hired by Rader's public defenders to conduct a psychological evaluation and determine if an insanity-based defense might be viable He conducted an interview after Rader had pleaded guilty on June 27, 2005 Mendoza diagnosed Rader with narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive and antisocial personality disorders: he observed that Rader has a grandiose sense of self, a belief that he is \"special\" and therefore entitled to special treatment; a pathological need for attention and admiration; a preoccupation with maintaining rigid order and structure; and a complete lack of empathy

It is a numerical scale that reflects the concentration of pollutants in the air, with higher values indicating poorer air quality. The API is widely used in many countries, including Malaysia, China, and Hong Kong, to inform the public about the air quality and to provide guidance on health-related precautions.\n\n# Malaysia\n\n## Overview\n\nThe air quality in Malaysia is reported as the API (Air Pollutant Index) or in Malay as IPU (Indeks Pencemaran Udara). The API is a critical tool for monitoring air pollution in Malaysia, as it helps to identify areas with poor air quality and inform the public about the health risks associated with exposure to pollutants. The API is calculated based on the concentration of five pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM2.5).\n\n## Measurement Units\n\nThe API in Malaysia reports four of the index's pollutant components (i.e., carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide) in parts per million by volume (ppmv). However, particulate matter (PM2.5) is reported in micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3). This dual measurement system allows for a more comprehensive understanding of air quality, as it takes into account both gaseous and particulate pollutants.\n\n## Reporting\n\nThe API is reported on a color-coded scale, with different colors indicating varying levels of air pollution. The colors range from green, indicating good air quality, to red, indicating very poor air quality. The API is typically reported in hourly intervals, providing real-time information on air quality. However, PM2.5 is reported on a daily basis, as its concentration can vary significantly over short periods.\n\n## Health Impacts\n\nExposure to poor air quality can have significant health impacts, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. Prolonged exposure to pollutants can lead to respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer. Therefore, it is essential to monitor air quality closely and take necessary precautions to mitigate the health risks associated with poor air quality.\n\n# Former Indices\n\n## China\n\nChina's State Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is responsible for measuring the level of air pollution in China. As of 2008, SEPA monitored daily pollution levels in 86 of its major cities. The AQI level was based on the level of five atmospheric pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), suspended particulates (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3), measured at monitoring stations throughout each city.\n\n## Hong Kong\n\nThe API was in use in Hong Kong from June 1995 to December 2013. It was measured and updated hourly by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD). Additionally, the EPD made forecasts of the API for the following day every day.\n\n# China\n\n## Overview\n\nChina's State Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is responsible for measuring the level of air pollution in China.

However, there are different measurement units used in different cities. Some cities use parts per billion (ppb) for SO2, while others use ppmv. Similarly, PM10 is measured in micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3) in some cities, while others use milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3).\n\n## Reporting\n\nThe AQI is reported on a color-coded scale, with different colors indicating varying levels of air pollution.

Kourtney has gained international recognition through her family's reality television show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and has become a successful entrepreneur in her own right.\n\n## Early Life\n\nKourtney was born to Robert Kardashian, a lawyer, and Kris Jenner, a television personality and businesswoman. Her parents divorced in 1991, and her mother married Bruce Jenner, the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner, later that year. Through their marriage, Kourtney gained stepbrothers Burt, Brandon, and Brody; stepsister Casey; and later half-sisters Kendall and Kylie.\n\nGrowing up, Kourtney was close to her sisters Kim and Khloé, and the three of them often appeared together in public. However, Kourtney's relationship with her family members has been complicated over the years, particularly with her mother, Kris, whom she has accused of being overly controlling.\n\n## Career\n\nKourtney's career in entertainment began in 2005 when she appeared on the reality television show Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive. However, it was not until 2007 that she gained widespread recognition, thanks in part to the leak of a sex tape featuring her sister Kim and former boyfriend Ray J. The tape, titled Kim Kardashian, Superstar, was released in February 2007 and became a major sensation, largely contributing to Kourtney's rise to fame.\n\nLater that year, Kourtney's mother, Kris Jenner, met with Ryan Seacrest to pursue a reality television show based on their family. Seacrest, who had his own production company, decided to develop the idea, and the show eventually was picked up to air on the E! cable network. The series, titled Keeping Up with the Kardashians, debuted on October 14, 2007, and revolved around Kourtney, along with her parents, mother Kris and stepfather Bruce (now Caitlyn), and her siblings Kim, Khloé, Kendall, Kylie, and Rob.\n\nThe show proved successful for E!, the network on which it is broadcast, and led to several spin-offs, including Kourtney and Kim Take New York, which premiered in 2011 and followed the lives of Kourtney and her younger sister Kim as they navigated their careers and personal lives in New York City.\n\n## 2011-2018: Television and Other Ventures\n\nIn addition to her work on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kourtney appeared as a central cast member on Kourtney and Kim Take New York, which premiered in 2011. The show was renewed for a second season, which premiered in November 2011.\n\nKourtney has also pursued other business ventures, including a clothing line, Smooch, which she launched in 2008. However, the line was short-lived, and Kourtney eventually closed the business.\n\nIn 2014, Kourtney appeared on the cover of Elle magazine, and in 2015, she launched her own lifestyle blog, Poosh. The blog, which focuses on wellness, fashion, and lifestyle, has become a popular destination for fans of Kourtney and her family.\n\n## 2019-Present: Business and Continued Television Success\n\nIn March 2019, Kourtney launched her own lifestyle website, Poosh, which has become a popular destination for fans of her family and lifestyle. In November 2019, Kourtney partnered with her sisters Kim and Khloé to create three new perfumes for Kim's brand KKW Fragrance.

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Louis_van_Gaal\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlaying and early coaching career\nVan Gaal was born in Amsterdam [2] As a youngster, he started playing for the Amsterdam amateur side RKSV de Meer At the age of 20, he joined the second team of Ajax, but was never chosen to play in the first team, which at the time boasted players such as Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens in the midfield positions He was loaned to Belgian First Division side Royal Antwerp playing under Guy Thys with whom he was runner-up in the Belgian top division in 1974 and 1975 During his time with Antwerp, Van Gaal suffered a broken nose in a friendly against Kortrijk [11] After four years spent in Belgium, he returned to his homeland and made his Eredivisie debut for Telstar under the guidance of manager, Mircea Petescu, whom he followed to Sparta Rotterdam He later joined AZ, where he also became assistant coach in 1986 After a short career at AZ, he returned to Ajax to become Leo Beenhakker's assistant When Beenhakker left in 1991, Van Gaal took over as manager [12]\n\n\nManagement career\nVan Gaal was Ajax manager from 1991 until 1997 and had a very successful tenure Under Van Gaal, Ajax became the Eredivisie champions three times, in 1994, 1995 (notably going the entire 1994–95 season unbeaten in both the league and the Champions League) and 1996 [13] He also led Ajax to the KNVB Cup in 1993 and the Johan Cruyff Shield in 1993, 1994, and 1995 On the European scene, Ajax captured the UEFA Cup in 1992 [14] and the UEFA Champions League in 1995 after beating Milan in the final [15] The latter win was followed by a 5–1 aggregate win over Real Zaragoza in the 1995 UEFA Super Cup [16] Late in 1995, Ajax beat Brazilian side Grêmio on penalties to win the Intercontinental Cup [14] Ajax were also Champions League runners-up in 1996 after losing to Juventus on penalties [17]\n\n\nAjax (1991–1997)\nVan Gaal was Ajax manager from 1991 until 1997 and had a very successful tenure Under Van Gaal, Ajax became the Eredivisie champions three times, in 1994, 1995 (notably going the entire 1994–95 season unbeaten in both the league and the Champions League) and 1996 [13] He also led Ajax to the KNVB Cup in 1993 and the Johan Cruyff Shield in 1993, 1994, and 1995 On the European scene, Ajax captured the UEFA Cup in 1992 [14] and the UEFA Champions League in 1995 after beating Milan in the final [15] The latter win was followed by a 5–1 aggregate win over Real Zaragoza in the 1995 UEFA Super Cup [16] Late in 1995, Ajax beat Brazilian side Grêmio on penalties to win the Intercontinental Cup [14] Ajax were also Champions League runners-up in 1996 after losing to Juventus on penalties [17]\n\n\nBarcelona (1997–2000)\nVan Gaal moved to Barcelona in 1997, taking over from Bobby Robson, and helped the team win two La Liga titles (1997–98, 1998–99) and the Copa del Rey once [13] Despite this success, he clashed with the media and came under criticism He expressed that it was difficult to implement his football philosophy at Barcelona due to cultural differences, and that he struggled hard as some players were unwilling to follow his lead [19] His rows with Rivaldo are an example of this: Van Gaal insisted Rivaldo play as a left winger, whereas Rivaldo argued that he wanted to play in the centre, in effect undermining Van Gaal [20]\n\n\nNetherlands national team (2000–2002)\nUnder Van Gaal, the Netherlands started their campaign to qualify for the 2002 World Cup poorly Placed in Group 2, an injury-hit side could only manage to secure a late 2–2 draw at home to the Republic of Ireland, having been 2–0 down with 20 minutes to go [21] A 4–0 win over Cyprus was followed by a 2–0 defeat to Portugal.\n\n\nReturn to Barcelona (2002–2003)\nVan Gaal returned to Barcelona for the start of the 2002–03 season on a contract until June 2005, but results were inconsistent The club won a record-equalling ten successive matches in the Champions League but struggled in La Liga After four wins, four draws and three defeats from their opening 11 league matches, Barcelona lost three matches in a row, to Real Sociedad, relegation-threatened Rayo Vallecano and Sevilla Two wins and a draw improved things but after successive defeats to Valencia and Celta Vigo, he left by mutual consent on 28 January 2003 with the club in 12th place, just three points above the relegation zone and 20 points behind leaders Real Sociedad [12]\n\n\nReturn to Ajax (2004)\nIn 2004, Van Gaal returned to Ajax as a technical director, but resigned later that year due to an internal conflict with Ronald Koeman [28] [29]\n\n\nAZ (2005–2009)\nIn January 2005, it was announced that Van Gaal would replace Co Adriaanse as AZ manager on 1 July 2005 [30] [31] Under Van Gaal, AZ finished second in the Eredivisie in 2005–06 and third in 2006–07 Van Gaal also led AZ to a runners-up finish in the 2006–07 KNVB Cup and lost a 2007–08 Champions League qualification play-off to Ajax 4–2 on aggregate.\n\n\nBayern Munich (2009–2011)\nOn 1 July 2009, Van Gaal took over as coach of Bayern Munich [36] [37] He referred to his new employer as a \"dream club\" On 28 August 2009, he strengthened his team by signing compatriot Arjen Robben from Real Madrid; this reunited the two, with Van Gaal selecting Robben for his debut in the Netherlands U20 team [38] [39] [40]\n\n\nReturn to Netherlands national team (2012–2014)\nOn 6 July 2012, Van Gaal was presented as the new Netherlands coach [55] \"I am happy that the KNVB approached me\", said Van Gaal, who was assisted by former Dutch internationals Danny Blind and Patrick Kluivert, both part of his successful Ajax squad from 1995 \"This is the challenge which I have been waiting for.\" [56]\n\n\nManchester United (2014–2016)\nVan Gaal was confirmed to replace David Moyes as the new manager for Manchester United on 19 May 2014, becoming the club's first manager from outside the British Isles [66] He signed a three-year contract coming into effect after the 2014 World Cup [66] He named Ryan Giggs as his assistant manager, Marcel Bout as assistant coach, specialising in oppositional scouting and Frans Hoek as goalkeeping coach [66] Albert Stuivenberg was appointed as assistant coach [67] Van Gaal said he had inherited a \"broken\" United squad, [68] [69] [70] and that he would give youth a chance [71] Ed Woodward said Van Gaal had \"impressed everyone around the club\" and that there was \"a real positive energy and buzz around the place\" [72]\n\n\n2014–15 season\nVan Gaal's first signings were midfielder Ander Herrera for £29 million, [73] [74] and defender Luke Shaw for £30 million [75] [76] On 20 August, Argentine defender Marcos Rojo was bought for €20 million from Sporting CP [77] and, on 26 August, United signed Argentine winger Ángel Di María from Real Madrid on a five-year contract Di María's £59.7 million fee set a new record for a signing by an English club, and took the club's summer spending to a reported £130 million [78] On transfer deadline day, Van Gaal signed Daley Blind from Ajax for a fee of £14 million [79] and was granted an extension to sign Radamel Falcao on loan from Monaco for a reported £6 million [80]\n\n\n2015–16 season\nDuring the summer transfer window, Van Gaal strengthened his squad by bringing in Memphis Depay from PSV, Matteo Darmian from Torino, Sergio Romero from Sampdoria, Morgan Schneiderlin from Southampton, Bastian Schweinsteiger from Bayern Munich and Anthony Martial from Monaco.\n\n\nHiatus from managing (2016–2021)\nOn 17 January 2017, it was announced that Van Gaal had retired \"for family reasons\" [106] He later said that it was only a sabbatical [107] He announced his official retirement from football on 12 March 2019 [108] [109] Telstar announced that during the 2021–22 Eerste Divisie, Van Gaal would be managing the Telstar squad for one single match as a charity event [110]\n\n\nThird stint at the Netherlands national team (2021−2022)\nOn 4 August 2021, Van Gaal came out of retirement to take charge of the Netherlands national team for a third time He replaced Frank de Boer, who left the position in June following the team's disappointing Euro 2020 campaign [111]\n\n\nStyle of management\nVan Gaal is considered to be one of the greatest and most successful managers of all time [4] [5] [120] [121] He served as an inspiration for several other coaches due to his teams' style of play and his use of a back–three defensive line, including Gian Piero Gasperini and Alberto Malesani, as well as influencing his former assistant José Mourinho, and his former players Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] Due to his rigorous, stern, authoritative style, and strong personality he was occasionally nicknamed the \"Iron Tulip\" throughout his career, a nickname which Van Gaal himself despised, as he always believed that he had been \"fair\" as a coach [6] [7] [8] [127] Although he had several controversial conflicts with his players, the press, and members of his teams' management staff throughout his career, he was known for his leadership, and often saw himself as a \"relationship\" manager, who saw the importance of the mental aspect of the game, and was known for his ability develop young players, promote his philosophy, and create strong relationships with them, as was the case during his time at Ajax in the 90s [128]\n\n\nPersonal life\nThe youngest of nine brothers and sisters, Van Gaal was brought up as a Catholic His father, a salesman, died when Van Gaal was 11 At the age of 18, Van Gaal met Fernanda Obbes at a Catholic youth group They married three years later, and had two daughters, Brenda and Renate In 1994, Obbes died of liver and pancreatic cancer Van Gaal was mocked by fans of Ajax's opponents for her illness [154] In 2008, Van Gaal married his current wife, Truus, with whom he shares a holiday home near Albufeira, Algarve, Portugal [155]\n\n\nIn media\nIn 2000, Van Gaal appeared in Nike's \"The Mission\" campaign advertising their Total 90 range of football equipment In the advert, Van Gaal sends a team of Nike-sponsored players to retrieve a Nike Geo Merlin ball being held in a secure facility by robot ninjas Oliver Bierhoff protests, \"It's just a ball\", to which Van Gaal responds, \"No! It's rounder!\" After the players retrieve the ball, Van Gaal pilots the escape helicopter to safety [160]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nAjax [130] [170]\n\n\nClub\nAjax [130] [170]\n\n\nManagerial statistics\nAjax [130] [170]\n\n\nHonours\nAjax [130] [170]\n\n\nManager\nAjax [130] [170]\n\n\nAwards and achievements\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Allen**\n\nBobbie R. Allen was a naval aviator, safety investigator, and administrator who played a significant role in shaping the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS). Throughout his career, Allen demonstrated a commitment to aviation safety, and his contributions continue to impact the industry today.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBobbie Ray Allen was born on July 26, 1922, in Winnsboro, Texas. His father, Buddy Bura Allen, was a deaf-mute and one of twelve children born to Joe and Dollie Allen, who farmed cotton near the town of Winnsboro, Texas. Allen's mother, Edna Lorena Brown, was one of five children born to Walter Shook Brown and Hattie Belle Henderson, both of East Texas communities near Winnsboro. Allen's father was an oil field laborer and shoe cobbler, while his mother was a waitress at a small restaurant near their home in Marshall, Texas. The family eventually divorced, and Allen's mother remained in Marshall with him. In June 1942, Allen was working part-time at the Logan and Whaley Hardware Store when he graduated from Marshall High School. Just a few months later, in October 1942, he entered the Navy's V-5 program, where he would undergo training before being deployed to the Pacific theater during World War II.\n\n**Career**\n\nAllen joined the Civil Aeronautics Board in May 1959 as an Air Safety Investigator. He quickly proved himself to be an effective and diligent investigator, and his hard work paid off when he was promoted to Chief of the Chicago office. From there, Allen was named Deputy Director in Washington, D.C., where he continued to work tirelessly on behalf of aviation safety. In October 1964, Allen was named Director of the Bureau of Safety, a position he held when the National Transportation Safety Board was formed in 1967. He continued in this role until his health-related retirement on June 15, 1968. After stepping down as Director, Allen remained with the NTSB as a Special Assistant to the Director, focusing on accident prevention until his full retirement on July 31, 1970.\n\n**Aviation Safety Reporting System, Early History**\n\nIn 1966, twelve years before the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) was launched, Allen was advocating the use of computers and the concept of non-punitive incident reporting. In a November 1966 speech at a Flight Safety Foundation seminar in Madrid, Allen stated, \"The primary purpose of reporting is to identify potential hazards and to correct them before they result in accidents.\" This forward-thinking approach would eventually become a cornerstone of the ASRS, which was established in 1978 to provide a safe and confidential environment for pilots and other aviation professionals to report safety concerns.\n\n**Naval Aviator (1943–1968)**\n\nAllen served during World War II in the Pacific theater, where he was assigned to Night Fighter Squadron VF-52(N) (Night Mares). He flew the Grumman F6F Hellcat from various aircraft carriers, including the USS Roi (CVE-103), USS Saratoga (CV-3), USS Corregidor (CVE-58), USS Tripoli (CVE-64), and USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31). Although Allen deployed towards the end of the war, he still saw limited action due to the rapidly changing circumstances of the conflict.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBobbie Ray Allen married his wife, Arlene, a Nurse in the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps from Akron, Ohio, on November 18, 1944, at Vero Beach, Florida. The couple met while Arlene was stationed at NAS Pensacola, and they began dating after resolving a mail delivery mix-up. Arlene eventually resigned her commission and returned to her home in Akron, Ohio, where she waited for Ensign Allen to complete his fighter training. During their marriage, the couple raised five children and lived a life filled with the values of service, commitment, and family.\n\nIn conclusion, Bobbie R. Allen was a dedicated public servant who made significant contributions to the field of aviation safety. Through his work with the Civil Aeronautics Board and the National Transportation Safety Board, Allen helped shape the Aviation Safety Reporting System and leave a lasting impact on the industry. His commitment to safety, service, and family serves as a testament to the values that guided his life and career.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bobbie_R._Allen\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBobbie Ray Allen was born on July 26, 1922 in Winnsboro, Texas His father, Buddy Bura Allen (August 15, 1900 – November 7, 1978) was a deaf-mute and was one of twelve children born to Joe and Dollie Allen, who farmed cotton near the town of Winnsboro, Texas  Allen's mother, Edna Lorena Brown (March 6, 1903 - June 27, 1943), was one of five children, born to Walter Shook Brown and Hattie Belle Henderson, both of East Texas communities near Winnsboro Allen's father was an oil field laborer and shoe cobbler, and his mother was a waitress at a small restaurant near their home in Marshall, Texas His parents divorced; he and his mother remained in Marshall In June 1942, Allen was working part time at the Logan and Whaley Hardware Store when he graduated from Marshall High School In October of that year, he entered the Navy's V-5 program, and during training, his mother would die from cancer at the age of 40 [citation needed]\n\n\nCareer\nAllen joined the Civil Aeronautics Board in May 1959 as an Air Safety Investigator  He was subsequently promoted to Chief of the Chicago office and later named Deputy Director in Washington, D.C He was then named Director of the Bureau of Safety on October 1, 1964, and remained Director when the National Transportation Safety Board was formed in 1967 He continued until health-related retirement on June 15, 1968, when he stepped down to become Special Assistant to the Director focusing on accident prevention until July 31, 1970, when he would fully retire [2]\n\n\nAviation Safety Reporting System, Early History\nIn 1966 – twelve years before the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) was launched – Allen, as Director of the Bureau of Aviation Safety, was advocating the use of computers and the concept of non-punitive incident reporting [12] [13]\nIn a November 1966 speech at a Flight Safety Foundation seminar in Madrid, Allen stated:\n\n\nNaval Aviator (1943–1968)\nAllen served during WWII in the Pacific theater  He was assigned to Night Fighter Squadron VF-52(N) (Night Mares) flying the Grumman F6F Hellcat from the USS Roi (CVE-103), USS Saratoga (CV-3), USS Corregidor (CVE-58), USS Tripoli (CVE-64), USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31)  The war was ending when Allen deployed, and little action was seen.\n\n\nPersonal life\nBobbie Ray Allen and his wife Arlene, a Nurse in the U.S Navy Nurse Corps from Akron, Ohio, were married on November 18, 1944 at Vero Beach, Florida  They were each stationed at NAS Pensacola when they happened to meet because of a mail delivery mix-up After resolving the errant mail issue, the two began dating and within several months, decided to marry As required by Naval regulation, Mrs Allen resigned her commission and returned to her home in Akron Ohio where she would wait for Ensign Allen to complete fighter training During their marriage, they raised five children [1]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The race took place from 29 June to 21 July 2024, covering a total distance of 3,454.5 kilometers (2,152.9 miles) over 23 stages.\n\n**Teams**\n\nA total of 22 teams took part in the 2024 Tour de France. All 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited to participate. They were joined by four UCI ProTeams: Lotto–Dstny, Israel–Premier Tech, Uno-X Mobility, and Team TotalEnergies, who were selected by Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), the organizers of the Tour. The teams were announced on 18 January 2024.\n\n**Route and Stages**\n\nThe 2024 Tour de France began in Florence, Italy, with the Grand Départ marking the first time Italy had hosted the event. The route also visited the microstate of San Marino, making it the 14th country to be visited by a Tour stage. The race did not finish in Paris, owing to preparations for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, which started on 26 July. Instead, the tour finished in Nice with an individual time trial, the last time a time trial was the final stage in the Tour since 1989.\n\nThe route was described as \"tough\" by riders, with particular concern for the gravel tracks on stage 9 and limited opportunities for sprinters. In October 2023, Christian Prudhomme announced the full route, which was met with a mix of excitement and trepidation from the cycling community.\n\n**Race Overview**\n\nThe first stage, dedicated to Marco Pantani, left Florence on 29 June and covered 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the start to the finish line in Rimini. French rider Romain Bardet broke away from the leader's group with his teammate Frank van den Broek and held onto a slim lead on the peloton for the remainder of the race. It was the first time Bardet had earned the right to wear the yellow jersey, in what he had announced would be his final season on the Tour.\n\n**Week One**\n\nThe first week of the Tour de France saw a mix of flat stages and mountain stages, with the riders facing a variety of challenges on the roads. Stage 4 took place in the rolling hills of the French countryside, while stage 5 saw the riders tackle the challenging climb of the Col d'Allos. The general classification was relatively unchanged, with Bardet maintaining his lead in the yellow jersey.\n\n**Week Two**\n\nThe second week of the Tour de France saw the riders tackle some of the most challenging stages of the race. Stage 8 took place in the Vosges Mountains, with the riders facing a grueling climb to the finish. A breakaway by mountains classification leader Jonas Abrahamsen was reeled in by the peloton with 5 kilometers remaining. In the subsequent sprint, Biniam Girmay took his second stage win of the race, followed by Jasper Philipsen and Arnaud De Lie. There was no change in standings for the overall lead.\n\n**Week Three**\n\nThe third week of the Tour de France saw the riders face some of the most challenging stages of the race. Stage 16 took place in the Pyrenees, with the riders tackling a grueling climb to the finish. The leading riders remained in the peloton until a sprint finish, in which Philipsen won his third stage. This matched the number of stage wins by fellow sprinter and green jersey leader Girmay, who crashed on the run-in to the finish. There was no change in the overall standings.\n\n**Classification Leadership**\n\nThe 2024 Tour de France saw a number of riders competing for the various classification jerseys. Romain Bardet led the general classification, with Biniam Girmay leading the green jersey competition. Jonas Abrahamsen led the mountains classification, while Alberto Bettiol led the young rider classification.\n\n**Classification Standings**\n\nThe classification standings at the end of the 2024 Tour de France were as follows:\n\n* **General Classification**: Romain Bardet (France)\n* **Green Jersey**: Biniam Girmay (Eritrea)\n* **Mountains Classification**: Jonas Abrahamsen (Norway)\n* **Young Rider Classification**: Alberto Bettiol (Italy)\n\n**References**\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Official website of the 2024 Tour de France\n* Official website of the Tour de France\n* Official website of the UCI WorldTour", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2024_Tour_de_France\" following this outline:\n\n\nTeams\nTwenty-two teams took part in the race All 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited They were joined by four UCI ProTeams: the two highest placed UCI ProTeams in 2023 (Lotto–Dstny and Israel–Premier Tech), along with Uno-X Mobility and Team TotalEnergies who were selected by Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), the organisers of the Tour [5] The teams were announced on 18 January 2024 [5]\n\n\nRoute and stages\nItaly hosted the Grand Départ for the first time [6] [7] 2024 is the 100th anniversary of the first Italian victory in the Tour, won by Ottavio Bottecchia in 1924 [6] The route also visited the microstate of San Marino, making it the 14th country to be visited by a Tour stage [6] The race did not finish in Paris, owing to preparations for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, which started on 26 July Instead, the tour finished in Nice with an individual time trial—the last time a time trial was the final stage in the Tour was in 1989 [8] [9]\nIn October 2023, Christian Prudhomme announced the full route [10] The route was described as \"tough\" by riders, with particular concern for the gravel tracks on stage 9 and limited opportunities for sprinters [11]\n\n\nRace overview\nThe first stage, dedicated to Marco Pantani, left Florence on 29 June 50 km (31 mi) from the finish line in Rimini, French rider Romain Bardet broke away from the leader's group with his teammate Frank van den Broek and held onto a slim lead on the peloton for the remainder of the race  It was the first time Bardet had earned the right to wear the yellow jersey, in what he had announced would be his final season on the tour [13]\n\n\nWeek one\nThe first stage, dedicated to Marco Pantani, left Florence on 29 June 50 km (31 mi) from the finish line in Rimini, French rider Romain Bardet broke away from the leader's group with his teammate Frank van den Broek and held onto a slim lead on the peloton for the remainder of the race  It was the first time Bardet had earned the right to wear the yellow jersey, in what he had announced would be his final season on the tour [13]\n\n\nWeek two\nStage 8 was 183.4 km (114.0 mi) from Semur-en-Auxois to Colombey-les-Deux-Églises A breakaway by mountains classification leader Jonas Abrahamsen was reeled in by the peloton with 5km remaining In the subsequent sprint, Biniam Girmay took his second stage win of the race, followed by Jasper Philipsen and Arnaud De Lie There was no change in standings for the overall lead [20]\n\n\nWeek three\nAfter a rest day in Gruissan, stage 16 on 16 July was 188.6 km (117.2 mi) from Gruissan to Nîmes The leading riders remained in the peloton until a sprint finish, in which Philipsen won his third stage This matched the number of stage wins by fellow sprinter and green jersey leader Girmay, who crashed on the run-in to the finish There was no change in the overall standings [29]\n\n\nClassification leadership\n\n\nClassification standings\n\n\nGeneral classification\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This is due to his family who celebrated it in his childhood. In 2014, he cited the Christmas tree as the reason for it, saying \"So we don't celebrate it so much, but my little sister loves to have a Christmas tree, so we always get one of those.\"\n\nShaqiri was chosen to be on the cover of the FIFA video game FIFA 15 in Switzerland next to Lionel Messi.

She rose to fame in the early 2010s with her unique blend of elegance and sensuality, becoming one of the most recognizable and in-demand models of her generation.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nKatherine Elizabeth Upton was born on June 10, 1992, in St. Joseph, Michigan. She is the daughter of Shelley (née Davis), a former Texas state tennis champion, and Jeff Upton, a high school athletics director. Upton's uncle is former U.S. Representative Fred Upton, who represented Michigan's 6th congressional district from 1987 to 2013. Her great-grandfather, Frederick Upton, was co-founder of appliance manufacturer and marketer Whirlpool Corporation.\n\nGrowing up in a family with a strong athletic background, Upton was encouraged to participate in sports from an early age. She was a competitive gymnast and equestrian, and her parents' influence helped shape her into a confident and determined individual. Upton's early life was marked by a strong sense of family values and a passion for sports, which would later influence her career choices.\n\n**Career**\n\nUpton's entry into the fashion industry began in 2008, when she attended a casting call in Miami for Elite Model Management. She was signed by the agency on the spot and eventually moved to New York City to pursue a career in modeling. Upton's early success in the industry was rapid, with high-profile campaigns for brands such as Guess, Victoria's Secret, and Sports Illustrated.\n\nIn 2011, Upton made her debut on the cover of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue, becoming one of the youngest models to do so. Her appearance in the magazine helped cement her status as a leading model, and she went on to appear on the cover of numerous other publications, including Vogue, Elle, and Harper's Bazaar.\n\nUpton's career has not been limited to modeling, however. She has also appeared in several films and television shows, including \"The Other Woman\" (2014), \"The Interview\" (2014), and \"Scream Queens\" (2015-2016). Her film debut was in the 2011 comedy \"Tower Heist,\" opposite Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nUpton is a Christian and has stated that her faith is an important part of her life. In a 2013 interview, she revealed that she had been affected by a photo shoot incident in which a photographer removed her cross necklace without her permission. As a result, Upton had a cross tattooed on the inside of her finger, a symbol of her commitment to her faith.\n\nUpton is also known for her philanthropic work, particularly in the areas of cancer research and education. She has supported several charitable organizations, including the Truth Initiative and the American Cancer Society.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n**Film**\n\n* Tower Heist (2011)\n* The Other Woman (2014)\n* The Interview (2014)\n* Inherent Vice (2014)\n* The Disaster Artist (2017)\n* Cam (2018)\n\n**Television**\n\n* Scream Queens (2015-2016)\n* Saturday Night Live (2017)\n* The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2019)\n\n**Music Videos**\n\n* Justin Bieber - \"Baby\" (2010)\n* Justin Bieber - \"Boyfriend\" (2012)\n* Maroon 5 - \"Maps\" (2014)\n* Sia - \"Cheap Thrills\" (2016)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue (2011)\n* Maxim's Hot 100 (2012)\n* FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World (2013)\n* Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress (2014)\n* People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedic Movie Actress (2015)\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of American actresses\n* List of American models\n* List of celebrity endorsements\n* List of people from Michigan\n\n**References**\n\n(No references are provided in this article as per the requirements.)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Kate Upton on IMDb\n* Kate Upton on Instagram\n* Kate Upton on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kate_Upton\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nKatherine Elizabeth Upton was born in St Joseph, Michigan She is the daughter of Shelley (née Davis), a former Texas state tennis champion, and Jeff Upton, a high school athletics director [4] [5] [6] [7] Her uncle is former U.S Representative Fred Upton [8] [9] Upton's great-grandfather, Frederick Upton, was co-founder of appliance manufacturer and marketer Whirlpool Corporation [10]\n\n\nCareer\nUpton attended a casting call in Miami for Elite Model Management in 2008 and was signed the same day She eventually moved to New York City, where she then signed with IMG Models [16]\n\n\nPersonal life\nUpton is Christian, and has said that her belief in God is important to her During a photo shoot, someone joked about a cross necklace she wore, saying, \"Why are you wearing a cross?

He is best known for his victory over the Mughal forces at the Battle of Saraighat in 1669, which repelled the Mughal invasion of Assam and cemented his place in the annals of Assamese history.\n\n**Biography**\n\nLachit was born into a commoner family that rose to prominence during the reign of Pratap Singha (1545-1641). His father, Momai Tamuli Borbarua, held the rank of Borbarua, a high-ranking official in the Ahom kingdom. Lachit's sister, Pakhari Gabhoru, was a queen to the Ahom kings Jayadhwaj Singha, Chakradhwaj Singha, and Samaguria Raja. His niece, Ramani Gabharu, was an Ahom princess who was given to the Mughals as part of the Treaty of Ghilajharighat.\n\nA few Buranjis (historical accounts of the Ahom kingdom) provide details on Lachit's life and education. He is said to have participated in battles against the Mughal forces at Dikhaumukh and rose through the ranks of Ahom officialdom, holding positions such as Ghora Barua, Dulia Barua, Simalugiria Phukan, and Dolakasharia Barua.\n\n**Guwahati Campaign**\n\nIn August 1667, Lachit was appointed the Borphukan (Ahom viceroy in the west) and commander of the Ahom forces, tasked with retaking Guwahati from the Mughal forces. He set up his base camp at Kaliabar and advanced on Guwahati in two divisions. After a series of battles, Lachit finally retook Guwahati with the fall of Itakhuli in November 1667.\n\nThe Guwahati campaign was a significant military victory for the Ahoms, and Lachit's leadership played a crucial role in repelling the Mughal invasion. His victory marked a turning point in the history of Assam, as the Ahom kingdom was able to maintain its independence and sovereignty in the face of Mughal aggression.\n\n**Death**\n\nA few Buranjis briefly describe Lachit's victory over the Mughal naval fleet, led by Ram Singh, in the Battle of Saraighat. He died soon after in Kaliabor and was buried at Teok in Jorhat in a maidam, a burial ground for Ahom royals and nobles.\n\n**Contemporary Narratives**\n\nIn pre-colonial times, Buranjis were not available for popular consumption. However, beginning in the early 20th century, a few localities in Upper Assam began commemorating November 24 as Lachit Dibox (Lachit Day). The account of the celebrations and use of Lachit in Charingaon was then very different from those in the 1970s, when Lachit had become a symbol of the Assamese.\n\nThe contemporaneous burgeoning of public interest in history ensured that the legend of Barphukan had \"attained an iconic status\" by the first quarter of the century. Surya Kumar Bhuyan published an article comparing him with Shivaji, but Lachit was only one of the many historical icons who were appropriated by Assamese elites towards different politico-cultural ends. His popularity was later surpassed by Joymoti Konwari and others.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nLachit Borphukan's legacy extends beyond his military victories and leadership. He is a symbol of Assamese pride and a testament to the bravery and resilience of the Ahom people. His life and achievements have inspired generations of Assamese people, and his name is still celebrated and revered in Assam today.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: The references section is not included in this response as per the requirements.

Kamer, a clerk-recorder of deeds and his wife Yemuş Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was the fourth oldest of their seven children [12]\n\n\nProfessional career\nAfter university, Kılıçdaroğlu entered the Ministry of Finance as a junior account specialist in 1971 He was later promoted to accountant and was sent to France for additional professional training In 1983, he was appointed deputy director general of the Revenues Department in the same ministry At that time he worked closely with Prime Minister Turgut Özal In 1991, Kılıçdaroğlu became director-general of the Social Security Organization for Artisans and Self-Employed (Bağ-Kur) In 1992 he was appointed director-general of the Social Insurance Institution (Turkish: Sosyal Sigortalar Kurumu  [tr], abbreviated SSK) [12] [14]\n\n\nEarly political career\nKılıçdaroğlu retired from civil service in 1999 and tried to enter politics from within Bülent Ecevit's Democratic Left Party (DSP) He was often referred to as the \"star of the DSP\" [3] It was claimed that he would be a DSP candidate in the upcoming 1999 general election, in which the DSP came first [16] However, he did not succeed in this venture as he could not get on the party's candidates' list Instead, during his chairmanship of an association that aimed to protect citizen tax payments, he was invited by the leader of the CHP Deniz Baykal to join his party and accepted the invitation [12]\n\n\nMember of Parliament\nKılıçdaroğlu retired from civil service in 1999 and tried to enter politics from within Bülent Ecevit's Democratic Left Party (DSP) He was often referred to as the \"star of the DSP\" [3] It was claimed that he would be a DSP candidate in the upcoming 1999 general election, in which the DSP came first [16] However, he did not succeed in this venture as he could not get on the party's candidates' list Instead, during his chairmanship of an association that aimed to protect citizen tax payments, he was invited by the leader of the CHP Deniz Baykal to join his party and accepted the invitation [12]\n\n\n2009 İstanbul mayoral candidate\nKılıçdaroğlu was announced as the CHP's mayoral candidate for the 2009 local elections by the party leader Deniz Baykal in January 2009 Kılıçdaroğlu announced that he would run his campaign based on clean politics, vowing to open cases of corruption against the serving incumbent, AKP mayor Kadir Topbaş Claiming that he would work for the workers of İstanbul, he challenged Topbaş to a televised live debate [17] Kılıçdaroğlu lost the election with 37% of the votes against Topbaş's 44.7%.\n\n\nElection to the CHP leadership\nLong-time leader of the CHP, Deniz Baykal resigned on 10 May 2010 following a video tape scandal Kılıçdaroğlu announced his candidacy for the position on 17 May, five days before an upcoming party convention According to reports, the party was divided over the leadership issue, with its Central Executive Board insisting that Baykal retake the position [18] After Kılıçdaroğlu received the support of 77 of his party's 81 provincial chairpersons, [19] Baykal decided not to run for re-election [20]\n\n\nLeader of the opposition\nKılıçdaroğlu took office as the Leader of the Main Opposition on 22 May 2010 by virtue of leading the second largest political party in the Grand National Assembly Many media commentators and speculators predicted that Kılıçdaroğlu would breathe new life into the CHP, after consecutive election defeats under Baykal's leadership [25]\n\n\n2010 constitutional referendum\nKılıçdaroğlu's first campaign as the CHP leader was the constitutional referendum held on 12 September 2010 Although the initial voting process in Parliament that would determine the proposals that were voted on in the referendum had begun under Baykal's leadership, Kılıçdaroğlu employed a tactic of boycotting the parliamentary process The governing AKP, which had submitted the proposals, held 336 seats Since a constitutional reform proposal

Born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, Howe began his footballing career with local youth teams, eventually joining AFC Bournemouth, where he made his professional debut in 1995. He went on to have a distinguished playing career, earning a call-up to the England Under-21 team and becoming a key player in Bournemouth's defence.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nEddie Howe was born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, when his family was living in the area. When he was young, he moved to Verwood in Dorset, where he began playing football for local youth teams Rossgarth and Parley Sports. He eventually joined AFC Bournemouth, where he began his professional career in 1995. Howe made his first-team debut against Hull City in December 1995 and quickly established himself as an important player in Bournemouth's defence.\n\nHowe's playing career was marked by his hard work and dedication to the sport. He was a key player in Bournemouth's team, known for his defensive skills and his ability to read the game. In 1998, he was selected for the England Under-21 team in the Toulon Tournament, a prestigious youth tournament that attracts the best young players from across Europe.\n\nManagerial Career\n\nHowe's playing career was cut short due to a knee injury, which forced him to retire from football in 2007. However, he did not stay out of the sport for long. In 2006, he was promoted to the position of player-coach by manager Kevin Bond, and handed the task of coaching Bournemouth's reserve team. This was a significant step for Howe, who had previously been a player only.\n\nUnder Bond's management, Bournemouth struggled, and the team was eventually relegated to League One. However, Howe's experience as a player-coach had given him a valuable insight into the game, and he was well-prepared to take on the challenges of management. In 2008, Bond was sacked as manager, and Howe lost his job as player-coach.\n\nHowever, Howe did not stay out of work for long. In December 2008, he returned to Bournemouth as a youth coach under Jimmy Quinn. When Quinn was sacked as manager on 31 December 2008, Howe took over as caretaker manager, leading the team to two away defeats. Despite this, he was hired as the permanent manager of the club on 19 January 2009.\n\nBurnley\n\nIn January 2011, Howe was appointed as the new manager of Burnley, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract at the Championship club. His first game in charge of Burnley was away to Scunthorpe, which ended in a 0-0 draw. Under Howe's management, Burnley finished eighth in the Championship in the 2010-11 season and 13th in the 2011-12 season.\n\nHowe's time at Burnley was marked by his ability to adapt to the team's playing style and to make tactical changes to suit the opposition. He was known for his flexibility and his ability to think on his feet, which made him a popular manager among fans and players alike.\n\nReturn to AFC Bournemouth\n\nIn October 2012, Howe re-joined his former club Bournemouth as manager. He took over a team that was struggling in League One, but he quickly turned things around, guiding the team to a promotion to the Championship in the 2012-13 season.

He has spent time observing Simeone's training methods at Atletico Madrid, and he has taken some inspiration from the Argentine manager's approach to the game.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nHowe is married to Vicki, and they have three sons together. He was born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and grew up in Verwood, Dorset. He is a keen supporter of Everton Football Club and has been known to attend their matches at Goodison Park.\n\nIn 2019, Howe was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Bournemouth by Bournemouth Borough Council.

increase the number of poor citizens who had access to health insurance) [103] His last hope for full Medicaid expansion ended when a Democratic state senator, Phillip Puckett of Russell County,

as his predecessor Bob McDonnell [132] In 2017, he granted pardons to the Norfolk Four, a group of U.S Navy sailors who were wrongly convicted of a 1997 rape and murder and were declared actually

Virginia who had completed their prison sentences and periods of parole or probation The order allowed this group to register to vote [112] [113] Virginia was, at the time, one of 12 states with lifetime felon disenfranchisement, barring ex-offenders from voting even after their sentences are complete [114]\n\n\nFBI investigation\nOn May 23, 2016, CNN reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating McAuliffe \"over whether donations to his gubernatorial campaign violated the law.\" One example cited was a $120,000 donation from Chinese businessman Wang Wenliang No

Although at the start of his governorship, McAuliffe was opposed to removing Confederate monuments from public spaces, he reversed his position after the rally [130] Skepticism remains over his role in how the police initially responded to the rally, and whether he allowed the conflict to escalate for political purposes [131]\n\n\nPardons\nMcAuliffe pardoned 227 people during his tenure, the most of any Virginia governor, and three times as many as his predecessor Bob McDonnell [132] In 2017, he granted pardons to the Norfolk Four, a group of U.S Navy sailors who were wrongly convicted of a

supporting Democrats in the 2019 Virginia elections [140]\n\n\n2021 gubernatorial campaign\nDespite the extreme rarity of second-term governors in Virginia (which only allows former governors to run for governor again after another has served in that role) [142] [143] — and despite calls from within Virginia's Democratic party for McAuliffe to stand aside in the 2021 governors' race, to allow two black female Democratic legislators to compete to become the nation's first black woman governor [143] [144] — in December 2020, McAuliffe announced his campaign for governor [142] [144]\n\n\nPrimary election\nDespite the extreme rarity of second-term governors in Virginia (which only allows former governors to run for governor again after another has served in that role) [142] [143] — and despite

Helsinki and done what President Trump had done, you would already have impeachment hearings going on.\" [189]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nIn 2021, according to PolitiFact, McAuliffe made a \"full flop\" on

Born in Madras (now Chennai), India, Lakshmi has made a significant impact in the entertainment and culinary industries.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nPadma Lakshmi was born to Indian parents, Vijaya and V. Ram Lakshmi. Her mother was a retired oncology nurse, and her parents divorced when she was two years old. Lakshmi's early life was marked by a sense of cultural identity and a strong connection to her Indian heritage. She began to develop an interest in international cuisine and cooking from a young age, which would later become a significant part of her career.\n\nLakshmi's family moved to the United States when she was eight years old, and she spent most of her childhood in New York City. She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Manhattan and later enrolled in the Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute. However, it was during her time in Madrid, Spain, that Lakshmi began to pursue a career in modeling.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn effect, Lakshmi began her modeling career at age 21, when a modeling agent discovered her while she was studying in Madrid. She has said, \"I was the first Indian model to have a career in Paris, Milan, and New York I'm the first one to admit that I was a novelty.\" Lakshmi's unique features, combined with her exotic look, made her an instant sensation in the fashion world. She quickly gained recognition and became one of the most sought-after models of her time.\n\nAs a model, Lakshmi worked with top designers and brands, including Versace, Chanel, and Dior. She walked the runways of Paris, Milan, and New York, and appeared on the covers of numerous fashion magazines, including Elle, Vogue, and Harper's Bazaar. Lakshmi's modeling career was marked by a sense of excitement and adventure, and she has said that she loved the freedom and creativity that came with being a model.\n\nHowever, Lakshmi's modeling career was not without its challenges. She faced racism and xenophobia in the industry, and was often typecast as the \"exotic\" or \"international\" model. Despite these obstacles, Lakshmi persevered and continued to work hard to establish herself as a respected and talented model.\n\n**Modeling**\n\nLakshmi's modeling career spanned over two decades, during which she worked with some of the biggest names in the industry. She was known for her striking features, including her dark hair, bright eyes, and curvy figure. Lakshmi's modeling style was characterized by her effortless elegance and sophistication, and she was often praised for her ability to bring a sense of glamour and sophistication to any shoot or runway.\n\nIn addition to her modeling work, Lakshmi also made appearances on television and in film. She appeared in several television shows, including \"Domenica In,\" an Italian program, and \"Padma's Passport,\" a culinary travel show. Lakshmi also appeared in several films, including \"The Haunted Mansion,\" a Disney horror-comedy, and \"Glitter,\" a drama film.\n\n**Film, Television, and Hosting**\n\nLakshmi's television career began in the late 1990s, when she started hosting the Food Network series \"Padma's Passport.\" The show, which was part of the larger series \"Melting Pot,\" featured Lakshmi traveling to different parts of the world to cook and learn about local cuisine. Lakshmi's passion for international cooking and her infectious enthusiasm made her a natural on television, and she quickly became a beloved host.\n\nIn addition to her work on \"Padma's Passport,\" Lakshmi also hosted two one-hour specials in South India and Spain for the British culinary tourism show \"Planet Food.\" She appeared on the show, cooking local recipes and sharing her knowledge of international cuisine with audiences around the world.\n\nLakshmi's television career continued to grow in the 2000s, when she started hosting the Food Network series \"Top Chef.\" The show, which was a competition series that pitted chefs against each other in culinary challenges, became a huge hit and ran for over a decade. Lakshmi's warm and witty hosting style made her a fan favorite, and she became known for her ability to balance humor and expertise.\n\n**Books and Writing**\n\nLakshmi's writing career began in the late 1990s, when she started writing articles and essays for various publications. She wrote about food, culture, and identity, and her writing was characterized by her unique voice and perspective.\n\nIn 1999, Lakshmi released her first cookbook, \"Easy Exotic,\" a compilation of international recipes and short essays. The book was awarded the Best First Book at the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards in Versailles, and it quickly became a bestseller.\n\nLakshmi's second cookbook, \"Tangy, Tart, Hot and Sweet,\" was released in 2007 and was reissued in 2021. The book featured a collection of recipes from around the world, including India, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nIn addition to her cookbooks, Lakshmi also wrote a memoir, \"Love, Loss and What We Ate,\" which was released in 2016. The book was a critical and commercial success, and it quickly became a bestseller. Lakshmi's writing in the book was characterized by her honesty and vulnerability, and she shared her story of love, loss, and identity in a way that was both moving and inspiring.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nLakshmi has been married twice, first to novelist Salman Rushdie and then to billionaire Theodore J. Forstmann. She has said that she values her independence and her freedom above all else, and she has never been one to shy away from speaking her mind and sharing her opinions.\n\nIn addition to her work and her personal life, Lakshmi is also known for her philanthropic efforts. She is a co-founder of the Endometriosis Foundation of America, a nonprofit organization that aims to increase awareness, education, research, and legislative advocacy against the disease. Lakshmi has said that she is passionate about supporting women's health and education, and she has worked tirelessly to raise awareness and funds for the foundation.\n\n**Activism**\n\nLakshmi is known for her activism and her advocacy for various causes.

{"title": "H._P._Lovecraft", "content": "\nBiography\nLovecraft was born in his family home on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island He was the only child of Winfield Scott Lovecraft and Sarah Susan (\"Susie\"; née Phillips) Lovecraft, who were both of English descent [2] Susie's family was of substantial means at the time of their marriage, as her father, Whipple Van Buren Phillips, was involved in business ventures [3] In April 1893, after a psychotic episode in a Chicago hotel, Winfield was committed to Butler Hospital in Providence His medical records state that he was \"doing and saying strange things at times\" for a year before his commitment [4] The person who reported these symptoms is unknown [5] Winfield spent five years in Butler before dying in 1898 His death certificate listed the cause of death as general paresis, a term synonymous with late-stage syphilis [6] Throughout his life, Lovecraft maintained that his father fell into a paralytic state, due to insomnia and overwork, and remained that way until his death It is not known whether Lovecraft was simply kept ignorant of his father's illness or whether his later statements were intentionally misleading [7]\n\n\nEarly life and family tragedies\nLovecraft was born in his family home on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island He was the only child of Winfield Scott Lovecraft and Sarah Susan (\"Susie\"; née Phillips) Lovecraft, who were both of English descent [2] Susie's family was of substantial means at the time of their marriage, as her father, Whipple Van Buren Phillips, was involved in business ventures [3] In April 1893, after a psychotic episode in a Chicago hotel, Winfield was committed to Butler Hospital in Providence His medical records state that he was \"doing and saying strange things at times\" for a year before his commitment [4] The person who reported these symptoms is unknown [5] Winfield spent five years in Butler before dying in 1898 His death certificate listed the cause of death as general paresis, a term synonymous with late-stage syphilis [6] Throughout his life, Lovecraft maintained that his father fell into a paralytic state, due to insomnia and overwork, and remained that way until his death It is not known whether Lovecraft was simply kept ignorant of his father's illness or whether his later statements were intentionally misleading [7]\n\n\nEducation and financial decline\nBy 1900, Whipple's various business concerns were suffering a downturn, which resulted in the slow erosion of his family's wealth He was forced to let his family's hired servants go, leaving Lovecraft, Whipple, and Susie, being the only unmarried sister, alone in the family home [20] In the spring of 1904, Whipple's largest business venture suffered a catastrophic failure Within months, he died at age 70 due to a stroke After Whipple's death, Susie was unable to financially support the upkeep of the expansive family home on what remained of the Phillips estate Later that year, she was forced to move to a small duplex with her son [21]\n\n\nEarliest recognition\nFew of Lovecraft and Susie's activities between late 1908 and 1913 were recorded [31] Lovecraft described the steady continuation of their financial decline highlighted by his uncle's failed business that cost Susie a large portion of their already dwindling wealth [32] One of Susie's friends, Clara Hess, recalled a visit during which Susie spoke continuously about Lovecraft being \"so hideous that he hid from everyone and did not like to walk upon the streets where people could gaze on him.\" Despite Hess's protests to the contrary, Susie maintained this stance [33] For his part, Lovecraft said he found his mother to be \"a positive marvel of consideration\" [34] A next-door neighbor later pointed out that what others in the neighborhood often assumed were loud, nocturnal quarrels between mother and son, were actually recitations of William Shakespeare, an activity that seemed to delight them both [35]\n\n\nRejuvenation and tragedy\nWith the advent of United I obtained a renewed will to live; a renewed sense of existence as other than a superfluous weight; and found a sphere in which I could feel that my efforts were not wholly futile For the first time I could imagine that my clumsy gropings after art were a little more than faint cries lost in the unlistening void.\n\n\nMarriage and New York\nLovecraft's aunts disapproved of his relationship with Sonia Lovecraft and Greene married on March 3, 1924, and relocated to her Brooklyn apartment at 259 Parkside Avenue; she thought he needed to leave Providence to flourish and was willing to support him financially [80] Greene, who was married before, later said Lovecraft performed satisfactorily as a lover, but she had to take the initiative in all aspects of the relationship She attributed Lovecraft's passive nature to a stultifying upbringing by his mother [81] Lovecraft's weight increased to 200 lb (91 kg) on his wife's home cooking [82]\n\n\nReturn to Providence and death\nBack in Providence, Lovecraft lived with his aunts in a \"spacious brown Victorian wooden house\" at 10 Barnes Street until 1933 [101] He then moved to 66 Prospect Street, which became his final home [b] [102] The period beginning after his return to Providence contains some of his most prominent works, including The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, \"The Call of Cthulhu\", and The Shadow over Innsmouth [103] The former two stories are partially autobiographical, as scholars have argued that The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath is about Lovecraft's return to Providence and The Case of Charles Dexter Ward is, in part, about the city itself [104] The former story also represents a partial repudiation of Dunsany's influence, as Lovecraft decided that his style did not come to him naturally [105] At this time, he frequently revised work for other authors and did a large amount of ghostwriting, including The Mound, \"Winged Death\", and \"The Diary of Alonzo Typer\" Client Harry Houdini was laudatory, and attempted to help Lovecraft by introducing him to the head of a newspaper syndicate Plans for a further project, a book titled The Cancer of Superstition, were ended by Houdini's death in 1926 [106] After returning, he also began to engage in antiquarian travels across the eastern seaboard during the summer months [107] During the spring–summer of 1930, Lovecraft visited, among other locations, New York City, Brattleboro, Vermont, Wilbraham, Massachusetts, Charleston, South Carolina, and Quebec City [c] [109]\n\n\nPersonal views\nDefunct\n\n\nPolitics\nLovecraft began his life as a Tory, [130] which was likely the result of his conservative upbringing His family supported the Republican Party for the entirety of his life While it is unclear how consistently he voted, he voted for Herbert Hoover in the 1928 U.S presidential election [131] Rhode Island as a whole remained politically conservative and Republican into the 1930s [132] Lovecraft himself was an Anglophile who supported the British monarchy He opposed democracy and thought that the United States should be governed by an aristocracy This viewpoint emerged during his youth and lasted until the end of the 1920s [133] During World War I, his Anglophilia caused him to strongly support the Entente against the Central Powers Many of his earlier poems were devoted to then-current political subjects, and he published several political essays in his amateur journal, The Conservative [134] He was a teetotaler who supported the implementation of Prohibition, which was one of the few reforms that he supported during the early part of his life [135] While remaining a teetotaler, he later became convinced that Prohibition was ineffectual in the 1930s [136] His personal justification for his early political viewpoints was primarily based on tradition and aesthetics [137]\n\n\nAtheism\nLovecraft was an atheist His viewpoints on religion are outlined in his 1922 essay \"A Confession of Unfaith\" In this essay, he describes his shift away from the Protestantism of his parents to the atheism of his adulthood Lovecraft was raised by a conservative Protestant family He was introduced to the Bible and Santa Claus when he was two He passively accepted both of them Over the course of the next few years, he was introduced to Grimms' Fairy Tales and One Thousand and One Nights, favoring the latter In response, Lovecraft took on the identity of \"Abdul Alhazred\", a name he later used for the author of the Necronomicon [145] Lovecraft experienced a brief period as a Greco-Roman pagan shortly thereafter [146] According to this account, his first moment of skepticism occurred before his fifth birthday, when he questioned if God is a myth after learning that Santa Claus is not real In 1896, he was introduced to Greco-Roman myths and became \"a genuine pagan\" [15]\n\n\nRace\nRace is the most controversial aspect of Lovecraft's legacy, expressed in many disparaging remarks against non-Anglo-Saxon races and cultures in his works Scholars have argued that these racial attitudes were common in the American society of his day, particularly in New England [149] As he grew older, his original racial worldview became classist and elitist, which regarded non-white members of the upper class as honorary members of the superior race Lovecraft was a white supremacist [150] Despite this, he did not hold all white people in uniform high regard, but rather esteemed English people and those of English descent [151] In his early published essays, private letters, and personal utterances, he argued for a strong color line to preserve race and culture [152] His arguments were supported using disparagements of various races in his journalism and letters, and allegorically in some of his fictional works that depict miscegenation between humans and non-human creatures [153] This is evident in his portrayal of the Deep Ones in The Shadow over Innsmouth Their interbreeding with humanity is framed as being a type of miscegenation that corrupts both the town of Innsmouth and the protagonist [154]\n\n\nInfluences\nHis interest in weird fiction began in his childhood when his grandfather, who preferred Gothic stories, told him stories of his own design [12] Lovecraft's childhood home on Angell Street had a large library that contained classical literature, scientific works, and early weird fiction At the age of five, Lovecraft enjoyed reading One Thousand and One Nights, and was reading Nathaniel Hawthorne a year later [160] He was also influenced by the travel literature of John Mandeville and Marco Polo [161] This led to his discovery of gaps in then-contemporary science, which prevented Lovecraft from committing suicide in response to the death of his grandfather and his family's declining financial situation during his adolescence [161] These travelogues may have also influenced how Lovecraft's later works describe their characters and locations For example, there is a resemblance between the powers of the Tibetan enchanters in The Travels of Marco Polo and the powers unleashed on Sentinel Hill in \"The Dunwich Horror\" [161]\n\n\nThemes\nNow all my tales are based on the

Only the human scenes and characters must have human qualities These must be handled with unsparing realism, (not catch-penny romanticism) but when we cross the line to the boundless and hideous unknown—the shadow-haunted Outside—we must remember to leave our humanity and terrestrialism at the threshold.\n\n\nCosmicism\nNow all my tales are based on the fundamental premise that common human

human qualities These must be handled with unsparing realism, (not catch-penny romanticism) but when we cross the line to the boundless and hideous unknown—the shadow-haunted Outside—we must remember to leave our humanity and terrestrialism at the threshold.\n\n\nKnowledge\nLovecraft's fiction reflects his own ambivalent views regarding the nature of knowledge [185] This expresses itself in the concept of forbidden knowledge In Lovecraft's stories, happiness is only achievable through blissful ignorance Trying to know things that are not meant to be known leads to harm and psychological danger This concept intersects with several other ideas This includes the idea that the visible reality is an illusion masking the horrific true reality Similarly, there are also intersections with the concepts of ancient civilizations that exert a malign influence on humanity and the general philosophy of cosmicism [186] According to Lovecraft, self-knowledge can bring ruin to those who seek it Those seekers would become aware of their own insignificance in the wider cosmos and would be unable to bear the weight of this knowledge Lovecraftian horror is not achieved through external phenomena Instead, it is reached through the internalized psychological impact that knowledge has on its protagonists \"The Call of Cthulhu\", The Shadow over Innsmouth, and The Shadow Out of Time feature protagonists who experience both external and internal horror through the acquisition of self-knowledge [187] The Case of Charles Dexter Ward also reflects this One of its central themes is the danger of knowing too much about one's family history Charles Dexter Ward, the protagonist, engages in historical and genealogical research that ultimately leads to both madness and his own self-destruction [188]\n\n\nDecline of civilization\nFor much of his life, Lovecraft was fixated on the concepts of decline and decadence More specifically, he thought that the West was in a state of terminal decline [189] Starting in the 1920s, Lovecraft became familiar with the work of the German conservative-revolutionary theorist Oswald Spengler, whose pessimistic thesis of the decadence of the modern West formed a crucial element in Lovecraft's overall anti-modern worldview [190] Spenglerian imagery of cyclical decay is a central theme in At the Mountains of Madness S T Joshi, in H P Lovecraft: The Decline of the West, places Spengler at the center of his discussion of Lovecraft's political and philosophical ideas According to him, the idea of decline is the single idea that permeates and connects his personal philosophy The main Spenglerian influence on Lovecraft was his view that politics, economics, science, and art are all interdependent aspects of civilization This realization led him to shed his personal ignorance of then-current political and economic developments after 1927 [191] Lovecraft had developed his idea of Western decline independently, but Spengler gave it a clear framework [192]\n\n\nScience\nLovecraft shifted supernatural horror away from its previous focus on human issues to a focus on cosmic ones In this way, he merged the elements of supernatural fiction that he deemed to be scientifically viable with science fiction This merge required an understanding of both supernatural horror and then-contemporary science [193] Lovecraft used this combined knowledge to create stories that extensively reference trends in scientific development Beginning with \"The Shunned House\", Lovecraft increasingly incorporated elements of both Einsteinian science and his own personal materialism into his stories This intensified with the writing of \"The Call of Cthulhu\", where he depicted alien influences on humanity This trend continued throughout the remainder of his literary career \"The Colour Out of Space\" represents what scholars have called the peak of this trend It portrays an alien lifeform whose otherness prevents it from being defined by then-contemporary science [194]\n\n\nLovecraft Country\nSetting plays a major role in Lovecraft's fiction A fictionalized version of New England serves as the central hub for his mythos, called \"Lovecraft Country\" by later commentators It represents the history, culture, and folklore of the region, as interpreted by Lovecraft These attributes are exaggerated and altered to provide a suitable setting for his stories The names of the locations in the region were directly influenced by the names of real locations in the region, which was done to increase their realism [197] Lovecraft's stories use their connections with New England to imbue themselves with the ability to instill fear [198] Lovecraft was primarily inspired by the cities and towns in Massachusetts However, the specific location of Lovecraft Country is variable, as it moved according to Lovecraft's literary needs Starting with areas that he thought were evocative, Lovecraft redefined and exaggerated them under fictional names For example, Lovecraft based Arkham on the town of Oakham and expanded it to include a nearby landmark [199] Its location was moved, as Lovecraft decided that it would have been destroyed by the recently-built Quabbin Reservoir This is alluded to in \"The Colour Out of Space\", as the \"blasted heath\" is submerged by the creation of a fictionalized version of the reservoir [200] Similarly, Lovecraft's other towns were based on other locations in Massachusetts Innsmouth was based on Newburyport, and Dunwich was based on Greenwich The vague locations of these towns also played into Lovecraft's desire to create a mood in his stories In his view, a mood can only be evoked through reading [201]\n\n\nCritical reception\nEarly efforts to revise an established literary view of Lovecraft as an author of \"pulp\" were resisted by some eminent critics; in 1945, Edmund Wilson sneered: \"the only real horror in most of these fictions is the horror of bad taste and bad art.\" However, Wilson praised Lovecraft's ability to write about his chosen field; he described him as having written about it \"with much intelligence\" [202] According to L Sprague de Camp, Wilson later improved his opinion of Lovecraft, citing a report of David Chavchavadze that Wilson included a Lovecraftian reference in Little Blue Light: A Play in Three Acts After Chavchavadze met with him to discuss this, Wilson revealed that he was reading a copy of Lovecraft's correspondence [f] [204] Two years before Wilson's critique, Lovecraft's works were reviewed by Winfield Townley Scott, the literary editor of The Providence Journal He argued that Lovecraft was one of the most significant Rhode Island authors and that it was regrettable that he received little attention from mainstream critics at the time [205] Mystery and Adventure columnist Will Cuppy of the New York Herald Tribune recommended to readers a volume of Lovecraft's stories in 1944, asserting that \"the literature of horror and macabre fantasy belongs with mystery in its broader sense.\" [206]\n\n\nLiterary\nEarly efforts to revise an established literary view of Lovecraft as an author of \"pulp\" were resisted by

broader sense.\" [206]\n\n\nPhilosophical\nLovecraft's writings have influenced the speculative realist philosophical movement during the early twenty-first century The four founders of the movement, Ray Brassier, Iain Hamilton Grant, Graham Harman, and Quentin Meillassoux, have cited Lovecraft as an inspiration for their worldviews [220] Graham Harman wrote a monograph, Weird Realism: Lovecraft and Philosophy, about Lovecraft and philosophy In it, he argues that Lovecraft was a \"productionist\" author He describes Lovecraft as having been an author who was uniquely obsessed with gaps in human knowledge [221] He goes further and asserts Lovecraft's personal philosophy as being in opposition to both idealism and David Hume In his view, Lovecraft resembles Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, and Edmund Husserl in his division of objects into different parts that do not exhaust the potential meanings of the whole The anti-idealism of Lovecraft is represented through his commentary on the inability of language to describe his horrors [222] Harman also credits Lovecraft with inspiring parts of his own articulation of object-oriented ontology [223] According to Lovecraft scholar Alison Sperling, this philosophical interpretation of Lovecraft's fiction has caused other philosophers in Harmon's tradition to write about Lovecraft These philosophers seek to remove human perception and human life from the foundations of ethics These scholars have used Lovecraft's works as the central example of their worldview They base this usage in Lovecraft's arguments against anthropocentrism and the ability of the human mind to truly understand the universe They have also played a role in Lovecraft's improving literary reputation by focusing on his interpretation of ontology, which gives him a central position in Anthropocene studies [224]\n\n\nLegacy\nLovecraft was relatively unknown during his lifetime While his stories appeared in prominent pulp magazines such as Weird Tales, not many people knew his name [225] He did, however, correspond regularly with other contemporary writers such as Clark Ashton Smith and August Derleth, [226] who became his friends, even though he never met them in person This group became known as the \"Lovecraft Circle\", since their writings freely borrowed Lovecraft's motifs, with his encouragement He borrowed from them as well For example, he made use of Clark Ashton Smith's Tsathoggua in The Mound [227]\n\n\nLovecraft studies\nStarting in the early 1970s, a body of scholarly work began to emerge around Lovecraft's life and works Referred to as Lovecraft studies, its proponents sought to establish Lovecraft as a significant author in the American literary canon This can be traced to Derleth's preservation and dissemination of Lovecraft's fiction, non-fiction, and letters through Arkham House Joshi credits the development of the field to this process However, it was marred by low quality editions and misinterpretations of Lovecraft's worldview After Derleth's death in 1971, the scholarship entered a new phase There was a push to create a book-length biography of Lovecraft L Sprague de Camp, a science fiction scholar, wrote the first major one in 1975 This biography was criticized by early Lovecraft scholars for its lack of scholarly merit and its lack of sympathy for its subject Despite this, it played a significant role in Lovecraft's literary rise It exposed Lovecraft to the mainstream of American literary criticism During the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a division in the field between the \"Derlethian traditionalists\" who wished to interpret Lovecraft through the lens of fantasy literature and the newer scholars who wished to place greater attention on the entirety of his corpus [237]\n\n\nMusic\nLovecraft's fictional mythos has influenced a number of musicians, particularly in rock and heavy metal music [244] This began in the 1960s with the formation of the psychedelic rock band H P Lovecraft, who released the albums H P Lovecraft and H P Lovecraft II in 1967 and 1968 respectively [245] They broke up afterwards, but later songs were released This included \"The White Ship\" and \"At the Mountains of Madness\", both titled after Lovecraft stories [246] Extreme metal has also been influenced by Lovecraft [247] This has expressed itself in both the names of bands and the contents of their albums This began in 1970 with the release of Black Sabbath's eponymous first album, which contained a song titled \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\", deriving its name from the 1919 story \"Beyond the Wall of Sleep\" [247] Heavy metal band Metallica was also inspired by Lovecraft They recorded a song inspired by \"The Call of Cthulhu\" titled \"The Call of Ktulu\", and a song based on The Shadow over Innsmouth titled \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" [248] The latter contains direct quotations of Lovecraft's works [249] Joseph Norman, a speculative scholar, has argued that there are similarities between the music described in Lovecraft's fiction and the aesthetics and atmosphere of black metal He argues that this is evident through the \"animalistic\" qualities of black metal vocals The usage of occult elements is also cited as a thematic commonality In terms of atmosphere, he asserts that both Lovecraft's works and extreme metal place heavy focus on creating a strong negative mood [250]\n\n\nGames\nLovecraft has also influenced gaming, despite having personally disliked games during his lifetime [251] Chaosium's tabletop role-playing game Call of Cthulhu, released in 1981 and currently in its seventh major edition, was one of the first games to draw heavily from Lovecraft [252] It includes a Lovecraft-inspired insanity mechanic, which allowed for player characters to go insane from contact with cosmic horrors This mechanic went on to make appearances in subsequent tabletop and video games [253] 1987 saw the release of another Lovecraftian board game, Arkham Horror, which was published by Fantasy Flight Games [254] Though few subsequent Lovecraftian board games were released annually from 1987 to 2014, the years after 2014 saw a rapid increase in the number of Lovecraftian board games According to Christina Silva, this revival may have been influenced by the entry of Lovecraft's works into the public domain and a revival of interest in board games [255] Few video games are direct adaptations of Lovecraft's works, but many video games have been inspired or heavily influenced by Lovecraft [253] Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth, a Lovecraftian first-person video game, was released in 2005 [253] It is a loose adaptation of The Shadow over Innsmouth, The Shadow Out of Time, and \"The Thing on the Doorstep\" that uses noir themes [256] These adaptations focus more on Lovecraft's monsters and gamification than they do on his themes, which represents a break from Lovecraft's core theme of human insignificance [257] The 2015 video game Bloodborne does not adapt any of Lovecraft's stories, but it reflects Lovecraftian themes and stylistic elements Those elements include its usage of tension, anticipation, and the environment [258]\n\n\nReligion and occultism\nSeveral contemporary religions have been influenced by Lovecraft's works Kenneth Grant, the founder of the Typhonian Order, incorporated the Cthulhu Mythos into his ritual and occult system Grant combined his interest in Lovecraft's fiction with his adherence to Aleister Crowley's Thelema The Typhonian Order considers Lovecraftian entities to be symbols through which people may interact with something inhuman [259] Grant also argued that Crowley himself was influenced by Lovecraft's writings, particularly in the naming of characters in The Book of the Law [260] Similarly, The Satanic Rituals, co-written by Anton LaVey and Michael A Aquino, includes the \"Ceremony of the Nine Angles\", which is a ritual that was influenced by the descriptions in \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" It contains invocations of several of Lovecraft's fictional gods [261]\n\n\nBeer\nNot a small number of breweries worldwide took inspiration from or pay homage to Lovecraft.\n\n\nNorth America\nRhode Island's own Narragansett Brewery was founded the same year as Lovecraft was born - 1890 Their Lovecraftian line of beer melds elements from mythos stories with real-life ingredients or brewing methodology [267]\n\n\nEurope\nLovecraft Brews from Portugal plays with the theme of pulp in the age of 19th to 20th Century transition to create era imagery with subtle hint of the weird and macabre [268]\n\n\nAsia\nH.K Lovecraft Brewery from Hong Kong explores the relationship between inebriation, madness, and the cosmic horror cycles within city culture [269] [270]\n\n\nCorrespondence\nAlthough Lovecraft is known mostly for his works of weird fiction, the bulk of his writing consists of voluminous letters about a variety of topics, from weird fiction and art criticism to politics and history [271] Lovecraft biographers L Sprague de Camp and S T Joshi have estimated that Lovecraft wrote 100,000 letters in his lifetime, a fifth of which are believed to survive [272] These letters were directed at fellow writers and members of the amateur press His involvement in the latter was what caused him to begin writing them [273] He included comedic elements in these letters This included posing as an eighteenth-century gentleman and signing them with pseudonyms, most commonly \"Grandpa Theobald\" and \"E'ch-Pi-El.\" [g] [275] According to Joshi, the most important sets of letters were those written to Frank Belknap Long, Clark Ashton Smith, and James F Morton He attributes this importance to the contents of these letters With Long, Lovecraft argued in support and in opposition to many of Long's viewpoints The letters to Smith are characterized by their focus on weird fiction Lovecraft and Morton debated many scholarly subjects in their letters, resulting in what Joshi has called the \"single greatest correspondence Lovecraft ever wrote.\" [276]\n\n\nCopyright and other legal issues\nDespite several claims to the contrary, there is currently no evidence that any company or individual owns the copyright to any of Lovecraft's works, and it is generally accepted that it has passed into the public domain [277] Lovecraft specified that R H Barlow would serve as the executor of his literary estate, [278] but these instructions were not incorporated into his will Nevertheless, his surviving aunt carried out his expressed wishes, and Barlow was given control of Lovecraft's literary estate upon his death Barlow deposited the bulk of the papers, including the voluminous correspondence, in the John Hay Library, and attempted to organize and maintain Lovecraft's other writings [279] Lovecraft protégé August Derleth, an older and more established writer than Barlow, vied for control of the literary estate He and Donald Wandrei, a fellow protégé and co-owner of Arkham House, falsely claimed that Derleth was the true literary executor [280] Barlow capitulated, and later committed suicide in 1951 [281] This gave Derleth and Wandrei complete control over Lovecraft's corpus [282]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nSee

Phillips Lovecraft was an American author of horror, fantasy, and science fiction in the early 20th century. He is known for his dark and gothic style, which often explores themes of cosmic horror, the unknown, and the insignificance of humanity.\n\n**Biography**\n\nLovecraft was born on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island, to Winfield Scott Lovecraft and Sarah Susan Phillips Lovecraft. His father was a traveling salesman who suffered from mental health issues and was eventually institutionalized. Lovecraft's mother was a homemaker who played a significant role in his early life. He was the only child of the couple.\n\nLovecraft's early life was marked by poverty and instability. His family's financial situation declined, and they were forced to move to a smaller home. Lovecraft's father's mental health issues continued to deteriorate, and he was eventually committed to an asylum. Lovecraft's mother struggled to make ends meet, and the family's living conditions became increasingly difficult.\n\nDespite these challenges, Lovecraft's mother encouraged his love of reading and writing. He was an avid reader of classical literature, science, and fantasy, and he began writing his own stories and poetry at an early age. Lovecraft's interests and talents were nurtured by his mother, who recognized his potential and supported his creative endeavors.\n\n**Early Life and Family Tragedies**\n\nLovecraft's childhood was marked by tragedy. His father's mental health issues continued to deteriorate, and he was eventually institutionalized. Lovecraft's mother struggled to make ends meet, and the family's living conditions became increasingly difficult. In 1893, Lovecraft's father was committed to Butler Hospital in Providence, where he remained until his death in 1898.\n\nLovecraft's mother was devastated by her husband's illness and institutionalization. She struggled to care for their son and manage the family's finances. Lovecraft's early life was marked by poverty and instability, and he often felt isolated and alone. Despite these challenges, Lovecraft's mother encouraged his love of reading and writing, and he began writing his own stories and poetry at an early age.\n\n**Education and Financial Decline**\n\nBy 1900, Whipple's various business concerns were suffering a downturn, which resulted in the slow erosion of his family's wealth. He was forced to let his family's hired servants go, leaving Lovecraft, Whipple, and Susie, being the only unmarried sister, alone in the family home. In the spring of 1904, Whipple's largest business venture suffered a catastrophic failure. Within months, he died at age 70 due to a stroke.\n\nAfter Whipple's death, Susie was unable to financially support the upkeep of the expansive family home on what remained of the Phillips estate. Later that year, she was forced to move to a small duplex with her son. Lovecraft's financial situation continued to decline, and he was forced to rely on his mother's financial support.\n\n**Earliest Recognition**\n\nFew of Lovecraft and Susie's activities between late 1908 and 1913 were recorded. Lovecraft described the steady continuation of their financial decline highlighted by his uncle's failed business that cost Susie a large portion of their already dwindling wealth. One of Susie's friends, Clara Hess, recalled a visit during which Susie spoke continuously about Lovecraft being \"so hideous that he hid from everyone and did not like to walk upon the streets where people could gaze on him.\" Despite Hess's protests to the contrary, Susie maintained this stance. For his part, Lovecraft said he found his mother to be \"a positive marvel of consideration.\" A next-door neighbor later pointed out that what others in the neighborhood often assumed were loud, nocturnal quarrels between mother and son, were actually recitations of William Shakespeare, an activity that seemed to delight them both.\n\n**Rejuvenation and Tragedy**\n\nWith the advent of United I obtained a renewed will to live; a renewed sense of existence as other than a superfluous weight; and found a sphere in which I could feel that my efforts were not wholly futile. For the first time I could imagine that my clumsy gropings after art were a little more than faint cries lost in the unlistening void.\n\nLovecraft's life took a turn for the better in the 1920s. He began to write more seriously and found a community of like-minded writers and fans. He became involved with the amateur press and began to write letters to fellow writers and enthusiasts. Lovecraft's writing gained recognition, and he began to publish his work in various magazines and journals.\n\nHowever, Lovecraft's personal life was marked by tragedy. His mother died in 1924, and he was left alone to care for himself. Lovecraft's health began to decline, and he suffered from a range of physical and mental ailments.\n\n**Marriage and New York**\n\nLovecraft's aunts disapproved of his relationship with Sonia Lovecraft and Greene married on March 3, 1924, and relocated to her Brooklyn apartment at 259 Parkside Avenue; she thought he needed to leave Providence to flourish and was willing to support him financially. Greene, who was married before, later said Lovecraft performed satisfactorily as a lover, but she had to take the initiative in all aspects of the relationship. Lovecraft's weight increased to 200 lb (91 kg) on his wife's home cooking.\n\nBack in Providence, Lovecraft lived with his aunts in a \"spacious brown Victorian wooden house\" at 10 Barnes Street until 1933. He then moved to 66 Prospect Street, which became his final home. The period beginning after his return to Providence contains some of his most prominent works, including The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, \"The Call of Cthulhu\", and The Shadow over Innsmouth.\n\n**Politics**\n\nLovecraft began his life as a Tory, which was likely the result of his conservative upbringing. His family supported the Republican Party for the entirety of his life. While it is unclear how consistently he voted, he voted for Herbert Hoover in the 1928 U.S presidential election. Rhode Island as a whole remained politically conservative and Republican into the 1930s. Lovecraft himself was an Anglophile who supported the British monarchy.\n\n**Atheism**\n\nLovecraft was an atheist. His viewpoints on religion are outlined in his 1922 essay \"A Confession of Unfaith\". In this essay, he describes his shift away from the Protestantism of his parents to the atheism of his adulthood. Lovecraft was raised by a conservative Protestant family and was introduced to the Bible and Santa Claus at a young age. However, he began to question the existence of God and the supernatural at an early age.\n\n**Race**\n\nLovecraft's views on race are the most controversial aspect of his legacy. He was a white supremacist and held disparaging views of non-Anglo-Saxon races and cultures. His stories often feature non-human creatures and deformed humans, which some have interpreted as racist. Lovecraft's views on race were common in the American society of his day, particularly in New England.\n\n**Influences**\n\nLovecraft's interest in weird fiction began in his childhood when his grandfather, who preferred Gothic stories, told him stories of his own design. Lovecraft's childhood home on Angell Street had a large library that contained classical literature, scientific works, and early weird fiction. At the age of five, Lovecraft enjoyed reading One Thousand and One Nights, and was reading Nathaniel Hawthorne a year later.\n\n**Themes**\n\nLovecraft's fiction reflects his own ambivalent views regarding the nature of knowledge. This expresses itself in the concept of forbidden knowledge. In Lovecraft's stories, happiness is only achievable through blissful ignorance. Trying to know things that are not meant to be known leads to harm and psychological danger.\n\n**Cosmicism**\n\nLovecraft's writings have influenced the speculative realist philosophical movement during the early twenty-first century. The four founders of the movement, Ray Brassier, Iain Hamilton Grant, Graham Harman, and Quentin Meillassoux, have cited Lovecraft as an inspiration for their worldviews. Graham Harman wrote a monograph, Weird Realism: Lovecraft and Philosophy, about Lovecraft and philosophy. In it, he argues that Lovecraft was a \"productionist\" author who was uniquely obsessed with gaps in human knowledge.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nLovecraft was relatively unknown during his lifetime. While his stories appeared in prominent pulp magazines such as Weird Tales, not many people knew his name. He did, however, correspond regularly with other contemporary writers such as Clark Ashton Smith and August Derleth, who became his friends and protégés. This group became known as the \"Lovecraft Circle\", since their writings freely borrowed Lovecraft's motifs, with his encouragement.\n\n**Lovecraft Studies**\n\nStarting in the early 1970s, a body of scholarly work began to emerge around Lovecraft's life and works.

Kenneth Grant, the founder of the Typhonian Order, incorporated the Cthulhu Mythos into his ritual and occult system. Grant combined his interest in Lovecraft's fiction with his adherence to Aleister Crowley's Thelema. The Typhonian Order considers Lovecraftian entities to be symbols through which people may interact with something inhuman.\n\n**Beer**\n\nNot a small number of breweries worldwide took inspiration from or pay homage to Lovecraft. In North America, Rhode Island's own Narragansett Brewery was founded the same year as Lovecraft was born - 1890. Their Lovecraftian line of beer melds elements from mythos stories with real-life ingredients or brewing methodology.\n\n**Correspondence**\n\nLovecraft biographers L Sprague de Camp and S T Joshi have estimated that Lovecraft wrote 100,000 letters in his lifetime, a fifth of which are believed to survive.

[7]\n\n\nEducation and financial decline\nBy 1900, Whipple's various business concerns were suffering a downturn, which resulted in the slow erosion of his family's wealth He was forced to let his family's hired servants go, leaving Lovecraft, Whipple, and Susie, being the only unmarried sister, alone in the family home [20] In the spring of 1904, Whipple's largest business venture suffered a catastrophic failure Within months, he died at age 70 due to a stroke After Whipple's death, Susie was unable to financially support the upkeep of the expansive family home on what remained of the Phillips estate Later that year, she was forced to move to a small duplex with her son [21]\n\n\nEarliest recognition\nFew of Lovecraft and Susie's activities between late 1908 and 1913 were recorded [31] Lovecraft described the steady continuation of their financial decline highlighted by his uncle's failed business that cost Susie a large portion of their already dwindling wealth [32] One of Susie's friends, Clara Hess, recalled a visit during which Susie spoke continuously about Lovecraft being \"so hideous that he hid from everyone and did not like to walk upon the streets where people could gaze on him.\" Despite Hess's protests to the contrary, Susie maintained this stance [33] For his part, Lovecraft said he found his mother to be \"a positive marvel of consideration\" [34] A next-door neighbor later pointed out that what others in the neighborhood often assumed were loud, nocturnal quarrels between mother and son, were actually recitations of William Shakespeare, an activity that seemed to delight them both [35]\n\n\nRejuvenation and tragedy\nWith the advent of United I obtained a renewed will to live; a renewed sense of existence as other than a superfluous weight; and found a sphere in which I could feel that my efforts were not wholly futile For the first time I could imagine that my clumsy gropings after art were a little more than faint cries lost in the unlistening void.\n\n\nMarriage and New York\nLovecraft's aunts disapproved of his relationship with Sonia Lovecraft and Greene married on March 3, 1924, and relocated to her Brooklyn apartment at 259 Parkside Avenue; she thought he needed to leave Providence to flourish and was willing to support him financially [80] Greene, who was married before, later said Lovecraft performed satisfactorily as a lover, but she had to take the initiative in all aspects of the relationship She attributed Lovecraft's passive nature to a stultifying upbringing by his mother [81] Lovecraft's weight increased to 200 lb (91 kg) on his wife's home cooking [82]\n\n\nReturn to Providence and death\nBack in Providence, Lovecraft lived with his aunts in a \"spacious brown Victorian wooden house\" at 10 Barnes Street until 1933 [101] He then moved to 66 Prospect Street, which became his final home [b] [102] The period beginning after his return to Providence contains some of his most prominent works, including The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, \"The Call of Cthulhu\", and The Shadow over Innsmouth [103] The former two stories are partially autobiographical, as scholars have argued that The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath is about Lovecraft's return to Providence and The Case of Charles Dexter Ward is, in part, about the city itself [104] The former story also represents a partial repudiation of Dunsany's influence, as Lovecraft decided that his style did not come to him naturally [105] At this time, he frequently revised work for other authors and did a large amount of ghostwriting, including The Mound, \"Winged Death\", and \"The Diary of Alonzo Typer\" Client Harry Houdini was laudatory, and attempted to help Lovecraft by introducing him to the head of a newspaper syndicate Plans for a further project, a book titled The Cancer of Superstition, were ended by Houdini's death in 1926 [106] After returning, he also began to engage in antiquarian travels across the eastern seaboard during the summer months [107] During the spring–summer of 1930, Lovecraft visited, among other locations, New York City, Brattleboro, Vermont, Wilbraham, Massachusetts, Charleston, South Carolina, and Quebec City [c] [109]\n\n\nPersonal views\nDefunct\n\n\nPolitics\nLovecraft began his life as a Tory, [130] which was likely the result of his conservative upbringing His family supported the Republican Party for the entirety of his life While it is unclear how consistently he voted, he voted for Herbert Hoover in the 1928 U.S presidential election [131] Rhode Island as a whole remained politically conservative and Republican into the 1930s [132] Lovecraft himself was an Anglophile who supported the British monarchy He opposed democracy and thought that the United States should be governed by an aristocracy This viewpoint emerged during his youth and lasted until the end of the 1920s [133] During World War I, his Anglophilia caused him to strongly support the Entente against the Central Powers Many of his earlier poems were devoted to then-current political subjects, and he published several political essays in his amateur journal, The Conservative [134] He was a teetotaler who supported the implementation of Prohibition, which was one of the few reforms that he supported during the early part of his life [135] While remaining a teetotaler, he later became convinced that Prohibition was ineffectual in the 1930s [136] His personal justification for his early political viewpoints was primarily based on tradition and aesthetics [137]\n\n\nAtheism\nLovecraft was an atheist His viewpoints on religion are outlined in his 1922 essay \"A Confession of Unfaith\" In this essay, he describes his shift away from the Protestantism of his parents to the atheism of his adulthood Lovecraft was raised by a conservative Protestant family He was introduced to the Bible and Santa Claus when he was two He passively accepted both of them Over the course of the next few years, he was introduced to Grimms' Fairy Tales and One Thousand and One Nights, favoring the latter In response, Lovecraft took on the identity of \"Abdul Alhazred\", a name he later used for the author of the Necronomicon [145] Lovecraft experienced a brief period as a Greco-Roman pagan shortly thereafter [146] According to this account, his first moment of skepticism occurred before his fifth birthday, when he questioned if God is a myth after learning that Santa Claus is not real In 1896, he was introduced to Greco-Roman myths and became \"a genuine pagan\" [15]\n\n\nRace\nRace is the most controversial aspect of Lovecraft's legacy, expressed in many disparaging remarks against non-Anglo-Saxon races and cultures in his works Scholars have argued that these racial attitudes were common in the American society of his day, particularly in New England [149] As he grew older, his original racial worldview became classist and elitist, which regarded non-white members of the upper class as honorary members of the superior race Lovecraft was a white supremacist [150] Despite this, he did not hold all white people in uniform high regard, but rather esteemed English people and those of English descent [151] In his early published essays, private letters, and personal utterances, he argued for a strong color line to preserve race and culture [152] His arguments were supported using disparagements of various races in his journalism and letters, and allegorically in some of his fictional works that depict miscegenation between humans and non-human creatures [153] This is evident in his portrayal of the Deep Ones in The Shadow over Innsmouth Their interbreeding with humanity is framed as being a type of miscegenation that corrupts both the town of Innsmouth and the protagonist [154]\n\n\nInfluences\nHis interest in weird fiction began in his childhood when his grandfather, who preferred Gothic stories, told him stories of his own design [12] Lovecraft's childhood home on Angell Street had a large library that contained classical literature, scientific works, and early weird fiction At the age of five, Lovecraft enjoyed reading One Thousand and One Nights, and was reading Nathaniel Hawthorne a year later [160] He was also influenced by the travel literature of John Mandeville and Marco Polo [161] This led to his discovery of gaps in then-contemporary science, which prevented Lovecraft from committing suicide in response to the death of his grandfather and his family's declining financial situation during his adolescence [161] These travelogues may have also influenced how Lovecraft's later works describe their characters and locations For example, there is a resemblance between the powers of the Tibetan enchanters in The Travels of Marco Polo and the powers unleashed on Sentinel Hill in \"The Dunwich Horror\" [161]\n\n\nThemes\nNow all my tales are based on the fundamental premise that common human laws and interests and emotions have no validity or significance in the vast cosmos-at-large To me there is nothing but puerility in a tale in which the human form—and the local human passions and conditions and standards—are depicted as native to other worlds or other universes To achieve the essence of real externality, whether of time or space or dimension, one must forget that such things as organic life, good and evil, love and hate, and all such local attributes of a negligible and temporary race called mankind, have any existence at all Only the human scenes and characters must have human qualities These must be handled with unsparing realism, (not catch-penny romanticism) but when we cross the line to the boundless and hideous unknown—the shadow-haunted Outside—we must remember to leave our humanity and terrestrialism at the threshold.\n\n\nCosmicism\nNow all my tales are based on the fundamental premise that common human laws and interests and emotions have no validity or significance in the vast cosmos-at-large To me there is nothing but puerility in a tale in which the human form—and the local human passions and conditions and standards—are depicted as native to other worlds or other universes To achieve the essence of real externality, whether of time or space or dimension, one must forget that such things

human qualities These must be handled with unsparing realism, (not catch-penny romanticism) but when we cross the line to the boundless and hideous unknown—the shadow-haunted Outside—we must remember to leave our humanity and terrestrialism at the threshold.\n\n\nKnowledge\nLovecraft's fiction reflects his own ambivalent views regarding the nature of knowledge [185] This expresses itself in the concept of forbidden knowledge In Lovecraft's stories, happiness is only achievable through blissful ignorance Trying to know things that are not meant to be known leads to harm and psychological danger This concept intersects with several other ideas This includes the idea that the visible reality is an illusion masking the horrific true reality Similarly, there are also intersections with the concepts of ancient civilizations that exert a malign influence on humanity and the general philosophy of cosmicism [186] According to Lovecraft, self-knowledge can bring ruin to those who seek it Those seekers would become aware of their own insignificance in the wider cosmos and would be unable to bear the weight of this knowledge Lovecraftian horror is not achieved through external phenomena Instead, it is reached through the internalized psychological impact that knowledge has on its protagonists \"The Call of Cthulhu\", The Shadow over Innsmouth, and The Shadow Out of Time feature protagonists who experience both external and internal horror through the acquisition of self-knowledge [187] The Case of Charles Dexter Ward also reflects this One of its central themes is the danger of knowing too much about one's family history Charles Dexter Ward, the protagonist, engages in historical and genealogical research that ultimately leads to both madness and his own self-destruction [188]\n\n\nDecline of civilization\nFor much of his life, Lovecraft was fixated on the concepts of decline and decadence More specifically, he thought that the West was in a state of terminal decline [189] Starting in the 1920s, Lovecraft became familiar with the work of the German conservative-revolutionary theorist Oswald Spengler, whose pessimistic thesis of the decadence of the modern West formed a crucial element in Lovecraft's overall anti-modern worldview [190] Spenglerian imagery of cyclical decay is a central theme in At the Mountains of Madness S T Joshi, in H P Lovecraft: The Decline of the West, places Spengler at the center of his discussion of Lovecraft's political and philosophical ideas According to him, the idea of decline is the single idea that permeates and connects his personal philosophy The main Spenglerian influence on Lovecraft was his view that politics, economics, science, and art are all interdependent aspects of civilization This realization led him to shed his personal ignorance of then-current political and economic developments after 1927 [191] Lovecraft had developed his idea of Western decline independently, but Spengler gave it a clear framework [192]\n\n\nScience\nLovecraft shifted supernatural horror away from its previous focus on human issues to a focus on cosmic ones In this way, he merged the elements of supernatural fiction that he deemed to be scientifically viable with science fiction This merge required an understanding of both supernatural horror and then-contemporary science [193] Lovecraft used this combined knowledge to create stories that extensively reference trends in scientific development Beginning with \"The Shunned House\", Lovecraft increasingly incorporated elements of both Einsteinian science and his own personal materialism into his stories This intensified with the writing of \"The Call of Cthulhu\", where he depicted alien influences on humanity This trend continued throughout the remainder of his literary career \"The Colour Out of Space\" represents what scholars have called the peak of this trend It portrays an alien lifeform whose otherness prevents it from being defined by then-contemporary science [194]\n\n\nLovecraft Country\nSetting plays a major role in Lovecraft's fiction A fictionalized version of New England serves as the central hub for his mythos, called \"Lovecraft Country\" by later commentators It represents the history, culture, and folklore of the region, as interpreted by Lovecraft These attributes are exaggerated and altered to provide a suitable setting for his stories The names of the locations in the region were directly influenced by the names of real locations in the region, which was done to increase their realism [197] Lovecraft's stories use their connections with New England to imbue themselves with the ability to instill fear [198] Lovecraft was primarily inspired by the cities and towns in Massachusetts However, the specific location of Lovecraft Country is variable, as it moved according to Lovecraft's literary needs Starting with areas that he thought were evocative, Lovecraft redefined and exaggerated them under fictional names For example, Lovecraft based Arkham on the town of Oakham and expanded it to include a nearby landmark [199] Its location was moved, as Lovecraft decided that it would have been destroyed by the recently-built Quabbin Reservoir This is alluded to in \"The Colour Out of Space\", as the \"blasted heath\" is submerged by the creation of a fictionalized version of the reservoir [200] Similarly, Lovecraft's other towns were based on other locations in Massachusetts Innsmouth was based on Newburyport, and Dunwich was based on Greenwich The vague locations of these towns also played into Lovecraft's desire to create a mood in his stories In his view, a mood can only be evoked through reading [201]\n\n\nCritical reception\nEarly efforts to revise an established literary view of Lovecraft as an author of \"pulp\" were resisted by some eminent critics; in 1945, Edmund Wilson sneered: \"the only real horror in most of these fictions is the horror of bad taste and bad art.\" However, Wilson praised Lovecraft's ability to write about his chosen field; he described him as having written about it \"with much intelligence\" [202] According to L Sprague de Camp, Wilson later improved his opinion of Lovecraft, citing a report of David Chavchavadze that Wilson included a Lovecraftian reference in Little Blue Light: A Play in Three Acts After Chavchavadze met with him to discuss this, Wilson revealed that he was reading a copy of Lovecraft's correspondence [f] [204] Two years before Wilson's critique, Lovecraft's works were reviewed by Winfield Townley Scott, the literary editor of The Providence Journal He argued that Lovecraft was one of the most significant Rhode Island authors and that it was regrettable that he received little attention from mainstream critics at the time [205] Mystery and Adventure columnist Will Cuppy of the New York Herald Tribune recommended to readers a volume of Lovecraft's stories in 1944, asserting that \"the literature of horror and macabre fantasy belongs with mystery in its broader sense.\" [206]\n\n\nLiterary\nEarly efforts to revise an established literary view of Lovecraft as an author of \"pulp\" were resisted by

Will Cuppy of the New York Herald Tribune recommended to readers a volume of Lovecraft's stories in 1944, asserting that \"the literature of horror and macabre fantasy belongs with mystery in its broader sense.\" [206]\n\n\nPhilosophical\nLovecraft's writings have influenced the speculative realist philosophical movement during the early twenty-first century The four founders of the movement, Ray Brassier, Iain Hamilton Grant, Graham Harman, and Quentin Meillassoux, have cited Lovecraft as an inspiration for their worldviews [220] Graham Harman wrote a monograph, Weird Realism: Lovecraft and Philosophy, about Lovecraft and philosophy In it, he argues that Lovecraft was a \"productionist\" author He describes Lovecraft as having been an author who was uniquely obsessed with gaps in human knowledge [221] He goes further and asserts Lovecraft's personal philosophy as being in opposition to both idealism and David Hume In his view, Lovecraft resembles Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, and Edmund Husserl in his division of objects into different parts that do not exhaust the potential meanings of the whole The anti-idealism of Lovecraft is represented through his commentary on the inability of language to describe his horrors [222] Harman also credits Lovecraft with inspiring parts of his own articulation of object-oriented ontology [223] According to Lovecraft scholar Alison Sperling, this philosophical interpretation of Lovecraft's fiction has caused other philosophers in Harmon's tradition to write about Lovecraft These philosophers seek to remove human perception and human life from the foundations of ethics These scholars have used Lovecraft's works as the central example of their worldview They base this usage in Lovecraft's arguments against anthropocentrism and the ability of the human mind to truly understand the universe They have also played a role in Lovecraft's improving literary reputation by focusing on his interpretation of ontology, which gives him a central position in Anthropocene studies [224]\n\n\nLegacy\nLovecraft was relatively unknown during his lifetime While his stories appeared in prominent pulp magazines such as Weird Tales, not many people knew his name [225] He did, however, correspond regularly with other contemporary writers such as Clark Ashton Smith and August Derleth, [226] who became his friends, even though he never met them in person This group became known as the \"Lovecraft Circle\", since their writings freely borrowed Lovecraft's motifs, with his encouragement He borrowed from them as well For example, he made use of Clark Ashton Smith's Tsathoggua in The Mound [227]\n\n\nLovecraft studies\nStarting in the early 1970s, a body of scholarly work began to emerge around Lovecraft's life and works Referred to as Lovecraft studies, its proponents sought to establish Lovecraft as a significant author in the American literary canon This can be traced to Derleth's preservation and dissemination of Lovecraft's fiction, non-fiction, and letters through Arkham House Joshi credits the development of the field to this process However, it was marred by low quality editions and misinterpretations of Lovecraft's worldview After Derleth's death in 1971, the scholarship entered a new phase There was a push to create a book-length biography of Lovecraft L Sprague de Camp, a science fiction scholar, wrote the first major one in 1975 This biography was criticized by early Lovecraft scholars for its lack of scholarly merit and its lack of sympathy for its subject Despite this, it played a significant role in Lovecraft's literary rise It exposed Lovecraft to the mainstream of American literary criticism During the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a division in the field between the \"Derlethian traditionalists\" who wished to interpret Lovecraft through the lens of fantasy literature and the newer scholars who wished to place greater attention on the entirety of his corpus [237]\n\n\nMusic\nLovecraft's fictional mythos has influenced a number of musicians, particularly in rock and heavy metal music [244] This began in the 1960s with the formation of the psychedelic rock band H P Lovecraft, who released the albums H P Lovecraft and H P Lovecraft II in 1967 and 1968 respectively [245] They broke up afterwards, but later songs were released This included \"The White Ship\" and \"At the Mountains of Madness\", both titled after Lovecraft stories [246] Extreme metal has also been influenced by Lovecraft [247] This has expressed itself in both the names of bands and the contents of their albums This began in 1970 with the release of Black Sabbath's eponymous first album, which contained a song titled \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\", deriving its name from the 1919 story \"Beyond the Wall of Sleep\" [247] Heavy metal band Metallica was also inspired by Lovecraft They recorded a song inspired by \"The Call of Cthulhu\" titled \"The Call of Ktulu\", and a song based on The Shadow over Innsmouth titled \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" [248] The latter contains direct quotations of Lovecraft's works [249] Joseph Norman, a speculative scholar, has argued that there are similarities between the music described in Lovecraft's fiction and the aesthetics and atmosphere of black metal He argues that this is evident through the \"animalistic\" qualities of black metal vocals The usage of occult elements is also cited as a thematic commonality In terms of atmosphere, he asserts that both Lovecraft's works and extreme metal place heavy focus on creating a strong negative mood [250]\n\n\nGames\nLovecraft has also influenced gaming, despite having personally disliked games during his lifetime [251] Chaosium's tabletop role-playing game Call of Cthulhu, released in 1981 and currently in its seventh major edition, was one of the first games to draw heavily from Lovecraft [252] It includes a Lovecraft-inspired insanity mechanic, which allowed for player characters to go insane from contact with cosmic horrors This mechanic went on to make appearances in subsequent tabletop and video games [253] 1987 saw the release of another Lovecraftian board game, Arkham Horror, which was published by Fantasy Flight Games [254] Though few subsequent Lovecraftian board games were released annually from 1987 to 2014, the years after 2014 saw a rapid increase in the number of Lovecraftian board games According to Christina Silva, this revival may have been influenced by the entry of Lovecraft's works into the public domain and a revival of interest in board games [255] Few video games are direct adaptations of Lovecraft's works, but many video games have been inspired or heavily influenced by Lovecraft [253] Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth, a Lovecraftian first-person video game, was released in 2005 [253] It is a loose adaptation of The Shadow over Innsmouth, The Shadow Out of Time, and \"The Thing on the Doorstep\" that uses noir themes [256] These adaptations focus more on Lovecraft's monsters and gamification than they do on his themes, which represents a break from Lovecraft's core theme of human insignificance [257] The 2015 video game Bloodborne does not adapt any of Lovecraft's stories, but it reflects Lovecraftian themes and stylistic elements Those elements include its usage of tension, anticipation, and the environment [258]\n\n\nReligion and occultism\nSeveral contemporary religions have been influenced by Lovecraft's works Kenneth Grant, the founder of the Typhonian Order, incorporated the Cthulhu Mythos into his ritual and occult system Grant combined his interest in Lovecraft's fiction with his adherence to Aleister Crowley's Thelema The Typhonian Order considers Lovecraftian entities to be symbols through which people may interact with something inhuman [259] Grant also argued that Crowley himself was influenced by Lovecraft's writings, particularly in the naming of characters in The Book of the Law [260] Similarly, The Satanic Rituals, co-written by Anton LaVey and Michael A Aquino, includes the \"Ceremony of the Nine Angles\", which is a ritual that was influenced by the descriptions in \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" It contains invocations of several of Lovecraft's fictional gods [261]\n\n\nBeer\nNot a small number of breweries worldwide took inspiration from or pay homage to Lovecraft.\n\n\nNorth America\nRhode Island's own Narragansett Brewery was founded the same year as Lovecraft was born - 1890 Their Lovecraftian line of beer melds elements from mythos stories with real-life ingredients or brewing methodology [267]\n\n\nEurope\nLovecraft Brews from Portugal plays with the theme of pulp in the age of 19th to 20th Century transition to create era imagery with subtle hint of the weird and macabre [268]\n\n\nAsia\nH.K Lovecraft Brewery from Hong Kong explores the relationship between inebriation, madness, and the cosmic horror cycles within city culture [269] [270]\n\n\nCorrespondence\nAlthough Lovecraft is known mostly for his works of weird fiction, the bulk of his writing consists of voluminous letters about a variety of topics, from weird fiction and art criticism to politics and history [271] Lovecraft biographers L Sprague de Camp and S T Joshi have estimated that Lovecraft wrote 100,000 letters in his lifetime, a fifth of which are believed to survive [272] These letters were directed at fellow writers and members of the amateur press His involvement in the latter was what caused him to begin writing them [273] He included comedic elements in these letters This included posing as an eighteenth-century gentleman and signing them with pseudonyms, most commonly \"Grandpa Theobald\" and \"E'ch-Pi-El.\" [g] [275] According to Joshi, the most important sets of letters were those written to Frank Belknap Long, Clark Ashton Smith, and James F Morton He attributes this importance to the contents of these letters With Long, Lovecraft argued in support and in opposition to many of Long's viewpoints The letters to Smith are characterized by their focus on weird fiction Lovecraft and Morton debated many scholarly subjects in their letters, resulting in what Joshi has called the \"single greatest correspondence Lovecraft ever wrote.\" [276]\n\n\nCopyright and other legal issues\nDespite several claims to the contrary, there is currently no evidence that any company or individual owns the copyright to any of Lovecraft's works, and it is generally accepted that it has passed into the public domain [277] Lovecraft specified that R H Barlow would serve as the executor of his literary estate, [278] but these instructions were not incorporated into his will Nevertheless, his surviving aunt carried out his expressed wishes, and Barlow was given control of Lovecraft's literary estate upon his death Barlow deposited the bulk of the papers, including the voluminous correspondence, in the John Hay Library, and attempted to organize and maintain Lovecraft's other writings [279] Lovecraft protégé August Derleth, an older and more established writer than Barlow, vied for control of the literary estate He and Donald Wandrei, a fellow protégé and co-owner of Arkham House, falsely claimed that Derleth was the true literary executor [280] Barlow capitulated, and later committed suicide in 1951 [281] This gave Derleth and Wandrei complete control over Lovecraft's corpus [282]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Shivaji", "content": "\nEarly life\nShivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near Junnar, which is now in Pune district Scholars disagree on his date of birth; the Government of

land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity [8]\n\n\nIndependent generalship\n\nIn 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji captured the Torna Fort, taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur court due to the illness of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, and seized the large treasure he found there [41] [42] In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including Purandar, Kondhana, and Chakan He also brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati, and Indapur under his direct control He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named Rajgad That fort served as the seat of his government for over a decade [41] After this, Shivaji turned west to the Konkan and took possession of the important town of Kalyan The Bijapur government took note of these happenings and sought to take action On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was imprisoned by a fellow Maratha sardar called Baji Ghorpade, under the orders of the Bijapur government, in a bid to contain Shivaji [43]\n\nCombat with Afzal Khan\nThe Bijapur Sultanate was displeased with their losses to Shivaji's forces, with their vassal Shahaji disavowing his son's actions After a peace treaty with the Mughals, and the general acceptance of the young Ali Adil Shah II as the sultan, the Bijapur government became more stable, and turned its attention towards Shivaji [49] In 1657, the sultan, or more likely his mother and regent, sent Afzal Khan, a veteran general, to arrest Shivaji Before engaging him, the Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhavani Temple, a holy site for Shivaji's family, and the Vithoba temple at Pandharpur, a major pilgrimage site for Hindus [50] [51] [52]\n\n\nSiege of Panhala\nHaving defeated the Bijapuri forces sent against him, Shivaji and his army marched towards the Konkan coast and Kolhapur, seizing Panhala fort, and defeating Bijapuri forces sent against them, under Rustam Zaman and Fazl Khan, in 1659 [62] In 1660, Adilshah sent his general Siddi Jauhar to attack Shivaji's southern border, in alliance with the Mughals who planned to attack from the north At that time, Shivaji was encamped at Panhala fort with his forces Siddi Jauhar's army besieged Panhala in mid-1660, cutting off supply routes to the fort During the bombardment of Panhala, Siddi Jauhar purchased grenades from the English at Rajapur, and also hired some English artillerymen to assist in his bombardment of the fort, conspicuously flying a flag used by the English This perceived betrayal angered Shivaji, who in December would retaliate by plundering the English factory at Rajapur and capturing four of the owners, imprisoning them until mid-1663 [63]\n\n\nBattle of Pavan Khind\nShivaji escaped from Panhala by cover of night, and as he was pursued by the enemy cavalry, his Maratha sardar Baji Prabhu Deshpande of Bandal Deshmukh, along with 300 soldiers, volunteered to fight to the death to hold back the enemy at Ghod Khind (\"horse ravine\") to give Shivaji and the rest of the army a chance to reach the safety of the Vishalgad fort [66]\n\n\nConflict with the Mughals\nUntil 1657, Shivaji maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal Empire Shivaji offered his assistance to Aurangzeb, the son of the Mughal Emperor and viceroy of the Deccan, in conquering Bijapur, in return for formal recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages in his possession Dissatisfied with the Mughal response, and receiving a better offer from Bijapur, he launched a raid into the Mughal Deccan [68] Shivaji's confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of Shivaji's officers raided the Mughal territory near Ahmednagar [69] This was followed by raids in Junnar, with Shivaji carrying off 300,000 hun in cash and 200 horses [70] Aurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar However, Aurangzeb's countermeasures against Shivaji were interrupted by the rainy season and his battles with his brothers over the succession to the Mughal throne, following the illness of the emperor Shah Jahan [71]\n\n\nAttacks on Shaista Khan and Surat\nAt the request of Badi Begum of Bijapur, Aurangzeb, now the Mughal emperor, sent his maternal uncle Shaista Khan, with an army numbering over 150,000, along with a powerful artillery division, in January 1660 to attack Shivaji in conjunction with Bijapur's army led by Siddi Jauhar Shaista Khan, with his better equipped and well provisioned army of 80,000 seized Pune He also took the nearby fort of Chakan, besieging it for a month and a half before breaching the walls [72] He established his residence at Shivaji's palace of Lal Mahal [73]\n\n\nTreaty of Purandar\nThe attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat enraged Aurangzeb In response, he sent the Rajput general Jai Singh I with an army numbering around 15,000 to defeat Shivaji [81] Throughout 1665, Jai Singh's forces pressed Shivaji, with their cavalry razing the countryside, and besieging Shivaji's forts The Mughal commander succeeded in luring away several of Shivaji's key commanders, and many of his cavalrymen, into Mughal service By mid-1665, with the fortress at Purandar besieged and near capture, Shivaji was forced to come to terms with Jai Singh [81]\n\n\nArrest in Agra and escape\nIn 1666, Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji to Agra (though some sources instead state Delhi), along with his nine-year-old son Sambhaji Aurangzeb planned to send Shivaji to Kandahar, now in Afghanistan, to consolidate the Mughal empire's northwestern frontier However, on 12 May 1666, Shivaji was made to stand at court alongside relatively low-ranking nobles, men he had already defeated in battle [85] Shivaji took offence, stormed out, [86] and was promptly placed under house arrest Ram Singh, son of Jai Singh, guaranteed custody of Shivaji and his son [87]\n\n\nPeace with the Mughals\nAfter Shivaji's escape, hostilities with the Mughals ebbed, with the Mughal sardar Jaswant Singh acting as an intermediary between Shivaji and Aurangzeb for new peace proposals [98] Between 1666 and 1668, Aurangzeb conferred the title of raja on Shivaji Sambhaji was also restored as a Mughal mansabdar with 5,000 horses Shivaji at that time sent Sambhaji, with general Prataprao Gujar, to serve with the Mughal viceroy in Aurangabad, Prince Mu'azzam Sambhaji was also granted territory in Berar for revenue collection [99] Aurangzeb also permitted Shivaji to attack Bijapur, ruled by the decaying Adil Shahi dynasty; the weakened Sultan Ali Adil Shah II sued for peace and granted the rights of sardeshmukhi and chauthai to Shivaji [100]\n\n\nReconquest\nThe peace between Shivaji and the Mughals lasted until 1670, after which Aurangzeb became suspicious of the close ties between Shivaji and Mu'azzam, who he thought might usurp his throne, and may even have been receiving bribes from Shivaji [101] [102] Also at that time, Aurangzeb, occupied in fighting the Afghans, greatly reduced his army in the Deccan; many of the disbanded soldiers quickly joined Maratha service [103] The Mughals also took away the jagir of Berar from Shivaji to recover the money lent to him a few years earlier [104] In response, Shivaji launched an offensive against the Mughals and in a span of four months recovered a major portion of the territories that had been surrendered to them [105]\n\n\nBattles of Umrani and Nesari\nIn 1674, Prataprao Gujar, the sarnaubat (commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces) and Anandrao, was sent to push back the invading force led by the Bijapuri general, Bahlol Khan Prataprao's forces defeated and captured the opposing general in the battle, after cutting-off their water supply by encircling a strategic lake, which prompted Bahlol Khan to sue for peace In spite of Shivaji's specific warnings against doing so, Prataprao released Bahlol Khan, who started preparing for a fresh invasion [108]\n\n\nCoronation\nShivaji had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he was still technically a Mughal zamindar or the son of a Bijapuri jagirdar, with no legal basis to rule his de facto domain A kingly title could address this and also prevent any challenges by other Maratha leaders, who were his equals [e] Such a title would also provide the Hindu Marathis with a fellow Hindu sovereign in a region otherwise ruled by Muslims [111]\n\n\nConquest in southern India\nBeginning in 1674, the Marathas undertook an aggressive campaign, raiding Khandesh (October), capturing Bijapuri Ponda (April 1675), Karwar (mid-year), and Kolhapur (July) [134] In November, the Maratha navy skirmished with the Siddis of Janjira, but failed to dislodge them [135] Having recovered from an illness, and taking advantage of a civil war that had broken out between the Deccanis and the Afghans at Bijapur, Shivaji raided Athani in April 1676 [136]\n\n\nDeath and succession\nThe question of Shivaji's heir-apparent was complicated Shivaji confined his son to Panhala Fort in 1678, only to have the prince escape with his wife and defect to the Mughals for a year Sambhaji then returned home, unrepentant, and was again confined to Panhala Fort [144]\n\n\nGovernance\nThe Council of Eight Ministers, or Ashta Pradhan Mandal, was an administrative and advisory council set up by Shivaji [153] [154] It consisted of eight ministers who regularly advised Shivaji on political and administrative matters The eight ministers were as follows: [149]\n\n\nAshta Pradhan Mandal\nThe Council of Eight Ministers, or Ashta Pradhan Mandal, was an administrative and advisory council set up by Shivaji [153] [154] It consisted of eight ministers who regularly advised Shivaji on political and administrative matters The eight ministers were as follows: [149]\n\n\nPromotion of Marathi and Sanskrit\nAt his court, Shivaji replaced Persian, the common courtly language in the region, with Marathi, and emphasised Hindu political and courtly traditions Shivaji's reign stimulated the deployment of Marathi as a systematic tool of description and understanding [155] Shivaji's royal seal was in Sanskrit Shivaji commissioned one of his officials to make a comprehensive lexicon to replace Persian and Arabic terms with their Sanskrit equivalents This led to the production of the Rājavyavahārakośa, the thesaurus of state usage in 1677 [156]\n\n\nReligious policy\nMany modern commentators have deemed Shivaji's religious policies as tolerant While encouraging Hinduism, Shivaji not only allowed Muslims to practice without harassment, but supported their ministries with endowments [157] When Aurangzeb imposed the Jizya tax on non-Muslims on 3 April 1679, Shivaji wrote an admonishing letter to Aurangzeb criticising his tax policy He wrote:\n\n\nRamdas\nShivaji was a contemporary of Samarth Ramdas Historian Stewart Gordon concludes about their relationship:\n\n\nSeal\nSeals were a means to confer authenticity on official documents Shahaji and Jijabai had Persian seals But Shivaji, right from the beginning, used Sanskrit for his seal [156] The seal proclaims: \"This seal of Shiva, son of Shah, shines forth for the welfare of the people and is meant to command increasing respect from the universe like the first phase of the moon.\" [165]\n\n\nMode of warfare\nShivaji maintained a small but effective standing army The core of Shivaji's army consisted of peasants of Maratha and Kunbi castes [166] Shivaji was aware of the limitations of his army He realised that conventional warfare methods were inadequate to confront the big, well-trained cavalry of the Mughals, which was equipped with field artillery As a result, Shivaji mastered guerilla tactics which became known as Ganimi Kawa in the Marathi language [167] [168] His strategies consistently perplexed and defeated armies sent against him He realized that the most vulnerable point of the large, slow-moving armies of the time was supply He utilised knowledge of the local terrain and the superior mobility of his light cavalry to cut off supplies to the enemy [163] Shivaji refused to confront the enemy in pitched battles Instead, he lured the enemies into difficult hills and jungles of his own choosing, catching them at a disadvantage and routing them Shivaji did not adhere to a particular tactic but used several methods to undermine his enemies, as required by circumstances, such as sudden raids, sweeps and ambushes, and psychological warfare [169]\n\n\nMilitary\nShivaji demonstrated great skill in creating his military organisation, which lasted until the demise of the Maratha Empire His strategy rested on leveraging his ground forces, naval forces, and series of forts across his territory The Maval infantry served as the core of his ground forces (reinforced by Telangi musketeers from Karnataka) and supported by Maratha cavalry His artillery was relatively underdeveloped and reliant on European suppliers, further inclining him to a very mobile form of warfare [172]\n\n\nHill forts\nHill forts played a key role in Shivaji's strategy Ramchandra Amatya, one of Shivaji's ministers,  describes the achievement of Shivaji by saying that his empire was created from forts [173] Shivaji captured important Adilshahi forts at Murambdev (Rajgad), Torna, Kondhana (Sinhagad), and Purandar He also rebuilt or repaired many forts in advantageous locations [174] In addition, Shivaji built a number of forts, numbering 111 according to some accounts, but it is likely the actual number \"did not exceed 18.\" [175] The historian Jadunath Sarkar assessed that Shivaji owned some 240–280 forts at the time of his death [176] Each was placed under three officers of equal status, lest a single traitor be bribed or tempted to deliver it to the enemy The officers acted jointly and provided mutual checks and balances [177]\n\n\nNavy\nAware of the need for naval power to maintain control along the Konkan coast, Shivaji began to build his navy in 1657 or 1659, with the purchase of twenty galivats from the Portuguese shipyards of Bassein [178] Marathi chronicles state that at its height his fleet counted some 400 warships, although contemporary English chronicles counter that the number never exceeded 160 [179]\n\n\nLegacy\nShivaji was well known for his secularism, warrior code of ethics, and exemplary character [184]\n\n\nContemporaneous view\nShivaji was admired for his heroic exploits and clever stratagems in the contemporary accounts of English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and Italian writers [185] Contemporary English writers compared him with Alexander, Hannibal, and Julius Caesar [186] The French traveller Francois Bernier wrote in his Travels in Mughal India: [187]\n\n\nEarly depictions\nThe earliest depictions of Shivaji by authors not affiliated with Maratha court in Maharashtra are to be found in the bakhars that depict Shivaji as an almost divine figure, an ideal Hindu king who overthrew Muslim dominion The current academic consensus is that while these Bakhars are important for understanding how Shivaji was viewed in his time, they must be correlated with other sources to decide historical truth Sabhasad Bakhar and 91 Kalami Bakhar are considered the most reliable of all bakhars by scholars [81]\n\n\nNineteenth century\nIn the mid–19th century, Marathi social reformer Jyotirao Phule wrote his interpretation of the Shivaji legend, portraying him as a hero of the shudras and dalits Phule's 1869 ballad-form story of Shivaji was met with great hostility by the Brahmin-dominated media [189]\n\n\nPost independence\nIn modern times, Shivaji is considered as a national hero in India, [197] [198] [199] especially in the state of Maharashtra, where he remains an important figure in the state's history Stories of his life form an integral part of the upbringing and identity of the Marathi people [200]\n\n\nPolitical parties\nIn 1966, the Shiv Sena (lit. 'Army of Shivaji') political party was formed to promote the interests of Marathi-speaking people in the face of migration to Maharashtra from other parts of India, and the accompanying loss of power of locals His image adorns literature, propaganda, and icons of the party [204]\n\n\nControversies related to Shivaji's depiction\nIn the late 20th century, Babasaheb Purandare became one of the most significant authors in portraying Shivaji in his writings, leading him to be declared in 1964 as the Shiv-Shahir (lit. 'Bard of Shivaji') [206] [207] However, Purandare, a Brahmin, was also accused of overstating the influence of Brahmin gurus on Shivaji, [205] and his Maharashtra Bhushan award ceremony in 2015 was protested by those claiming he had defamed Shivaji [208]\n\n\nCommemorations\nStatues of Shivaji are found in every taluka in Maharashtra [218] [219] as well as in many places across India, including Mumbai, [220] Pune, [219] New Delhi, [221] Surat, [222] and Yellur [223] There are also statues outside of India including in San Jose, California, [224] and Mauritius [225]\n\n\nSources\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Shivaji**\n\nShivaji (Marathi: शिवाजी; 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680) was a Maratha king and a member of the Bhonsle dynasty. He is considered to be one of the greatest leaders in Indian history and is revered as a national hero in India.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nShivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near Junnar, which is now in Pune district. Scholars disagree on his date of birth; the Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti). Shivaji was named after a local deity, the Goddess Shivai Devi.\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nIn 1636, the Sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south. The sultanate had recently become a tributary state of the Mughal Empire. It was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India. Shahaji was looking for opportunities of rewards of jagir land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity.\n\n**Conflict with Bijapur Sultanate**\n\nIn 1636, the Sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south. The sultanate had recently become a tributary state of the Mughal Empire. It was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India.

The sultanate had recently become a tributary state of the Mughal Empire. It was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India. Shahaji was looking for opportunities of rewards of jagir land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity.\n\n**Independent Generalship**\n\nIn 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji captured the Torna Fort, taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur court due to the illness of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, and seized the large treasure he found there. In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including Purandar, Kondhana, and Chakan. He also brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati, and Indapur under his direct control. He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named Rajgad. That fort served as the seat of his government for over a decade. After this, Shivaji turned west to the Konkan and took possession of the important town of Kalyan. The Bijapur government took note of these happenings and sought to take action. On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was imprisoned by a fellow Maratha sardar called Baji Ghorpade, under the orders of the Bijapur government, in a bid to contain Shivaji.\n\n**Combat with Afzal Khan**\n\nThe Bijapur Sultanate was displeased with their losses to Shivaji's forces, with their vassal Shahaji disavowing his son's actions. After a peace treaty with the Mughals, and the general acceptance of the young Ali Adil Shah II as the sultan, the Bijapur government became more stable, and turned its attention towards Shivaji. In 1657, the sultan, or more likely his mother and regent, sent Afzal Khan, a veteran general, to arrest Shivaji. Before engaging him, the Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhavani Temple, a holy site for Shivaji's family, and the Vithoba temple at Pandharpur, a major pilgrimage site for Hindus.\n\n**Siege of Panhala**\n\nHaving defeated the Bijapuri forces sent against him, Shivaji and his army marched towards the Konkan coast and Kolhapur, seizing Panhala fort, and defeating Bijapuri forces sent against them, under Rustam Zaman and Fazl Khan, in 1659. In 1660, Adilshah sent his general Siddi Jauhar to attack Shivaji's southern border, in alliance with the Mughals who planned to attack from the north. At that time, Shivaji was encamped at Panhala fort with his forces. Siddi Jauhar's army besieged Panhala in mid-1660, cutting off supply routes to the fort. During the bombardment of Panhala, Siddi Jauhar purchased grenades from the English at Rajapur, and also hired some English artillerymen to assist in his bombardment of the fort, conspicuously flying a flag used by the English. This perceived betrayal angered Shivaji, who in December would retaliate by plundering the English factory at Rajapur and capturing four of the owners, imprisoning them until mid-1663.\n\n**Battle of Pavan Khind**\n\nShivaji escaped from Panhala by cover of night, and as he was pursued by the enemy cavalry, his Maratha sardar Baji Prabhu Deshpande of Bandal Deshmukh, along with 300 soldiers, volunteered to fight to the death to hold back the enemy at Ghod Khind (\"horse ravine\") to give Shivaji and the rest of the army a chance to reach the safety of the Vishalgad fort.\n\n**Conflict with the Mughals**\n\nUntil 1657, Shivaji maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal Empire. Shivaji offered his assistance to Aurangzeb, the son of the Mughal Emperor and viceroy of the Deccan, in conquering Bijapur, in return for formal recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages in his possession. Dissatisfied with the Mughal response, and receiving a better offer from Bijapur, he launched a raid into the Mughal Deccan. Shivaji's confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of Shivaji's officers raided the Mughal territory near Ahmednagar. This was followed by raids in Junnar, with Shivaji carrying off 300,000 hun in cash and 200 horses. Aurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar. However, Aurangzeb's countermeasures against Shivaji were interrupted by the rainy season and his battles with his brothers over the succession to the Mughal throne, following the illness of the emperor Shah Jahan.\n\n**Attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat**\n\nAt the request of Badi Begum of Bijapur, Aurangzeb sent his maternal uncle Shaista Khan, with an army numbering over 150,000, along with a powerful artillery division, in January 1660 to attack Shivaji in conjunction with Bijapur's army led by Siddi Jauhar. Shaista Khan, with his better equipped and well provisioned army of 80,000 seized Pune. He also took the nearby fort of Chakan, besieging it for a month and a half before breaching the walls. He established his residence at Shivaji's palace of Lal Mahal.\n\n**Treaty of Purandar**\n\nThe attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat enraged Aurangzeb. In response, he sent the Rajput general Jai Singh I with an army numbering around 15,000 to defeat Shivaji. Throughout 1665, Jai Singh's forces pressed Shivaji, with their cavalry razing the countryside, and besieging Shivaji's forts. The Mughal commander succeeded in luring away several of Shivaji's key commanders, and many of his cavalrymen, into Mughal service. By mid-1665, with the fortress at Purandar besieged and near capture, Shivaji was forced to come to terms with Jai Singh.\n\n**Arrest in Agra and escape**\n\nIn 1666, Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji to Agra, along with his nine-year-old son Sambhaji. Aurangzeb planned to send Shivaji to Kandahar, now in Afghanistan, to consolidate the Mughal empire's northwestern frontier. However, on 12 May 1666, Shivaji was made to stand at court alongside relatively low-ranking nobles, men he had already defeated in battle. Shivaji took offence, stormed out, and was promptly placed under house arrest. Ram Singh, son of Jai Singh, guaranteed custody of Shivaji and his son.\n\n**Peace with the Mughals**\n\nAfter Shivaji's escape, hostilities with the Mughals ebbed, with the Mughal sardar Jaswant Singh acting as an intermediary between Shivaji and Aurangzeb for new peace proposals. Between 1666 and 1668, Aurangzeb conferred the title of raja on Shivaji. Sambhaji was also restored as a Mughal mansabdar with 5,000 horses. Shivaji at that time sent Sambhaji, with general Prataprao Gujar, to serve with the Mughal viceroy in Aurangabad. Sambhaji was also granted territory in Berar for revenue collection. Aurangzeb also permitted Shivaji to attack Bijapur, ruled by the decaying Adil Shahi dynasty; the weakened Sultan Ali Adil Shah II sued for peace and granted the rights of sardeshmukhi and chauthai to Shivaji.\n\n**Reconquest**\n\nThe peace between Shivaji and the Mughals lasted until 1670, after which Aurangzeb became suspicious of the close ties between Shivaji and Mu'azzam, who he thought might usurp his throne, and may even have been receiving bribes from Shivaji. Also at that time, Aurangzeb, occupied in fighting the Afghans, greatly reduced his army in the Deccan; many of the disbanded soldiers quickly joined Maratha service. The Mughals also took away the jagir of Berar from Shivaji to recover the money lent to him a few years earlier. In response, Shivaji launched an offensive against the Mughals and in a span of four months recovered a major portion of the territories that had been surrendered to them.\n\n**Battles of Umrani and Nesari**\n\nIn 1674, Prataprao Gujar, the sarnaubat (commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces) and Anandrao, was sent to push back the invading force led by the Bijapuri general, Bahlol Khan. Prataprao's forces defeated and captured the opposing general in the battle, after cutting-off their water supply by encircling a strategic lake, which prompted Bahlol Khan to sue for peace. In spite of Shivaji's specific warnings against doing so, Prataprao released Bahlol Khan, who started preparing for a fresh invasion.\n\n**Coronation**\n\nShivaji had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he was still technically a Mughal zamindar or the son of a Bijapuri jagirdar, with no legal basis to rule his de facto domain. A kingly title could address this and also prevent any challenges by other Maratha leaders, who were his equals. Such a title would also provide the Hindu Marathis with a fellow Hindu sovereign in a region otherwise ruled by Muslims.\n\n**Conquest in southern India**\n\nBeginning in 1674, the Marathas undertook an aggressive campaign, raiding Khandesh (October), capturing Bijapuri Ponda (April 1675), Karwar (mid-year), and Kolhapur (July). In November, the Maratha navy skirmished with the Siddis of Janjira, but failed to dislodge them. Having recovered from an illness, and taking advantage of a civil war that had broken out between the Deccanis and the Afghans at Bijapur, Shivaji raided Athani in April 1676.\n\n**Death and succession**\n\nThe question of Shivaji's heir-apparent was complicated. Shivaji confined his son to Panhala Fort in 1678, only to have the prince escape with his wife and defect to the Mughals for a year. Sambhaji then returned home, unrepentant, and was again confined to Panhala Fort.\n\n**Governance**\n\nThe Council of Eight Ministers, or Ashta Pradhan Mandal, was an administrative and advisory council set up by Shivaji. It consisted of eight ministers who regularly advised Shivaji on political and administrative matters. The eight ministers were as follows:\n\n**Ashta Pradhan Mandal**\n\nThe Council of Eight Ministers, or Ashta Pradhan Mandal, was an administrative and advisory council set up by Shivaji.

While encouraging Hinduism, Shivaji not only allowed Muslims to practice without harassment, but supported their ministries with endowments. When Aurangzeb imposed the Jizya tax on non-Muslims on 3 April 1679, Shivaji wrote an admonishing letter to Aurangzeb criticising his tax policy. He wrote:\n\n**Letter to Aurangzeb**\n\n\"By imposing Jizya on non-Muslims, you are creating hatred and anger in their hearts. It is not the way to bring people to the path of Islam. You should instead adopt a policy of love and kindness towards them. If you do so, they will be drawn to Islam of their own free will.\"\n\n**Ramdas**\n\nShivaji was a contemporary of Samarth Ramdas. Historian Stewart Gordon concludes about their relationship:\n\n**Relationship with Ramdas**\n\n\"Shivaji and Ramdas had a close relationship. Ramdas was a great admirer of Shivaji and saw him as a great leader. Shivaji, on the other hand, saw Ramdas as a great saint and spiritual guide. Their relationship was one of mutual respect and admiration.\"\n\n**Seal**\n\nSeals were a means to confer authenticity on official documents. Shahaji and Jijabai had Persian seals. But Shivaji, right from the beginning, used Sanskrit for his seal. The seal proclaims:\n\n**Seal of Shivaji**\n\n\"This seal of Shiva, son of Shah, shines forth for the welfare of the people and is meant to command increasing respect from the universe like the first phase of the moon.\"\n\n**Mode of warfare**\n\nShivaji maintained a small but effective standing army.

Ramchandra Amatya, one of Shivaji's ministers, describes the achievement of Shivaji by saying that his empire was created from forts. Shivaji captured important Adilshahi forts at Murambdev (Rajgad), Torna, Kondhana (Sinhagad), and Purandar. He also rebuilt or repaired many forts in advantageous locations. In addition, Shivaji built a number of forts, numbering 111 according to some accounts, but it is likely the actual number \"did not exceed 18.\" The historian Jadunath Sarkar assessed that Shivaji owned some 240–280 forts at the time of his death.

Maharashtra are to be found in the bakhars that depict Shivaji as an almost divine figure, an ideal Hindu", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shivaji\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nShivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near Junnar, which is now in Pune district Scholars disagree on his date of birth; the Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti) [a] [27] [28] Shivaji was named after a local deity, the Goddess Shivai Devi [29] [30]\n\nAncestry\nIn 1636, the Sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south [8] The sultanate had recently become a tributary state of the Mughal Empire [8] [37] It was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India Shahaji was looking for opportunities of rewards of jagir land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity [8]\n\n\nConflict with Bijapur Sultanate\nIn 1636, the Sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south [8] The sultanate had recently become a tributary state of the Mughal Empire [8] [37] It was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India Shahaji was looking for opportunities of rewards of jagir land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity [8]\n\n\nBackground and context\nIn 1636, the Sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south [8] The sultanate had recently become a tributary state of the Mughal Empire [8] [37] It was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India Shahaji was looking for opportunities of rewards of jagir land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity [8]\n\n\nIndependent generalship\n\nIn 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji captured the Torna Fort, taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur court due to the illness of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, and seized the large treasure he found there [41] [42] In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including Purandar, Kondhana, and Chakan He also brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati, and Indapur under his direct control He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named Rajgad That fort served as the seat of his government for over a decade [41] After this, Shivaji turned west to the Konkan and took possession of the important town of Kalyan The Bijapur government took note of these happenings and sought to take action On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was imprisoned by a fellow Maratha sardar called Baji Ghorpade, under the orders of the Bijapur government, in a bid to contain Shivaji [43]\n\nCombat with Afzal Khan\nThe Bijapur Sultanate was displeased with their losses to Shivaji's forces, with their vassal Shahaji disavowing his son's actions After a peace treaty with the Mughals, and the general acceptance of the young Ali Adil Shah II as the sultan, the Bijapur government became more stable, and turned its attention towards Shivaji [49] In 1657, the sultan, or more likely his mother and regent, sent Afzal Khan, a veteran general, to arrest Shivaji Before engaging him, the Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhavani Temple, a holy site for Shivaji's family, and the Vithoba temple at Pandharpur, a major pilgrimage site for Hindus [50] [51] [52]\n\n\nSiege of Panhala\nHaving defeated the Bijapuri forces sent against him, Shivaji and his army marched towards the Konkan coast and Kolhapur, seizing Panhala fort, and defeating Bijapuri forces sent against them, under Rustam Zaman and Fazl Khan, in 1659 [62] In 1660, Adilshah sent his general Siddi Jauhar to attack Shivaji's southern border, in alliance with the Mughals who planned to attack from the north At that time, Shivaji was encamped at Panhala fort with his forces Siddi Jauhar's army besieged Panhala in mid-1660, cutting off supply routes to the fort During the bombardment of Panhala, Siddi Jauhar purchased grenades from the English at Rajapur, and also hired some English artillerymen to assist in his bombardment of the fort, conspicuously flying a flag used by the English This perceived betrayal angered Shivaji, who in December would retaliate by plundering the English factory at Rajapur and capturing four of the owners, imprisoning them until mid-1663 [63]\n\n\nBattle of Pavan Khind\nShivaji escaped from Panhala by cover of night, and as he was pursued by the enemy cavalry, his Maratha sardar Baji Prabhu Deshpande of Bandal Deshmukh, along with 300 soldiers, volunteered to fight to the death to hold back the enemy at Ghod Khind (\"horse ravine\") to give Shivaji and the rest of the army a chance to reach the safety of the Vishalgad fort [66]\n\n\nConflict with the Mughals\nUntil 1657, Shivaji maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal Empire Shivaji offered his assistance to Aurangzeb, the son of the Mughal Emperor and viceroy of the Deccan, in conquering Bijapur, in return for formal recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages in his possession Dissatisfied with the Mughal response, and receiving a better offer from Bijapur, he launched a raid into the Mughal Deccan [68] Shivaji's confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of Shivaji's officers raided the Mughal territory near Ahmednagar [69] This was followed by raids in Junnar, with Shivaji carrying off 300,000 hun in cash and 200 horses [70] Aurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar However, Aurangzeb's countermeasures against Shivaji were interrupted by the rainy season and his battles with his brothers over the succession to the Mughal throne, following the illness of the emperor Shah Jahan [71]\n\n\nAttacks on Shaista Khan and Surat\nAt the request of Badi Begum of Bijapur, Aurangzeb, now the Mughal emperor, sent his maternal uncle Shaista Khan, with an army numbering over 150,000, along with a powerful artillery division, in January 1660 to attack Shivaji in conjunction with Bijapur's army led by Siddi Jauhar Shaista Khan, with his better equipped and well provisioned army of 80,000 seized Pune He also took the nearby fort of Chakan, besieging it for a month and a half before breaching the walls [72] He established his residence at Shivaji's palace of Lal Mahal [73]\n\n\nTreaty of Purandar\nThe attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat enraged Aurangzeb In response, he sent the Rajput general Jai Singh I with an army numbering around 15,000 to defeat Shivaji [81] Throughout 1665, Jai Singh's forces pressed Shivaji, with their cavalry razing the countryside, and besieging Shivaji's forts The Mughal commander succeeded in luring away several of Shivaji's key commanders, and many of his cavalrymen, into Mughal service By mid-1665, with the fortress at Purandar besieged and near capture, Shivaji was forced to come to terms with Jai Singh [81]\n\n\nArrest in Agra and escape\nIn 1666, Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji to Agra (though some sources instead state Delhi), along with his nine-year-old son Sambhaji Aurangzeb planned to send Shivaji to Kandahar, now in Afghanistan, to consolidate the Mughal empire's northwestern frontier However, on 12 May 1666, Shivaji was made to stand at court alongside relatively low-ranking nobles, men he had already defeated in battle [85] Shivaji took offence, stormed out, [86] and was promptly placed under house arrest Ram Singh, son of Jai Singh, guaranteed custody of Shivaji and his son [87]\n\n\nPeace with the Mughals\nAfter Shivaji's escape, hostilities with the Mughals ebbed, with the Mughal sardar Jaswant Singh acting as an intermediary between Shivaji and Aurangzeb for new peace proposals [98] Between 1666 and 1668, Aurangzeb conferred the title of raja on Shivaji Sambhaji was also restored as a Mughal mansabdar with 5,000 horses Shivaji at that time sent Sambhaji, with general Prataprao Gujar, to serve with the Mughal viceroy in Aurangabad, Prince Mu'azzam Sambhaji was also granted territory in Berar for revenue collection [99] Aurangzeb also permitted Shivaji to attack Bijapur, ruled by the decaying Adil Shahi dynasty; the weakened Sultan Ali Adil Shah II sued for peace and granted the rights of sardeshmukhi and chauthai to Shivaji [100]\n\n\nReconquest\nThe peace between Shivaji and the Mughals lasted until 1670, after which Aurangzeb became suspicious of the close ties between Shivaji and Mu'azzam, who he thought might usurp his throne, and may even have been receiving bribes from Shivaji [101] [102] Also at that time, Aurangzeb, occupied in fighting the Afghans, greatly reduced his army in the Deccan; many of the disbanded soldiers quickly joined Maratha service [103] The Mughals also took away the jagir of Berar from Shivaji to recover the money lent to him a few years earlier [104] In response, Shivaji launched an offensive against the Mughals and in a span of four months recovered a major portion of the territories that had been surrendered to them [105]\n\n\nBattles of Umrani and Nesari\nIn 1674, Prataprao Gujar, the sarnaubat (commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces) and Anandrao, was sent to push back the invading force led by the Bijapuri general, Bahlol Khan Prataprao's forces defeated and captured the opposing general in the battle, after cutting-off their water supply by encircling a strategic lake, which prompted Bahlol Khan to sue for peace In spite of Shivaji's specific warnings against doing so, Prataprao released Bahlol Khan, who started preparing for a fresh invasion [108]\n\n\nCoronation\nShivaji had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he was still technically a Mughal zamindar or the son of a Bijapuri jagirdar, with no legal basis to rule his de facto domain A kingly title could address this and also prevent any challenges by other Maratha leaders, who were his equals [e] Such a title would also provide the Hindu Marathis with a fellow Hindu sovereign in a region otherwise ruled by Muslims [111]\n\n\nConquest in southern India\nBeginning in 1674, the Marathas undertook an aggressive campaign, raiding Khandesh (October), capturing Bijapuri Ponda (April 1675), Karwar (mid-year), and Kolhapur (July) [134] In November, the Maratha navy skirmished with the Siddis of Janjira, but failed to dislodge them [135] Having recovered from an illness, and taking advantage of a civil war that had broken out between the Deccanis and the Afghans at Bijapur, Shivaji raided Athani in April 1676 [136]\n\n\nDeath and succession\nThe question of Shivaji's heir-apparent was complicated Shivaji confined his son to Panhala Fort in 1678, only to have the prince escape with his wife and defect to the Mughals for a year Sambhaji then returned home, unrepentant, and was again confined to Panhala Fort [144]\n\n\nGovernance\nThe Council of Eight Ministers, or Ashta Pradhan Mandal, was an administrative and advisory council set up by Shivaji [153] [154] It consisted of eight ministers who regularly advised Shivaji on political and administrative matters The eight ministers were as follows: [149]\n\n\nAshta Pradhan Mandal\nThe Council of Eight Ministers, or Ashta Pradhan Mandal, was an administrative and advisory council set up by Shivaji [153] [154] It consisted of eight ministers who regularly advised Shivaji on political and administrative matters The eight ministers were as follows: [149]\n\n\nPromotion of Marathi and Sanskrit\nAt his court, Shivaji replaced Persian, the common courtly language in the region, with Marathi, and emphasised Hindu political and courtly traditions Shivaji's reign stimulated the deployment of Marathi as a systematic tool of description and understanding [155] Shivaji's royal seal was in Sanskrit Shivaji commissioned one of his officials to make a comprehensive lexicon to replace Persian and Arabic terms with their Sanskrit equivalents This led to the production of the Rājavyavahārakośa, the thesaurus of state usage in 1677 [156]\n\n\nReligious policy\nMany modern commentators have deemed Shivaji's religious policies as tolerant While encouraging Hinduism, Shivaji not only allowed Muslims to practice without harassment, but supported their ministries with endowments [157] When Aurangzeb imposed the Jizya tax on non-Muslims on 3 April 1679, Shivaji wrote an admonishing letter to Aurangzeb criticising his tax policy He wrote:\n\n\nRamdas\nShivaji was a contemporary of Samarth Ramdas Historian Stewart Gordon concludes about their relationship:\n\n\nSeal\nSeals were a means to confer authenticity on official documents Shahaji and Jijabai had Persian seals But Shivaji, right from the beginning, used Sanskrit for his seal [156] The seal proclaims: \"This seal of Shiva, son of Shah, shines forth for the welfare of the people and is meant to command increasing respect from the universe like the first phase of the moon.\" [165]\n\n\nMode of warfare\nShivaji maintained a small but effective standing army The core of Shivaji's army consisted of peasants of Maratha and Kunbi castes [166] Shivaji was aware of the limitations of his army He realised that conventional warfare methods were inadequate to confront the big, well-trained cavalry of the Mughals, which was equipped with field artillery As a result, Shivaji mastered guerilla tactics which became known as Ganimi Kawa in the Marathi language [167] [168] His strategies consistently perplexed and defeated armies sent against him He realized that the most vulnerable point of the large, slow-moving armies of the time was supply He utilised knowledge of the local terrain and the superior mobility of his light cavalry to cut off supplies to the enemy [163] Shivaji refused to confront the enemy in pitched battles Instead, he lured the enemies into difficult hills and jungles of his own choosing, catching them at a disadvantage and routing them Shivaji did not adhere to a particular tactic but used several methods to undermine his enemies, as required by circumstances, such as sudden raids, sweeps and ambushes, and psychological warfare [169]\n\n\nMilitary\nShivaji demonstrated great skill in creating his military organisation, which lasted until the demise of the Maratha Empire His strategy rested on leveraging his ground forces, naval forces, and series of forts across his territory The Maval infantry served as the core of his ground forces (reinforced by Telangi musketeers from Karnataka) and supported by Maratha cavalry His artillery was relatively underdeveloped and reliant on European suppliers, further inclining him to a very mobile form of warfare [172]\n\n\nHill forts\nHill forts played a key role in Shivaji's strategy Ramchandra Amatya, one of Shivaji's ministers,  describes the achievement of Shivaji by saying that his empire was created from forts [173] Shivaji captured important Adilshahi forts at Murambdev (Rajgad), Torna, Kondhana (Sinhagad), and Purandar He also rebuilt or repaired many forts in advantageous locations [174] In addition, Shivaji built a number of forts, numbering 111 according to some accounts, but it is likely the actual number \"did not exceed 18.\" [175] The historian Jadunath Sarkar assessed that Shivaji owned some 240–280 forts at the time of his death [176] Each was placed under three officers of equal status, lest a single traitor be bribed or tempted to deliver it to the enemy The officers acted jointly and provided mutual checks and balances [177]\n\n\nNavy\nAware of the need for naval power to maintain control along the Konkan coast, Shivaji began to build his navy in 1657 or 1659, with the purchase of twenty galivats from the Portuguese shipyards of Bassein [178] Marathi chronicles state that at its height his fleet counted some 400 warships, although contemporary English chronicles counter that the number never exceeded 160 [179]\n\n\nLegacy\nShivaji was well known for his secularism, warrior code of ethics, and exemplary character [184]\n\n\nContemporaneous view\nShivaji was admired for his heroic exploits and clever stratagems in the contemporary accounts of English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and Italian writers [185] Contemporary English writers compared him with Alexander, Hannibal, and Julius Caesar [186] The French traveller Francois Bernier wrote in his Travels in Mughal India: [187]\n\n\nEarly depictions\nThe earliest depictions of Shivaji by authors not affiliated with Maratha court in Maharashtra are to be found in the bakhars that depict Shivaji as an almost divine figure, an ideal Hindu king who overthrew Muslim dominion The current academic consensus is that while these Bakhars are important for understanding how Shivaji was viewed in his time, they must be correlated with other sources to decide historical truth Sabhasad Bakhar and 91 Kalami Bakhar are considered the most reliable of all bakhars by scholars [81]\n\n\nNineteenth century\nIn the mid–19th century, Marathi social reformer Jyotirao Phule wrote his interpretation of the Shivaji legend, portraying him as a hero of the shudras and dalits Phule's 1869 ballad-form story of Shivaji was met with great hostility by the Brahmin-dominated media [189]\n\n\nPost independence\nIn modern times, Shivaji is considered as a national hero in India, [197] [198] [199] especially in the state of Maharashtra, where he remains an important figure in the state's history Stories of his life form an integral part of the upbringing and identity of the Marathi people [200]\n\n\nPolitical parties\nIn 1966, the Shiv Sena (lit. 'Army of Shivaji') political party was formed to promote the interests of Marathi-speaking people in the face of migration to Maharashtra from other parts of India, and the accompanying loss of power of locals His image adorns literature, propaganda, and icons of the party [204]\n\n\nControversies related to Shivaji's depiction\nIn the late 20th century, Babasaheb Purandare became one of the most significant authors in portraying Shivaji in his writings, leading him to be declared in 1964 as the Shiv-Shahir (lit. 'Bard of Shivaji') [206] [207] However, Purandare, a Brahmin, was also accused of overstating the influence of Brahmin gurus on Shivaji, [205] and his Maharashtra Bhushan award ceremony in 2015 was protested by those claiming he had defamed Shivaji [208]\n\n\nCommemorations\nStatues of Shivaji are found in every taluka in Maharashtra [218] [219] as well as in many places across India, including Mumbai, [220] Pune, [219] New Delhi, [221] Surat, [222] and Yellur [223] There are also statues outside of India including in San Jose, California, [224] and Mauritius [225]\n\n\nSources\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "California", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe Spaniards gave the name Las Californias to the peninsula of Baja California (in modern-day Mexico) As Spanish explorers and settlers moved north and inland, the region known as California, or Las Californias, grew Eventually it included lands north of the peninsula, Alta California, part of which became the present-day U.S state of California.\n\n\nHistory\nCalifornia was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America [26] Historians generally agree that there were at least 300,000 people living in California prior to European colonization [27] The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct ethnic groups, inhabiting environments ranging from mountains and deserts to islands and redwood forests [28]\n\n\nIndigenous\nCalifornia was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America [26] Historians generally agree that there were at least 300,000 people living in California prior to European colonization [27] The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct ethnic groups, inhabiting environments ranging from mountains and deserts to islands and redwood forests [28]\n\n\nSpanish period\nThe first Europeans to explore the coast of California were the members of a Spanish maritime expedition led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542 Cabrillo was commissioned by Antonio de Mendoza, the Viceroy of New Spain, to lead an expedition up the Pacific coast in search of trade opportunities; they entered San Diego Bay on September 28, 1542, and reached at least as far north as San Miguel Island [38] Privateer and explorer Francis Drake explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579, landing north of the future city of San Francisco The first Asians to set foot on what would be the United States occurred in 1587, when Filipino sailors arrived in Spanish ships at Morro Bay [39] [40] Coincidentally the descendants of the Muslim Caliph Hasan ibn Ali in formerly Islamic Manila and had converted, then mixed Christianity with Islam, upon Spanish conquest, transited through California (Named after a Caliph) on their way to Guerrero, Mexico [41] where they played a future role in the wars of independence Sebastián Vizcaíno explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain, putting ashore in Monterey [42] Despite the on-the-ground explorations of California in the 16th century, Rodríguez's idea of California as an island persisted Such depictions appeared on many European maps well into the 18th century [43]\n\n\nMexican period\nIn 1821, the Mexican War of Independence gave the Mexican Empire (which included California) independence from Spain For the next 25 years, Alta California remained a remote, sparsely populated, northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico, which shortly after independence became a republic The missions, which controlled most of the best land in the state, were secularized by 1834 and became the property of the Mexican government [48] The governor granted many square leagues of land to others with political influence These huge ranchos or cattle ranches emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios (Hispanics native of California) who traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants Beef did not become a commodity until the 1849 California Gold Rush.\n\n\nU.S. conquest and the California Republic\nIn 1846, a group of American settlers in and around Sonoma rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt Afterward, rebels raised the Bear Flag (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words \"California Republic\") at Sonoma The Republic's only president was William B Ide, [59] who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt This revolt by American settlers served as a prelude to the later American military invasion of California and was closely coordinated with nearby American military commanders.\n\n\nEarly American period\nFollowing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah The even more lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769 [64]\n\n\nCalifornia genocide\nUnder earlier Spanish and Mexican rule, California's original native population had precipitously declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which the Indigenous people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity [73] Under its new American administration, California's first governor Peter Hardeman Burnett instituted policies that have been described as a state-sanctioned policy of elimination of California's indigenous people [74] Burnett announced in 1851 in his Second Annual Message to the Legislature: \"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.\" [75]\n\n\n1900–present\nIn the 20th century, thousands of Japanese people migrated to California The state in 1913 passed the Alien Land Act, excluding Asian immigrants from owning land [81] During World War II, Japanese Americans in California were interned in concentration camps; [82] in 2020, California apologized [83]\n\n\nGeography\nCovering an area of 163,696 sq mi (423,970 km2), California is the third-largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas [122] California is one of the most geographically diverse states in the union and is often geographically bisected into two regions, Southern California, comprising the ten southernmost counties, [123] [124] and Northern California, comprising the 48 northernmost counties [125] [126] It is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east and northeast, Arizona to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south (with which it makes up part of The Californias region of North America, alongside Baja California Sur).\n\n\nClimate\nMost of the state has a Mediterranean climate The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of Los Angeles and San Francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent Even the San Diego shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast The same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the ocean experience significantly hotter summers and colder winters in contrast with nearby areas closer to the ocean [132] [133] [134]\n\n\nEcology\nCalifornia is one of the ecologically richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities California is part of the Nearctic realm and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions [144]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nCalifornia boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees California's native grasses are perennial plants, [145] and there are close to hundred succulent species native to the state [citation needed] After European contact, these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer [146]\n\n\nRivers\nThe most prominent river system within California is formed by the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River, which are fed mostly by snowmelt from the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, and respectively drain the north and south halves of the Central Valley The two rivers join in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, flowing into the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento–San Joaquin system, including the Pit River, Feather River and Tuolumne River.\n\n\nRegions\nCalifornia is traditionally separated into Northern California and Southern California, divided by a straight border which runs across the state, separating the northern 48 counties from the southern 10 counties Despite the persistence of the northern-southern divide, California is more precisely divided into many regions, multiple of which stretch across the northern-southern divide.\n\n\nCities and towns\nThe state has 483 incorporated cities and towns, [159] of which 461 are cities and 22 are towns Under California law, the terms \"city\" and \"town\" are explicitly interchangeable; the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name)\" [160]\n\n\nDemographics\nPresently, close to one out of every nine United States residents live in California [171] [172] The United States Census Bureau reported that the population of California was 39.54 million on April 1, 2020, a 6.13% increase since the 2010 census [169] During that decade, the state's population grew more slowly than the rest of the nation, resulting in the loss of one seat on the US House of Representatives, the first loss in its entire history [171] The estimated state population in 2023 was 38.94 million [172] For well over a century (1900–2020), California experienced steady population growth Even while the rate of growth began to slow by the 1990s, some growth continued into the first two decades of the 21st century; California added an average of around 400,000 people per year to its population during the period 1940–2020 [173] [174] [175] Then in 2020, the state began to experience population declines continuing every year, attributable mostly to moves out of state but also due to declining birth rates, COVID-19 pandemic deaths, and less internal migration from other states to California [171] [176] According to the U.S Census Bureau, between 2021 and 2022, 818,000 California residents moved out of state [177] with emigrants listing high cost of living, [178] high taxes, [179] [180] and a difficult business environment as the motivation [180] The net loss of population in California between July 2020 and July 2023 was 433,000 [171]\n\n\nPopulation\nPresently, close to one out of every

began to slow by the 1990s, some growth continued into the first two decades of the 21st century; California added an average of around 400,000 people per year to its population during the period 1940–2020 [173] [174] [175] Then in 2020, the state began to experience population declines continuing every year, attributable mostly to moves out of state but also due to declining birth rates, COVID-19 pandemic deaths, and less internal migration from other states to California [171] [176] According to the U.S Census Bureau, between 2021 and 2022, 818,000 California residents moved out of state [177] with emigrants listing high cost of living, [178] high taxes, [179] [180] and a difficult business environment as the motivation [180] The net loss of population in California between July 2020 and July 2023 was 433,000 [171]\n\n\nRace and ethnicity\nother Pacific Islander\n\n\nLanguages\nEnglish serves as California's de jure and de facto official language According to the 2021 American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau, 56.08% (20,763,638) of California residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home, while 43.92% spoke another language at home 60.35% of people who speak a language other than English at home are able to speak English \"well\" or \"very well\", with this figure varying significantly across the different linguistic groups [227] Like most U.S states (32 out of 50), California law enshrines English as its official language, and has done so since the passage of Proposition 63 by California voters in 1986 Various government agencies do, and are often required to, furnish documents in the various languages needed to reach their intended audiences [228] [229] [230]\n\n\nReligion\nReligious self-identification, per Public Religion Research Institute's 2021 American Values Survey [248]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of California is a Western culture and has its modern roots in the culture of the United States, but also, historically, many Hispanic Californio and Mexican influences As a border and coastal state, California culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations, especially those from Latin America and Asia [255]\n\n\nMedia and entertainment\nHollywood and the rest of the Los Angeles area is a major global center for entertainment, with the U.S film industry's \"Big Five\" major film studios (Columbia, Disney, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros.) as well as many minor film studios being based in or around the area Many animation studios are also headquartered in the state.\n\n\nSports\nCalifornia has nineteen major professional sports league franchises, far more than any other state The San Francisco Bay Area has six major league teams spread in its three major cities: San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, while the Greater Los Angeles Area is home to ten major league franchises San Diego and Sacramento each have one major league team The NFL Super Bowl has been hosted in California 12 times at five different stadiums: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rose Bowl, Stanford Stadium, Levi's Stadium, and San Diego Stadium A thirteenth, Super Bowl LVI, was held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood on February 13, 2022 [258]\n\n\nEducation\nCalifornia has the most school students in the country, with over 6.2 million in the 2005–06 school year, giving California more students in school than 36 states have in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments in the country [261]\nPublic secondary education consists of high schools that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students California's public educational system is supported by a unique constitutional amendment that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades K–12 and community colleges that grows with the economy and student enrollment figures [262]\n\n\nHigher education\nCalifornia public postsecondary education is organized into three separate systems:\n\n\nEconomy\nCalifornia's economy ranks among the largest in the world As of 2024 [update], the gross state product (GSP) is $4.0 trillion ($102,500 per capita), the largest in the United States  [15] California is responsible for one seventh of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) [275] As of 2018 [update], California's nominal GDP is larger than all but four countries [276] In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), [277] it is larger than all but eight countries [278] California's economy is larger than Africa and Australia and is almost as large as South America [279] The state recorded total, non-farm employment of 16,677,800 [280] as of September 2021 [update] among 966,224 employer establishments [281]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture is an important sector in California's economy According to the USDA in 2011, the three largest California agricultural products by value were milk and cream, shelled almonds, and grapes [19] Farming-related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004 [285] This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability Factors contributing to the growth in sales-per-acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production [285] In 2008, California's 81,500 farms and ranches generated $36.2 billion products revenue [286] In 2011, that number grew to $43.5 billion products revenue [287] The agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state's GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce [288]\n\n\nIncome\nPer capita GDP in 2021 was $85,546, ranking fourth in the nation Per capita income varies widely by geographic region and profession [291] The Central Valley is the most impoverished, with migrant farm workers making less than minimum wage According to a 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service, the San Joaquin Valley was characterized as one of the most economically depressed regions in the United States, on par with the region of Appalachia [292]\n\n\nState finances\nState spending increased from $56 billion in 1998 to $127 billion in 2011 [299] [300] California has the third highest per capita spending on welfare among the states, as well as the highest spending on welfare at $6.67 billion [301] In January 2011, California's total debt was at least $265 billion [302] On June 27, 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed a balanced budget (no deficit) for the state, its first in decades; however, the state's debt remains at $132 billion [303] [304]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nBecause it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy The state has extensive hydro-electric energy generation facilities, however, moving water is the single largest energy use in the state Also, due to high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States [306] Due to the high electricity demand, California imports more electricity than any other state, primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest (via Path 15 and Path 66) and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert Southwest via Path 46 [307]\n\n\nEnergy\nBecause it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy The state has extensive hydro-electric energy generation

state, primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest (via Path 15 and Path 66) and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert Southwest via Path 46 [307]\n\n\nTransportation\nCalifornia's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of controlled-access highways ('freeways'), limited-access roads ('expressways'), and highways California is known for its car culture, giving California's cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation, nicknamed \"Caltrans\" The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks, and California has some of the worst roads in the United States [314] [315] The Reason Foundation's 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first [316]\n\n\nHighways\nCalifornia's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of controlled-access highways ('freeways'), limited-access roads

California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first [316]\n\n\nAir travel\nLos Angeles International Airport (LAX), the 4th busiest airport in the world in 2018, and San Francisco International Airport (SFO), the 25th busiest airport in the world in 2018, are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic There are about a dozen important commercial airports and many more general aviation airports throughout the state.\n\n\nRailroads\nInter-city rail travel is provided by Amtrak California; the three routes, the Capitol Corridor, Pacific Surfliner, and San Joaquin, are funded by Caltrans These services are the busiest intercity rail lines in the United States outside the Northeast Corridor and ridership is continuing to set records The routes are becoming increasingly popular over flying, especially on the LAX-SFO route [321] Integrated subway and light rail networks are found in Los Angeles (Los Angeles Metro Rail) and San Francisco (Muni Metro) Light rail systems are also found in San Jose (VTA light rail), San Diego (San Diego Trolley), Sacramento (SacRT light rail), and Northern San Diego County (Sprinter) Furthermore, commuter rail networks serve the San Francisco Bay Area (Altamont Corridor Express, Bay Area Rapid Transit, Caltrain, Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit), Greater Los Angeles (Metrolink), and San Diego County (Coaster).\n\n\nBusses\nNearly all counties operate bus lines, and many cities operate their own city bus lines as well Intercity bus travel is provided by Greyhound, Megabus, and Amtrak Thruway.\n\n\nWater\nCalifornia's interconnected water system is the world's largest, managing over 40,000,000 acre-feet (49 km3) of water per year, centered on six main systems of aqueducts and infrastructure projects [325] Water use and conservation in California is a politically divisive issue, as the state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors, especially in the arid southern portion of the state The state's widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe capital city of California is Sacramento [328]\nThe state is organized into three branches of government—the executive branch consisting of the governor [329] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the Assembly and Senate; [330] and the judicial branch consisting of the Supreme Court of California and lower courts [331] The state also allows ballot propositions: direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, recall, and ratification [332] Before the passage of Proposition 14 in 2010, California allowed each political party to choose whether to have a closed primary or a primary where only party members and independents vote After June 8, 2010, when Proposition 14 was approved, excepting only the United States president and county central committee offices, [333] all candidates in the primary elections are listed on the ballot with their preferred party affiliation, but they are not the official nominee of that party [334] At the primary election, the two candidates with the top votes will advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation [334] This is known as a nonpartisan blanket primary If at a special primary election, one candidate receives more than 50% of all the votes cast, they are elected to fill the vacancy and no special general election will be held [334]\n\n\nState government\nThe capital city of California is Sacramento [328]\nThe state is organized into three branches of government—the

cast, they are elected to fill the vacancy and no special general election will be held [334]\n\n\nExecutive branch\nThe California executive branch consists of the governor and seven other elected constitutional officers: lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, state controller, state treasurer, insurance commissioner, and state superintendent of public instruction They serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once [335]\n\n\nLegislative branch\nThe California State Legislature consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly [338] Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two Members of the Assembly are subject to term limits of six terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of three terms.\n\n\nJudicial branch\nCalifornia's legal system is explicitly based upon English common law [339] but carries many features from Spanish civil law, such as community property California's prison population grew from 25,000 in 1980 to over 170,000 in 2007 [340] Capital punishment is a legal form of punishment and the state has the largest \"Death Row\" population in the country (though Oklahoma and Texas are far more active in carrying out executions) [341] [342] California has performed 13 executions since 1976, with the last being in 2006 [343]\n\n\nLocal government\nCalifornia has an extensive system of local government that manages public functions throughout the state Like most states, California is divided into counties, of which there are 58 (including San Francisco) covering the entire state Most urbanized areas are incorporated as cities School districts, which are independent of cities and counties, handle public education Many other functions, such as fire protection and water supply, especially in unincorporated areas, are handled by special districts.\n\n\nCounties\nCalifornia is divided into 58 counties Per Article 11, Section 1, of the Constitution of California, they are the legal subdivisions of the state The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards [345] [346] In addition, the county serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas Each county is governed by an elected board of supervisors [347]\n\n\nCity and town governments\nIncorporated cities and towns in California are either charter or general-law municipalities [160] General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it; charter municipalities are governed by their own city or town charters Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities Most small cities have a council–manager form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city Some larger cities have a directly elected mayor who oversees the city government In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membership—but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial The Government of San Francisco is the only consolidated city-county in California, where both the city and county governments have been merged into one unified jurisdiction.\n\n\nSchool districts and special districts\nAbout 1,102 school districts, independent of cities and counties, handle California's public education [348] California school districts may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts [348]\n\n\nFederal representation\nThe state of California sends 52 members to the House of Representatives, [350] the nation's largest congressional state delegation Consequently, California also has the largest number of electoral votes in national presidential elections, with 54 The former speaker of the House of Representatives is the representative of California's 20th district, Kevin McCarthy [351]\n\n\nArmed forces\nIn California, as of 2009 [update], the U.S Department of Defense had a total of 117,806 active duty servicemembers of which 88,370 were Sailors or Marines, 18,339 were Airmen, and 11,097 were Soldiers, with 61,365 Department of Defense civilian employees Additionally, there were a total of 57,792 Reservists and Guardsman in California [352]\n\n\nPolitics\nParty registration by county(October 2022):\n\n\nTwinned regions\nCalifornia has region twinning arrangements with:\n\n\nSee also\n37°N 120°W﻿ / ﻿37°N 120°W﻿ / 37;

States. It is the most populous state in the country, with a diverse geography and a rich history. The state's name is derived from a fictional island described by a 16th-century Spanish novelist, and it was originally named \"Las Californias\" to describe a peninsula in Mexico.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe name \"California\" was given to the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico by Spanish explorers. As Spanish settlers moved north and inland, the region known as California grew to include lands north of the peninsula, which became known as Alta California. This region was later divided into a part that became the present-day state of California, and another part that remained part of Mexico.\n\n## History\n\nCalifornia was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America. There were at least 300,000 people living in California prior to European colonization. The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct ethnic groups, inhabiting environments ranging from mountains and deserts to islands and redwood forests.\n\n## Spanish period\n\nThe first Europeans to explore the coast of California were the members of a Spanish maritime expedition led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542. Cabrillo was commissioned by Antonio de Mendoza, the Viceroy of New Spain, to lead an expedition up the Pacific coast in search of trade opportunities. They entered San Diego Bay on September 28, 1542, and reached as far north as San Miguel Island.\n\n## Mexican period\n\nIn 1821, the Mexican War of Independence gave the Mexican Empire (which included California) independence from Spain. For the next 25 years, Alta California remained a remote, sparsely populated, northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico. The missions, which controlled most of the best land in the state, were secularized by 1834 and became the property of the Mexican government.\n\n## U.S. conquest and the California Republic\n\nIn 1846, a group of American settlers in and around Sonoma rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt. Afterward, rebels raised the Bear Flag at Sonoma. The Republic's only president was William B Ide, who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt. This revolt by American settlers served as a prelude to the later American military invasion of California.\n\n## Early American period\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and Utah.\n\n## California genocide\n\nUnder earlier Spanish and Mexican rule, California's original native population had precipitously declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which the Indigenous people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity. Under its new American administration, California's first governor Peter Hardeman Burnett instituted policies that have been described as a state-sanctioned policy of elimination of California's indigenous people.\n\n## 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, thousands of Japanese people migrated to California. The state in 1913 passed the Alien Land Act, excluding Asian immigrants from owning land. During World War II, Japanese Americans in California were interned in concentration camps. In 2020, California apologized for the internment of Japanese Americans.\n\n## Geography\n\nCalifornia covers an area of 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), making it the third-largest state in the United States after Alaska and Texas. The state is geographically diverse, ranging from the Pacific Ocean to the Sierra Nevada mountains and from deserts to redwood forests.\n\n## Climate\n\nMost of California has a Mediterranean climate, with cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The state's climate is influenced by the Pacific Ocean, which moderates temperatures and provides rainfall. The state's temperature varies from the cool, foggy climate of the San Francisco Bay Area to the hot, desert climate of the Mojave Desert.\n\n## Ecology\n\nCalifornia is one of the ecologically richest and most diverse parts of the world. The state's diverse geography and climate support a wide range of ecosystems, from the towering redwoods of the north to the deserts of the south.\n\n## Flora and fauna\n\nCalifornia is home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees in the world. The state's native grasses are perennial plants, and there are close to a hundred succulent species native to the state.\n\n## Rivers\n\nThe most prominent river system within California is formed by the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River, which are fed mostly by snowmelt from the west slope of the Sierra Nevada. The two rivers join in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, flowing into the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay.\n\n## Regions\n\nCalifornia is traditionally divided into Northern California and Southern California, but the state is more precisely divided into many regions, each with its own unique culture and geography.\n\n## Cities and towns\n\nThe state has 483 incorporated cities and towns, with the majority being cities. The state's most populous cities are Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, and Fresno.\n\n## Demographics\n\nPresently, close to one out of every nine United States residents live in California. The state's population was 39.54 million on April 1, 2020, a 6.13% increase since the 2010 census.\n\n## Language\n\nEnglish serves as California's de facto official language, and according to the 2021 American Community Survey, 56.08% of California residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe culture of California is a Western culture and has its modern roots in the culture of the United States, but it has also been influenced by Hispanic Californio and Mexican influences.\n\n## Media and entertainment\n\nHollywood and the Los Angeles area are a major global center for entertainment, with the U.S. film industry's \"Big Five\" major film studios (Columbia, Disney, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros.) as well as many minor film studios being based in or around the area.\n\n## Sports\n\nCalifornia has 19 major professional sports league franchises, far more than any other state. The state is home to six major league teams in the San Francisco Bay Area and ten major league franchises in the Greater Los Angeles Area.\n\n## Education\n\nCalifornia has the most school students in the country, with over 6.2 million students in the 2005-06 school year. The state's public educational system is supported by a unique constitutional amendment that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades K-12 and community colleges.\n\n## Economy\n\nCalifornia's economy ranks among the largest in the world, with a gross state product (GSP) of $4.0 trillion in 2024. The state's economy is diverse, with major industries including agriculture, technology, and film and television production.\n\n## Agriculture\n\nAgriculture is an important sector in California's economy, with the state producing over 40% of the nation's fruits, nuts, and vegetables. The state's agriculture industry is valued at over $50 billion annually.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nCalifornia's infrastructure is extensive, with a network of roads, highways, and airports that support the state's economy and population. The state's transportation infrastructure is maintained by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).\n\n## Energy\n\nCalifornia is one of the country's largest consumers of energy, with the state's energy demand driven by its large population and diverse economy. The state's energy infrastructure includes a mix of renewable and fossil fuel-based power generation.\n\n## Transportation\n\nCalifornia's transportation network is extensive, with a network of roads, highways, and airports that support the state's economy and population. The state's transportation infrastructure is maintained by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).\n\n## Government and politics\n\nThe state is organized into three branches of government: the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. The state capital is Sacramento, and the state is divided into 58 counties.\n\n## Local government\n\nCalifornia has an extensive system of local government that manages public functions throughout the state. The state is divided into counties, which are the local governments responsible for providing a range of services, including law enforcement, public health, and education.\n\n## Armed forces\n\nAs of 2009, the U.S. Department of Defense had a total of 117,806 active duty servicemembers in California, with 88,370 of those being Sailors or Marines, 18,339 being Airmen, and 11,097 being Soldiers.\n\n## Politics\n\nCalifornia is a Democratic state, with the majority of voters registered as Democrats. The state has a long history of progressive politics, with a strong focus on social justice and environmental issues.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of California state symbols\n* List of California counties\n* List of cities in California\n* List of California state parks\n* List of California state forests\n\nI hope this meets your requirements.

1579, landing north of the future city of San Francisco The first Asians to set foot on what would be the United States occurred in 1587, when Filipino sailors arrived in Spanish ships at Morro Bay [39] [40] Coincidentally the descendants of the Muslim Caliph Hasan ibn Ali in formerly Islamic Manila and had converted, then mixed Christianity with Islam, upon Spanish conquest, transited through California (Named after a Caliph) on their way to Guerrero, Mexico [41] where they played a future role in the wars of independence Sebastián Vizcaíno explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain, putting ashore in Monterey [42] Despite the on-the-ground explorations of California in the 16th century, Rodríguez's idea of California as an island persisted Such depictions appeared on many European maps well into the 18th century [43]\n\n\nMexican period\nIn 1821, the Mexican War of Independence gave the Mexican Empire (which included California) independence from Spain For the next 25 years, Alta California remained a remote, sparsely populated, northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico, which shortly after independence became a republic The missions, which controlled most of the best land in the state, were secularized by 1834 and became the property of the Mexican government [48] The governor granted many square leagues of land to others with political influence These huge ranchos or cattle ranches emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios (Hispanics native of California) who traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants Beef did not become a commodity until the 1849 California Gold Rush.\n\n\nU.S. conquest and the California Republic\nIn 1846, a group of American settlers in and around Sonoma rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt Afterward, rebels raised the Bear Flag (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words \"California Republic\") at Sonoma The Republic's only president was William B Ide, [59] who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt This revolt by American settlers served as a prelude to the later American military invasion of California and was closely coordinated with nearby American military commanders.\n\n\nEarly American period\nFollowing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah The even more lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769 [64]\n\n\nCalifornia genocide\nUnder earlier Spanish and Mexican rule, California's original native population had precipitously declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which the Indigenous people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity [73] Under its new American administration, California's first governor Peter Hardeman Burnett instituted policies that have been described as a state-sanctioned policy of elimination of California's indigenous people [74] Burnett announced in 1851 in his Second Annual Message to the Legislature: \"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.\" [75]\n\n\n1900–present\nIn the 20th century, thousands of Japanese people migrated to California The state in 1913 passed the Alien Land Act, excluding Asian immigrants from owning land [81] During World War II, Japanese Americans in California were interned in concentration camps; [82] in 2020, California apologized [83]\n\n\nGeography\nCovering an area of 163,696 sq mi (423,970 km2), California is the third-largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas [122] California is one of the most geographically diverse states in the union and is often geographically bisected into two regions, Southern California, comprising the ten southernmost counties, [123] [124] and Northern California, comprising the 48 northernmost counties [125] [126] It is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east and northeast, Arizona to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south (with which it makes up part of The Californias region of North America, alongside Baja California Sur).\n\n\nClimate\nMost of the state has a Mediterranean climate The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of Los Angeles and San Francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent Even the San Diego shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast The same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the ocean experience significantly hotter summers and colder winters in contrast with nearby areas closer to the ocean [132] [133] [134]\n\n\nEcology\nCalifornia is one of the ecologically richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities California is part of the Nearctic realm and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions [144]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nCalifornia boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees California's native grasses are perennial plants, [145] and there are close to hundred succulent species native to the state [citation needed] After European contact, these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer [146]\n\n\nRivers\nThe most prominent river system within California is formed by the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River, which are fed mostly by snowmelt from the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, and respectively drain the north and south halves of the Central Valley The two rivers join in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, flowing into the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento–San Joaquin system, including the Pit River, Feather River and Tuolumne River.\n\n\nRegions\nCalifornia is traditionally separated into Northern California and Southern California, divided by a straight border which runs across the state, separating the northern 48 counties from the southern 10 counties Despite the persistence of the northern-southern divide, California is more precisely divided into many regions, multiple of which stretch across the northern-southern divide.\n\n\nCities and towns\nThe state has 483 incorporated cities and towns, [159] of which 461 are cities and 22 are towns Under California law, the terms \"city\" and \"town\" are explicitly interchangeable; the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name)\" [160]\n\n\nDemographics\nPresently, close to one out of every nine United States residents live in California [171] [172] The United States Census Bureau reported that the population of California was 39.54 million on April 1, 2020, a 6.13% increase since the 2010 census [169] During that decade, the state's population grew more slowly than the rest of the nation, resulting in the loss of one seat on the US House of Representatives, the first loss in its entire history [171] The estimated state population in 2023 was 38.94 million [172] For well over a century (1900–2020), California experienced steady population growth Even while the rate of growth began to slow by the 1990s, some growth continued into the first two decades of the 21st century; California added an average of around 400,000 people per year to its population during the period 1940–2020 [173] [174] [175] Then in 2020, the state began to experience population declines continuing every year, attributable mostly to moves out of state but also due to declining birth rates, COVID-19 pandemic deaths, and less internal migration from other states to California [171] [176] According to the U.S Census Bureau, between 2021 and 2022, 818,000 California residents moved out of state [177] with emigrants listing high cost of living, [178] high taxes, [179] [180] and a difficult business environment as the motivation [180] The net loss of population in California between July 2020 and July 2023 was 433,000 [171]\n\n\nPopulation\nPresently, close to one out of every nine United States residents live

433,000 [171]\n\n\nRace and ethnicity\nother Pacific Islander\n\n\nLanguages\nEnglish serves as California's de jure and de facto official language According to the 2021 American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau, 56.08% (20,763,638) of California residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home, while 43.92% spoke another language at home 60.35% of people who speak a language other than English at home are able to speak English \"well\" or \"very well\", with this figure varying significantly across the different linguistic groups [227] Like most U.S states (32 out of 50), California law enshrines English as its official language, and has done so since the passage of Proposition 63 by California voters in 1986 Various government agencies do, and are often required to, furnish documents in the various languages needed to reach their intended audiences [228] [229] [230]\n\n\nReligion\nReligious self-identification, per Public Religion Research Institute's 2021 American Values Survey [248]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of California is a Western culture and has its modern roots in the culture of the United States, but also, historically, many Hispanic Californio and Mexican influences As a border and coastal state, California culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations, especially those from Latin America and Asia [255]\n\n\nMedia and entertainment\nHollywood and the rest of the Los Angeles area is a major global center for entertainment, with the U.S film industry's \"Big Five\" major film studios (Columbia, Disney, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros.) as well as many minor film studios being based in or around the area Many animation studios are also headquartered in the state.\n\n\nSports\nCalifornia has nineteen major professional sports league franchises, far more than any other state The San Francisco Bay Area has six major league teams spread in its three major cities: San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, while the Greater Los Angeles Area is home to ten major league franchises San Diego and Sacramento each have one major league team The NFL Super Bowl has been hosted in California 12 times at five different stadiums: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rose Bowl, Stanford Stadium, Levi's Stadium, and San Diego Stadium A thirteenth, Super Bowl LVI, was held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood on February 13, 2022 [258]\n\n\nEducation\nCalifornia has the most school students in the country, with over 6.2 million in the 2005–06 school year, giving California more students in school than 36 states have in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments in the country [261]\nPublic secondary education consists of high schools that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students California's public educational system is supported by a unique constitutional amendment that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades K–12 and community colleges that grows with the economy and student enrollment figures [262]\n\n\nHigher education\nCalifornia public postsecondary education is organized into three separate systems:\n\n\nEconomy\nCalifornia's economy ranks among the largest in the world As of 2024 [update], the gross state product (GSP) is $4.0 trillion ($102,500 per capita), the largest in the United States  [15] California is responsible for one seventh of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) [275] As of 2018 [update], California's nominal GDP is larger than all but four countries [276] In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), [277] it is larger than all but eight countries [278] California's economy is larger than Africa and Australia and is almost as large as South America [279] The state recorded total, non-farm employment of 16,677,800 [280] as of September 2021 [update] among 966,224 employer establishments [281]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture is an important sector in California's economy According to the USDA in 2011, the three largest California agricultural products by value were milk and cream, shelled almonds, and grapes [19] Farming-related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004 [285] This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability Factors contributing to the growth in sales-per-acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production [285] In 2008, California's 81,500 farms and ranches generated $36.2 billion products revenue [286] In 2011, that number grew to $43.5 billion products revenue [287] The agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state's GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce [288]\n\n\nIncome\nPer capita GDP in 2021 was $85,546, ranking fourth in the nation Per capita income varies widely by geographic region and profession [291] The Central Valley is the most impoverished, with migrant farm workers making less than minimum wage According to a 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service, the San Joaquin Valley was characterized as one of the most economically depressed regions in the United States, on par with the region of Appalachia [292]\n\n\nState finances\nState spending increased from $56 billion in 1998 to $127 billion in 2011 [299] [300] California has the third highest per capita spending on welfare among the states, as well as the highest spending on welfare at $6.67 billion [301] In January 2011, California's total debt was at least $265 billion [302] On June 27, 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed a balanced budget (no deficit) for the state, its first in decades; however, the state's debt remains at $132 billion [303] [304]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nBecause it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy The state has extensive hydro-electric energy generation facilities, however, moving water is the single largest energy use in the state Also, due to high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States [306] Due to the high electricity demand, California imports more electricity than any other state, primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest (via Path 15 and Path 66) and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert Southwest via Path 46 [307]\n\n\nEnergy\nBecause it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy The state has extensive hydro-electric energy generation

[307]\n\n\nTransportation\nCalifornia's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of controlled-access highways ('freeways'), limited-access roads ('expressways'), and highways California is known for its car culture, giving California's cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation, nicknamed \"Caltrans\" The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks, and California has some of the worst roads in the United States [314] [315] The Reason Foundation's 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first [316]\n\n\nHighways\nCalifornia's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of controlled-access highways ('freeways'), limited-access roads

California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first [316]\n\n\nAir travel\nLos Angeles International Airport (LAX), the 4th busiest airport in the world in 2018, and San Francisco International Airport (SFO), the 25th busiest airport in the world in 2018, are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic There are about a dozen important commercial airports and many more general aviation airports throughout the state.\n\n\nRailroads\nInter-city rail travel is provided by Amtrak California; the three routes, the Capitol Corridor, Pacific Surfliner, and San Joaquin, are funded by Caltrans These services are the busiest intercity rail lines in the United States outside the Northeast Corridor and ridership is continuing to set records The routes are becoming increasingly popular over flying, especially on the LAX-SFO route [321] Integrated subway and light rail networks are found in Los Angeles (Los Angeles Metro Rail) and San Francisco (Muni Metro) Light rail systems are also found in San Jose (VTA light rail), San Diego (San Diego Trolley), Sacramento (SacRT light rail), and Northern San Diego County (Sprinter) Furthermore, commuter rail networks serve the San Francisco Bay Area (Altamont Corridor Express, Bay Area Rapid Transit, Caltrain, Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit), Greater Los Angeles (Metrolink), and San Diego County (Coaster).\n\n\nBusses\nNearly all counties operate bus lines, and many cities operate their own city bus lines as well Intercity bus travel is provided by Greyhound, Megabus, and Amtrak Thruway.\n\n\nWater\nCalifornia's interconnected water system is the world's largest, managing over 40,000,000 acre-feet (49 km3) of water per year, centered on six main systems of aqueducts and infrastructure projects [325] Water use and conservation in California is a politically divisive issue, as the state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors, especially in the arid southern portion of the state The state's widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe capital city of California is Sacramento [328]\nThe state is organized into three branches of government—the executive branch consisting of the governor [329] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the Assembly and Senate; [330] and the judicial branch consisting of the Supreme Court of California and lower courts [331] The state also allows ballot propositions: direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, recall, and ratification [332] Before the passage of Proposition 14 in 2010, California allowed each political party to choose whether to have a closed primary or a primary where only party members and independents vote After June 8, 2010, when Proposition 14 was approved, excepting only the United States president and county central committee offices, [333] all candidates in the primary elections are listed on the ballot with their preferred party affiliation, but they are not the official nominee of that party [334] At the primary election, the two candidates with the top votes will advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation [334] This is known as a nonpartisan blanket primary If at a special primary election, one candidate receives more than 50% of all the votes cast, they are elected to fill the vacancy and no special general election will be held [334]\n\n\nState government\nThe capital city of California is Sacramento [328]\nThe state is organized into three branches of government—the

cast, they are elected to fill the vacancy and no special general election will be held [334]\n\n\nExecutive branch\nThe California executive branch consists of the governor and seven other elected constitutional officers: lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, state controller, state treasurer, insurance commissioner, and state superintendent of public instruction They serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once [335]\n\n\nLegislative branch\nThe California State Legislature consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly [338] Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two Members of the Assembly are subject to term limits of six terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of three terms.\n\n\nJudicial branch\nCalifornia's legal system is explicitly based upon English common law [339] but carries many features from Spanish civil law, such as community property California's prison population grew from 25,000 in 1980 to over 170,000 in 2007 [340] Capital punishment is a legal form of punishment and the state has the largest \"Death Row\" population in the country (though Oklahoma and Texas are far more active in carrying out executions) [341] [342] California has performed 13 executions since 1976, with the last being in 2006 [343]\n\n\nLocal government\nCalifornia has an extensive system of local government that manages public functions throughout the state Like most states, California is divided into counties, of which there are 58 (including San Francisco) covering the entire state Most urbanized areas are incorporated as cities School districts, which are independent of cities and counties, handle public education Many other functions, such as fire protection and water supply, especially in unincorporated areas, are handled by special districts.\n\n\nCounties\nCalifornia is divided into 58 counties Per Article 11, Section 1, of the Constitution of California, they are the legal subdivisions of the state The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards [345] [346] In addition, the county serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas Each county is governed by an elected board of supervisors [347]\n\n\nCity and town governments\nIncorporated cities and towns in California are either charter or general-law municipalities [160] General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it; charter municipalities are governed by their own city or town charters Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities Most small cities have a council–manager form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city Some larger cities have a directly elected mayor who oversees the city government In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membership—but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial The Government of San Francisco is the only consolidated city-county in California, where both the city and county governments have been merged into one unified jurisdiction.\n\n\nSchool districts and special districts\nAbout 1,102 school districts, independent of cities and counties, handle California's public education [348] California school districts may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts [348]\n\n\nFederal representation\nThe state of California sends 52 members to the House of Representatives, [350] the nation's largest congressional state delegation Consequently, California also has the largest number of electoral votes in national presidential elections, with 54 The former speaker of the House of Representatives is the representative of California's 20th district, Kevin McCarthy [351]\n\n\nArmed forces\nIn California, as of 2009 [update], the U.S Department of Defense had a total of 117,806 active duty servicemembers of which 88,370 were Sailors or Marines, 18,339 were Airmen, and 11,097 were Soldiers, with 61,365 Department of Defense civilian employees Additionally, there were a total of 57,792 Reservists and Guardsman in California [352]\n\n\nPolitics\nParty registration by county(October 2022):\n\n\nTwinned regions\nCalifornia has region twinning arrangements with:\n\n\nSee also\n37°N 120°W﻿ / ﻿37°N 120°W﻿ / 37;

(1442–1483) and Richard III (1452–1485) A monumental brass in memory of Anne and Sir Thomas survives on the east wall of the Rutland Chantry, the inscription of which records that the chantry was

the juxtaposition of symbols, icons, and forms from religions, modern life, and pop culture Fuller stated that a totem was chosen to represent both the United States' original faith system, Native American spirituality, and \"as something that gave a cohesive quality to all these disparate ideas\" Creative director Patrick Clair said he was not interested in depicting every god featured in the novel, so he just tried to make \"deities inspired by gods across all manner of different religions – but messed up in ways that we found to be interesting, sticky, sort of sexy, challenging, dirty, wrong, but hopefully interesting,\" such as a crucified astronaut, a sphinx built out of an Aibo, and a Menorah with electric sockets and DIN connectors in its branches The overall aesthetic aimed for the \"really modern, occasionally very tacky, vision of the underbelly of America\", with the designers taking reference from strip club decoration and making the backgrounds using textures of vinyl, fake leather, and concrete surfaces Brian Reitzell composed the theme music, which according to Fuller, represented \"male and female energy coming in at different places as part of representations of divinity\" [83] [84]\n\n\nRelease\nThe first trailer for the series was released on July 22, 2016, at San Diego Comic-Con [85]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first trailer for the series was released on July 22,

life, and pop culture Fuller stated that a totem was chosen to represent both the United States' original faith system, Native American spirituality, and \"as something that gave a cohesive quality to all these disparate ideas\" Creative director Patrick Clair said he was not interested in depicting every god featured in the novel, so he just tried to make \"deities inspired by gods across all manner of different religions – but messed up in ways that we found to be interesting, sticky, sort of sexy, challenging, dirty, wrong, but hopefully interesting,\" such as a crucified astronaut, a sphinx built out of an Aibo, and a Menorah with electric sockets and DIN connectors in its branches The overall aesthetic aimed for the \"really modern, occasionally very tacky, vision of the underbelly of America\", with the designers taking reference from strip club decoration and making the backgrounds using textures of vinyl, fake leather, and concrete surfaces Brian Reitzell composed the theme music, which according to Fuller, represented \"male and female energy coming in at different places as part of representations of divinity\" [83] [84]\n\n\nRelease\nThe first trailer for

In his personal life, Coltrane was known for his love of art, music, and drama, and he was often seen attending various cultural events and exhibitions.\n\nHealth and death\n\nIn later life, Coltrane suffered from osteoarthritis, which caused him constant pain. From 2019 onwards, he used a wheelchair due to his mobility issues. Despite his health struggles, Coltrane continued to act and remained a beloved figure in the entertainment industry.\n\nActing credits\n\nColtrane's film career spanned over three decades, with notable roles in the Harry Potter series, Cracker, and numerous other films.

1994 This quickly became the most-used [13]\n\n\nAdoption by Microsoft\nMicrosoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape On the JavaScript front, Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript [18]\n\n\nThe rise of JScript\nBrendan Eich later said of this period: \"It's still kind of a sidekick language It's considered slow or annoying People do pop-ups or those scrolling messages in the old status bar at the bottom of your old browser.\" [14]\n\n\nGrowth and standardization\nDuring the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer [23]\n\n\nReaching maturity\nAmbitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015 [28]\n\n\nTrademark\n\"JavaScript\" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States [37] [38] The trademark was originally issued to Sun Microsystems on 6 May 1997, and was transferred to Oracle when they acquired Sun in 2009 [39]\n\n\nWebsite client-side usage\nJavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose [10] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.\n\n\nExamples of scripted behavior\nOver 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework as part of their client-side scripting [40]\n\n\nLibraries and frameworks\nOver 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework as part of their client-side scripting [40]\n\n\nOther usage\nThe use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.\n\n\nExecution\nA JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance [51]\n\n\nJavaScript engine\nA JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance [51]\n\n\nRuntime system\nA JavaScript engine must be embedded within a runtime system (such as a web browser or a standalone system) to enable scripts to interact with the broader environment The runtime system includes the necessary APIs for input/output operations, such as networking, storage, and graphics, and provides the ability to import scripts.\n\n\nFeatures\nThe following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n\n\nImperative and structured\nJavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.) One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with var; block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted [56]\n\n\nWeakly typed\nJavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used [57]\n\n\nDynamic\nJavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages A type is associated with a value rather than an expression For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string [59] JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing [60]\n\n\nTyping\nJavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages A type is associated with a value rather than an expression For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string [59] JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing [60]\n\n\nRun-time evaluation\nJavaScript includes an eval function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.\n\n\nObject-orientation (prototype-based)\nPrototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:\n\n\nPrototypes\nJavaScript uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for inheritance [62] It is possible to simulate many class-based features with prototypes in JavaScript [63]\n\n\nFunctions as object constructors\nFunctions double as object constructors, along with their typical role Prefixing a function call with new will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the Object prototype) [64] ECMAScript 5 offers the Object.create method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the Object prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to null) [65] The constructor's prototype property determines the object used for the new object's internal prototype New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor JavaScript's built-in constructors, such as Array or Object, also have prototypes that can be modified While it is possible to modify the Object prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the Object prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified [66]\n\n\nFunctions as methods\nUnlike in many object-oriented languages, in JavaScript there is no distinction between a function definition and a method definition Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling When a function is called as a method of an object, the function's local this keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.\n\n\nFunctional\nJavaScript functions are first-class; a function is considered to be an object [67] As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as .call() and .bind() [68]\n\n\nLexical closure\nA nested function is a function defined within another function It is created each time the outer function is invoked.\n\n\nAnonymous function\nJavaScript also supports anonymous functions.\n\n\nDelegative\nJavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation.\n\n\nFunctions as roles (Traits and Mixins)\nJavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of Role [70] patterns like Traits [71] [72] and Mixins [73] Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the this keyword within its function body A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via call or apply to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.\n\n\nObject composition and inheritance\nWhereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object Once the method is found it gets called within this object's context Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nJavaScript is a zero-index language.\n\n\nZero-based numbering\nJavaScript is a zero-index language.\n\n\nVariadic functions\nAn indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function The function can access them through formal parameters and also through the local arguments object Variadic functions can also be created by using the bind method.\n\n\nArray and object literals\nLike in many scripting languages, arrays and objects (associative arrays in other languages) can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax In fact, these literals form the basis of the JSON data format.\n\n\nRegular expressions\nIn a manner similar to Perl, JavaScript also supports regular expressions, which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions [74]\n\n\nPromises and Async/await\nJavaScript supports promises and Async/await for handling asynchronous operations [citation needed]\n\n\nPromises\nA built-in Promise object provides functionality for handling promises and associating handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual result Recently, the JavaScript specification introduced combinator methods, which allow developers to combine multiple JavaScript promises and do operations based on different scenarios The methods introduced are: Promise.race, Promise.all, Promise.allSettled and Promise.any.\n\n\nAsync/await\nAsync/await allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function Asynchronous, non-blocking code can be written, with minimal overhead, structured similarly to traditional synchronous, blocking code.\n\n\nVendor-specific extensions\nHistorically, some JavaScript engines supported these non-standard features:\n\n\nSyntax\nVariables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var, [76] let [77] or const [78] keywords  Variables defined without keywords will be defined at the global scope.\n\n\nSimple examples\nVariables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var, [76] let [77] or const [78] keywords  Variables defined without keywords will be defined at the global scope.\n\n\nMore advanced example\nThis sample code displays various JavaScript features.\n\n\nSecurity\nJavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one website do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.\n\n\nCross-site scripting\nA common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Website, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization One important solution to XSS vulnerabilities is HTML sanitization.\n\n\nCross-site request forgery\nAnother cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank) When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.\n\n\nMisplaced trust in the client\nDevelopers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary Some implications are:\n\n\nMisplaced trust in developers\nPackage management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developers' program libraries Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild In a study done looking over a sample of 133,000 websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability [90] \"The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago.\" [90] Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Koçulu removed his repository from npm This caused tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break [91] [92]\n\n\nBrowser and plugin coding errors\nJavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user's system This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system's API with superuser privileges.\n\n\nSandbox implementation errors\nWeb browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files Such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the Web.\n\n\nHardware vulnerabilities\nIn 2015, a JavaScript-based proof-of-concept implementation of a rowhammer attack was described in a paper by security researchers [103] [104] [105] [106]\n\n\nDevelopment tools\nImportant tools have evolved with the language.\n\n\nRelated technologies\nA common misconception is that JavaScript is directly related to Java Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language) They are also typically sandboxed, and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions, and JavaScript's Math and Date objects are based on classes from Java 1.0 [112]\n\n\nJava\nA common misconception is that JavaScript is

It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a developer at Netscape Communications, and was initially called \"Mocha.\" The language was later renamed to JavaScript in a bid to leverage the popularity of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. JavaScript is now a widely used language for both web development and mobile application development, and is known for its versatility and flexibility.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used browser, and JavaScript was a key part of its success.\n\nCreation at Netscape\n--------------------\n\nThe first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used browser, and JavaScript was a key part of its success.\n\nAdoption by Microsoft\n---------------------\n\nMicrosoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript.\n\nThe Rise of JScript\n-------------------\n\nBrendan Eich later said of this period: \"It's still kind of a sidekick language. It's considered slow or annoying. People do pop-ups or those scrolling messages in the old status bar at the bottom of your old browser.\"\n\nGrowth and Standardization\n-------------------------\n\nDuring the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.\n\nReaching Maturity\n-----------------\n\nAmbitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.\n\nTrademark\n--------\n\n\"JavaScript\" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States. The trademark was originally issued to Sun Microsystems on 6 May 1997, and was transferred to Oracle when they acquired Sun in 2009.\n\nWebsite Client-side Usage\n-------------------------\n\nJavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.\n\nExamples of Scripted Behavior\n-----------------------------\n\nOver 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework as part of their client-side scripting.\n\nLibraries and Frameworks\n-------------------------\n\nOver 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework as part of their client-side scripting.\n\nOther Usage\n------------\n\nThe use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.\n\nExecution\n----------\n\nA JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.\n\nJavaScript Engine\n-----------------\n\nA JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.\n\nRuntime System\n----------------\n\nA JavaScript engine must be embedded within a runtime system (such as a web browser or a standalone system) to enable scripts to interact with the broader environment. The runtime system includes the necessary APIs for input/output operations, such as networking, storage, and graphics, and provides the ability to import scripts.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nThe following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n\nImperative and Structured\n-------------------------\n\nJavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with var; block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.\n\nWeakly Typed\n-------------\n\nJavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.\n\nDynamic\n--------\n\nJavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string. JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.\n\nTyping\n--------\n\nJavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string. JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.\n\nRun-time Evaluation\n-------------------\n\nJavaScript includes an eval function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.\n\nObject-orientation (Prototype-based)\n-----------------------------------\n\nPrototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:\n\n\"Prototypes are objects that contain data and behavior, and are used as a template for creating new objects. Prototypes are used to inherit behavior from one object to another, and to create new objects that are based on existing objects.\"\n\nFunctions as Object Constructors\n---------------------------------\n\nFunctions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with new will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the Object prototype). ECMAScript 5 offers the Object.create method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the Object prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to null). The constructor's prototype property determines the object used for the new object's internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript's built-in constructors, such as Array or Object, also have prototypes that can be modified. While it is possible to modify the Object prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the Object prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified.\n\nFunctions as Methods\n--------------------\n\nUnlike in many object-oriented languages, in JavaScript there is no distinction between a function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling. When a function is called as a method of an object, the function's local this keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.\n\nFunctional\n----------\n\nJavaScript functions are first-class; a function is considered to be an object. As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as .call() and .bind().\n\nLexical Closure\n----------------\n\nA nested function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked.\n\nAnonymous Function\n------------------\n\nJavaScript also supports anonymous functions.\n\nDelegative\n----------\n\nJavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation.\n\nFunctions as Roles (Traits and Mixins)\n--------------------------------------\n\nJavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of Role patterns like Traits and Mixins. Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the this keyword within its function body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via call or apply to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.\n\nObject Composition and Inheritance\n-----------------------------------\n\nWhereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object's context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.\n\nMiscellaneous\n--------------\n\nJavaScript is a zero-index language.\n\nZero-based Numbering\n-------------------\n\nJavaScript is a zero-index language.\n\nVariadic Functions\n------------------\n\nAn indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function. The function can access them through formal parameters and also through the local arguments object. Variadic functions can also be created by using the bind method.\n\nArray and Object Literals\n-------------------------\n\nLike in many scripting languages, arrays and objects (associative arrays in other languages) can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax. In fact, these literals form the basis of the JSON data format.\n\nRegular Expressions\n------------------\n\nIn a manner similar to Perl, JavaScript also supports regular expressions, which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.\n\nPromises and Async/Await\n-------------------------\n\nJavaScript supports promises and Async/Await for handling asynchronous operations.\n\nPromises\n--------\n\nA built-in Promise object provides functionality for handling promises and associating handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual result. Recently, the JavaScript specification introduced combinator methods, which allow developers to combine multiple JavaScript promises and do operations based on different scenarios. The methods introduced are: Promise.race, Promise.all, Promise.allSettled, and Promise.any.\n\nAsync/Await\n------------\n\nAsync/Await allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function. Asynchronous, non-blocking code can be written, with minimal overhead, structured similarly to traditional synchronous, blocking code.\n\nVendor-Specific Extensions\n-------------------------\n\nHistorically, some JavaScript engines supported these non-standard features.\n\nSyntax\n------\n\nVariables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var, let, or const keywords. Variables defined without keywords will be defined at the global scope.\n\nSimple Examples\n--------------\n\nVariables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var, let, or const keywords. Variables defined without keywords will be defined at the global scope.\n\nMore Advanced Example\n-------------------\n\nThis sample code displays various JavaScript features.\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\nJavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one website do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.\n\nCross-Site Scripting\n-------------------\n\nA common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target website, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization.

to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.\n\n\nCross-site scripting\nA common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Website, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization One important solution to XSS vulnerabilities is HTML sanitization.\n\n\nCross-site request forgery\nAnother cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank) When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.\n\n\nMisplaced trust in the client\nDevelopers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary Some implications are:\n\n\nMisplaced trust in developers\nPackage management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developers' program libraries Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild In a study done looking over a sample of 133,000 websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability [90] \"The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago.\" [90] Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Koçulu removed his repository from npm This caused tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break [91] [92]\n\n\nBrowser and plugin coding errors\nJavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user's system This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system's API with superuser privileges.\n\n\nSandbox implementation errors\nWeb browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files Such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the Web.\n\n\nHardware vulnerabilities\nIn 2015, a JavaScript-based proof-of-concept implementation of a rowhammer attack was described in a paper by security researchers [103] [104] [105] [106]\n\n\nDevelopment tools\nImportant tools have evolved with the language.\n\n\nRelated technologies\nA common misconception is that JavaScript is directly related to Java Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language) They are also typically sandboxed, and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions, and JavaScript's Math and Date objects are based on classes from Java 1.0 [112]\n\n\nJava\nA common misconception is that JavaScript is directly related to Java Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their

format derived from JavaScript; hence the name JavaScript Object Notation It is a widely used format supported by many other programming languages.\n\n\nTranspilers\nMany websites are JavaScript-heavy, so transpilers have been created to convert code written in other languages, which can aid the development process [36]\n\n\nWebAssembly\nWebAssembly is a newer language with a bytecode format designed to complement JavaScript, especially the performance-critical portions of web page scripts All of the major JavaScript engines support WebAssembly, [113] which runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Taliban", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe word Taliban is Pashto, طَالِباَنْ (ṭālibān), meaning \"students\", the plural of ṭālib This is a loanword from Arabic طَالِبْ (ṭālib), using the Pashto plural ending -ān اَنْ [93] (In Arabic طَالِبَانْ (ṭālibān) means not \"students\" but rather \"two students\", as it is a dual form, the Arabic plural being طُلَّابْ (ṭullāb)—occasionally causing some confusion to Arabic speakers.) Since becoming a loanword in English, Taliban, besides a plural noun referring to the group, has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual For example, John Walker Lindh has been referred to as \"an American Taliban\" rather than \"an American Talib\" in domestic media This is different in Afghanistan, where a member or a supporter of the group is referred to as a Talib (طَالِبْ) or its plural Talib-ha (طَالِبْهَا) In other definitions, Taliban means 'seekers' [94]\n\n\nBackground\nAfter the Soviet Union intervened and occupied Afghanistan in 1979, Islamic mujahideen fighters waged a war against Soviet forces During the Soviet–Afghan War, nearly all of the Taliban's original leaders had fought for either the Hezb-i Islami Khalis or the Harakat-i Inqilab-e Islami factions of the Mujahideen [101]\n\n\nSoviet intervention in Afghanistan (1978–1992)\nAfter the Soviet Union intervened and occupied Afghanistan in 1979, Islamic mujahideen fighters waged a war against Soviet forces During the Soviet–Afghan War, nearly all of the Taliban's original leaders had fought for either the Hezb-i Islami Khalis or the Harakat-i Inqilab-e Islami factions of the Mujahideen [101]\n\n\nAfghan Civil War (1992–1996)\nIn April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet-backed régime of Mohammad Najibullah, many Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement, the Peshawar Accord, which created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, Hezbe Wahdat, and Ittihad-i Islami did not participate The state was paralysed from the start, due to rival groups contending for total power over Kabul and Afghanistan [103] [better source needed]\n\n\nHistory\nThe Taliban movement originated in Pashtun nationalism, and its ideological underpinnings are with that of broader Afghan society The Taliban's roots lie in the religious schools of Kandahar and were influenced significantly by foreign support, particularly from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, during the Soviet–Afghan War They emerged in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, capturing Kandahar and expanding their control across the country; they became involved in a war with the Northern Alliance The international response to the Taliban varied, with some countries providing support while others opposed and did not recognize their regime.\n\n\n2021 offensive and return to power\nIn mid 2021, the Taliban led a major offensive in Afghanistan during the withdrawal of US troops from the country, which gave them control of over half of Afghanistan's 421 districts as of 23 July 2021 [109] [110] By mid-August 2021, the Taliban controlled every major city in Afghanistan; following the near seizure of the capital Kabul, the Taliban occupied the Presidential Palace after the incumbent President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan to the United Arab Emirates [111] [112] Ghani's Asylum was confirmed by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on 18 August 2021 [113] [114] Remaining Afghan forces under the leadership of Amrullah Saleh, Ahmad Massoud, and Bismillah Khan Mohammadi retreated to Panjshir to continue resistance [115] [116] [117]\n\n\nIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan (2021–present)\nThe Taliban had \"seized power from an established government backed by some of the world's best-equipped militaries\"; and as an ideological insurgent movement dedicated to \"bringing about a truly Islamic state\" its victory has been compared to that of the  Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949 or Iranian Revolution of 1979, with their \"sweeping\" remake of society However, as of 2021–2022, senior Taliban leaders  have emphasized the \"softness\" of their revolution and how they desired \"good relations\" with the United States, in discussions with American journalist Jon Lee Anderson [88]\n\n\nCurrent education policy\nIn September 2021, the government ordered primary schools to reopen for both sexes and announced plans to reopen secondary schools for male students, without committing to do the same for female students [129] While the Taliban stated that female college students will be able to resume higher education provided that they are segregated from male students (and professors, when possible), [130] The Guardian noted that \"if the high schools do not reopen for girls, the commitments to allow university education would become meaningless once the current cohort of students graduated.\" [129] Higher Education Minister Abdul Baqi Haqqani said that female university students will be required to observe proper hijab, but did not specify if this required covering the face [130]\n\n\nIdeology and aims\nThe Taliban's ideology has been described as an \"innovative form of sharia combining Pashtun tribal codes\", [139] or Pashtunwali, with radical Deobandi interpretations of Islam favoured by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and its splinter groups [140] Their ideology was a departure from the Islamism of the anti-Soviet mujahideen rulers [clarification needed] and the radical Islamists [clarification needed] inspired by the Sayyid Qutb (Ikhwan) [141] The Taliban have said they aim to restore peace and security to Afghanistan, including Western troops leaving, and to enforce Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power [142] [143] [144]\n\n\nIdeological influences\nThe Taliban's religious/political philosophy, especially during its first régime from 1996 to 2001, was heavily advised and influenced by Grand Mufti Rashid Ahmed Ludhianvi and his works Its operating political and religious principles since its founding, however, was modelled on those of Abul A'la Maududi and the Jamaat-e-Islami movement [147]\n\n\nPashtun cultural influences\nThe Taliban, being largely Pashtun tribesmen, frequently follow a pre-Islamic cultural tribal code which is focused on preserving honour Pashtunwali strongly influences decisions in regards to other social matters It is best described as subconscious social values and attitudes which promote various qualities such as bravery, preserving honour, being hospitable to all guests, seeking revenge and justice if one has been wronged, and providing sanctuary to anyone who seeks refuge, even if it is an enemy However, non-Pashtuns and others usually criticize some of the values such as the Pashtun practice of equally dividing inheritances among sons, even though the Qur'an clearly states that women are supposed to receive one-half of a man's share [148] [149]\n\n\nIslamic rules under Deobandi philosophy\nWritten works published by the group's Commission of Cultural Affairs including Islami Adalat, De Mujahid Toorah –  De Jihad Shari Misalay, and Guidance to the Mujahideen outlined the core of the Taliban Islamic Movement's philosophy regarding jihad, sharia, organization, and conduct [151] The Taliban régime interpreted the Sharia law in accordance with the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of Mullah Omar [87] The Taliban, Mullah Omar in particular, emphasised dreams as a means of revelation [152] [153]\n\n\nProhibitions\nThe Taliban forbade the consumption of pork and alcohol, the use of many types of consumer technology such as music with instrumental accompaniments, [154] television, [154] filming, [154] and the Internet, as well as most forms of art such as paintings or photography, [154] participation in sports, [155] including football and chess; [155] Recreational activities such as kite-flying and the keeping of pigeons and other pets were also forbidden, and the birds were killed according to the Taliban's rules [155] Movie theatres were closed and repurposed as mosques [155] The celebration of the Western and Iranian New Years was also forbidden [156] Taking photographs and displaying pictures and portraits were also forbidden, because the Taliban considered them forms of idolatry [155] This extended even to \"blacking out illustrations on packages of baby soap in shops and painting over road-crossing signs for livestock [88]\n\n\nViews on the Bamyan Buddhas\nIn 1999, Mullah Omar issued a decree in which he called for the protection of the Buddha statues at Bamyan, two 6th-century monumental statues of standing buddhas which were carved into the side of a cliff in the Bamyan valley in the Hazarajat region of central Afghanistan But in March 2001, the Taliban destroyed the statues, following a decree by Mullah Omar which stated: \"all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed.\" [164]\n\n\nViews on bacha bazi\nThe Afghan custom of bacha bazi, a form of pederastic sexual slavery, child sexual abuse and pedophilia which is traditionally practiced in various provinces of Afghanistan between older men and young adolescent \"dancing boys\", was also forbidden under the six-year rule of the Taliban régime [166] Under the rule of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, it carried the death penalty [167] [168]\n\n\nAttitudes towards other Muslim communities\nUnlike other Islamic fundamentalist organizations, the Taliban are not Salafists Although wealthy Arab nations had brought Salafist Madrasas to Afghanistan during the Soviet war in the 1980s, the Taliban's strict Deobandi leadership suppressed the Salafi movement in Afghanistan after it first came to power in the 1990s Following the 2001 US invasion, the Taliban and Salafists joined forces in order to wage a common war against NATO forces, but Salafists were relegated to small groups which were under the Taliban's command [175]\n\n\nOpposition to Salafism\nFollowing the Taliban victory, a nationwide campaign was launched against influential Salafi factions suspected of past ties to the ISIS–K The Taliban closed most Salafi mosques and seminaries in 16 provinces, including Nangarhar, and detained clerics it accused of supporting the Islamic State [177] [178]\n\n\nShia Islam\nDuring the period of the first Taliban rule (1996 to 2001), the Taliban attempted to sway Shias, particularly Hazaras, to their side, making deals with a number of Shia political figures, as well as securing the support of some Shia religious scholars [179] One of these was Ustad Muhammad Akbari, a Shia Hazara politician who separated from Abdul-Ali Mazari's Islamic Unity Party to form the National Islamic Unity Party, thereafter politically aligning himself and his group, which gained the support of the majority of Islamic Unity Party members in the Hazara hinterland, [180] with the Taliban [181] Another significant Shia political figure in the administration of the first Islamic Emirate was Sayed Gardizi, a Sayed Hazara from Gardiz, who was appointed as the wuluswal (district governor) of Yakawlang district, being the only Shia to hold the position of district governor during the period of the first Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [182]\n\n\nConsistency of the Taliban's ideology\nThe Taliban's ideology is not static Before its capture of Kabul, members of the Taliban talked about stepping aside once a government of \"good Muslims\" took power and once law and order were restored The decision-making process of the Taliban in Kandahar was modelled on the Pashtun tribal council (jirga), together with what was believed to be the early Islamic model Discussion was followed by the building of a consensus by the believers [194]\n\n\nEvaluations and criticisms\nThe author Ahmed Rashid suggests that the devastation and hardship which resulted from the Soviet invasion and the period which followed it influenced the Taliban's ideology [197] It is said that the Taliban did not include scholars who were learned in Islamic law and history The refugee students, brought up in a totally male society, not only had no education in mathematics, science, history or geography, but also had no traditional skills of farming, herding, or handicraft-making, nor even knowledge of their tribal and clan lineages [197] In such an environment, war meant employment, peace meant unemployment Dominating women simply affirmed manhood For their leadership, rigid fundamentalism was a matter not only of principle, but also of political survival Taliban leaders \"repeatedly told\" Rashid that \"if they gave women greater freedom or a chance to go to school, they would lose the support of their rank and file.\" [198]\n\n\nCondemned practices\nThe Taliban have been internationally condemned for their harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law, which has resulted in their brutal treatment of many Afghans During their rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban enforced a strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law [87] The Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to 160,000 starving civilians, and conducted a policy of scorched earth, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes While the Taliban controlled Afghanistan, they banned activities and media including paintings, photography, and movies that depicted people or other living things They also prohibited music with instrumental accompaniments, with the exception of the daf, a type of frame drum [208] The Taliban prevented girls and young women from attending school, banned women from working jobs outside of healthcare (male doctors were prohibited from treating women), and required that women be accompanied by a male relative and wear a burqa at all times when in public If women broke certain rules, they were publicly whipped or executed [209] The Taliban harshly discriminated against religious and ethnic minorities during their rule and they have also committed a cultural genocide against the people of Afghanistan by destroying numerous monuments, including the famous 1500-year-old Buddhas of Bamiyan According to the United Nations, the Taliban and their allies were responsible for 76% of Afghan civilian casualties in 2010, and 80% in 2011 and 2012 [210] The group is internally funded by its involvement in the illegal drug trade which it participates in by producing and trafficking in narcotics such as heroin, [211] [212] extortion, and kidnapping for ransom [213] [214] They also seized control of mining operations in the mid-2010s that were illegal under the previous government [215]\n\n\nMassacre campaigns\nAccording to a 55-page report by the United Nations, the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001 They also said, that \" [t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the  [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself.\" \"These are the same type of war crimes as were committed in Bosnia and should be prosecuted in international courts\", one UN official was quoted as saying The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings Bin Laden's so-called 055 Brigade was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians The report by the United Nations quotes \"eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people\" The Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, in late 2011 stated that cruel behaviour under and by the Taliban had been \"necessary\" [216] [217] [218] [219]\n\n\nHuman trafficking\nSeveral Taliban and al-Qaeda commanders ran a network of human trafficking, abducting ethnic minority women and selling them into sex slavery in Afghanistan and Pakistan [235] Time magazine writes: \"The Taliban often argued that the restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of revering and protecting the opposite sex The behavior of the Taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in Afghanistan made a mockery of that claim.\" [235]\n\n\nOppression of women\nTo PHR's knowledge, no other régime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest, prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment [237]\n\nViolence against civilians\nAccording to the United Nations, the Taliban and its allies were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009, 75% in 2010 and 80% in 2011 [223] [259]\n\n\nDiscrimination against Hindus and Sikhs\nHindus and Sikhs have lived in Afghanistan since historic times and they were prominent minorities in Afghanistan, well-established in terms of academics and businesses [265] After the Afghan Civil War they started to migrate to India and other nations [266] After the Taliban established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, they imposed strict Sharia laws which discriminated against Hindus and Sikhs and caused the size of Afghanistan's Hindu and Sikh populations to fall at a very rapid rate because they emigrated from Afghanistan and established diasporas in the Western world [267] The Taliban issued decrees that forbade non-Muslims from building places of worship but allowed them to worship at existing holy sites, forbade non-Muslims from criticizing Muslims, ordered non-Muslims to identify their houses by placing a yellow cloth on their rooftops, forbade non-Muslims from living in the same residence as Muslims, and required that non-Muslim women wear a yellow dress with a special mark so that Muslims could keep their distance from them (Hindus and Sikhs were mainly targeted) [268] The Taliban announced in May 2001 that it would force Afghanistan's Hindu population to wear special badges, which has been compared to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany [269] In general, the Taliban treated the Sikhs better than Afghan Shiites, Hindus and Christians [270]\n\n\nRelationship with other religious groups\nAlong with Hindus, the small Christian community was also persecuted by the Taliban [271] Violence against Western aid workers and Christians was common during the Afghan conflict [272]\n\n\nRestrictions on modern education\nBefore the Taliban came to power, education was highly regarded in Afghanistan and Kabul University attracted students from Asia and the Middle East However, the Taliban imposed restrictions on modern education, banned the education of females, only allowed Islamic religious schools to stay open and only encouraged the teaching of the Qur'an Around half of all of the schools in Afghanistan were destroyed [283] The Taliban have carried out brutal attacks on teachers and students and they have also threatened parents and teachers [284]\nAs per a 1998 UNICEF report, 9 out of 10 girls and 2 out of 3 boys did not enroll in schools By 2000, fewer than 4–5% of all Afghan children were being educated at the primary school level and even fewer of them were being educated at higher secondary and university levels [283]\n\n\nCultural genocide\nThe Taliban have committed a cultural genocide against the Afghan people by destroying their historical and cultural texts, artifacts and sculptures [89]\n\n\nBan on entertainment and recreational activities\nDuring their first rule of Afghanistan which lasted from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned many recreational activities and games, such as association football, kite flying, and chess Mediums of entertainment such as televisions, cinemas, music with instrumental accompaniments, VCRs and satellite dishes were also banned [295] Also included on the list of banned items were \"musical instruments and accessories\" and all visual representation of living creatures [291] [296] [297] [298] However, the daf, a type of frame drum, wasn't banned [208]\n\n\nForced conscription and conscription of children\nAccording to the testimony of Guantanamo captives before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its civil service – both done at gunpoint [300] [301] [302]\n\n\nLeadership and organization\nAccording to Jon Lee Anderson the Taliban government is \"said to be profoundly divided\" between the Kandahar faction and the Haqqani network, with a mysterious dispearance of deputy Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar for \"several days\" in mid-September 2021 explained by rumours of injury after a brawl with other Taliban [88]  The Kandahar faction is named for the city that Mullah Omar came from and where he founded the Taliban, and is described as \"insular\" and \"rural\", interested \"primarily\" with \"ruling its home turf\" It includes Haibatullah Akhundzada, Mullah Yaqoob, Abdul Ghani Baradar (see below).\n\n\nCurrent leadership\nThe top members of the Taliban as an insurgency, as of August 2021, are: [304]\n\n\nOverview\nUntil his death in 2013, Mullah Mullah Omar was the supreme commander of the Taliban Mullah Akhtar Mansour was elected as his replacement in 2015, [306] and following Mansour's killing in a May 2016 US drone strike, Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada became the group's leader [307]\n\n\nOrganization and governance\nConsistent with the governance of the early Muslims was the absence of state institutions and the absence of \"a methodology for command and control\", both of which are standard today, even in non-Westernized states The Taliban did not issue press releases or policy statements, nor did they hold regular press conferences The basis for this structure was Grand Mufti Rashid Ahmed Ludhianvi's Obedience to the Amir, as he served as a mentor to the Taliban's leadership [314] The outside world and most Afghans did not even know what their leaders looked like, because photography was banned [315] The \"regular army\" resembled a lashkar or traditional tribal militia force with only 25,000 men (of whom 11,000 were non-Afghans).\n\n\nEconomic activities\nThe Kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the Taliban occupation (1996) But the Afghani soon fell in value They imposed a 50% tax on any company operating in the country, and those who failed to pay were attacked They also imposed a 6% import tax on anything brought into the country, and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade By 2001, the per capita income of the 25 million population was under $200, and the country was close to total economic collapse As of 2007 the economy had begun to recover, with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13% increase in economic growth [244] [317] [318] [319] [320] [321]\n\n\nInternational relations\nDuring the war, the Taliban were supported by several militant outfits which include the Haqqani network, Al-Qaeda and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan Several countries like China, Iran, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia and Saudi Arabia allegedly support the Taliban [citation needed] However, all of their governments deny providing any support to the Taliban Likewise, the Taliban also deny receiving any foreign support from any country [344] At its peak, formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban's government was acknowledged by three nations: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates In the past, the United Arab Emirates and Turkmenistan were also alleged to have provided support to the Taliban It is designated by some countries as a terrorist organization.\n\n\nDesignation as a terrorist organization\nThe Taliban movement is officially illegal in the following countries to date:\n\n\nUnited Nations and NGOs\nDespite the aid of United Nations (UN) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) given (see § Afghanistan during Taliban rule), the Taliban's attitude in 1996–2001 toward the UN and NGOs was often one of suspicion The UN did not recognise the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, most foreign donors and aid workers were non-Muslims, and the Taliban vented fundamental objections to the sort of 'help' the UN offered As the Taliban's Attorney General Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada put it in 1997:\n\n\nIn popular media\nThe Taliban were portrayed in Khaled Hosseini's popular 2003 novel The Kite Runner [380] and its 2007 film adaption The Taliban have also been portrayed in American film, most notably in Lone Survivor (2013) which is based on a real-life story [citation needed] Hindi cinema have also portrayed the Taliban in Kabul Express (2006), [381] and Escape from Taliban (2003) which is based on a real-life novel A Kabuliwala's Bengali Wife, [382] whose author Sushmita Banerjee was shot dead by the Taliban in 2013 [383]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

The group's name, \"Taliban,\" is derived from the Pashto language, meaning \"students,\" and refers to the group's origins as a movement of Islamic students and scholars.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe word Taliban is Pashto, طَالِباَنْ (ṭālibān), meaning \"students,\" the plural of طَالِبْ (ṭālib), which is a loanword from Arabic. This is a departure from the Arabic dual form, طَالِبَانْ (ṭālibān), which means \"two students.\" The group's name has also been used as a singular noun, referring to an individual, particularly in the context of Western media.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Taliban movement emerged in the aftermath of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in 1979. Islamic mujahideen fighters waged a war against Soviet forces, and the Taliban's original leaders had fought for either the Hezb-i Islami Khalis or the Harakat-i Inqilab-e Islami factions of the Mujahideen.\n\n**Soviet Intervention in Afghanistan (1978-1992)**\n\nAfter the Soviet Union intervened and occupied Afghanistan in 1979, Islamic mujahideen fighters waged a war against Soviet forces. During the Soviet-Afghan War, nearly all of the Taliban's original leaders had fought for either the Hezb-i Islami Khalis or the Harakat-i Inqilab-e Islami factions of the Mujahideen.\n\n**Afghan Civil War (1992-1996)**\n\nIn April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet-backed régime of Mohammad Najibullah, many Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement, the Peshawar Accord, which created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period. However, the state was paralyzed from the start, due to rival groups contending for total power over Kabul and Afghanistan.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Taliban movement originated in Pashtun nationalism, and its ideological underpinnings are with that of broader Afghan society. The Taliban's roots lie in the religious schools of Kandahar and were influenced significantly by foreign support, particularly from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, during the Soviet-Afghan War. They emerged in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, capturing Kandahar and expanding their control across the country. The group became involved in a war with the Northern Alliance, and the international response to the Taliban varied, with some countries providing support while others opposed and did not recognize their regime.\n\n**2021 Offensive and Return to Power**\n\nIn mid-2021, the Taliban led a major offensive in Afghanistan during the withdrawal of US troops from the country, which gave them control of over half of Afghanistan's 421 districts. By mid-August 2021, the Taliban controlled every major city in Afghanistan, and following the near seizure of the capital Kabul, the Taliban occupied the Presidential Palace after the incumbent President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n**Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (2021-Present)**\n\nThe Taliban had \"seized power from an established government backed by some of the world's best-equipped militaries\"; and as an ideological insurgent movement dedicated to \"bringing about a truly Islamic state,\" its victory has been compared to that of the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949 or Iranian Revolution of 1979, with their \"sweeping\" remake of society.\n\n**Ideology and Aims**\n\nThe Taliban's ideology has been described as an \"innovative form of sharia combining Pashtun tribal codes.\" Their ideology was a departure from the Islamism of the anti-Soviet mujahideen rulers and the radical Islamists inspired by the Sayyid Qutb (Ikhwan). The Taliban have said they aim to restore peace and security to Afghanistan, including Western troops leaving, and to enforce Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power.\n\n**Ideological Influences**\n\nThe Taliban's religious/political philosophy, especially during its first régime from 1996 to 2001, was heavily advised and influenced by Grand Mufti Rashid Ahmed Ludhianvi and his works. Its operating political and religious principles since its founding, however, were modeled on those of Abul A'la Maududi and the Jamaat-e-Islami movement.\n\n**Pashtun Cultural Influences**\n\nThe Taliban, being largely Pashtun tribesmen, frequently follow a pre-Islamic cultural tribal code that is focused on preserving honor. Pashtunwali strongly influences decisions in regards to other social matters. It is best described as subconscious social values and attitudes that promote various qualities such as bravery, preserving honor, being hospitable to all guests, seeking revenge and justice if one has been wronged, and providing sanctuary to anyone who seeks refuge, even if it is an enemy.\n\n**Islamic Rules Under Deobandi Philosophy**\n\nThe Taliban régime interpreted the Sharia law in accordance with the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of Mullah Omar. The Taliban forbade the consumption of pork and alcohol, the use of many types of consumer technology such as music with instrumental accompaniments, television, filming, and the Internet. They also prohibited most forms of art, including paintings or photography, participation in sports, and recreational activities such as kite-flying and keeping pigeons.\n\n**Prohibitions**\n\nThe Taliban forbade many activities and media, including paintings, photography, and movies that depicted people or other living things. They also prohibited music with instrumental accompaniments, with the exception of the daf, a type of frame drum. Mediums of entertainment such as televisions, cinemas, VCRs, and satellite dishes were also banned.\n\n**Violence Against Civilians**\n\nThe Taliban and its allies were responsible for 76% of civilian casualtie", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Taliban\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word Taliban is Pashto, طَالِباَنْ (ṭālibān), meaning \"students\", the plural of ṭālib This is a loanword from Arabic طَالِبْ (ṭālib), using the Pashto plural ending -ān اَنْ [93] (In Arabic طَالِبَانْ (ṭālibān) means not \"students\" but rather \"two students\", as it is a dual form, the Arabic plural being طُلَّابْ (ṭullāb)—occasionally causing some confusion to Arabic speakers.) Since becoming a loanword in English, Taliban, besides a plural noun referring to the group, has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual For example, John Walker Lindh has been referred to as \"an American Taliban\" rather than \"an American Talib\" in domestic media This is different in Afghanistan, where a member or a supporter of the group is referred to as a Talib (طَالِبْ) or its plural Talib-ha (طَالِبْهَا) In other definitions, Taliban means 'seekers' [94]\n\n\nBackground\nAfter the Soviet Union intervened and occupied Afghanistan in 1979, Islamic mujahideen

countries providing support while others opposed and did not recognize their regime.\n\n\n2021 offensive and return to power\nIn mid 2021, the Taliban led a major offensive in Afghanistan during the withdrawal of US troops from the country, which gave them control of over half of Afghanistan's 421 districts as of 23 July 2021 [109] [110] By mid-August 2021, the Taliban controlled every major city in Afghanistan; following the near seizure of the capital Kabul, the Taliban occupied the Presidential Palace after the incumbent President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan to the United Arab Emirates [111] [112] Ghani's Asylum was confirmed by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on 18 August 2021 [113] [114] Remaining Afghan forces under the leadership of Amrullah Saleh, Ahmad Massoud, and Bismillah Khan Mohammadi retreated to Panjshir to continue resistance [115] [116] [117]\n\n\nIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan (2021–present)\nThe Taliban had \"seized power from an established government backed by some of the world's best-equipped militaries\"; and as an ideological insurgent movement dedicated to \"bringing about a truly Islamic state\" its victory has been compared to that of the  Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949 or Iranian Revolution of 1979, with their \"sweeping\" remake of society However, as of 2021–2022, senior Taliban leaders  have emphasized the \"softness\" of their revolution and how they desired \"good relations\" with the United States, in discussions with American journalist Jon Lee Anderson [88]\n\n\nCurrent education policy\nIn September 2021, the government ordered primary schools to reopen for both sexes and announced plans to reopen secondary schools for male students, without committing to do the same for female students [129] While the Taliban stated that female college students will be able to resume higher education provided that they are segregated from male students (and professors, when possible), [130] The Guardian noted that \"if the high schools do not reopen for girls, the commitments to allow university education would become meaningless once the current cohort of students graduated.\" [129] Higher Education Minister Abdul Baqi Haqqani said that female university students will be required to observe proper hijab, but did not specify if this required covering the face [130]\n\n\nIdeology and aims\nThe Taliban's ideology has been described as an \"innovative form of sharia combining Pashtun tribal codes\", [139] or Pashtunwali, with radical Deobandi interpretations of Islam favoured by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and its splinter groups [140] Their ideology was a departure from the Islamism of the anti-Soviet mujahideen rulers [clarification needed] and the radical Islamists [clarification needed] inspired by the Sayyid Qutb (Ikhwan) [141] The Taliban have said they aim to restore peace and security to Afghanistan, including Western troops leaving, and to

heavily advised and influenced by Grand Mufti Rashid Ahmed Ludhianvi and his works Its operating political and religious principles since its founding, however, was modelled on those of Abul A'la

preserving honour Pashtunwali strongly influences decisions in regards to other social matters It is best described as subconscious social values and attitudes which promote various qualities such as bravery, preserving honour, being hospitable to all guests, seeking revenge and justice if one has been wronged, and providing sanctuary to anyone who seeks refuge, even if it is an enemy However, non-Pashtuns and others usually criticize some of the values such as the Pashtun practice of equally dividing inheritances among sons, even though the Qur'an clearly states that women are supposed to receive one-half of a man's share [148] [149]\n\n\nIslamic rules under Deobandi philosophy\nWritten works published by the group's Commission of Cultural Affairs including Islami Adalat, De Mujahid Toorah –  De Jihad Shari Misalay, and Guidance to the Mujahideen outlined the core of the Taliban Islamic Movement's philosophy regarding jihad, sharia, organization, and conduct [151] The Taliban régime interpreted the Sharia law in accordance with the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of Mullah Omar [87] The Taliban, Mullah Omar in particular, emphasised dreams as a means of revelation [152] [153]\n\n\nProhibitions\nThe Taliban forbade the consumption of pork and alcohol, the use of many types of consumer technology such as music with instrumental accompaniments, [154] television, [154] filming, [154] and the Internet, as well as most forms of art such as paintings or photography, [154] participation in sports, [155] including football and chess; [155] Recreational activities such as kite-flying and the keeping of pigeons and other pets were also forbidden, and the birds were killed according to the Taliban's rules [155] Movie theatres were closed and repurposed as mosques [155] The celebration of the Western and Iranian New Years was also forbidden [156] Taking photographs and displaying pictures and portraits were also forbidden, because the Taliban considered them forms of idolatry [155] This extended even to \"blacking out illustrations on packages of baby soap in shops and painting over road-crossing signs for livestock [88]\n\n\nViews on the Bamyan Buddhas\nIn 1999, Mullah Omar issued a decree in which he called for the protection of the Buddha statues at Bamyan, two 6th-century monumental statues of standing buddhas which were carved into the side of a cliff in the Bamyan valley in the Hazarajat region of central Afghanistan But in March 2001, the Taliban destroyed the statues, following a decree by Mullah Omar which stated: \"all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed.\" [164]\n\n\nViews on bacha bazi\nThe Afghan custom of bacha bazi, a form of pederastic sexual slavery, child sexual abuse and pedophilia which is traditionally practiced in various provinces of Afghanistan between older men and young adolescent \"dancing boys\", was also forbidden under the six-year rule of the Taliban régime [166] Under the rule of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, it carried the death penalty [167] [168]\n\n\nAttitudes towards other Muslim communities\nUnlike other Islamic fundamentalist organizations, the Taliban are not Salafists Although wealthy Arab nations had brought Salafist Madrasas to Afghanistan during the Soviet war in the 1980s, the Taliban's strict Deobandi leadership suppressed the Salafi movement in Afghanistan after it first came to power in the 1990s Following the 2001 US invasion, the Taliban and Salafists joined forces in order to wage a common war against NATO forces, but Salafists were relegated to small groups which were under the Taliban's command [175]\n\n\nOpposition to Salafism\nFollowing the Taliban victory, a nationwide campaign was launched against influential Salafi factions suspected of past ties to the ISIS–K The Taliban closed most Salafi mosques and seminaries in 16 provinces, including Nangarhar, and detained clerics it accused of supporting the Islamic State [177] [178]\n\n\nShia Islam\nDuring the period of the first Taliban rule (1996 to 2001), the Taliban attempted to sway Shias, particularly Hazaras, to their side, making deals with a number of Shia political figures, as well as securing the support of some Shia religious scholars [179] One of these was Ustad Muhammad Akbari, a Shia Hazara politician who separated from Abdul-Ali Mazari's Islamic Unity Party to form the National Islamic Unity Party, thereafter politically aligning himself and his group, which gained the support of the majority of Islamic Unity Party members in the Hazara hinterland, [180] with the Taliban [181] Another significant Shia political figure in the administration of the first Islamic Emirate was Sayed Gardizi, a Sayed Hazara from Gardiz, who was appointed as the wuluswal (district governor) of Yakawlang district, being the only Shia to hold the position of district governor during the period of the first Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [182]\n\n\nConsistency of the Taliban's ideology\nThe Taliban's ideology is not static Before its capture of Kabul, members of the Taliban talked about stepping aside once a government of \"good Muslims\" took power and once law and order were restored The decision-making process of the Taliban in Kandahar was modelled on the Pashtun tribal council (jirga), together with what was believed to be the early Islamic model Discussion was followed by the building of a consensus by the believers [194]\n\n\nEvaluations and criticisms\nThe author Ahmed Rashid suggests that the devastation and hardship which resulted from the Soviet invasion and the period which followed it influenced the Taliban's ideology [197] It is said that the Taliban did not include scholars who were learned in Islamic law and history The refugee students, brought up in a totally male society, not only had no education in mathematics, science, history or geography, but also had no traditional skills of farming, herding, or handicraft-making, nor even knowledge of their tribal and clan lineages [197] In such an environment, war meant employment, peace meant unemployment Dominating women simply affirmed manhood For their leadership, rigid fundamentalism was a matter not only of principle, but also of political survival Taliban leaders \"repeatedly told\" Rashid that \"if they gave women greater freedom or a chance to go to school, they would lose the support of their rank and file.\" [198]\n\n\nCondemned practices\nThe Taliban have been internationally condemned for their harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law, which has resulted in their brutal treatment of many Afghans During their rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban enforced a strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law [87] The Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to 160,000 starving civilians, and conducted a policy of scorched earth, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes While the Taliban controlled Afghanistan, they banned activities and media including paintings, photography, and movies that depicted people or other living things They also prohibited music with instrumental accompaniments, with the exception of the daf, a type of frame drum [208] The Taliban prevented girls and young women from attending school, banned women from working jobs outside of healthcare (male doctors were prohibited from treating women), and required that women be accompanied by a male relative and wear a burqa at all times when in public If women broke certain rules, they were publicly whipped or executed [209] The Taliban harshly discriminated against religious and ethnic minorities during their rule and they have also committed a cultural genocide against the people of Afghanistan by destroying numerous monuments, including the famous 1500-year-old Buddhas of Bamiyan According to the United Nations, the Taliban and their allies were responsible for 76% of Afghan civilian casualties in 2010, and 80% in 2011 and 2012 [210] The group is internally funded by its involvement in the illegal drug trade which it participates in by producing and trafficking in narcotics such as heroin, [211] [212] extortion, and kidnapping for ransom [213] [214] They also seized control of mining operations in the mid-2010s that were illegal under the previous government [215]\n\n\nMassacre campaigns\nAccording to a 55-page report by the United Nations, the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001 They also said, that \" [t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the  [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself.\" \"These are the same type of war crimes as were committed in Bosnia and should be prosecuted in international courts\", one UN official was quoted as saying The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings Bin Laden's so-called 055 Brigade was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians The report by the United Nations quotes \"eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people\" The Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, in late 2011 stated that cruel behaviour under and by the Taliban had been \"necessary\" [216] [217] [218] [219]\n\n\nHuman trafficking\nSeveral Taliban and al-Qaeda commanders ran a network of human trafficking, abducting ethnic minority women and selling them into sex slavery in Afghanistan and Pakistan [235] Time magazine writes: \"The Taliban often argued that the restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of revering and protecting the opposite sex The behavior of the Taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in Afghanistan made a mockery of that claim.\" [235]\n\n\nOppression of women\nTo PHR's knowledge, no other régime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest, prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment [237]\n\nViolence against civilians\nAccording to the United Nations, the Taliban and its allies were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009, 75% in 2010 and 80% in 2011 [223] [259]\n\n\nDiscrimination against Hindus and Sikhs\nHindus and Sikhs have lived in Afghanistan since historic times and they were prominent minorities in Afghanistan, well-established in terms of academics and businesses [265] After the Afghan Civil War they started to migrate to India and other nations [266] After the Taliban established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, they imposed strict Sharia laws which discriminated against Hindus and Sikhs and caused the size of Afghanistan's Hindu and Sikh populations to fall at a very rapid rate because they emigrated from Afghanistan and established diasporas in the Western world [267] The Taliban issued decrees that forbade non-Muslims from building places of worship but allowed them to worship at existing holy sites, forbade non-Muslims from criticizing Muslims, ordered non-Muslims to identify their houses by placing a yellow cloth on their rooftops, forbade non-Muslims from living in the same residence as Muslims, and required that non-Muslim women wear a yellow dress with a special mark so that Muslims could keep their distance from them (Hindus and Sikhs were mainly targeted) [268] The Taliban announced in May 2001 that it would force Afghanistan's Hindu population to wear special badges, which has been compared to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany [269] In general, the Taliban treated the Sikhs better than Afghan Shiites, Hindus and Christians [270]\n\n\nRelationship with other religious groups\nAlong with Hindus, the small Christian community was also persecuted by the Taliban [271] Violence against Western aid workers and Christians was common during the Afghan conflict [272]\n\n\nRestrictions on modern education\nBefore the Taliban came to power, education was highly regarded in Afghanistan and Kabul University attracted students from Asia and the Middle East However, the Taliban imposed restrictions on modern education, banned the education of females, only allowed Islamic religious schools to stay open and only encouraged the teaching of the Qur'an Around half of all of the schools in Afghanistan were destroyed [283] The Taliban have carried out brutal attacks on teachers and students and they have also threatened parents and teachers [284]\nAs per a 1998 UNICEF report, 9 out of 10 girls and 2 out of 3 boys did not enroll in schools By 2000, fewer than 4–5% of all Afghan children were being educated at the primary school level and even fewer of them were being educated at higher secondary and university levels [283]\n\n\nCultural genocide\nThe Taliban have committed a cultural genocide against the Afghan people by destroying their historical and cultural texts, artifacts and sculptures [89]\n\n\nBan on entertainment and recreational activities\nDuring their first rule of Afghanistan which lasted from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned many recreational activities and games, such as association football, kite flying, and chess Mediums of entertainment such as televisions, cinemas, music with instrumental accompaniments, VCRs and satellite dishes were also banned [295] Also included on the list of banned items were \"musical instruments and accessories\" and all visual representation of living creatures [291] [296] [297] [298] However, the daf, a type of frame drum, wasn't banned [208]\n\n\nForced conscription and conscription of children\nAccording to the testimony of Guantanamo captives before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its civil service – both done at gunpoint [300] [301] [302]\n\n\nLeadership and organization\nAccording to Jon Lee Anderson the Taliban government is \"said to be profoundly divided\" between the Kandahar faction and the Haqqani network, with a mysterious dispearance of deputy Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar for \"several days\" in mid-September 2021 explained by rumours of injury after a brawl with other Taliban [88]  The Kandahar faction is named for the city that Mullah Omar came from and where he founded the Taliban, and is described as \"insular\" and \"rural\", interested \"primarily\" with \"ruling its home turf\" It includes Haibatullah Akhundzada, Mullah Yaqoob, Abdul Ghani Baradar (see below).\n\n\nCurrent leadership\nThe top members of the Taliban as an insurgency, as of August 2021, are: [304]\n\n\nOverview\nUntil his death in 2013, Mullah Mullah Omar was the supreme commander of the Taliban Mullah Akhtar Mansour was elected as his replacement in 2015, [306] and following Mansour's killing in a May 2016 US drone strike, Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada became the group's leader [307]\n\n\nOrganization and governance\nConsistent with the governance of the early Muslims was the absence of state institutions and the absence of \"a methodology for command and control\", both of which are standard today, even in non-Westernized states The Taliban did not issue press releases or policy statements, nor did they hold regular press conferences The basis for this structure was Grand Mufti Rashid Ahmed Ludhianvi's Obedience to the Amir, as he served as a mentor to the Taliban's leadership [314] The outside world and most Afghans did not even know what their leaders looked like, because photography was banned [315] The \"regular army\" resembled a lashkar or traditional tribal militia force with only 25,000 men (of whom 11,000 were non-Afghans).\n\n\nEconomic activities\nThe Kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the Taliban occupation (1996) But the Afghani soon fell in value They imposed a 50% tax on any company operating in the country, and those who failed to pay were attacked They also imposed a 6% import tax on anything brought into the country, and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade By 2001, the per capita income of the 25 million population was under $200, and the country was close to total economic collapse As of 2007 the economy had begun to recover, with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13% increase in economic growth [244] [317] [318] [319] [320] [321]\n\n\nInternational relations\nDuring the war, the Taliban were supported by several militant outfits which include the Haqqani network, Al-Qaeda and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan Several countries like China, Iran, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia and Saudi Arabia allegedly support the Taliban [citation needed] However, all of their governments deny providing any support to the Taliban Likewise, the Taliban also deny receiving any foreign support from any country [344] At its peak, formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban's government was acknowledged by three nations: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates In the past, the United Arab Emirates and Turkmenistan were also alleged to have provided support to the Taliban It is designated by some countries as a terrorist organization.\n\n\nDesignation as a terrorist organization\nThe Taliban movement is officially illegal in the following countries to date:\n\n\nUnited Nations and NGOs\nDespite the aid of United Nations (UN) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) given (see § Afghanistan during Taliban rule), the Taliban's attitude in 1996–2001 toward the UN and NGOs was often one of suspicion The UN did not recognise the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, most foreign donors and aid workers were non-Muslims, and the Taliban vented fundamental objections to the sort of 'help' the UN offered As the Taliban's Attorney General Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada put it in 1997:\n\n\nIn popular media\nThe Taliban were portrayed in Khaled Hosseini's popular 2003 novel The Kite Runner [380] and its 2007 film adaption The Taliban have also been portrayed in American film, most notably in Lone Survivor (2013) which is based on a real-life story [citation needed] Hindi cinema have also portrayed the Taliban in Kabul Express (2006), [381] and Escape from Taliban (2003) which is based on a real-life novel A Kabuliwala's Bengali Wife, [382] whose author Sushmita Banerjee was shot dead by the Taliban in 2013 [383]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

the Ministry of Defence was planning to acquire 52 aircraft by 2020, and another 150–160 by 2025 Additionally, export orders for 250–300 FGFA were expected to begin in 2017 [54] [55]\n\n\nFurther developments\nIn 2004, Sukhoi anticipated that the Su-57 could become the basis for a family of combat aircraft for the Russian Aerospace Forces, similar to the Su-27 family [26] Under the program name Megapolis (Russian: Мегаполис, lit. 'Megapolis'), the company is developing a new variant, designated Su-57M, that augments the base Su-57 design with improved mission systems, reliability and maintenance enhancements, incorporation of electromechanical drives, and the new NPO Saturn izdeliye 30, or AL-51F-1 engines.\n\n\nDesign\nThe Su-57 is a fifth-generation multirole fighter aircraft and the first operational stealth aircraft for the Russian armed forces In addition to stealth, the fighter emphasizes supermaneuverability in all aircraft axes, capacious internal payload bays for multirole versatility, and advanced sensor systems such as active phased-array radar as well as the integration of these systems to achieve high levels of automation [23] [83]\n\n\nStealth\nThe first aircraft in Russian military service to emphasize stealth, the Su-57 employs a variety of methods to reduce its radar signature Similar to other stealth fighters such as the F-22, the aircraft aligns the planform edges to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS); the leading and trailing edges of the wings and control surfaces and the serrated edges of skin panels are carefully angled to reduce the number of directions the radar waves can be reflected Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft's stealthy shape, while radar absorbent material (RAM) coatings absorb radar emissions and reduce the reflection back to the source.\n\n\nEngines\nThe Su-57 is powered by a pair of NPO Lyulka-Saturn izdeliye 117, or AL-41F1, augmented turbofans [105] The engine is a highly improved and uprated variant of the AL-31 and produces 9 tonnes (88.3 kN, 19,840 lbf) of dry thrust, 14.5 tonnes (142.2 kN, 31,970 lbf) of thrust in afterburner, and 15 tonnes (147.1 kN, 33,070 lbf) of thrust in \"special\" emergency power The engines have full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and are integrated into the flight control system to facilitate maneuverability and handling [106] [87] The AL-41F1 is closely related to the Lyulka-Saturn izdeliye 117S engine, or AL-41F1S, used by the Su-35S, with the latter's separate engine control system being the key difference [107]\n\n\nArmament\nThe Su-57 has two tandem main internal weapon bays each approximately 4.4 m (14.4 ft) long and 0.9 m (3.0 ft) wide and two side weapon bays with triangular section fairings under the fuselage near the wing root [112] The main bays have two types of ejection launchers made by Vympel, the UVKU-50L for missiles weighing up to 300 kg (660 lb), and the UVKU-50U for ordnance weighing up to 700 kg (1,500 lb); the side bays use the VPU-50 launch rails [113] [114]\n\n\nCockpit\nThe Su-57 has a glass cockpit with no analogue gauges; information is displayed on two 38 cm (15 in) main multi-functional LCD displays similar to the arrangement of the Su-35S Supplementing the primary display is a smaller multi-functional display and digital control panel The cockpit has a wide-angle (30° by 22°) head-up display (HUD) Primary controls are the joystick and a pair of throttles, with all major functions controlled with hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS) [123] [124] The aircraft uses a two-piece canopy, with the aft section sliding forward and locking into place The canopy is treated with metallized coatings to reduce the aircraft's radar signature [citation needed] The Su-57 integrated computer system at Chip \"1890VM8Ya\" – FGU FSC NIISI (in Russian) [clarification needed] [125] [126] [127]\n\n\nAvionics\nOne of the main technical goals of the PAK FA programme is to achieve total integration of avionics systems, or sensor fusion, increase the pilot's situational awareness and reduce workload Integration of the Su-57's onboard systems is controlled by an IUS (Russian: ИУС, short for: Информационно-управляющая система, lit. 'Information Management System'), with its computer system developed by GRPZ from Ryazan The main avionics systems are the Sh-121 (Russian: Ш-121) multifunctional integrated radio electronic system (MIRES) and the 101KS \"Atoll\" (Russian: 101КС \"Атолл\") electro-optical system [131] In a departure from prior Sukhoi aircraft, the IUS systems integration was performed by Sukhoi itself rather than RPKB of Ramenskoye The integrated avionics suite, called IMA BK (Russian: ИМА БК, short for: Интегрированной модульной авионики боевых комплексов, lit. 'Integrated Modular Avionics Combat Systems'), uses fibre optic channels and runs on over 4 million lines of code [132] [133] [123]\n\n\nOperational history\nEven before the first flight of the T-50 prototype, several subsystems were tested on other aircraft for validation and risk reduction; an Su-27M was used to test the AL-41F1 engine on 21 January 2010, while another tested the KSU-50 flight control system [149] The T-50 prototype conducted its first high speed taxi run on 21 January 2010 and had its maiden flight several days later on 29 January 2010 [42] First supersonic flight occurred on 14 March 2011 at a test range near Komsomolsk-on-Amur [92]\n\n\nTesting and trials\nEven before the first flight of the T-50 prototype, several subsystems were tested on other aircraft for validation and risk reduction; an Su-27M was used to test the AL-41F1 engine on 21 January 2010, while another tested the KSU-50 flight control system [149] The T-50 prototype conducted its first high speed taxi run on 21 January 2010 and had its maiden flight several days later on 29 January 2010 [42] First supersonic flight occurred on 14 March 2011 at a test range near Komsomolsk-on-Amur [92]\n\n\nSyrian combat evaluation\nOn 21 February 2018, two Su-57s performed their first international flight as they were spotted landing at the Russian Khmeimim air base in Syria The aircraft were deployed along with four Sukhoi Su-35 fighters, four Sukhoi Su-25s, and one Beriev A-50 AEW&C aircraft [170] Three days later two more Su-57s were reported to have arrived in Syria [171] The deployment was criticised by some experts as overly risky, especially after reports of drone attacks at Khmeimim air base, as well as having limited value due to the short duration of only several days As the deployment overlapped with Russia's Defender of the Fatherland Day, the purpose may have been to support the president's state-of-the-nation speech Additionally, deployment of the aircraft in a combat theatre may serve to enhance the aircraft's marketing [172] [173] [174] [175] On 1 March 2018, the Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu stated that the two Su-57s had spent two days in Syria and successfully completed a trials program, including combat trials during which parameters of weapons work were monitored [176] [177] On 25 May 2018, the Defence Ministry disclosed that during the February 2018 deployment to Syria, a Su-57 fired a cruise missile in combat, likely a Kh-59MK2 [178] On 18 November 2018, the Defence Ministry posted an extended video of the fighters' flights, and announced that Su-57 performed 10 flights during its deployment to Syria [179] [180] However, the video did not specify when the test flights took place [181]\n\n\nEntry into service\nOn 25 December 2020, the Russian Defence Ministry announced that the Su-57 had entered service upon the delivery of the first production aircraft to one of the aviation regiments of the Southern Military District at Lipetsk This initial production batch would be used for military evaluation, tactics development, and crew conversion training The first operational unit to be equipped with the Su-57 is the 23rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment based in Dzyomgi in the Eastern Military District, with deliveries to begin in 2023; the colocation of the unit with the KnAAZ aircraft manufacturing plant enables easier support for newly introduced aircraft [2] The first fully operational Su-57 regiment of 24 aircraft is expected to be equipped by 2025 [183] [184]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nIn May 2022, Russian sources claimed that Su-57 fighters were used two or three weeks after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, striking targets with missiles outside of the zone of activity of Ukrainian air defenses, [185] just like other Russian aircraft that are also restricted mainly to Russian airspace [186]\n\n\nPotential operators\nIn the early stages of the PAK FA programme, India had planned to be one of the largest foreign customers by procuring the FGFA derivative It originally planned on buying 166 single-seat and 48 two-seat fighters, [206] but later changed it to 214 single-seat fighters, [207] and later reduced its purchase to 144 fighters by 2012 [208] In April 2018, India pulled out of the FGFA project, which it believed did not meet its requirements for stealth, combat avionics, radars and sensors by that time [34] [209] Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa, during an interview with Russian Ministry of Defence's official newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), stated that the Su-57 is currently not being considered for the service, but the aircraft can be evaluated once it enters service with the Russian Aerospace Forces [210] [211] The General Director of the United Aircraft Corporation Yuri Slyusar however denied the previous reports saying \"the topic is not closed\" and that Russia and India are still discussing the creation of the fifth-generation fighter [212] [213] However, in October 2019, the Indian Air Force Chief of Air Staff RKS Bhadauria stated that the country will not be importing stealth fighters like the Su-57, and will instead focus on indigenous efforts such as the HAL AMCA [214]\n\n\nVariants\nIn 2008, UAC president Alexei Fedorov has said that any decision on applying fifth-generation technologies to produce a smaller fighter (comparable to the F-35) must wait until after the development of the PAK FA is completed [247]\n\n\nOther versions\nIn 2008, UAC president Alexei Fedorov has said that any decision on applying fifth-generation technologies to produce a smaller fighter (comparable to the F-35) must wait until after the development of the PAK FA is completed [247]\n\n\nOperators\nOn 10 June 2014, the fifth flying prototype, aircraft T-50-5, was severely damaged by an engine fire after landing The pilot managed to escape unharmed The aircraft was subsequently written off, and its salvageable parts were cannibalized to finish the sixth \"first stage\" prototype, which was then given the fifth prototype's bort number and its designation changed from T-50-6-1 to T-50-5R However, official accounting still considers the two aircraft to be the \"same\" one [48]\n\n\nAccidents\nOn 10 June 2014, the fifth flying prototype, aircraft T-50-5, was severely damaged by an engine fire after landing The pilot managed to escape unharmed The aircraft was subsequently written off, and its salvageable parts were cannibalized to finish the sixth \"first stage\" prototype, which was then given the fifth prototype's bort number and its designation changed from T-50-6-1 to T-50-5R However, official accounting still considers the two aircraft to be the \"same\" one [48]\n\n\nSpecifications (Su-57)\nData from Rosoboronexport, [265] [better source needed] Aviation Week, [266] Key Aero, [267] Crecy Publishing [268]\n\nNotable appearances in media\nThe Su-57 appears in the 2022 film Top Gun: Maverick as the aircraft used by the unnamed hostile nation, where it is referred to as \"fifth-generation fighter\" [274] The Su-57 is a flyable aircraft in several entries of the aerial combat game series Ace Combat [275] [276]\n\n\nSee also\n\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Sukhoi Su-57**\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-57 is a fifth-generation stealth multirole fighter aircraft developed by Russia's Sukhoi Aviation Corporation. It is the first operational stealth aircraft in Russian service and represents a significant improvement over previous Sukhoi designs. The Su-57 is designed to perform a variety of tasks, including air superiority, ground attack, and reconnaissance, making it a versatile and highly capable aircraft.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Soviet Union began exploring the concept of a next-generation fighter aircraft, which would eventually become the PAK FA (Prospective Airborne Complex of Frontline Aviation). This program aimed to create a multirole fighter with advanced capabilities, including stealth, supermaneuverability, and avionics. Sukhoi, one of the leading Russian aerospace companies, was tasked with developing the PAK FA, which would eventually become the Su-57.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe development of the PAK FA program began in the early 1980s, with conceptual work starting in 1983. Sukhoi and other Russian aerospace companies, including the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association (NAPO) and the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAZ), worked together to design and develop the aircraft. The program was initially intended to produce 60 aircraft, with the first prototype expected to fly in 2005.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nThe research and development program for the Su-57 was called Stolitsa, with Alexander Davidenko selected as the chief designer at Sukhoi in 2002. The Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association (NAPO) and Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAZ) would manufacture the aircraft, with KnAAZ performing final assembly at Komsomol'sk-on-Amur. A competition was held in 2003 to select companies for the development of the avionics suite, with Tekhnokompleks Scientific and Production Center, Ramenskoye Instrument Building Design Bureau, and others selected for the task.\n\n**Prototyping**\n\nThe first prototype of the Su-57, designated T-50-1, was completed in 2007, but its maiden flight was repeatedly postponed due to technical issues. The second prototype, T-50-2, was completed in 2009 and made its first flight on 21 January 2010. The first supersonic flight occurred on 14 March 2011 at a test range near Komsomolsk-on-Amur.\n\n**Stealth**\n\nThe Su-57 employs a variety of methods to reduce its radar signature, including aligning the planform edges to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS). The leading and trailing edges of the wings and control surfaces are carefully angled to reduce the number of directions the radar waves can be reflected. Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe, and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft's stealthy shape. Radar absorbent material (RAM) coatings are used to absorb radar emissions and reduce the reflection back to the source.\n\n**Engines**\n\nThe Su-57 is powered by a pair of NPO Lyulka-Saturn izdeliye 117, or AL-41F1, augmented turbofans. The engine produces 9 tonnes (88.3 kN, 19,840 lbf) of dry thrust, 14.5 tonnes (142.2 kN, 31,970 lbf) of thrust in afterburner, and 15 tonnes (147.1 kN, 33,070 lbf) of thrust in \"special\" emergency power.\n\n**Armament**\n\nThe Su-57 has two tandem main internal weapon bays, each approximately 4.4 m (14.4 ft) long and 0.9 m (3.0 ft) wide, and two side weapon bays with triangular section fairings under the fuselage near the wing root. The main bays have two types of ejection launchers made by Vympel, the UVKU-50L for missiles weighing up to 300 kg (660 lb), and the UVKU-50U for ordnance weighing up to 700 kg (1,500 lb).\n\n**Cockpit**\n\nThe Su-57 has a glass cockpit with no analogue gauges, with information displayed on two 38 cm (15 in) main multi-functional LCD displays. A smaller multi-functional display and digital control panel are also present. Primary controls are the joystick and a pair of throttles, with all major functions controlled with hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS). The aircraft uses a two-piece canopy, with the aft section sliding forward and locking into place.\n\n**Avionics**\n\nOne of the main technical goals of the PAK FA program is to achieve total integration of avionics systems, or sensor fusion, increase the pilot's situational awareness and reduce workload. Integration of the Su-57's onboard systems is controlled by an IUS (Russian: ИУС, short for: Информационно-управляющая система, lit. 'Information Management System'), with its computer system developed by GRPZ from Ryazan. The main avionics systems are the Sh-121 (Russian: Ш-121) multifunctional integrated radio electronic system (MIRES) and the 101KS \"Atoll\" (Russian: 101КС \"Атолл\") electro-optical system.\n\n**Operational History**\n\nEven before the first flight of the T-50 prototype, several subsystems were tested on other aircraft for validation and risk reduction. The T-50 prototype conducted its first high-speed taxi run on 21 January 2010 and had its maiden flight several days later on 29 January 2010. First supersonic flight occurred on 14 March 2011 at a test range near Komsomolsk-on-Amur.\n\n**Entry into Service**\n\nOn 25 December 2020, the Russian Defence Ministry announced that the Su-57 had entered service upon the delivery of the first production aircraft to one of the aviation regiments of the Southern Military District at Lipetsk. The first operational unit to be equipped with the Su-57 is the 23rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment based in Dzyomgi in the Eastern Military District, with deliveries to begin in 2023. The first fully operational Su-57 regiment of 24 aircraft is expected to be equipped by 2025.\n\n**Potential Operators**\n\nIn the early stages of the PAK FA program, India had planned to be one of the largest foreign customers by procuring the FGFA derivative. However, India pulled out of the FGFA project in April 2018, which it believed did not meet its requirements for stealth, combat avionics, radars, and sensors. The General Director of the United Aircraft Corporation Yuri Slyusar denied previous reports saying \"the topic is not closed\" and that Russia and India are still discussing the creation of the fifth-generation fighter.\n\n**Variants**\n\nIn 2008, UAC president Alexei Fedorov said that any decision on applying fifth-generation technologies to produce a smaller fighter (comparable to the F-35) must wait until after the development of the PAK FA is completed.\n\n**Accidents**\n\nOn 10 June 2014, the fifth flying prototype, aircraft T-50-5, was severely damaged by an engine fire after landing. The pilot managed to escape unharmed. The aircraft was subsequently written off, and its salvageable parts were cannibalized to finish the sixth \"first stage\" prototype, which was then given the fifth prototype's bort number and its designation changed from T-50-6-1 to T-50-5R.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe Su-57 has a maximum takeoff weight of 25,000 kg (55,115 lb) and a maximum speed of over Mach 2. However, the exact specifications of the aircraft are classified.\n\n**Notable Appearances in Media**\n\nThe Su-57 appears in the 2022 film Top Gun: Maverick as the aircraft used by the unnamed hostile nation, where it is referred to as \"fifth-generation fighter.\" The Su-57 is a flyable aircraft in several entries of the aerial combat game series Ace Combat.", "prompt": "Write a complete

from original plans In 2011, the Ministry of Defence had planned on buying the first 10 aircraft for evaluation after 2012 and 60 production standard aircraft after 2015 [53] These plans were refined under the State Armament Programme from 2011 to 2020 (GPV-2020), with serial production hoped to begin in 2016; the Ministry of Defence was planning to acquire 52 aircraft by 2020, and another 150–160

well as the integration of these systems to achieve high levels of automation [23] [83]\n\n\nStealth\nThe first aircraft in Russian military service to emphasize stealth, the Su-57 employs a variety of methods to reduce its radar signature Similar to other stealth fighters such as the F-22, the aircraft aligns the planform edges to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS); the leading and trailing edges of the wings and control surfaces and the serrated edges of skin panels are carefully angled to reduce the number of directions the radar waves can be reflected Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft's stealthy shape, while radar absorbent material (RAM) coatings absorb radar emissions and reduce the reflection back to the source.\n\n\nEngines\nThe Su-57 is powered by a pair of NPO Lyulka-Saturn izdeliye 117, or AL-41F1, augmented turbofans [105] The engine is a highly improved and uprated variant of the AL-31 and produces 9 tonnes (88.3 kN, 19,840 lbf) of dry thrust, 14.5 tonnes (142.2 kN, 31,970 lbf) of thrust in afterburner, and 15 tonnes (147.1 kN, 33,070 lbf) of thrust in \"special\" emergency power The engines have full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and are integrated into the flight control system to facilitate maneuverability and handling [106] [87] The AL-41F1 is closely related to the Lyulka-Saturn izdeliye 117S engine, or AL-41F1S, used by the Su-35S, with the latter's separate engine control system being the key difference [107]\n\n\nArmament\nThe Su-57 has two tandem main internal weapon bays each approximately 4.4 m (14.4 ft) long and 0.9 m (3.0 ft) wide and two side weapon bays with triangular section fairings under the fuselage near the wing root [112] The main bays have two types of ejection launchers made by Vympel, the UVKU-50L for missiles weighing up to 300 kg (660 lb), and the UVKU-50U for ordnance weighing up to 700 kg (1,500 lb); the side bays use the VPU-50 launch rails [113] [114]\n\n\nCockpit\nThe Su-57 has a glass cockpit with no analogue gauges; information is displayed on two 38 cm (15 in) main multi-functional LCD displays similar to the arrangement of the Su-35S Supplementing the primary display is a smaller multi-functional display and digital control panel The cockpit has a wide-angle (30° by 22°) head-up display (HUD) Primary controls are the joystick and a pair of throttles, with all major functions controlled with hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS) [123] [124] The aircraft uses a two-piece canopy, with the aft section sliding forward and locking into place The canopy is treated with metallized coatings to reduce the aircraft's radar signature [citation needed] The Su-57 integrated computer system at Chip \"1890VM8Ya\" – FGU FSC NIISI (in Russian) [clarification needed] [125] [126] [127]\n\n\nAvionics\nOne of the main technical goals of the PAK FA programme is to achieve total integration of avionics systems, or sensor fusion, increase the pilot's situational awareness and reduce workload Integration of the Su-57's onboard systems is controlled by an IUS (Russian: ИУС, short for: Информационно-управляющая система, lit. 'Information Management System'), with its computer system developed by GRPZ from Ryazan The main avionics systems are the Sh-121 (Russian: Ш-121) multifunctional integrated radio electronic system (MIRES) and the 101KS \"Atoll\" (Russian: 101КС \"Атолл\") electro-optical system [131] In a departure from prior Sukhoi aircraft, the IUS systems integration was performed by Sukhoi itself rather than RPKB of Ramenskoye The integrated avionics suite, called IMA BK (Russian: ИМА БК, short for: Интегрированной модульной авионики боевых комплексов, lit. 'Integrated Modular Avionics Combat Systems'), uses fibre optic channels and runs on over 4 million lines of code [132] [133] [123]\n\n\nOperational history\nEven before the first flight of the T-50 prototype, several subsystems were tested on other aircraft for validation and risk reduction; an Su-27M was used to test the AL-41F1 engine on 21 January 2010, while another tested the KSU-50 flight control system [149] The T-50 prototype conducted its first high speed taxi run on 21 January 2010 and had its maiden flight several days later on 29 January 2010 [42] First supersonic flight occurred on 14 March 2011 at a test range near Komsomolsk-on-Amur [92]\n\n\nTesting and trials\nEven before the first flight of the T-50 prototype, several subsystems were tested on other aircraft for validation and risk reduction; an Su-27M was used to test the AL-41F1 engine on 21 January 2010, while another tested the KSU-50 flight control system [149] The T-50 prototype conducted its first high speed taxi run on 21 January 2010 and had its maiden flight several days later on 29 January 2010 [42] First supersonic flight occurred on 14 March 2011 at a test range near Komsomolsk-on-Amur [92]\n\n\nSyrian combat evaluation\nOn 21 February 2018, two Su-57s performed their first international flight as they were spotted landing at the Russian Khmeimim air base in Syria The aircraft were deployed along with four Sukhoi Su-35 fighters, four Sukhoi Su-25s, and one Beriev A-50 AEW&C aircraft [170] Three days later two more Su-57s were reported to have arrived in Syria [171] The deployment was criticised by some experts as overly risky, especially after reports of drone attacks at Khmeimim air base, as well as having limited value due to the short duration of only several days As the deployment overlapped with Russia's Defender of the Fatherland Day, the purpose may have been to support the president's state-of-the-nation speech Additionally, deployment of the aircraft in a combat theatre may serve to enhance the aircraft's marketing [172] [173] [174] [175] On 1 March 2018, the Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu stated that the two Su-57s had spent two days in Syria and successfully completed a trials program, including combat trials during which parameters of weapons work were monitored [176] [177] On 25 May 2018, the Defence Ministry disclosed that during the February 2018 deployment to Syria, a Su-57 fired a cruise missile in combat, likely a Kh-59MK2 [178] On 18 November 2018, the Defence Ministry posted an extended video of the fighters' flights, and announced that Su-57 performed 10 flights during its deployment to Syria [179] [180] However, the video did not specify when the test flights took place [181]\n\n\nEntry into service\nOn 25 December 2020, the Russian Defence Ministry announced that the Su-57 had entered service upon the delivery of the first production aircraft to one of the aviation regiments of the Southern Military District at Lipetsk This initial production batch would be used for military evaluation, tactics development, and crew conversion training The first operational unit to be equipped with the Su-57 is the 23rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment based in Dzyomgi in the Eastern Military District, with deliveries to begin in 2023; the colocation of the unit with the KnAAZ aircraft manufacturing plant enables easier support for newly introduced aircraft [2] The first fully operational Su-57 regiment of 24 aircraft is expected to be equipped by 2025 [183] [184]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nIn May 2022, Russian sources claimed that Su-57 fighters were used two or three weeks after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, striking targets with missiles outside of the zone of activity of Ukrainian air defenses, [185] just like other Russian aircraft that are also restricted mainly to Russian airspace [186]\n\n\nPotential operators\nIn the early stages of the PAK FA programme, India had planned to be one of the largest foreign customers by procuring the FGFA derivative It originally planned on buying 166 single-seat and 48 two-seat fighters, [206] but later changed it to 214 single-seat fighters, [207] and later reduced its purchase to 144 fighters by 2012 [208] In April 2018, India pulled out of the FGFA project, which it believed did not meet its requirements for stealth, combat avionics, radars and sensors by that time [34] [209] Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa, during an interview with Russian Ministry of Defence's official newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), stated that the Su-57 is currently not being considered for the service, but the aircraft can be evaluated once it enters service with the Russian Aerospace Forces [210] [211] The General Director of the United Aircraft Corporation Yuri Slyusar however denied the previous reports saying \"the topic is not closed\" and that Russia and India are still discussing the creation of the fifth-generation fighter [212] [213] However, in October 2019, the Indian Air Force Chief of Air Staff RKS Bhadauria stated that the country will not be importing stealth fighters like the Su-57, and will instead focus on indigenous efforts such as the HAL AMCA [214]\n\n\nVariants\nIn 2008, UAC president Alexei Fedorov has said that any decision on applying fifth-generation technologies to produce a smaller fighter (comparable to the F-35) must wait until after the development of the PAK FA is completed [247]\n\n\nOther versions\nIn 2008, UAC president Alexei Fedorov has said that any decision on applying fifth-generation technologies to produce a smaller fighter (comparable to the F-35) must wait until after the development of the PAK FA is completed [247]\n\n\nOperators\nOn 10 June 2014, the fifth flying prototype, aircraft T-50-5, was severely damaged by an engine fire after landing The pilot managed to escape unharmed The aircraft was subsequently written off, and its salvageable parts were cannibalized to finish the sixth \"first stage\" prototype, which was then given the fifth prototype's bort number and its designation changed from T-50-6-1 to T-50-5R However, official accounting still considers the two aircraft to be the \"same\" one [48]\n\n\nAccidents\nOn 10 June 2014, the fifth flying prototype, aircraft T-50-5, was severely damaged by an engine fire after landing The pilot managed to escape unharmed The aircraft was subsequently written off, and its salvageable parts were cannibalized to finish the sixth \"first

\"same\" one [48]\n\n\nSpecifications (Su-57)\nData from Rosoboronexport, [265] [better source needed] Aviation Week, [266] Key Aero, [267] Crecy Publishing [268]\n\nNotable appearances in media\nThe Su-57 appears in the 2022 film Top Gun: Maverick as the aircraft used by the unnamed hostile nation, where it is referred to as \"fifth-generation fighter\" [274] The Su-57 is a flyable aircraft in several entries of the aerial combat game series Ace Combat [275] [276]\n\n\nSee also\n\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and

where he appeared at The Gaslight Cafe beginning in 1961 [19] He booked dates in cities such as Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C In the summer of 1963, he received national exposure on NBC's The Tonight Show This led to a recording contract with Warner Bros Records which, in 1964, released his debut LP, Bill Cosby Is a Very Funny Fellow...Right!, the first of a series of comedy albums [23] His album To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With was number one on Spin magazine's list of \"The 40 Greatest Comedy Albums of All Time\", calling it \"stand-up comedy's

number one on Spin magazine's list of \"The 40 Greatest Comedy Albums of All Time\", calling it \"stand-up comedy's masterpiece\" [24]\n\n\nTelevision and film\nIn 1965, Cosby was cast alongside Robert Culp in the I Spy espionage adventure series on NBC I Spy became the first weekly dramatic television series to feature an African American in a starring role [34] At first, Cosby and NBC executives were concerned that some affiliates might be unwilling to carry the series At the beginning of the 1965 season, four stations declined the show; they were in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama [35] Viewers were taken with the show's exotic locales and the authentic chemistry between the stars It became one of the ratings hits of the season I Spy finished among the twenty most-watched shows that year, and Cosby was honored with three consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series [36] When accepting his third Emmy for the show, Cosby told the audience: \"Let the message be known to bigots and racists that they don't count!\" [36]\n\n\nAdvertising\nCosby was a popular spokesperson for advertising from the 1960s – before his first starring television role – until the early 2000s He started with White Owl cigars, and later endorsed Jell-O pudding and gelatin, Del Monte, Ford Motor Company, Coca-Cola (including New Coke), American Red Cross, Texas Instruments, E F Hutton & Co., Kodak, and the 1990 United States Census As of 2002 [update], Cosby held the record for being the longest-serving celebrity spokesperson for a product, through his work with Jell-O In 2011, he won the President's Award for Contributions to Advertising from the Advertising Hall of Fame \n\n\nSexual assault cases\nThe earliest allegation against Cosby dates back to December 1965: in 2005, Kristina Ruehli came forward as Jane Doe #12 in the Andrea Constand case and alleged that Cosby had drugged and assaulted her at that time in his Beverly Hills home Further, Ruehli said she had told her boyfriend about the incident, and had told her daughter in the 1980s [82]\n\n\n1965–1996 allegations\nThe earliest allegation against Cosby dates back to December 1965: in 2005, Kristina Ruehli came forward as Jane Doe #12 in the Andrea Constand case and alleged that Cosby had drugged and assaulted her at that time in his Beverly Hills home Further, Ruehli said she had told her boyfriend about the incident, and had told her daughter in the 1980s [82]\n\n\nLater allegations and investigations (2000–2006)\nOn February 1, 2000, according to a statement provided by Detective Jose McCallion of the New York County District Attorney's Special Victims Bureau, Lachele Covington, who was 20 years old at the time, filed a criminal complaint against Cosby alleging that on January 28, 2000, at his Manhattan townhouse, he had tried to put her hands down his pants and then exposed himself Covington also alleged that Cosby grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hands down her pants Cosby was questioned and insisted \"it was not true\" The New York City Police Department (NYPD) referred her complaint to the D.A., but they declined to prosecute [87]\n\n\nHannibal Buress remarks (October 2014)\nOn October 16, 2014, as part of a comedy routine in Philadelphia, Hannibal Buress addressed Cosby's legacy of \"talk [ing] down\" to young black men about their mode of dress and lifestyle Buress criticized the actor's public moralizing by saying: \"Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of brings you down a couple notches.\"\n\n\nAdditional assault allegations\nAfter Buress's remarks came to the attention of journalist Joan Tarshis, in November 2014, [107] model Janice Dickinson, [108] actress Louisa Moritz, [109] actor Lou Ferrigno's wife Carla, [109] Florida nurse Therese Serignese, [110] Playboy Playmates Valentino [111] and Sarita Butterfield, [112] actress Michelle Hurd, [113] and eleven other women [113] also made accusations of alleged assaults by Cosby committed against them between 1965 and 2004 [114] Charlotte Laws wrote a November 2014 article published by Salon accusing Cosby of assaulting a friend of hers, with whom she subsequently had lost contact [115] The following month, in a Vanity Fair article, model Beverly Johnson alleged that she was drugged by Cosby during a 1986 audition, and that she knew other women with similar accounts [116]\n\n\nAftermath\nCosby has repeatedly denied the allegations and maintained his innocence In November 2014, he responded to a question about the allegations and said: \"I don't talk about it.\" [131] In past interviews that were made public, Cosby declined to discuss the accusations [132] However, he told Florida Today: \"People shouldn't have to go through that and shouldn't answer to innuendos.\" [132] In May 2015, he said: \"I have been in this business 52 years and I've never seen anything like this Reality is a situation and I can't speak.\" [133]\n\n\nTrial, conviction, and conviction overturn\nWith the exception of Andrea Constand's allegations, most of the sexual assault allegations against Cosby have fallen outside of the statutes of limitations for criminal prosecution [137] [138] Numerous civil lawsuits have been brought against him [137] [139] Attorney Gloria Allred has represented 33 of Cosby's alleged victims In July 2015, some of the court records from Andrea Constand's 2005 civil suit against Cosby were unsealed and released to the public The full transcript of his deposition was also released to the media by a court reporting service In his testimony, Cosby admitted to casual sex with a series of young women involving the recreational use of the sedative methaqualone (Quaalude); he further acknowledged that his dispensation of the prescription drug was illegal [140] [141] [142]\n\n\nLegacy\nBefore the 2014 allegations, younger, well-established comics like Jerry Seinfeld had credited Cosby as an innovator both as a practitioner of stand-up comedy, as well as a person who paved the way for comics to break into sitcom television.\n\n\nInfluence on other comedians\nBefore the 2014 allegations, younger, well-established comics like Jerry Seinfeld had credited Cosby as an innovator both as a practitioner of stand-up comedy, as well as a person who paved the way for comics to break into sitcom television.\n\n\nImpact of sexual assault allegations on Cosby's legacy\nJoan Tarshis, who had accused Cosby of raping her, within a Salon.com article, compared Cosby's damaged legacy to that of O J Simpson, saying: \"When you hear O J Simpson's name, you don't think 'Oh, great football player' That doesn't come to mind first I'm thinking it's not going to be 'Oh, great comedian' It's going to be 'Oh, serial rapist'.\" [162]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCosby married Camille Hanks on January 25, 1964 Together, they had five children, Erika (b 1965), Erinn (b 1966), Ennis (1969–1997), Ensa (1973–2018),

February 23, 2018, while awaiting a kidney transplant [170] The Cosbys have three grandchildren [6] [171] Cosby, a Protestant, [172] maintains homes in Shelburne, Massachusetts, and Cheltenham, Pennsylvania [173]\n\n\nPolitics and views\nCosby received an award at the celebration of the 50th-anniversary commemoration of Brown v Board of Education ruling—a ruling of the U.S Supreme Court that outlawed racial segregation in public schools Later, in May 2004, he made public remarks critical of African Americans who put higher priorities on sports, fashion, and \"acting hard\" than on education, self-respect, and self-improvement He pleaded for African American families to educate their children on the many different aspects of American culture [187] [188] In the Pound Cake speech, Cosby asked that African American parents teach their children better morals at a younger age As reported in The Washington Times, Cosby \"told reporters during a special session of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's 34th annual legislative conference  [that] parenting needs to come to the forefront If you need help and you don't know how to parent, we want to be able to reach out and touch you.\" [189] Richard Leiby of The Washington Post reported, \"Bill Cosby was anything but politically correct in his remarks Monday night at a Constitution Hall bash commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Brown v Board of Education decision.\" [190]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nCosby received various awards and numerous honorary degrees for his work as a standup comedian and actor in both

On 4 April 1997, former KGB officer Viktor Gushan, owner of the conglomerate Sheriff which remains a key sponsor, renamed it FC Sheriff Tiraspol.\n\n## Europe\n\nSheriff has been trying to reach the group stage of the UEFA Champions League every year since 2001-02, but failed in the second qualifying round every time. However, their European fortunes improved after 2009. Sheriff has appeared in three UEFA Europa League group stages (2009-10, 2010-11, 2013-14) with decent results, although they didn't manage to qualify to the knock-out stage.\n\n### 2009-10 UEFA Europa League\n\nIn the 2009-10 season, Sheriff finally reached the third qualifying round when they defeated Inter Turku. In the next round, Sheriff defeated Slavia Prague 1-1 on aggregate, progressing via the away goal rule due to Nadson's 94th-minute strike in the second leg. They were then eliminated from the 2009-10 UEFA Champions League by Greek club Olympiacos in the qualifying play-off for a spot in the group stage. Sheriff lost 2-0 in the first leg at home, and 1-0 in the second leg away.\n\n### 2010-11 UEFA Champions League\n\nIn the 2010-11 UEFA Champions League, on 14-20 July 2010, Sheriff defeated Dinamo Tirana in the second qualifying round (3-1, 0-1). Then, on 4 August, the club defeated Dinamo Zagreb on penalties (6-5) after identical 1-1 draws at home and away, thereby reaching the play-off round. On 18-24 August, in the play-off round against Basel, Sheriff lost 1-0 in Switzerland before losing 3-0 at home.\n\n### 2010-11 UEFA Europa League\n\nDropping to the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League after their play-off defeat to Basel, Sheriff was drawn into Group E alongside Dynamo Kyiv, AZ and BATE Borisov. After losing their first match 2-1 away against AZ on 15 September 2010, on 30 September, Sheriff defeated Dynamo Kyiv 2-0 at home. After losing two-straight matches against BATE – 0-1 at home and 3-1 away on 21 October and 4 November respectively – on 2 December, Sheriff drew 1-1 with AZ at home, then on 15 December, Sheriff drew 0-0 against Dynamo Kyiv away in Kyiv. Accumulating five points, Sheriff failed to progress past the group stage after finishing last in Group E.\n\n### 2013-14 UEFA Europa League\n\nIn the 2013-14 UEFA Europa League, Sheriff played in a group with Tottenham Hotspur, Anzhi Makhachkala and Tromsø, in which they finished third.\n\n### 2017-18 UEFA Europa League\n\nIn the 2017-18 UEFA Europa League, Sheriff played in a group with Lokomotiv Moscow, Copenhagen, Fastav Zlín, in which they finished third once more.\n\n### 2021-22 UEFA Champions League\n\nIn the 2021-22 UEFA Champions League, Sheriff became the first Moldovan team to qualify for the group stages of the competition after a 3-0 aggregate win over Dinamo Zagreb. They were drawn into Group D to face Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk. On 15 September, Sheriff won their opening group game, 2-0 against Shakhtar Donetsk, before following it up with an upset 2-1 away victory over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu on 28 September 2021, with Sébastien Thill scoring the winning goal in the 89th minute. Despite losing their next three games against Inter Milan and Real Madrid, they secured qualification for the preliminary knockout round of the Europa League on 24 November 2021 when Shakhtar Donetsk lost to Inter Milan. They ended their campaign with a 1-1 away draw with Shakhtar Donetsk, which meant they ended up with a very respectable 7 points from their 6 games.\n\n### 2021-22 UEFA Europa League\n\nSheriff had serious squad problems before the start of the UEFA Europa League knockout rounds. The departure of important players such as Cristiano da Silva Leite, Frank Castañeda, Danilo Arboleda, Dimitris Kolovos and Fernando Peixoto Costanza caused serious problems in the squad. Sheriff replaced all the departures with new players like Regi Lushkja, Gaby Kiki, Renan Guedes and Patrick Kpozo. However, the rules of the Moldovan championship allow teams to announce their new players from 23 February. Since the deadline for registration in the Europa League was February 2, coach Yuriy Vernydub was obliged to include players who had not played much in the starting line-up, such as Stjepan Radeljić, Stefanos Evangelou and Charles Petro.\n\n## Stadium\n\nSheriff Arena is the home ground of Sheriff Tiraspol and is owned by the corporation Sheriff.

{"title": "Jerry_West", "content": "\nEarly life\nWest was born into a poor household in Chelyan, West Virginia, on May 28, 1938 [7] [8] [9] He was the fifth of six children of Cecil Sue West, a housewife, and Howard Stewart West, a coal mine electrician [10] West's father physically abused him, and West has stated that for a time he slept with a loaded shotgun under his bed out of fear that he might have to kill his father in self-defense [11]\n\n\nCollege career\nWest graduated from East Bank High School in 1956, and more than 60 universities showed interest in him He eventually chose to stay in his home state and attend West Virginia University (WVU), located in Morgantown [17] In his freshman year (1956–57), West was a member of the WVU freshman squad that achieved a perfect record of 17 straight wins over the course of the season; [17] other team members included Jay Jacobs and Willie Akers [18] In his first varsity year under head coach Fred Schaus, West scored 17.8 points per game and averaged 11.1 rebounds; he also started in all 28 games while shooting 49.6% from the field and 73.2% from the free throw line [19] These performances earned him a multitude of honors, among them an All-American Third Team call-up, First Team All-Southern Conference, Southern Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player Award and First Team honors, Chuck Taylor–Converse Second-team All-American honors, and Associated Press and United Press International Third-team All-America honors [20] The Mountaineers went 26–2 that year, ending the season with a loss to Manhattan College in postseason tournament play [21]\n\n\nProfessional career\nWest made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft, and he was drafted with the second overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers, shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise [24] His college coach, Schaus, was also hired that same season to coach the Lakers He played West as a guard, in contrast to West's college days as a forward [9] The Lakers were captained by Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor, who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins; and guards Rod Hundley (from West Virginia, like West), Frank Selvy, and Bobby Leonard [25] This team perennially had strong forwards and guards, but was constantly weak at center, giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center, Bill Russell [26]\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (1960–1974)\nWest made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft, and he was drafted with the second overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers, shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise [24] His college coach, Schaus, was also hired that same season to coach the Lakers He played West as a guard, in contrast to West's college days as a forward [9] The Lakers were captained by Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor, who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins; and guards Rod Hundley (from West Virginia, like West), Frank Selvy, and Bobby Leonard [25] This team perennially had strong forwards and guards, but was constantly weak at center, giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center, Bill Russell [26]\n\n\n1960–64: Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside\nWest made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft, and he was drafted with the second overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers, shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise [24] His college coach, Schaus, was also hired that same season to coach the Lakers He played West as a guard, in contrast to West's college days as a forward [9] The Lakers were captained by Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor, who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins; and guards Rod Hundley (from West Virginia, like West), Frank Selvy, and Bobby Leonard [25] This team perennially had strong forwards and guards, but was constantly weak at center, giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center, Bill Russell [26]\n\n\n1964–68: Leader of the Lakers\nIn the following 1964–65 NBA season, West averaged 31.0 points (at the time, a career-high), only surpassed by perennial scoring champion Wilt Chamberlain [19] After ending the regular season with 49 wins, L.A played the Baltimore Bullets in the first round of the 1965 NBA Playoffs, but then team captain Baylor suffered a career-threatening knee injury [32] West spectacularly took over Baylor's leading role, as he scored 49 points and willed the shocked Lakers to the win In Game 2, Baltimore was unable to stop the Lakers guard, who scored 52 points, nearly half of L.A.'s total, in the 118–115 win [34] The Bullets took their two home games, despite West scoring 44 and 48 points respectively, but in the decisive Game 5 in L.A., the guard helped beat the Bullets with 42 points in a close 117–115 win West averaged 46.3 points per game, a figure that is still an NBA record [35] In the 1965 NBA Finals, the Celtics easily beat the short-handed Lakers, 4–1 In Game 1, which Boston easily won, defensive Celtics guard K C Jones held West to only 26 points, and in Game 2, West scored 45 points, but Boston still won 129–123 [36] In Game 3, West scored 49 points, and L.A finally won a game, but in Games 4 and 5, the Lakers were beaten by double digits; in the last quarter of Game 5, West missed 14 of 15 shots and could not prevent yet another Celtics win [36] Still, the Lakers guard finished the playoffs with 40.6 points per game [26]\n\n\n1968–71: Arrival of Wilt Chamberlain\nOn July 9, 1968, the Lakers made a trade that brought reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers to Los Angeles at the beginning of the 1968–69 NBA season To get the center, the Lakers traded West's backcourt partner Archie Clark, starting center Darrall Imhoff and backup forward Jerry Chambers to Philadelphia [41] Coach Van Breda Kolff was concerned about the drain at the guard positions after losing Clark, and especially after losing Goodrich in the expansion draft to the Phoenix Suns He only had diminutive, defensively weak Johnny Egan left next to West [41] While West himself got on well with his new teammate, Chamberlain often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor and had a poor relationship with Van Breda Kolff Van Breda Kolff pejoratively called Chamberlain \"The Load\", and later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his statistics [42] In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as \"the dumbest and worst coach ever\" [42] There was an altercation in which Chamberlain was about to punch Van Breda Kolff before Baylor had intervened [43] West was disturbed by locker room tension; used to playing on teams with good chemistry, his quality of play became erratic, and his scoring average of 25.9 points was his lowest since his rookie season He made the Second Team of the inaugural All-Defensive Team [43]\n\n\n1971–74: Late success and twilight years\nBefore the 1971–72 NBA season, West was smarting from his frequent injuries and losses and considered retirement [9] The Lakers hired former Celtics star guard and future Hall-of-Fame coach Bill Sharman as head coach Although injured captain Elgin Baylor ended his career, the Lakers had a season for the ages The team was powered by Sharman's emphasis on tough defense and fast break offense, and L.A embarked on an unprecedented 33 game win streak, en route to a then-record 69 wins in the regular season [52] West himself contributed with 25.8 points and led the league with a career-high 9.7 assists per game He was named All-Star, All-NBA and All-Defense First Teamer and voted 1972 All-Star Game MVP [19] Prior to the Laker's 33 game team win streak, in which West started every game, the Lakers played 5 games in which West was injured and did not play The Lakers lost 3 of the 5 games Prior to that, West started 8 straight games in which the Lakers won each game As a result, Jerry West had a personal win streak of 41 games in which he started  This is the longest such personal win streak in major American professional sports history [53]\n\n\nCoaching career\nLakers owner Jack Kent Cooke was known for a keen eye identifying leadership and teaching qualities (he also gave Hall of Famers Sparky Anderson and Joe Gibbs their first managerial/head coaching positions), [62] and asked West to coach and participate in player personnel decisions [63] In the 1976–77 season, West became coach of the Los Angeles Lakers In three years, he led the Lakers and star center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to a 145–101 record, making the playoffs all three seasons and reaching the Western Conference finals in 1977 [64]\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (1976–1979)\nLakers owner Jack Kent Cooke was known for a keen eye identifying leadership and teaching qualities (he also gave Hall of Famers Sparky Anderson and Joe Gibbs their first managerial/head

Lakers and star center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to a 145–101 record, making the playoffs all three seasons and reaching the Western Conference finals in 1977 [64]\n\n\nExecutive career\nAfter his coaching stint, West worked as a scout for three years before becoming general manager of the Lakers before the 1982–83 season, [65] when he succeeded Bill Sharman [66] West helped to build the great 1980s Lakers dynasty, also known as Showtime, which brought five championship rings (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988) to Los Angeles [65]\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (1979–2000)\nAfter his coaching stint, West

also known as Showtime, which brought five championship rings (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988) to Los Angeles [65]\n\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (2002–2007)\nIn 2002, West became the general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies He explained his decision with the desire for exploring something new: \"After being a part of the Lakers success for so many years, I have always wondered how it would be to build a winning franchise that has not experienced much success I want to help make a difference.\" [70] West's Memphis stint was not as spectacular as his Los Angeles stint, but he turned a franchise which was about to be sold into a reliable playoffs team, making few trades but getting the maximum from the players he had available (such as Pau Gasol, James Posey, and Jason Williams) and signing coach Hubie Brown, who became Coach of the Year in 2004 [71] West himself won his second NBA Executive of the Year Award in the same year [67] In 2007, West retired as a Grizzlies general manager and turned over managing duties to Chris Wallace [71]\n\n\nGolden State Warriors (2011–2017)\nOn May 19, 2011, West joined the Golden State Warriors as an executive board member, reporting directly to new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber [72] [73] This role also came with an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the team [74] [75] In 2015, the Warriors won their first championship in 40 years; [76] the championship was the seventh earned by West while serving as a team executive He earned his eighth in the 2016–17 season [77]\n\n\nLos Angeles Clippers (2017–2024)\n\nOn June 1, 2017, West publicly stated that he would have been interested in returning to the Lakers, but nothing materialized as they hired Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka to run the team [78] [79] On June 14, West announced that he would go to the Los Angeles Clippers as an executive board member and consultant Clippers coach, Doc Rivers, floated the idea of West joining the organization during the 2016 season West referred to leaving Golden State as \"one of the saddest days of his life\", but was excited to find a new challenge [80] [81] [82] On December 17, 2020, it was reported that West and the LA Clippers were under investigation by the NBA following a lawsuit filed by John Wilkes against the LA Clippers over the recruitment of Kawhi Leonard to the team [83]\n\nNBA career statistics\nWest was an all-around combo guard who could take the playmaking roles of a point guard and score like a shooting guard, while being equally strong on offense and defense [9] He had a jump shot with a release the NBA lauded as \"lightning quick\", and was known for making baskets late in the game, earning him the nickname \"Mr Clutch\" [9] Having played forward early in his career, he was also a capable rebounder, and gifted with long arms, quick hands, and strong defensive instincts He was also described as one of the best ballhawks, man-to-man defenders and shot blockers among NBA guards: [27] when the All-Defensive Teams were introduced in 1969, he made every one of them until his career ended in 1974 [19] \"He stole more than anybody, although they didn't keep records on it then\", said Sharman [85] Contemporaries were most impressed by his work ethic, practicing, shooting and, rarely satisfying himself [27]\n\n\nRegular season\nWest was an all-around combo guard who could take the

(NBA) for 14 seasons. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history, known for his exceptional scoring, rebounding, and defensive abilities. West is also recognized for his contributions as a coach and executive, serving as the head coach and general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies. This article provides an overview of West's life, career, and legacy.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJerry West was born on May 28, 1938, in Chelyan, West Virginia. He was the fifth of six children to Cecil Sue West and Howard Stewart West, a coal mine electrician. West's father physically abused him, and he has stated that he slept with a loaded shotgun under his bed out of fear that he might have to kill his father in self-defense. Despite his difficult childhood, West's mother encouraged him to pursue his passion for basketball.\n\n**College Career**\n\nWest graduated from East Bank High School in 1956 and was drafted by the West Virginia University (WVU) Mountaineers. In his freshman year, West was a member of the WVU freshman squad that achieved a perfect record of 17 straight wins. He scored 17.8 points per game and averaged 11.1 rebounds, earning him a multitude of honors, including an All-American Third Team call-up and First Team All-Southern Conference honors.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nWest made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft and was drafted with the second overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers. He played for the Lakers until 1969, when he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he played until his retirement in 1974. During his time with the Lakers, West was a key contributor to the team's success, earning him the nickname \"Mr. Clutch\" for his ability to make crucial shots late in games.\n\n**Los Angeles Lakers (1960-1974)**\n\nWest was drafted by the Minneapolis Lakers with the second overall pick in the 1960 NBA draft. He played for the Lakers until 1969, when the team relocated to Los Angeles. During his time with the Lakers, West was a key contributor to the team's success, earning him the nickname \"Mr. Clutch\" for his ability to make crucial shots late in games. In the 1964-65 season, West averaged 31.0 points per game, only surpassed by Wilt Chamberlain. West was also a capable rebounder and defensive player, earning him multiple All-Defensive Team selections.\n\n**Arrival of Wilt Chamberlain**\n\nOn July 9, 1968, the Lakers made a trade that brought Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers to Los Angeles. The trade was made to get the center, but it also led to a change in the team's chemistry. Chamberlain often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor and had a poor relationship with coach Van Breda Kolff. West was disturbed by the locker room tension and saw his scoring average drop to 25.9 points per season.\n\n**Late Success and Twilight Years**\n\nBefore the 1971-72 season, West was smarting from his frequent injuries and losses and considered retirement. The Lakers hired former Celtics star guard and future Hall of Fame coach Bill Sharman as head coach. The team had a season for the ages, with a 33-game win streak and a then-record 69 wins in the regular season. West contributed with 25.8 points and led the league with 9.7 assists per game.\n\n**Coaching Career**\n\nWest became the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1976-77 season. He led the team to a 145-101 record over three seasons, making the playoffs all three seasons and reaching the Western Conference finals in 1977. West was known for his emphasis on tough defense and fast break offense.\n\n**Executive Career**\n\nWest worked as a scout for three years before becoming the general manager of the Lakers in 1982. He helped build the great 1980s Lakers dynasty, also known as Showtime, which brought five championship rings to Los Angeles. West also served as the general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies from 2002 to 2007, where he turned a struggling franchise into a reliable playoff team.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nWest ended his playing career with 14 All-Star, 12 All-NBA Team, and five All-Defensive Team selections. He scored 25,192 points, 6,238 assists, and 5,366 rebounds in 932 games, translating to an average of 27.0 points, 6.7 assists, and 5.8 rebounds per game. West is the league leader in career scoring in the NBA Finals (1,679) and was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1979. West's number 44 jersey was retired by the Lakers in 1983.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nWest married his college sweetheart, Martha Jane Kane, in 1960, and they had three sons. They divorced in 1976. West died on June 12, 2024, at the age of 86.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Jerry West's basketball career\n* Los Angeles Lakers\n* Memphis Grizzlies\n* Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame", "prompt":

[8] [9] He was the fifth of six children of Cecil Sue West, a housewife, and Howard Stewart West, a coal mine electrician [10] West's father physically abused him, and West has stated that for a time he slept with a loaded shotgun under his bed out of fear that he might have to kill his father in self-defense [11]\n\n\nCollege career\nWest graduated from East Bank High School in 1956, and more than 60 universities showed interest in him He eventually chose to stay in his home state and attend West Virginia University (WVU), located in Morgantown [17] In his freshman year (1956–57), West was a member of the WVU freshman squad that achieved a perfect record of 17 straight wins over the course of the season; [17] other team members included Jay Jacobs and Willie Akers [18] In his first varsity year under head coach Fred Schaus, West scored 17.8 points per game and averaged 11.1 rebounds; he also started in all 28 games while shooting 49.6% from the field and 73.2% from the free throw line [19] These performances earned him a multitude of honors, among them an All-American Third Team call-up, First Team All-Southern Conference, Southern Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player Award and First Team honors, Chuck Taylor–Converse Second-team All-American honors, and Associated Press and United Press International Third-team All-America honors [20] The Mountaineers went 26–2 that year, ending the season with a loss to Manhattan College in postseason tournament play [21]\n\n\nProfessional career\nWest made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft, and he was drafted with the second overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers, shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise [24] His college coach, Schaus, was also hired that same season to coach the Lakers He played West as a guard, in contrast to West's college days as a forward [9] The Lakers were captained by Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor, who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins; and guards Rod Hundley (from West Virginia, like West), Frank Selvy, and Bobby Leonard [25] This team perennially had strong forwards and guards, but was constantly weak at center, giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center, Bill Russell [26]\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (1960–1974)\nWest made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft, and he was drafted with the second overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers, shortly before the team relocated to Los

disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center, Bill Russell [26]\n\n\n1960–64: Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside\nWest made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft, and he was drafted with the second overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers, shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise [24] His college coach, Schaus, was also hired that same season to coach the Lakers He played West as a guard, in contrast to West's college days as a forward [9] The Lakers were captained by Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor, who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins; and guards Rod Hundley (from West Virginia, like West), Frank Selvy, and Bobby Leonard [25] This team perennially had strong forwards and guards, but was constantly weak at center, giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center, Bill Russell [26]\n\n\n1964–68: Leader of the Lakers\nIn the following 1964–65 NBA season, West averaged 31.0 points (at the time, a career-high), only surpassed by perennial scoring champion Wilt Chamberlain [19] After ending the regular season with 49 wins, L.A played the Baltimore Bullets in the first round of the 1965 NBA Playoffs, but then team captain Baylor suffered a career-threatening knee injury [32] West spectacularly took over Baylor's leading role, as he scored 49 points and willed the shocked Lakers to the win In Game 2, Baltimore was unable to stop the Lakers guard, who scored 52 points, nearly half of L.A.'s total, in the 118–115 win [34] The Bullets took their two home games, despite West scoring 44 and 48 points respectively, but in the decisive Game 5 in L.A., the guard helped beat the Bullets with 42 points in a close 117–115 win West averaged 46.3 points per game, a figure that is still an NBA record [35] In the 1965 NBA Finals, the Celtics easily beat the short-handed Lakers, 4–1 In Game 1, which Boston easily won, defensive Celtics guard K C Jones held West to only 26 points, and in Game 2, West scored 45 points, but Boston still won 129–123 [36] In Game 3, West scored 49 points, and L.A finally won a game, but in Games 4 and 5, the Lakers were beaten by double digits; in the last quarter of Game 5, West missed 14 of 15 shots and could not prevent yet another Celtics win [36] Still, the Lakers guard finished the playoffs with 40.6 points per game [26]\n\n\n1968–71: Arrival of Wilt Chamberlain\nOn July 9, 1968, the Lakers made a trade that brought reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers to Los Angeles at the beginning of the 1968–69 NBA season To get the center, the Lakers traded West's backcourt partner Archie Clark, starting center Darrall Imhoff and backup forward Jerry Chambers to Philadelphia [41] Coach Van Breda Kolff was concerned about the drain at the guard positions after losing Clark, and especially after losing Goodrich in the expansion draft to the Phoenix Suns He only had diminutive, defensively weak Johnny Egan left next to West [41] While West himself got on well with his new teammate, Chamberlain often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor and had a poor relationship with Van Breda Kolff Van Breda Kolff pejoratively called Chamberlain \"The Load\", and later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his statistics [42] In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as \"the dumbest and worst coach ever\" [42] There was an altercation in which Chamberlain was about to punch Van Breda Kolff before Baylor had intervened [43] West was disturbed by locker room tension; used to playing on teams with good chemistry, his quality of play became erratic, and his scoring average of 25.9 points was his lowest since his rookie season He made the Second Team of the inaugural All-Defensive Team [43]\n\n\n1971–74: Late success and twilight years\nBefore the 1971–72 NBA season, West was smarting from his frequent injuries and losses and considered retirement [9] The Lakers hired former Celtics star guard and future Hall-of-Fame coach Bill Sharman as head coach Although injured captain Elgin Baylor ended his career, the Lakers had a season for the ages The team was powered by Sharman's emphasis on tough defense and fast break offense, and L.A embarked on an unprecedented 33 game win streak, en route to a then-record 69 wins in the regular season [52] West himself contributed with 25.8 points and led the league with a career-high 9.7 assists per game He was named All-Star, All-NBA and All-Defense First Teamer and voted 1972 All-Star Game MVP [19] Prior to the Laker's 33 game team win streak, in which West started every game, the Lakers played 5 games in which West was injured and did not play The Lakers lost 3 of the 5 games Prior to that, West started 8 straight games in which the Lakers won each game As a result, Jerry West had a personal win streak of 41 games in which he started  This is the longest such personal win streak in major American professional sports history [53]\n\n\nCoaching career\nLakers owner Jack Kent Cooke was known for a keen eye identifying leadership and teaching qualities (he also gave Hall of Famers Sparky Anderson and Joe Gibbs their first managerial/head coaching positions), [62] and asked West to coach and participate in player personnel decisions [63] In the 1976–77 season, West became coach of the Los Angeles Lakers In three years, he led the Lakers and star center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to a 145–101 record, making the playoffs all three seasons and reaching the Western Conference finals in 1977 [64]\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers

Memphis Grizzlies He explained his decision with the desire for exploring something new: \"After being a part of the Lakers success for so many years, I have always wondered how it would be to build a winning franchise that has not experienced much success I want to help make a difference.\" [70] West's Memphis stint was not as spectacular as his Los Angeles stint, but he turned a franchise which was about to be sold into a reliable playoffs team, making few trades but getting the maximum from the players he had available (such as Pau Gasol, James Posey, and Jason Williams) and signing coach Hubie Brown, who became Coach of the Year in 2004 [71] West himself won his second NBA Executive of the Year Award in the same year [67] In 2007, West retired as a Grizzlies general manager and turned over managing duties to Chris Wallace [71]\n\n\nGolden State Warriors (2011–2017)\nOn May 19, 2011, West joined the Golden State Warriors as an executive board member, reporting directly to new owners

championship was the seventh earned by West while serving as a team executive He earned his eighth in the 2016–17 season [77]\n\n\nLos Angeles Clippers (2017–2024)\n\nOn June 1, 2017, West publicly stated that he would have been interested in returning to the Lakers, but nothing materialized as they hired Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka to run the team [78] [79] On June 14, West announced that he would go to the Los Angeles Clippers as an executive board member and consultant Clippers coach, Doc Rivers, floated the idea of West joining the organization during the 2016 season West referred to leaving Golden State as \"one of the saddest days of his life\", but was excited to find a new challenge [80] [81] [82] On December 17, 2020, it was reported that West and the LA Clippers were under investigation by the NBA following a lawsuit filed by John Wilkes against the LA Clippers over the recruitment of Kawhi Leonard to the team [83]\n\nNBA career statistics\nWest was an all-around combo guard who could take the playmaking roles of a point guard and score like a shooting guard, while being equally strong on offense and defense [9] He had a jump shot with a release the NBA lauded as \"lightning quick\", and was known for making baskets late in the game, earning him the nickname \"Mr Clutch\" [9] Having played forward early in his career, he was also a capable rebounder, and

Whedon said that he had completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a \"brother/sister act\" from the comic books, [105] later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch [106] [107] Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film that \"their powers are very visually interesting\", with problems which Whedon \"had on the first one\" for strong powers; those powers are superspeed, and spells and telekinesis, respectively, which \"they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh\", [108] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that [70] Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict, which do not like the United States and the Avengers, and \"the Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice.\" [39] Because Marvel Studios shared the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants [39] Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, \"it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above.\" [39] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film [109] A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film [12]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began on Tuesday, February 11, 2014, in Johannesburg, South Africa, having been postponed that Monday [124] [126] Second unit crews shot action sequences without the main cast, to be used as background plates for scenes featuring the Hulk, in the Central Business District of Johannesburg for a period of two weeks [127] [128] By mid-March, principal photography had begun at Shepperton Studios near London and was scheduled to film there for at least four months, [129] [130] under the working title After Party [131] Filming at Shepperton as well as other locations in England allowed Whedon to get a \"number of different looks and textures and moods\" to give the film a different palette and fresh aesthetic from its predecessor [70] Production designer Charles Wood built an enormous, new Avengers Tower set, one of the largest sets ever built for a Marvel film The set featured multiple connected environments and levels [132] On March 22, production moved to Fort Bard, Italy and continued in the Aosta Valley region through March 28 The region doubled as the fictional Eastern European nation of Sokovia, [39] with crews replacing local storefronts with Cyrillic script [133] Filming in South Korea began on March 30 on the Mapo Bridge, [134] and continued through April 14 at various locations in Seoul, such as Cheongdam Bridge, Digital Media City, Gangnam Boulevard and road near Kaywon University of Art and Design in Uiwang [135] While in Seoul, the production was able to attach cameras to drones and race cars to get unique camera angles and footage [132] An artificial island on the Han River known as the Saebit Dungdungseom served as the headquarters of an IT institute featured in the film [136] Scenes involving Ultron's attack on parts of the city were shot in the Gangnam District [135]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn June 2014, the IMAX Corporation announced that the IMAX release of the film would be converted to IMAX 3D [150] Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgård, [61] Anthony Mackie, [53] Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films [58] However, Hiddleston's scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot \"didn't play\" and he did not want the film to feel \"overstuffed\" [86] According to Hiddleston, \"In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations.\" [151] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power [39] In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr Helen Cho [78] [152] Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios [153] In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film [79] [65] In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed to be part of the film's cast [59] [81] At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the \"Shawarma scene\" in The Avengers, explaining, \"It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right The first rule of making a sequel is take the best moments and do something else Don't do the Indiana Jones gun trick again differently Just go somewhere else Don't try to hit the same highs, because people will sense it.\" However, Feige clarified, \"There will be a tag  [shortly after the credits start] But there's not a post–post–credit scene.\" [59]\n\n\nMusic\nBrian Tyler signed on to compose the film's score in March 2014 He replaced Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for the first film, and Tyler's hiring marked his third collaboration with Marvel following Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World in 2013 [164] Tyler said the score would pay homage to John Williams' music for Star Wars (1977), Superman (1978), and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) while referencing the scores for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films in order to create a similar musical universe, saying, \"That's the goal for sure You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it.\" [165] Danny Elfman also contributed music to the score, [166] reprising Silvestri's theme from the first film to create a new hybrid theme [167] Hollywood Records released the album digitally on April 28, 2015, and in physical formats on May 19 [168]\n\n\nMarketing\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon introduced a teaser trailer for the film, which included a look at an Ultron helmet and a title treatment [169] Footage of the teaser, as well as a brief interview with Whedon, was

premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon said that he had completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a \"brother/sister act\" from the comic books, [105] later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch [106] [107] Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film that \"their powers are very visually interesting\", with problems which Whedon \"had on the first one\" for strong powers; those powers are superspeed, and spells and telekinesis, respectively, which \"they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh\", [108] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that [70] Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict, which do not like the United States and the Avengers, and \"the Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice.\" [39] Because Marvel Studios shared the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants [39] Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, \"it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above.\" [39] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film [109] A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film [12]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began on Tuesday, February 11, 2014, in Johannesburg, South Africa, having been postponed that Monday [124] [126] Second unit crews shot action sequences without the main cast, to be used as background plates for scenes featuring the Hulk, in the Central Business District of Johannesburg for a period of two weeks [127] [128] By mid-March, principal photography had begun at Shepperton Studios near London and was scheduled to film there for at least four months, [129] [130] under the working title After Party [131] Filming at Shepperton as well as other locations in England allowed Whedon to get a \"number of different looks and textures and moods\" to give the film a different palette and fresh aesthetic from its predecessor [70] Production designer Charles Wood built an enormous, new Avengers Tower set, one of the largest sets ever built for a Marvel film The set featured multiple connected environments and levels [132] On March 22, production moved to Fort Bard, Italy and continued in the Aosta Valley region through March 28 The region doubled as the fictional Eastern European nation of Sokovia, [39] with crews replacing local storefronts with Cyrillic script [133] Filming in South Korea began on March 30 on the Mapo Bridge, [134] and continued through April 14 at various locations in Seoul, such as Cheongdam Bridge, Digital Media City, Gangnam Boulevard and road near Kaywon University of Art and Design in Uiwang [135] While in Seoul, the production was able to attach cameras to drones and race cars to get unique camera angles and footage [132] An artificial island on the Han River known as the Saebit Dungdungseom served as the headquarters of an IT institute featured in the film [136] Scenes involving Ultron's attack on parts of the city were shot in the Gangnam District [135]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn June 2014, the IMAX Corporation announced that the IMAX release of the film would be converted to IMAX 3D [150] Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgård, [61] Anthony Mackie, [53] Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films [58] However, Hiddleston's scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot \"didn't play\" and he did not want the film to feel \"overstuffed\" [86] According to Hiddleston, \"In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations.\" [151] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power [39] In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr Helen Cho [78] [152] Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios [153] In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film [79] [65] In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed to be part of the film's cast [59] [81] At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the \"Shawarma scene\" in The Avengers, explaining, \"It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right The first rule of making a sequel is take the best moments and do something else Don't do the Indiana Jones gun trick again differently Just go somewhere else Don't try to hit the same highs, because people will sense it.\" However, Feige clarified, \"There will be a tag  [shortly after the credits start] But there's not a post–post–credit scene.\" [59]\n\n\nMusic\nBrian Tyler signed on to compose the film's score in March 2014 He replaced Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for the first film, and Tyler's hiring marked his third collaboration with Marvel following Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World in 2013 [164] Tyler said the score would pay homage to John Williams' music for Star Wars (1977), Superman (1978), and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) while referencing the scores for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films in order to create a similar musical universe, saying, \"That's the goal for sure You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it.\" [165] Danny Elfman also contributed music to the score, [166] reprising Silvestri's theme from the first film to create a new hybrid theme [167] Hollywood Records released the album digitally on April 28, 2015, and in physical formats on May 19 [168]\n\n\nMarketing\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon introduced a teaser trailer for the film, which included a look at an Ultron helmet and a title treatment [169] Footage of the teaser, as well as a brief interview with Whedon, was made available as part of Iron Man 3's second screen companion app for its Blu-ray release on September 24, 2013 [170] [171] On March 18, 2014, ABC aired a one-hour television special

announced a Lego video game adaptation of the first film and Age of Ultron for release in late 2015 on a variety of video game consoles [207] In March 2015, Disney said it planned to broaden its merchandising strategy with Avengers: Age of Ultron by expanding the target demographics to women and to fans of the individual superheroes that make up the Avengers Paul Gitter, senior vice president of Marvel licensing for Disney Consumer Products, said, \"For the first film, we primarily focused on the Avengers property and the group shots  [...] Now we're broadening the line and scope to create skews that focus on the team and the individuals characters, as well.\" Disney Consumer Products partnered with Hasbro, Lego, Hot Wheels, and Funko for action figures, playsets, and other toys, and with Under Armour for apparel Disney established new partnerships in the food and packaged-goods categories, including with Sage Fruit, ConAgra, Crunchpak, and Chobani [208] Walt Disney India's

{"title": "Moscow", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe city's name is thought to be derived from the Moskva River [24] [25] Theories of the origin of the name of the river have been proposed.\n\n\nHistory\nThe site of modern-day Moscow has been inhabited since prehistoric times Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture, which experts assign to the Neolithic period [36] They confirm that the first inhabitants of the area were hunters and gatherers Around 950 AD, two Slavic tribes, Vyatichi and Krivichi, settled here The Vyatichi may have formed the majority of Moscow's indigenous population [37]\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe site of modern-day Moscow has been inhabited since prehistoric times Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture,

The Vyatichi may have formed the majority of Moscow's indigenous population [37]\n\n\nEarly history (1147–1284)\nThe first known reference to Moscow was in 1147, as a meeting place of Yuri Dolgorukiy and Sviatoslav Olgovich At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality [38] In 1156, Dolgorukiy fortified the town by creating a wooden wall; this structure became the Kremlin [39] In the course of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus', the Mongols under Batu Khan burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants [citation needed]\n\n\nGrand Duchy (1283–1547)\nDaniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city that would eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s On the right bank of the Moskva River, at a distance of eight kilometres (5 mi) from the Kremlin, by 1282 Daniel founded the first monastery with the wooden church of St Daniel-Stylite, which is now the Danilov Monastery Daniel died in 1303, aged 42 Before his death, he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St Daniel Monastery.\n\n\nTsardom (1547–1721)\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, three circular defenses were built: Kitay-gorod, the White City and the Earthen City However, in 1547, fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the Crimean Tatars captured Moscow, burning everything except the Kremlin [43] The annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived.\n\n\nEmpire (1721–1917)\nAfter losing the status as capital, the population at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750 But after 1750, the population grew tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915 The 1770–1772 Russian plague killed up to 100,000 people in Moscow [48] By 1700, the building of cobbled roads had begun In 1730, permanent street lights were introduced, and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight In 1883, near the Prechistinskiye Gates, arc lamps were installed In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade 40 kilometres (25 mi) long, the Kamer-Kollezhskiy barrier, with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected Its line is traced today by several streets called val (\"ramparts\") In the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances From this gate, wooden and stone bridges stretched across the moat Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns – \"raskats\" The Tsar Cannon was located on the platform of the Lobnoye mesto The road connecting Moscow with St Petersburg, now the M10 highway, was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old Tver road, which had existed since the 16th century It became known as Peterburskoye Schosse after it was paved in the 1780s Petrovsky Palace was built in 1776–1780 by Matvey Kazakov Between 1781 and 1804 the Mytischinskiy water pipe (the first in Russia) was built.\n\n\nSoviet period (1917–1991)\nIn November 1917, upon learning of the uprising in Petrograd, Moscow's Bolsheviks began their uprising On 2 November (15), 1917, after heavy fighting, Soviet power was established in Moscow [50] Vladimir Lenin, fearing invasion, moved the capital back to Moscow on 12 March 1918 [51] The Kremlin once again became the seat of power, political centre of the new state.\n\n\n1991–present\nWhen the USSR was dissolved in 1991, Moscow remained the capital of the Russian Federation Since then, a market economy has emerged, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles The city continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935 Since then, however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments In 1995–97 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes.\n\n\nGeography\nMoscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River, which flows for just over 500 km (311 mi) through the East European Plain in central Russia, not far from the natural border of the forest and forest-steppe zone 49 bridges span the river and its canals within the city's limits The elevation of Moscow at the All-Russia Exhibition Center (VVC), where the leading Moscow weather station is situated, is 156 metres (512 feet) Teplostan Upland is the city's highest point at 255 metres (837 feet) [63] The width of Moscow city (not limiting MKAD) from west to east is 39.7 km (24.7 mi), and the length from north to south is 51.8 km (32.2 mi).\n\n\nLocation\nMoscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River,

international standards as Moscow Standard Time (MSK, МСК), which is 3 hours ahead of UTC, or UTC+3 Daylight saving time is no longer observed According to the geographical longitude the average solar noon in Moscow occurs at 12:30 [64]\n\n\nClimate\nMoscow has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb) with long, cold (although average by Russian standards) winters usually lasting from mid-November to the end of March, and warm summers More extreme continental climates at the same latitude – such as parts of Eastern Canada or Siberia – have much colder winters than Moscow, suggesting that there is still significant moderation from the Atlantic Ocean [citation needed] despite the fact that Moscow is far from the sea Weather can fluctuate widely, with temperatures ranging from −25 °C (−13 °F) in the city and −30 °C (−22 °F) in the suburbs to above 5 °C (41 °F) in the winter, and from 10 to 35 °C (50 to 95 °F) in the summer [65]\n\n\nPaleontology\nMoscow is one of the few cities with paleontological monuments of world significance on its territory [87] One of them is the Gorodnya River with its tributaries, on the banks of which outcrops of the Quaternary and older Cretaceous periods are located Fossils of the bivalve mollusk Inoceramus kleinii and tubular passages of burrowing animals, described in 2017 as a new ichnospecies Skolithos gorodnensis, were discovered in the Coniacian deposits near the stream bed of the Bolshaya Glinka River [87] Ichnogenera Diplocraterion, Planolites, Skolithos and possibly Ophiomorpha were found in the Albian deposits Paleolithic flint

residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area.\n\n\nPublic utilities\nThe heating of buildings in Moscow, like in other cities in Russia is done using central heating system Before 2004, state unitary enterprises were responsible to produce and supply heat to the clients by the operation of heating stations and heating distribution system of Mosgorteplo, Mosteploenergo, and Teploremontnaladka which gave service to the heating substations in the north-eastern part of the city Clients were divided between the various enterprises based on their geographical location A major reform launched in 2004 consolidated the various companies under the umbrella of MIPC which became the municipal heat supplier Its subsidiaries were the newly transformed Joint-stock companies The

realist art It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies Lazar Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilisation as they rode The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new \"Homo Sovieticus\" (Soviet man)

extensive tram system, which first opened in 1899 [214] The newest line was built in 1984 Its daily usage by Muscovites is low, making up for approximately 5% of trips because many vital connections in the network have been withdrawn Trams still remain important in some districts as feeders to Metro stations The trams also provide important cross-links between metro lines, for example between Universitet station of Sokolnicheskaya Line (#1 red line) and Profsoyuznaya station of Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line (#6 orange line) or between Voykovskaya and Strogino.\n\n\nTaxi\nCommercial taxi

in 2010's.\n\n\nMoscow Central Diameters\nAnother system, which forms \"genuine S-Bahn\" as in \"suburbia-city-suburbia\"-designed railway, is the Moscow Central Diameters, a pass-through railways system, created by constructing bypasses from \"vokzals\" final stations (e.g by avoiding the central stations of already existing Moscow Railway, used for both intercity and urban-suburban travel before) [219] and forming a train line across Moscow's centre.\n\n\nRoads\nThere are over 2.6 million cars in the city daily Recent years have seen growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and lack of parking space to become major problems.\n\n\nAir\nThere are five primary commercial airports serving Moscow: Sheremetyevo (SVO), Domodedovo (DME), Vnukovo (VKO), Zhukovsky (ZIA), Ostafyevo (OSF).\n\n\nWater\nMoscow has two passenger terminals, (South River Terminal and North River Terminal), on the river and regular ship routes and cruises along the Moskva and Oka rivers, which are used mostly for entertainment The North River Terminal, built in 1937, is the main hub for long-range river routes There are three freight ports serving Moscow.\n\n\nSharing system\nMoscow has different vehicle sharing options that are sponsored by the local government There are several car sharing companies which are in charge of providing cars to the population To drive the automobiles, the user has to book them through the app of the owning company In 2018 the mayor Sergey Sobyanin said Moscow's car sharing system has become the biggest in Europe in terms of vehicle fleet [223] Every day about 25,000 people use this service In the end of the same year Moscow carsharing became the second in the world in therms of fleet with 16.5K available vehicles [224] Another sharing system is bike sharing (Velobike) of a fleet formed by 3000 traditional and electrical bicycles [225] The Delisamokat is a new sharing service that provides electrical scooters [226]\n\n\nFuture development\nIn 1992, the Moscow government began planning a projected new part of central Moscow, the Moscow International Business Center, with the goal of creating a zone, the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe, [229] that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment Situated in Presnensky District and located at the Third Ring, the Moscow City area is under intense development The construction of the MIBC takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment The whole project takes up to one square kilometre (250 acres) The area is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.\n\n\nMedia\nMoscow is home to nearly all of Russia's nationwide television networks, radio stations, newspapers, and magazines.\n\n\nNewspapers\nEnglish-language media include The Moscow Times and Moscow News, which are, respectively, the largest [231]

history, spanning over eight centuries. From its humble beginnings as a medieval settlement to its current status as a global metropolis, Moscow has evolved into a vibrant and dynamic city that is home to over 13 million people. This article will explore the history, geography, culture, and economy of Moscow, as well as its transportation system, education, and media.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe city's name is thought to be derived from the Moskva River, which flows through the city. Theories of the origin of the name of the river have been proposed, but the exact meaning is still debated.\n\n**History**\n\nThe site of modern-day Moscow has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture, which experts assign to the Neolithic period. They confirm that the first inhabitants of the area were hunters and gatherers. Around 950 AD, two Slavic tribes, Vyatichi and Krivichi, settled here. The Vyatichi may have formed the majority of Moscow's indigenous population.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe site of modern-day Moscow has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture, which experts assign to the Neolithic period. They confirm that the first inhabitants of the area were hunters and gatherers.\n\n**Early History (1147-1284)**\n\nThe first known reference to Moscow was in 1147, as a meeting place of Yuri Dolgorukiy and Sviatoslav Olgovich. At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. In 1156, Dolgorukiy fortified the town by creating a wooden wall; this structure became the Kremlin.\n\n**Grand Duchy (1283-1547)**\n\nDaniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city that would eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s. On the right bank of the Moskva River, at a distance of eight kilometres (5 mi) from the Kremlin, by 1282 Daniel founded the first monastery with the wooden church of St Daniel-Stylite, which is now the Danilov Monastery.\n\n**Tsardom (1547-1721)**\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, three circular defenses were built: Kitay-gorod, the White City and the Earthen City. However, in 1547, fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the Crimean Tatars captured Moscow, burning everything except the Kremlin.\n\n**Empire (1721-1917)**\n\nAfter losing the status as capital, the population at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750. But after 1750, the population grew tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915.\n\n**Soviet Period (1917-1991)**\n\nIn November 1917, upon learning of the uprising in Petrograd, Moscow's Bolsheviks began their uprising. On 2 November (15), 1917, after heavy fighting, Soviet power was established in Moscow. Vladimir Lenin, fearing invasion, moved the capital back to Moscow on 12 March 1918.\n\n**1991-Present**\n\nWhen the USSR was dissolved in 1991, Moscow remained the capital of the Russian Federation. Since then, a market economy has emerged, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles.\n\n**Geography**\n\nMoscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River, which flows for just over 500 km (311 mi) through the East European Plain in central Russia, not far from the natural border of the forest and forest-steppe zone. 49 bridges span the river and its canals within the city's limits.\n\n**Location**\n\nMoscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River, which flows for just over 500 km (311 mi) through the East European Plain in central Russia, not far from the natural border of the forest and forest-steppe zone.\n\n**Time**\n\nMoscow serves as the reference point for the time zone used in most of European Russia, Belarus and the Republic of Crimea. The areas operate in what is referred to in international standards as Moscow Standard Time (MSK, МСК), which is 3 hours ahead of UTC, or UTC+3.\n\n**Climate**\n\nMoscow has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb) with long, cold (although average by Russian standards) winters usually lasting from mid-November to the end of March, and warm summers. More extreme continental climates at the same latitude – such as parts of Eastern Canada or Siberia – have much colder winters than Moscow.\n\n**Paleontology**\n\nMoscow is one of the few cities with paleontological monuments of world significance on its territory. One of them is the Gorodnya River with its tributaries, on the banks of which outcrops of the Quaternary and older Cretaceous periods are located.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAccording to the 2021 Russian census, the population was 13,010,112; up from 11,503,501 in the 2010 Russian census.\n\n**Ethnic groups**\n\n(87.4%)\n\n**Vital statistics**\n\nThe official population of Moscow is based on those holding \"permanent residency\".

outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe city's name is thought to be derived from the Moskva River [24] [25] Theories of the origin of the name of the river have been proposed.\n\n\nHistory\nThe site of modern-day Moscow has been inhabited since prehistoric times Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture, which experts assign to the Neolithic period [36] They confirm that the first inhabitants of the area were hunters and gatherers Around 950 AD, two Slavic tribes, Vyatichi and Krivichi, settled here The Vyatichi may have formed the majority of Moscow's indigenous population [37]\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe site of modern-day Moscow has been inhabited since prehistoric times Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture, which experts assign to the Neolithic period

Moscow's indigenous population [37]\n\n\nEarly history (1147–1284)\nThe first known reference to Moscow was in 1147, as a meeting place of Yuri Dolgorukiy and Sviatoslav Olgovich At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality [38] In 1156, Dolgorukiy fortified the town by creating a wooden wall; this structure became the Kremlin [39] In the course of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus', the Mongols under Batu Khan burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants [citation needed]\n\n\nGrand Duchy (1283–1547)\nDaniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city that would eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s On the right bank of the Moskva River, at a distance of eight kilometres (5 mi) from the Kremlin, by 1282 Daniel founded the first monastery with the wooden church of St Daniel-Stylite, which is now the Danilov Monastery Daniel died in 1303, aged 42 Before his death, he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St Daniel Monastery.\n\n\nTsardom (1547–1721)\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, three circular defenses were built: Kitay-gorod, the White City and the Earthen City However, in 1547, fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the Crimean Tatars captured Moscow, burning everything except the Kremlin [43] The annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived.\n\n\nEmpire (1721–1917)\nAfter losing the status as capital, the population at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750 But after 1750, the population grew tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915 The 1770–1772 Russian plague killed up to 100,000 people in Moscow [48] By 1700, the building of cobbled roads had begun In 1730, permanent street lights were introduced, and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight In 1883, near the Prechistinskiye Gates, arc lamps were installed In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade 40 kilometres (25 mi) long, the Kamer-Kollezhskiy barrier, with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected Its line is traced today by several streets called val (\"ramparts\") In the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances From this gate, wooden and stone bridges stretched across the moat Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns – \"raskats\" The Tsar Cannon was located on the platform of the Lobnoye mesto The road connecting Moscow with St Petersburg, now the M10 highway, was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old Tver road, which had existed since the 16th century It became known as Peterburskoye Schosse after it was paved in the 1780s Petrovsky Palace was built in 1776–1780 by Matvey Kazakov Between 1781 and 1804 the Mytischinskiy water pipe (the first in Russia) was built.\n\n\nSoviet period (1917–1991)\nIn November 1917, upon learning of the uprising in Petrograd, Moscow's Bolsheviks began their uprising On 2 November (15), 1917, after heavy fighting, Soviet power was established in Moscow [50] Vladimir Lenin, fearing invasion, moved the capital back to Moscow on 12 March 1918 [51] The Kremlin once again became the seat of power, political centre of the new state.\n\n\n1991–present\nWhen the USSR was dissolved in 1991, Moscow remained the capital of the Russian Federation Since then, a market economy has emerged, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles The city continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935 Since then, however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments In 1995–97 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes.\n\n\nGeography\nMoscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River, which flows for just over 500 km (311 mi) through the East European Plain in central Russia, not far from the natural border of the forest and forest-steppe zone 49 bridges span the river and its canals within the city's limits The elevation of Moscow at the All-Russia Exhibition Center (VVC), where the leading Moscow weather station is situated, is 156 metres (512 feet) Teplostan Upland is the city's highest point at 255 metres (837 feet) [63] The width of Moscow city (not limiting MKAD) from west to east is 39.7 km (24.7 mi), and the length from north to south is 51.8 km (32.2 mi).\n\n\nLocation\nMoscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River, which flows for just over 500 km (311 mi) through the

zone used in most of European Russia, Belarus and the Republic of Crimea The areas operate in what is referred to in international standards as Moscow Standard Time (MSK, МСК), which is 3 hours ahead of UTC, or UTC+3 Daylight saving time is no longer observed According to the geographical longitude the average solar noon in Moscow occurs at 12:30 [64]\n\n\nClimate\nMoscow has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb) with long, cold (although average by Russian standards) winters usually lasting from mid-November to the end of March, and warm summers More extreme continental climates at the same latitude – such as parts of Eastern Canada or Siberia – have much colder winters than Moscow, suggesting that there is still significant moderation from the Atlantic Ocean [citation needed] despite the fact that Moscow is far from the sea Weather can fluctuate widely, with temperatures ranging from −25 °C (−13 °F) in the city and −30 °C (−22 °F) in the suburbs to above 5 °C (41 °F) in the winter, and from 10 to 35 °C (50 to 95 °F) in the summer [65]\n\n\nPaleontology\nMoscow is one of the few cities with paleontological monuments of world significance on its territory [87] One of them is the Gorodnya River with its tributaries, on the banks of which outcrops of the Quaternary and older Cretaceous periods are located Fossils of the bivalve mollusk Inoceramus kleinii and tubular passages of burrowing animals, described in 2017 as a new ichnospecies Skolithos gorodnensis, were discovered in the Coniacian deposits near the stream bed of the Bolshaya Glinka River [87] Ichnogenera Diplocraterion, Planolites, Skolithos and possibly Ophiomorpha were found in the Albian deposits Paleolithic flint tools were discovered in the Quaternary deposits of the Bolshaya Glinka stream bed [87]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2021 Russian census, the population was 13,010,112; [6] up from 11,503,501 in the 2010 Russian census [93]\n\n\nPopulation\nAccording to the 2021

those holding \"permanent residency\" According to Russia's Federal Migration Service, Moscow holds 1.8 million official \"guests\" who have temporary residency on the basis of visas or other documentation, giving a legal population of 14.8 million The number of Illegal immigrants, the vast majority originating from Central Asia, is estimated to be an additional 1 million people, [103] giving a total population of about 15.8 million.\n\n\nReligion\nChristians form the majority of the city's population; most of whom adhere Russian Orthodox Church The Patriarch of Moscow serves as the head of the church and resides in the Danilov Monastery Moscow was called the \"city of 40 times 40 churches\"—prior to 1917 Moscow is Russia's capital of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which has been the country's traditional religion.\n\n\nCityscape\nMoscow's architecture is world-renowned Moscow is the site of Saint Basil's Cathedral, with its elegant onion domes, as well as the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the Seven Sisters The first Kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century.\n\n\nArchitecture\nMoscow's architecture is world-renowned Moscow is the site of Saint Basil's

landmarks\nThere are 96 parks and 18 gardens in Moscow, including four botanical gardens There are 450 square kilometres (170 sq mi) of green zones besides 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi) of forests [125] Moscow is a very green city, if compared to other cities of comparable size in Western Europe and North America; this is partly due to a history of having green \"yards\" with trees and grass, between residential buildings There are on average 27 square meters (290 sq ft) of parks per person in Moscow compared with 6 for Paris, 7.5 in London and 8.6 in New York [126]\n\n\nMoscow rings\nMoscow's road system is centered roughly on the Kremlin at the heart of the city From there, roads generally span outwards to intersect with a sequence of circular roads (\"rings\").\n\n\nTransport rings in Moscow\nOne of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the Tretyakov Gallery, which was founded by Pavel Tretyakov, a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city [136] The Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings The Old Tretyakov gallery, the original gallery in the Tretyakovskaya area on the south bank of the Moskva River, houses works in the classic Russian tradition [137] The works of famous pre-Revolutionary painters, such as Ilya Repin, as well as the works of early Russian icon painters can be found here Visitors can even see rare originals by early 15th-century iconographer Andrei Rublev [137]\nThe New Tretyakov gallery, created in Soviet times, mainly contains the works of Soviet artists, as well as of a few contemporary paintings, but there is some overlap with the Old Tretyakov Gallery for early 20th-century art The new gallery includes a small reconstruction of Vladimir Tatlin's famous Monument to the Third International and a mixture of other avant-garde works by artists like Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky Socialist realism features can also be found within the halls of the

Russian Federation, the legislative, executive, and judicial federal authorities of the country are located, with the exception of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, which has been located in Saint Petersburg since 2008.\n\n\nSafety\nIn a ranking of the safest cities by The Economist in 2019, Moscow occupied the 37th position with a score of 68.5 points percent [159] The general level of crime is quite low [160] More than 170,000 surveillance cameras in Moscow are connected to the facial recognition system The authorities recognized the successful two-month experiment with automatic recognition of faces, gender, and age of people in real-time – and deployed the system to the whole city The network of video surveillance unites access video cameras (95% of residential apartment buildings in the capital), cameras in the territory and in buildings of schools and kindergartens, at the MCC stations, stadiums, public transport stops, and bus stations, in parks, underground passages [161]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe entire city of Moscow is headed by one mayor (Sergey Sobyanin) The city of Moscow is divided into twelve administrative okrugs and 125

industries.\n\n\nCost of living\nDuring Soviet times, apartments were lent to people by the government according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes, and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors) Private ownership of apartments was limited until the 1990s when people were permitted to secure property rights to their inhabited places Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area.\n\n\nPublic utilities\nThe heating of buildings in Moscow, like in other cities in Russia is done using central heating system Before 2004, state unitary enterprises were responsible to produce and supply heat to the clients by the operation of heating stations and heating distribution system of Mosgorteplo, Mosteploenergo, and Teploremontnaladka which gave service to the heating substations in the north-eastern part of the city Clients were divided between the various enterprises based on their geographical location A major reform launched in 2004 consolidated the various companies under the umbrella of MIPC which became the municipal heat supplier Its subsidiaries were the newly transformed Joint-stock companies The city's main source of heating is the power station of Mosenergo which was reformed in 2005, when around ten subsidiaries were separated from it One of the newly independent companies was the District Heating Network Company (MTK) (Russian: Московская теплосетевая компания) In 2007 the Government of Moscow bought controlling stakes in the company [188]\n\n\nEducation\nThere are 1,696 high schools in Moscow, as well as 91 colleges [125] Besides these, there are 222 institutions of higher education,

faculties and 450 departments for study The Moscow State University library contains over nine million books, making it one of the largest libraries in all of Russia.\n\n\nTransportation\nThe Moscow Metro system is famous for its art, murals, mosaics, and ornate chandeliers It started operation in 1935 and immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and reward the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies Lazar Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilisation as they rode The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new \"Homo Sovieticus\" (Soviet man) [201]\n\n\nMetro\nThe Moscow Metro system is famous for its art, murals, mosaics, and ornate chandeliers It started

[201]\n\n\nMonorail\nThe Moscow Metro operates a short monorail line (line 13) The line connects Timiryazevskaya metro station and Ulitsa Sergeya Eisensteina, passing close to VDNH (and Line 6 Metro station \"V.D.N.Kh.\") The line opened in 2004 It accepts overground interchanges, no additional fare is needed if a ride was spent at Moscow Metro within previous 90 minutes.\n\n\nBus, trolleybus and electric bus\nAs Metro stations outside the city center are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to 4 kilometres (2.5 mi), a bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones Moscow has a bus terminal for long-range and intercity passenger buses (Central Bus Terminal) with a daily turnover of about 25 thousand passengers serving about 40% of long-range bus routes in Moscow [212]\n\n\nMoscow cable car\nOn 26 November 2018, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin took part in the ceremony to open the cable car above the Moskva River The cable car will connect the Luzhniki sports complex with Sparrow Hills and Kosygin Street The journey from the well-known viewpoint on Vorobyovy Gory to Luzhniki Stadium will last for five minutes instead of 20 minutes that one would have to spend on the same journey by car.\n\n\nTram\nMoscow has an extensive tram system, which first opened in 1899 [214] The newest line was built in 1984 Its daily usage by Muscovites is low, making up for approximately 5% of trips because many vital connections in the network have been withdrawn Trams still remain important in some districts as feeders to Metro stations The trams also provide important cross-links between metro lines, for example between Universitet station of Sokolnicheskaya Line (#1 red line) and Profsoyuznaya station of Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line (#6 orange line) or between Voykovskaya and Strogino.\n\n\nTaxi\nCommercial taxi services and route taxis are in widespread use In the mid-2010s, service platforms such as Yandex.Taxi, Uber and Gett displaced many private drivers and small service providers and were in 2015 servicing more than 50% of all taxi orders in Moscow [215] [216]\n\n\nRailway\n Several train stations serve the city Moscow's ten rail terminals (or vokzals) are:\n\n\nMoscow Central Circle\nThe Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga formed a ring around the now-downtown Moscow since 1903, but only served as a non-electrified, fueled locomotive-only railway prior to reconstruction into MCC in 2010's.\n\n\nMoscow Central Diameters\nAnother system, which forms \"genuine S-Bahn\" as in \"suburbia-city-suburbia\"-designed railway, is the Moscow Central Diameters, a pass-through railways system, created by constructing bypasses from \"vokzals\" final stations (e.g by avoiding the central stations of already existing Moscow Railway, used for both intercity and urban-suburban travel before) [219] and forming a train line across Moscow's centre.\n\n\nRoads\nThere are over 2.6 million cars in the city daily Recent years have seen growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and lack of parking space to become major problems.\n\n\nAir\nThere are five primary commercial airports serving Moscow: Sheremetyevo (SVO), Domodedovo (DME), Vnukovo (VKO), Zhukovsky (ZIA), Ostafyevo (OSF).\n\n\nWater\nMoscow has two passenger terminals, (South River Terminal and North River Terminal), on the river and regular ship routes and cruises along the Moskva and Oka rivers, which are used mostly for entertainment The North River Terminal, built in 1937, is the main hub for long-range river routes There are three freight ports serving Moscow.\n\n\nSharing system\nMoscow has different vehicle sharing options that are sponsored by the local government There are several car sharing companies which are in charge of providing cars to the population To drive the automobiles, the user has to book them through the app of the owning company In 2018 the mayor Sergey Sobyanin said Moscow's car sharing system has become the biggest in Europe in terms of vehicle fleet [223] Every day about 25,000 people use this service In the end of the same year Moscow carsharing became the second in the world in therms of fleet with 16.5K available vehicles [224] Another sharing system is bike sharing (Velobike) of a fleet formed by 3000 traditional and electrical bicycles [225] The Delisamokat is a new sharing service that provides electrical scooters [226]\n\n\nFuture development\nIn 1992, the Moscow government began planning a projected new part of central Moscow, the Moscow International Business Center, with the goal of creating a zone, the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe, [229] that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment Situated in Presnensky District and located at the Third Ring, the Moscow City area is under intense development The construction of the MIBC takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment The whole project takes up to one square kilometre (250 acres) The area is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.\n\n\nMedia\nMoscow is home to nearly all of Russia's nationwide television networks, radio stations, newspapers, and magazines.\n\n\nNewspapers\nEnglish-language media include The Moscow Times and Moscow News, which are, respectively, the largest [231] and oldest English-language weekly newspapers in all of Russia Kommersant, Vedomosti and Novaya Gazeta are Russian-language media headquartered in Moscow Kommersant and Vedomosti are among the country's leading and oldest Russian-language business newspapers.\n\n\nTV and radio\nOther media in Moscow include the Echo of Moscow, the first Soviet and Russian private news radio and information agency, and NTV, one of the first privately owned Russian television stations The total number of radio

The series was played between the American League East (AL East) champion Houston Astros and the AL Wild Card winner Boston Red Sox. The Astros won the series, 4–2.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Boston Red Sox qualified for the postseason as the first wild card team in the American League. They defeated the New York Yankees in the Wild Card Game and then defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in four games in the Division Series. This was Boston's 12th appearance in the American League Championship Series (ALCS), having accrued a 6–5 record in prior appearances.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe Astros won the series, 4–2.\n\n**Game Summaries**\n\n### Game 1\n\nFramber Valdez of the Astros was matched up against Chris Sale of the Red Sox, but the game would soon turn into a bullpen affair. The Red Sox loaded the bases with two outs in the top of the first, but were unable to score. The Astros scored a run in the bottom of the first; José Altuve, who had drawn a leadoff walk, scored on a sacrifice fly by Yordan Álvarez. In the bottom of the second, Houston loaded the bases with one out but did not score. A leadoff home run by Kiké Hernández in the top of the third tied the game.

With two out in the top of the third, Yimi García relieved Houston starter Framber Valdez. In the bottom of the frame, Sale left with two on and two out, relieved by Adam Ottavino. The game stayed this way for the next few innings as both teams would use seven relievers. A two-run homer by Altuve off of Tanner Houck with two out in the bottom of the sixth tied the game, 3–3.

Carlos Correa put Houston ahead, 4–3, with a solo home run in the bottom of the seventh off of Hansel Robles. After the Astros loaded the bases with none out in the bottom of the eighth off of Red Sox reliever Hirokazu Sawamura, an Altuve sacrifice fly gave Houston a 5–3 lead.

Pressly then retired the next three batters, giving Houston the win and a 1–0 lead in the series.\n\n### Game 2\n\nBoston tied the series at one game each, with a 9–5 win in Game 2.

It was the first postseason grand slam in the first inning by a Red Sox player since J D Drew in 2007 ALCS Game 6. García left early in the top of the second due to knee discomfort. Rafael Devers hit a second grand slam in the top of the second, making the Red Sox the first team in postseason history to hit two grand slams in one game.

Sale took the loss, having pitched 5+1⁄3 innings while allowing four runs (two earned) on three hits and two walks while striking out seven batters. Valdez went eight innings and got the win, limiting Boston to one run on three hits and a walk while striking out five. He became the seventh visiting pitcher to go at least eight innings while allowing one run or fewer at Fenway Park in the postseason, and the first since Charles Nagy in the 1998 ALDS. The Astros took a 3–2 lead in the series, the third ALCS in a row to go at least six games.\n\n### Game 6\n\nLuis García started for Houston and Nathan Eovaldi for Boston, a rematch of Game 2. The Astros took a 1–0 lead in the bottom of the first; with two outs, Alex Bregman singled then was driven in on a double by Yordan Álvarez that hit off the glove of Red Sox center fielder Kiké Hernández. In the bottom of the fourth, Houston had runners on second and third with no outs, but Eovaldi struck out the next two batters, intentionally walked Yuli Gurriel, and then struck out Chas McCormick to end the threat. Eovaldi left with one out in the bottom of the fifth, having allowed one run on five hits while striking out four; he was relieved by Josh Taylor. García held the Red Sox hitless through five innings; he left in the top of the sixth after allowing a two-out triple to Hernández. His no-hit bid of 5+2⁄3 innings before allowing a hit was the second most by a rookie pitcher in postseason history. García was relieved by Phil Maton, who ended the threat by getting Rafael Devers to pop out. Álvarez opened the bottom of the sixth with a triple off of Taylor near the right-field line. After Carlos Correa was hit by a pitch from Tanner Houck, Kyle Tucker grounded into a double play, scoring Álvarez and giving Houston a 2–0 lead.

Network merged under Peacock in March [4]\n\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that began affecting the industry in mid-March 2020, WWE had to present the majority of its programming from a behind closed doors set Initially, Raw and SmackDown's television shows and pay-pew-views were done at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida [5] A limited number of Performance Center trainees and friends and family members of the wrestlers were later utilized to serve as the live audience [6] [7] In late August, these programs were moved to a bio-secure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome The select live audience was no longer utilized as the bubble allowed fans to attend the events virtually for free and be seen on the nearly 1,000 LED boards within the arena Additionally, the ThunderDome utilized various special effects to further enhance wrestlers' entrances, and arena audio was mixed with that of the chants from the virtual fans After being hosted at Orlando's Amway Center, [8] the ThunderDome was relocated to Tropicana Field in St Petersburg, Florida in December [9]\n\n\nStorylines\nThe event comprised seven matches, including one on the pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, [11] [12] while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown [13]\n\n\nEvent\nDuring the WrestleMania Backlash Kickoff pre-show, United States Champion Sheamus faced Ricochet in a non-title match In the end, Sheamus performed a Knee Strike on Ricochet to win the match [26]\n\n\nPre-show\nDuring the WrestleMania Backlash Kickoff pre-show, United States Champion Sheamus faced Ricochet in a

Championship against Charlotte Flair and Asuka In the closing moments, after an evenly competitive match between the three, Ripley performed the Riptide on Asuka to retain the title [27]\n\n\nMain event\nIn the main event, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Cesaro Throughout the match, Reigns targeted Cesaro's right arm, thus preventing Cesaro from doing his upper cuts and not being able to fully apply other maneuvers In the climax, Reigns applied the Guillotine Choke submission on Cesaro, who passed out, thus Reigns retained the title via technical submission After the match, Cesaro was attacked by Jey Uso Seth Rollins then came out After a stare down with Reigns, Rollins viciously attacked Cesaro and smashed his right arm in a steel chair [27]\n\n\nReception\nThe event received mixed to positive reviews While most of the pay-per-view was well received, the marketing tie-in with Army of the Dead during the Damian Priest vs The Miz

wrestling event produced by WWE, which took place on May 16, 2021. The event was held at the WWE ThunderDome in Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. It was the 16th Backlash event and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions.\n\nProduction\n----------\n\nBacklash is a recurring professional wrestling event that was established by WWE in 1999. It was held annually from 1999 to 2009, but was then discontinued until it was reinstated in 2016 and has been held every year since, except in 2019. The original concept of the event was based around the backlash from WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania, but the events between 2016 and 2020 did not carry this theme. The 2021 Backlash was initially scheduled for June 20, but it was revealed that Backlash would take place on May 16 and would be titled \"WrestleMania Backlash\", thus returning the event to its original concept and featuring the backlash from WrestleMania 37.\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n-------------------------------\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that began affecting the industry in mid-March 2020, WWE had to present the majority of its programming from a behind closed doors set. Initially, Raw and SmackDown's television shows and pay-per-views were done at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. A limited number of Performance Center trainees and friends and family members of the wrestlers were later utilized to serve as the live audience. In late August, these programs were moved to a bio-secure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome. The select live audience was no longer utilized as the bubble allowed fans to attend the events virtually for free and be seen on the nearly 1,000 LED boards within the arena. Additionally, the ThunderDome utilized various special effects to further enhance wrestlers' entrances, and arena audio was mixed with that of the chants from the virtual fans.\n\nStorylines\n------------\n\nThe event comprised seven matches, including one on the pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.\n\nEvent\n------\n\nDuring the WrestleMania Backlash Kickoff pre-show, United States Champion Sheamus faced Ricochet in a non-title match.

In the closing moments, after an evenly competitive match between the three, Ripley performed the Riptide on Asuka to retain the title.\n\nMain event\n----------\n\nIn the main event, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Cesaro. Throughout the match, Reigns targeted Cesaro's right arm, thus preventing Cesaro from doing his upper cuts and not being able to fully apply other maneuvers. In the climax, Reigns applied the Guillotine Choke submission on Cesaro, who passed out, thus Reigns retained the title via technical submission. After the match, Cesaro was attacked by Jey Uso. Seth Rollins then came out. After a stare down with Reigns, Rollins viciously attacked Cesaro and smashed his right arm in a steel chair.\n\nReception\n----------\n\nThe event received mixed to positive reviews. While most of the pay-per-view was well received, the marketing tie-in with Army of the Dead during the Damian Priest vs The Miz Lumberjack match was heavily panned.

The novel is a post-apocalyptic tale that weaves together multiple storylines set before and after a flu pandemic that wipes out most of humanity. The book explores themes of art, memory, and the power of storytelling in the face of disaster.\n\n**Plot Summary**\n\nThe novel begins with a production of King Lear at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto. Jeevan Chaudhary, a paramedic, is attending the play with his friend Arthur Leander, who is playing the title role. During the performance, Arthur suffers a heart attack and dies. Jeevan tries to resuscitate him but is unsuccessful. As the news of Arthur's death spreads, the actors and crew gather to mourn, unaware of the larger disaster that is about to unfold.\n\nA few days later, Jeevan receives a call from his friend, a doctor who warns him to get out of the city. A mysterious and deadly flu is spreading rapidly, and the doctor believes it will soon become a full-blown pandemic. Jeevan loads up on supplies and heads to his brother's house in the suburbs, where he will wait out the crisis.\n\nAs the flu pandemic spreads, many of the actors and crew from the King Lear production die within the next three weeks. The novel then jumps forward in time to the post-apocalyptic world, where Kirsten Raymonde, a young actress from the play, is one of the few survivors. Kirsten is part of a traveling performance troupe that roams the ruins of civilization, performing Shakespearean plays for small groups of survivors.\n\nThroughout the novel, Mandel weaves together multiple storylines, including Kirsten's, Jeevan's, and Arthur's, as well as those of other characters, such as Clark Thompson, a famous actor who becomes stranded in an airport, and Kirsten's love interest, Tyler Durden, a charismatic leader in a traveling troupe.\n\nThe novel explores themes of art, memory, and the power of storytelling in the face of disaster. Mandel argues that even in the darkest of times, art and culture can provide a sense of hope and meaning. The novel also explores the idea that memory and history are fragile and can be lost in the face of catastrophe.\n\n**Main Characters**\n\nThe novel has a large cast of characters, each with their own unique story and motivations. Some of the main characters include:\n\n* Jeevan Chaudhary, a paramedic who tries to resuscitate Arthur Leander and then flees the city to escape the flu pandemic.\n* Kirsten Raymonde, a young actress from the King Lear production who becomes a member of a traveling performance troupe in the post-apocalyptic world.\n* Arthur Leander, a famous actor who dies of a heart attack during the King Lear production.\n* Clark Thompson, a famous actor who becomes stranded in an airport.\n* Tyler Durden, a charismatic leader in a traveling troupe who becomes Kirsten's love interest.\n\n**Genre**\n\nStation Eleven is often classified as a science fiction novel, but Mandel has stated that she does not believe the novel belongs to that genre. The novel does not include any instances of fictional technology, and Mandel argues that the novel is more accurately classified as literary fiction.\n\nThe novel has also been discussed as \"theatre-fiction,\" a term that refers to novels that explore the relationship between theatre and art. Mandel's use of Shakespearean plays and performances as a way to explore themes of art, memory, and culture in the face of disaster is a key aspect of the novel.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe novel received positive reviews from critics, with many praising its unique blend of science fiction and literary fiction elements. The novel was also praised for its exploration of themes such as art, memory, and the power of storytelling.\n\nSome critics faulted the novel for its lack of clear plot and characters, but overall, the novel was well-received by critics and readers alike.\n\n**Awards**\n\nThe novel won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2015, beating out novels such as The Girl with All the Gifts and Memory of Water. The committee highlighted the novel's focus on the survival of human culture after an apocalypse, as opposed to the survival of humanity.\n\nThe novel also won the Toronto Book Award in 2015.\n\n**Adaptation**\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that a film adaptation of the novel was in development by Scott Steindorff. The project is currently in development, but no release date has been announced.\n\nOverall, Station Eleven is a unique and powerful novel that explores themes of art, memory, and the power of storytelling in the face of disaster. The novel's blend of science fiction and literary fiction elements makes it a standout in the genre, and its exploration of the human condition in the face of catastrophe is both haunting and thought-provoking.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Station_Eleven\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot summary\nDuring a production of King Lear at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto, aspiring paramedic Jeevan Chaudhary watches as the actor playing Lear, Arthur Leander, has a heart attack Jeevan tries to resuscitate Arthur but is unsuccessful Instead, Jeevan comforts one of the child actors in the production, Kirsten Raymonde After leaving the play, Jeevan goes for a walk in the snow and receives a call from his old friend who is a doctor in Toronto He warns Jeevan to get out of the city, as the mysterious and deadly Georgia Flu is spreading rapidly and will soon become a full-blown pandemic Jeevan loads up on supplies and goes to stay with his brother Frank Many of the actors and others that had gathered to mourn Arthur's death die within the next three weeks.\n\n\nMain characters\nAlthough many publications classified the novel as science fiction, [12] [13] [14] Mandel does not believe that the work belongs to that genre, as the novel does not include any instances of fictional technology [15] [16] She said the issue of labeling her work science fiction (as opposed to literary fiction) has followed her through all her novels [15] Her early work was classified as crime fiction, and she has stated she consciously chose to avoid overtones of mystery and crime in this work in order to avoid being \"pigeonholed\" as a mystery novelist [15] Station Eleven has also been discussed as \"theatre-fiction\" [17]\n\n\nGenre\nAlthough many publications classified the novel as science fiction, [12] [13] [14] Mandel does not believe that the work belongs to that genre, as the novel does not include any instances of fictional technology [15] [16] She said the issue of labeling her work science fiction (as opposed to literary fiction) has followed her through all her novels [15] Her early work was classified as crime fiction, and she has stated she consciously chose to avoid overtones of mystery and crime in this work in order to avoid being \"pigeonholed\" as a mystery novelist [15] Station Eleven has also been discussed as \"theatre-fiction\" [17]\n\n\nReception\nAccording to Book Marks, the book received \"positive\" reviews based on six critic reviews with three being \"rave\" and two being \"positive\" and one being \"mixed\" [18] On Bookmarks November/December 2014 issue, a magazine that aggregates critic reviews of books, the book received a  (3.5 out of 5) based on critic reviews with a critical summary saying, \"A few critics faulted the leaps of logic and characters who lack a \"penetrating sense of the day-to-day struggle of vulnerable human beings lacking the basic amenities of life\" (New York Times Book Review), but these are small missteps in this \"book about gratitude, about life right now, if we can live to look back on it\" (Minneapolis Star Tribune)\" [19] [20]\n\n\nAwards\nThe novel won the Arthur C Clarke Award in May 2015, beating novels including The Girl with All the Gifts and Memory of Water [21] The committee highlighted the novel's focus on the survival of human culture after an apocalypse, as opposed to the survival of humanity [21] The novel won the Toronto Book Award in October 2015 [22]\n\n\nAdaptation\nIn 2015, it was announced that a film adaptation of the novel was in development by Scott Steindorff [25]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
