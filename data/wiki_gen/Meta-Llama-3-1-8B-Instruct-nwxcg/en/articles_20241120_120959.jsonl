This feature ensures that web pages and applications are rendered correctly, even on high DPI screens.\n\n### Prerender and Prefetch\n\nIE11 includes support for prerender and prefetch, which enable web browsers to pre-load web pages and resources in the background, improving page load times and overall user experience.\n\n### Additional Features\n\nIE11 also supports several other features and enhancements, including:\n\n* Full Screen and Orientation APIs\n* CSS border image support\n* JavaScript enhancements\n* DOM mutation observers\n* Web Cryptography API\n* Video text track support\n* Encrypted media support\n* Improved HTML editor\n\nThese features and enhancements make IE11 a more capable and feature-rich web browser, providing a better user experience for web developers and users alike.\n\n**Removed Features**\n\nWhile IE11 introduces several new features and enhancements, it also removes some features that were present in earlier versions of Internet Explorer. Some of the features that are no longer supported in IE11 include:\n\n### Speed Improvements\n\nDespite the removal of some features, IE11 is reported to be faster and more efficient than earlier versions of Internet Explorer. In a review by SitePoint, IE11 scored better than Google Chrome 30 and Firefox 26 in WebKit's SunSpider test and Google's WebGL test. It also tied with Chrome for fastest in Microsoft's \"fish aquarium\" benchmark for WebGL and came last in Google's V8 performance benchmark.\n\n### Memory Usage\n\nIE11 is also reported to use less memory than contemporary versions of Chrome and Firefox, even with multiple tabs open. This makes it a more efficient and resource-friendly web browser.\n\n**Performance**\n\nThe performance of IE11 is a significant improvement over earlier versions of Internet Explorer. The browser's speed and efficiency make it a viable option for users who value performance and responsiveness.\n\n### Speed Benchmarks\n\nIE11 has been tested and benchmarked against other web browsers, including Google Chrome and Firefox. In a review by SitePoint, IE11 scored better than Google Chrome 30 and Firefox 26 in WebKit's SunSpider test and Google's WebGL test. It also tied with Chrome for fastest in Microsoft's \"fish aquarium\" benchmark for WebGL and came last in Google's V8 performance benchmark.\n\n### Memory Benchmarks\n\nIE11 has also been tested and benchmarked against other web browsers in terms of memory usage. In a review by SitePoint, IE11 was reported to use less memory than contemporary versions of Chrome and Firefox, even with multiple tabs open.\n\n**History**\n\nThe development and release of IE11 is a significant event in the history of Internet Explorer. The browser's release is closely tied to the development and release of Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\n### First Preview Release\n\nThe first preview version of IE11 was released in June 2013, during the Build 2013 conference. This release was a significant milestone in the development of IE11, marking the beginning of a new era for the browser.\n\n### Developer Preview Release\n\nOn July 25, 2013, Microsoft released the developer preview of Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. This release provided developers with a preview of the new features and enhancements included in IE11.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Internet Explorer\n* Microsoft\n* Windows\n* Windows 8.1\n* Windows Server 2012 R2\n* WebGL\n* CSS\n* JavaScript\n* DOM mutation observers\n* Web Cryptography API\n* Video text track support\n* Encrypted media support\n* Improved HTML editor\n\n**References**\n\n* Microsoft.

The concept of a geographic center is not unique to the United States, as many countries have their own geographic centers. However, the geographic center of the United States is particularly significant due to its size and the fact that it encompasses a diverse range of landscapes and cultures.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe geographic center of the United States is distinct from the contiguous geographic center, which has not changed since the 1912 admissions of New Mexico and Arizona to the 48 contiguous United States. The contiguous geographic center is located near the town of Lebanon, Kansas, and has served as the overall geographic center of the 48 contiguous United States for 47 years. However, the 1959 admissions of Alaska and Hawaii moved the geographic center of the overall United States approximately 550 miles (885 km) northwest by north.\n\n## Contiguous United States\n\nThe geographic center of the 48 contiguous or conterminous United States was determined in a 1918 survey by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. The survey found that the center of the contiguous United States is located at 39°50′N 98°35′W, which is about 2.6 miles (4.2 km) northwest of the center of Lebanon, Kansas. The location is approximately 12 miles (19 km) south of the Kansas–Nebraska border.\n\nThe determination of the geographic center of the contiguous United States is accurate to about 20 miles (32 km). The method used by the surveyors in 1918 was a cardboard cutout shaped like the U.S., which was balanced on a point to determine the center. This method was accurate for its time but is no longer considered a reliable method by modern geodetic standards.\n\n## Marker\n\nIn order to protect the privacy of the private landowner where the point identified by the 1918 survey falls, a proxy marker was erected in 1940 about half a mile (800 m) away. The proxy marker is located at the 130/AA intersection (39°49′42″N 98°34′47″W). The proxy marker serves as a substitute for the original marker, which was likely removed to protect the landowner's property.\n\n## Method of Measurement\n\nThe United States Coast and Geodetic Survey used a unique method to determine the geographic center of the contiguous United States in 1918. The method involved balancing a cardboard cutout shaped like the U.S. on a point to determine the center. This method was accurate for its time but is no longer considered a reliable method by modern geodetic standards.\n\nThe use of a cardboard cutout to determine the geographic center of the United States may seem unconventional by modern standards. However, the method was a common practice in the early 20th century, and it was considered a reliable method at the time. The fact that the geographic center of the contiguous United States has remained unchanged since the 1918 survey suggests that the method was accurate enough to determine the center of the contiguous United States.\n\n## Cultural References\n\nThe geographic center of the contiguous United States has been referenced in various forms of media, including literature and film. In Neil Gaiman's novel \"American Gods,\" the geographic center of the contiguous United States is mentioned as a neutral ground where the modern and the old gods can meet despite the war between them.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Geographic center of the contiguous United States\n* United States Coast and Geodetic Survey\n* Lebanon, Kansas\n* 130/AA intersection\n\n## References\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n## External Links\n\n* Geographic Center of the United States, U.S. Geological Survey\n* Geographic Center of the Contiguous United States, U.S. Geological Survey", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Geographic_center_of_the_United_States\" following this outline:\n\n\nOverview\nThis is distinct from the contiguous geographic center, which has not changed since the 1912 admissions of New Mexico and Arizona to the 48 contiguous United States, and falls near the town of Lebanon, Kansas This served as the overall geographic center of the United States for 47 years, until the 1959 admissions of Alaska and Hawaii moved the geographic center of the overall United States approximately 550 miles (885 km) northwest by north.\n\n\nContiguous United States\nThe geographic center of the 48 contiguous or conterminous United States, determined in a 1918 survey, is located at 39°50′N 98°35′W﻿ / ﻿39.833°N 98.583°W﻿ / 39.833; -98.583﻿ (1918 geographic Center of the Contiguous United States), about 2.6 miles (4.2 km) northwest of the center of Lebanon, Kansas, approximately 12 miles (19 km) south of the Kansas–Nebraska border [4] The determination is accurate to about 20 miles (32 km) [5]\n\n\nMarker\nIn order to protect the privacy of the private land owner where the point identified by the 1918 survey falls, [5] a proxy marker was erected in 1940 about half a mile (800 m) away, at the 130/AA intersection (39°49′42″N 98°34′47″W﻿ / ﻿39.8282°N 98.5796°W﻿ / 39.8282; -98.5796﻿ (Center of the United States, Proxy Marker)) [8]\n\n\nMethod of measurement\nIn 1918, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey found this location by balancing on a point a cardboard cutout shaped like the U.S [10] This method was accurate to within 20 miles (32 km), but while the Geodetic Survey no longer endorses any location as the center of the U.S., the identification of Lebanon, Kansas, has remained [9] [5]\n\n\nCultural references\nThe geographic center of the contiguous United States is mentioned in Neil Gaiman's American Gods as a neutral ground where the modern and the old gods can meet despite the war between them.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

before the Series started In 2014 Little League voted to change the age cutoff from April 30 to December 31 However, this caused outrage by parents because the players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005 would have lost their 12-year-old season because they would be considered to be 13 years old even though they have not reached their 13th birthday Effective November 2015, a new implementation plan was established, which \"grandfathered\" players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005 as 12-year-olds for the 2018 season, using April 30 age determination date for the 2018

old, with the top teams from around the world competing in a week-long event held in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The tournament is organized by Little League International and is considered one of the most prestigious youth baseball tournaments in the world.\n\n**Qualifying tournaments**\n\nIn the summer months leading up to the Little League World Series, held each year in August, Little Leagues around the world select All-Star teams made up of players from each league. It is these All-Star teams that compete in district, sectional, and/or divisional, and regional tournaments, hoping to advance to Williamsport for the Little League World Series. The number of games a team has to play varies from region to region. In the United States, the tournaments at the lowest (district) level lack nationwide standardization, with some using pool play or double elimination, while others use single elimination.\n\n**Regions**\n\nBeginning with the 2022 tournament, 10 regional tournament winners compete in the United States bracket of the Little League World Series. The states those regional champions could possibly hail from are as listed below using U.S state abbreviations: AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY, and DC. There are 53 total U.S entrants that compete in the 10 regional tournaments: two from Texas, two from California, and one each from the remaining 48 U.S states, and one from the District of Columbia.\n\n**World Series tournament format**\n\nCurrently, the Little League World Series consists of 20 teams: 10 from the United States, and 10 from other countries. The U.S and international teams play in separate brackets, in a double-elimination format. The winners of each bracket then play each other for the LLWS championship game.\n\n**Venues**\n\nTwo venues host World Series games: Howard J Lamade Stadium and Little League Volunteer Stadium. Lamade Stadium has hosted games since 1959 and added lights in 1992. Volunteer Stadium opened in 2001 when the field expanded to 16 teams. Prior to 1959, the Little League World Series was held at Original Little League on West Fourth Street in Williamsport.\n\n**Age requirements**\n\nFrom 1947 to 2005, the age limit for players was set at children who turned 13 on August 1 of that year or later. In 2006, the age limit was loosened to include players who turn 13 after April 30. As the Series takes place in August, this led to many of the players having already turned 13 before the Series started. In 2014 Little League voted to change the age cutoff from April 30 to December 31. However, this caused outrage by parents because the players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005 would have lost their 12-year-old season because they would be considered to be 13 years old even though they have not reached their 13th birthday. Effective November 2015, a new implementation plan was established, which \"grandfathered\" players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005 as 12-year-olds for the 2018 season, using April 30 age determination date for the 2018 season.

{"title": "Louis_XVI", "content": "\nChildhood\nLouis-Auguste de France, who was given the title Duke of Berry at birth, was born in the Palace of Versailles on 23 August 1754 One of seven children, he was the second surviving son of Louis, the Dauphin of France and the grandson of Louis XV and of his consort, Maria Leszczyńska His mother was Marie-Josèphe of Saxony, the daughter of Augustus III, Prince-elector of Saxony and King of Poland and Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria.\n\n\nMarriage and family life\nOn 19 April 1770, at the age of fifteen, Louis XVI married the fourteen-year-old Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria, his second cousin once removed and the youngest daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Francis I and Empress Maria Theresa [13]\n\n\nAbsolute monarch of France (1774–1789)\nWhen Louis XVI acceded to the throne in 1774, he was nineteen years old He had an enormous responsibility, as the government was deeply in debt, and resentment of despotic monarchy was on the rise His predecessor, his grandfather Louis XV, had been widely hated by the time of his death The public remembered him as an irresponsible man who spent his time womanizing rather than administrating [27] Furthermore, the monarchy had poured money into a series of unsuccessful foreign military campaigns, leaving France in a state of financial difficulty [28] The young Louis XVI felt woefully unqualified to resolve the situation.\n\n\nEconomic policies\nRadical financial reforms by Anne Robert Jacques Turgot and Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes angered the nobles and were blocked by the parlements who insisted that the King did not have the legal right to levy new taxes So, in 1776, Turgot was dismissed and Malesherbes resigned, to be replaced by Jacques Necker Necker supported the American Revolution, and he carried out a policy of taking out large international loans instead of raising taxes He attempted to gain public favor in 1781 by publishing the first ever accounting of the French Crown's expenses and accounts, the Compte-rendu au Roi This misleading publication led the people of France to believe the kingdom ran a modest surplus [32] When this policy of hiding and ignoring the kingdom's financial woes failed miserably, Louis dismissed and replaced him in 1783 with Charles Alexandre de Calonne, who increased public spending to \"buy\" the country's way out of debt Again this failed, so Louis convoked the Assembly of Notables in 1787 to discuss a revolutionary new fiscal reform proposed by Calonne When the nobles were informed of the true extent of the debt, they were shocked and rejected the plan.\n\n\nRoyal spending\nThe Menus-Plaisirs du Roi was under the direction of Papillon de la Ferté and he gave details in his journal about the costs of the performances over the years 1756–1780 in three different palaces [34] The wedding in 1771 was especially costly The performance of Castor et Pollux in 1779 when he was visited by his brother-in-law, Joseph II, involved more than 500 people.\nRoyal household spending in 1788 was 13% of total state expenses (excluding interest on debts) [35] [36]\n\n\nForeign policy\nFrench involvement in the Seven Years' War had left Louis XVI a disastrous inheritance Britain's victories had seen them capture most of France's colonial territories While some were returned to France at the Treaty of Paris (1763), almost all of New France was ceded to the British, or to France's Spanish allies to compensate them for losses to the British.\n\n\nConcerning the American Revolution and Europe\nIn the spring of 1776, Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, saw an opportunity to humiliate France's long-standing enemy, Great Britain, and to recover territory lost during the Seven Years' War, by supporting the American Revolution In the same year Louis was persuaded by Pierre Beaumarchais to send supplies, ammunition, and guns to the rebels secretly Early in 1778 he signed a formal Treaty of Alliance, and later that year France went to war with Britain In deciding in favor of war, despite France's large financial problems, the King was materially influenced by alarmist reports after the Battle of Saratoga, which suggested that Britain was preparing to make huge concessions to the Thirteen Colonies and then, allied with them, to strike at French and Spanish possessions in the West Indies [38] Spain and the Netherlands soon joined the French in an anti-British coalition After 1778, Great Britain switched its focus to the West Indies, as defending the sugar islands was considered more important than trying to recover the Thirteen Colonies France and Spain planned to invade the British Isles themselves with the Armada of 1779, but the operation never went ahead.\n\n\nConcerning Asia\nLouis XVI hoped to use the American Revolutionary War as an opportunity to expel the British from India [37] In 1782, he sealed an alliance with the Peshwa Madhavrao II As a consequence, the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau moved his troops to the Isle de France (now Mauritius) and later contributed to the French effort in India in 1783 [37] [43] Pierre André de Suffren became the ally of Hyder Ali in the Second Anglo-Mysore War against the British East India Company from 1782 to 1783, engaging the Royal Navy along the coasts of India and Ceylon [44]\n\n\nRevolutionary constitutional reign (1789–1792)\nThere is a lack of scholarship on the subject of Louis XVI's time as a constitutional monarch, though it was a significant length of time The reason as to why many biographers have not elaborated extensively on this time in the king's life is due to the uncertainty surrounding his actions during this period, as Louis XVI's declaration that was left behind in the Tuileries stated that he regarded his actions during his constitutional reign as provisional; he reflected that his \"palace was a prison\" This time period was exemplary in its demonstration of an institution's deliberation while in their last standing moments [47]\n\n\nFlight to Varennes (1791)\nOn 21 June 1791, Louis XVI attempted to flee secretly with his family from Paris to the royalist fortress town of Montmédy on the northeastern border of France, where he would join the émigrés and be protected by Austria The voyage was planned by the Swedish nobleman, and often assumed secret lover of Queen Marie Antoinette, Axel von Fersen [48] [49]\n\n\nIntervention by foreign powers\nThe other monarchies of Europe looked with concern upon the developments in France, and considered whether they should intervene, either in support of Louis or to take advantage of the chaos in France The key figure was Marie Antoinette's brother, Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor Initially, he had looked on the Revolution with equanimity However, he became more and more disturbed as it became more and more radical Despite this, he still hoped to avoid war.\n\n\nImprisonment, execution and burial (1792–1793)\nLouis was officially arrested on 13 August 1792 and sent to the Temple, an ancient fortress in Paris that was used as a prison On 21 September, the National Assembly declared France to be a republic, and abolished the monarchy Louis was stripped of all of his titles and honors, and from this date was known as Citoyen Louis Capet.\n\n\nLegacy\nThe 19th-century historian Jules Michelet attributed the restoration of the French monarchy to the sympathy that had been engendered by the execution of Louis XVI Michelet's Histoire de la Révolution Française and Alphonse de Lamartine's Histoire des Girondins, in particular, showed the marks of the feelings aroused by the revolution's regicide The two writers did not share the same sociopolitical vision, but they agreed that, even though the monarchy was rightly ended in 1792, the lives of the royal family should have been spared Lack of compassion at that moment contributed to a radicalization of revolutionary violence and to greater divisiveness among Frenchmen For the 20th century novelist Albert Camus the execution signaled the end of the role of God in history, for which he mourned For the 20th century philosopher Jean-François Lyotard the regicide was the starting point of all French thought, the memory of which acts as a reminder that French modernity began under the sign of a crime [75]\n\n\nReputation\nThe 19th-century historian Jules Michelet attributed the restoration of the French monarchy to the sympathy that had been engendered by

depicted in the 2006 film Marie Antoinette by Jason Schwartzman In Sacha Guitry's Si Versailles m'était conté, Louis was portrayed by one of the film's producers, Gilbert Bokanowski, using the alias Gilbert Boka Several portrayals have upheld the image of a bumbling, almost foolish king, such as that by Jacques Morel in the 1956 French film Marie-Antoinette reine de France and that by Terence Budd in the Lady Oscar live action film In the 1989 series La Révolution française, Jean-François Balmer played Louis as an intelligent, but ultimately ineffective ruler overwhelmed by events [78] In Start the Revolution Without Me, Louis XVI is portrayed by Hugh Griffith as a laughable cuckold Mel Brooks played a comic version of Louis XVI in The History of the World Part 1, portraying him as a libertine who has such distaste for the peasantry he uses them as targets in skeet shooting In the 1996 film Ridicule, Urbain Cancelier plays Louis.\n\n\nIn literature\nLouis XVI has been the subject of novels as well, including two of the alternate histories anthologized in If It Had Happened Otherwise (1931): \"If Drouet's Cart Had Stuck\" by Hilaire Belloc and \"If Louis XVI Had Had an Atom of Firmness\" by André Maurois, which tell very different stories but both imagine Louis surviving and still reigning in the early 19th century Louis appears in the children's book Ben and Me by Robert Lawson but does not appear in the 1953 animated short film based on the same book.\n\n\nAncestry\nLarmuseau et al (2013) [79] tested the Y-DNA of three living members of the House of Bourbon, one

R1b (R-M343) The three individuals were further assigned to sub-haplogroup R1b1b2a1a1b* (R-Z381*) These results contradicted an earlier DNA analysis of a handkerchief dipped in the presumptive blood of Louis XVI after his execution performed by Laluez-Fo et al (2010) [80]\n\n\nArms\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article":

to the Isle de France (now Mauritius) and later contributed to the French effort in India in 1783 [37] [43] Pierre André de Suffren became the ally of Hyder Ali in the Second Anglo-Mysore War against the British East India Company from 1782 to 1783, engaging the Royal Navy along the coasts of India and Ceylon [44]\n\n\nRevolutionary constitutional reign (1789–1792)\nThere is a lack of scholarship on the subject of Louis XVI's time as a constitutional monarch, though it was a significant length of time The reason as to why many biographers have not elaborated extensively on this time in the king's life is due to the uncertainty surrounding his actions during this period, as Louis XVI's declaration that was left behind in the Tuileries stated that he regarded his actions during his constitutional reign as provisional; he reflected that his \"palace was a prison\" This time period was exemplary in its demonstration of an institution's deliberation while in their last standing moments [47]\n\n\nFlight to Varennes (1791)\nOn 21 June 1791, Louis XVI attempted to flee secretly with his family from Paris to the royalist fortress town of Montmédy on the northeastern border of France, where he would join the émigrés and be protected by Austria The voyage was planned by the Swedish nobleman, and often assumed secret lover of Queen Marie Antoinette, Axel von Fersen [48] [49]\n\n\nIntervention by foreign powers\nThe other monarchies of Europe looked with concern upon the developments in France, and considered whether they should intervene, either in support of Louis or to take advantage of the chaos in France The key figure was Marie Antoinette's brother, Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor Initially, he had looked on the Revolution with equanimity However, he became more and more disturbed as it became more and more radical Despite this, he still hoped to avoid war.\n\n\nImprisonment, execution and burial (1792–1793)\nLouis was officially arrested on 13 August 1792 and sent to the Temple, an ancient fortress in Paris that was used as a prison On 21 September, the National Assembly declared France to be a republic, and abolished the monarchy Louis was stripped of all of his titles and honors, and from this date was known as Citoyen Louis Capet.\n\n\nLegacy\nThe 19th-century historian Jules Michelet attributed the restoration of the French monarchy to the sympathy that had been engendered by the execution of Louis XVI Michelet's Histoire de la Révolution Française and Alphonse de Lamartine's Histoire des Girondins, in particular, showed the marks of the feelings aroused by the revolution's regicide The two writers did not share the same sociopolitical vision, but they agreed that, even though the monarchy was rightly ended in 1792, the lives of the royal family should have been spared Lack of compassion at that moment contributed to a radicalization of revolutionary violence and to greater divisiveness among Frenchmen For the 20th century novelist Albert Camus the execution signaled the end of the role of God in history, for which he mourned For the 20th century philosopher Jean-François Lyotard the regicide was the starting point of all French thought, the memory of which acts as a reminder that French modernity began under the sign of a crime [75]\n\n\nReputation\nThe 19th-century historian Jules Michelet attributed the

Louis XVI has been portrayed in numerous films In Captain of the Guard (1930), he is played by Stuart Holmes In Marie Antoinette (1938), he was played by Robert Morley Jean-François Balmer portrayed him in the 1989 two-part miniseries La Révolution française More recently, he was depicted in the 2006 film Marie Antoinette by Jason Schwartzman In Sacha Guitry's Si Versailles m'était conté, Louis was portrayed by one of the film's producers, Gilbert Bokanowski, using the alias Gilbert Boka Several portrayals have upheld the image of a bumbling, almost foolish king, such as that by Jacques Morel in the 1956 French film Marie-Antoinette reine de France and that by Terence Budd in the Lady Oscar live action film In the 1989 series La Révolution française, Jean-François Balmer played Louis as an intelligent, but ultimately ineffective ruler overwhelmed by events [78] In Start the Revolution Without Me, Louis XVI is portrayed by Hugh Griffith as a laughable cuckold Mel Brooks played a comic version of Louis XVI in The History of the World Part 1, portraying him as a libertine who has such distaste for the peasantry he uses them as targets in skeet shooting In the 1996 film Ridicule, Urbain Cancelier plays Louis.\n\n\nIn literature\nLouis XVI has been the subject of novels as well, including two of the alternate histories anthologized in If It Had Happened Otherwise (1931): \"If Drouet's Cart Had Stuck\" by Hilaire Belloc and \"If Louis XVI Had Had an Atom of Firmness\" by André Maurois, which tell very different stories but both imagine Louis surviving and still reigning in the early 19th century Louis appears in the children's book Ben and Me by Robert Lawson but does not appear in the 1953 animated short film based on the same book.\n\n\nAncestry\nLarmuseau et al (2013) [79] tested the Y-DNA of three living members of the House of Bourbon, one descending from Louis XIII of France via King Louis Philippe I, and two from Louis XIV via Philip V of Spain, and concluded that all three men share the same STR haplotype and belonged to haplogroup R1b (R-M343) The three individuals were further assigned to sub-haplogroup R1b1b2a1a1b* (R-Z381*) These results contradicted an earlier DNA analysis of a handkerchief dipped in the presumptive blood of Louis XVI after his execution performed by Laluez-Fo et al (2010)

{"title": "Derek_Chauvin", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nChauvin was born in Oakdale, Minnesota, on March 19, 1976 [29] [30] His mother was a housewife and his father was a certified public accountant [31] During his early years, Chauvin grew up in West Saint Paul When he was seven, his parents divorced and were granted joint custody of him [31]\n\n\nCareer\nChauvin applied to the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) in September 2000 and joined the MPD in 2001 [9] [33] While on the force he was involved in three police shootings, one of which was fatal [9] [10] [11] [12] He received a medal for valor in 2006 for being one of several officers who fired 23 shots on Wayne Reyes who pointed a shotgun at them, and another in 2008 for a domestic violence incident in which he broke down a door and shot Ira Latrell Toles who reached for Chauvin's gun, according to police [37] [38] He received a commendation medal in 2008 after he and his partner tackled a fleeing suspect holding a pistol In 2009, Chauvin received another commendation medal after working off duty as a security guard for a nightclub [36]\n\n\nMisconduct complaints\nChauvin had 18 complaints on his official record, two of which ended in discipline, [39] specifically letters of reprimand [13]\n\n\nMurder of George Floyd\nOn May 25, 2020, Chauvin was one of four officers involved in arresting George Floyd on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a market and was the field training officer for one of the other officers involved [50] Security camera footage from a nearby business did not show Floyd resisting the arrest [51] [52] The criminal complaint stated that, based on body camera footage, Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe while standing outside the police car, resisted getting in the car and fell down; [53] he went to the ground face down While Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down on the street, Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes [54] [55] [56] After Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd's neck, Floyd repeatedly said \"I can't breathe\", \"Mama\", and \"please\" [57] [56] For part of the time, two other officers knelt on Floyd's back [58] During the final two [59] minutes Floyd was motionless and had no pulse [60] Several bystanders took videos which were widely circulated and broadcast [57] Chauvin and the other officers involved were fired the day following the incident [61] While knee-to-neck restraints were allowed in Minnesota under certain circumstances, in the days that followed Chauvin's use of the technique was widely criticized by law enforcement experts as excessive [62] [63] [64] Public outrage over the incident and other issues of racial injustice led to mass protests in Minneapolis, the United States, and across the world [65] [66]\n\n\nFailed plea bargain\nOn May 28, 2020, state and federal prosecutors held a press conference at a regional FBI office in Brooklyn Center, a Minneapolis suburb, to make an announcement in the case against the officers at the scene of Floyd's murder [67] However, officials at the press conference said they needed more time to review the case [68] On June 9, it was revealed that state and federal prosecutors had discussed a plea deal with Chauvin and his attorney that would have included state murder charges and federal civil rights charges, [67] but the deal fell apart when United States Attorney General William Barr rejected it [69] As part of the failed deal, Chauvin was expected to plead guilty to third-degree murder and agree to a ten-year prison sentence As he would have gone to federal prison, the federal government was involved, but Barr worried that protesters might view the agreement as too lenient and opted for a full investigation [69]\n\n\nArrest and charges\nChauvin was arrested on May 29, 2020 [70] Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman charged him with third-degree murder, and the lesser included offense of second-degree manslaughter, [29] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] making him the first white police officer in Minnesota to be charged in the death of a black civilian [76] [77] Under Minnesota law, third-degree murder is defined as causing another's death without intent to kill, but \"evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life\" Second-degree manslaughter also does not imply lethal intent, but that the perpetrator created \"an unreasonable risk\" of serious harm or death [78]\n\n\nPre-trial\nChauvin was released on conditional bail on October 7, 2020, after posting a bond of $1 million [86] [87] [88] [89] On October 22, 2020, Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill dismissed the third-degree murder charge, but also denied Chauvin's motion to dismiss the other, more serious murder charges [90] [91] On November 5, 2020, Judge Cahill ruled that Chauvin and all three of the others charged would be tried together in Hennepin County [92] [93] However, on January 13, 2021, Judge Cahill reversed his earlier ruling, deciding that Chauvin would be tried separately from the other three officers [94] On March 11, 2021, Cahill reinstated the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin [95]\n\n\nTrial\nChauvin's trial began on March 8, 2021, at the Hennepin County Government Center [96] It marked the first time that a judge in Minnesota authorized cameras to show a full criminal trial [96] On April 20, 2021, a jury, consisting of six white people and six people of color, found Chauvin guilty on three counts: unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter [1] [2] [3] He was the first white Minnesotan police officer to be convicted of murdering a Black person It was only the second time an officer has been convicted of murder in Minnesota, the first being the third-degree murder conviction of Somali-American officer Mohamed Noor in the killing of Justine Damond, a white woman [97] Following Chauvin's conviction Judge Cahill revoked Chauvin's bail and he was taken back into police custody [98] [99]\n\n\nAppeal\nChauvin appealed his second-degree murder conviction and requested a public defender to represent him on appeal The Minnesota Supreme Court denied Chauvin's request for a public defender, ruling that his financial state rendered him ineligible Chauvin later hired attorney William Mohrman to represent him [100] In April 2022, Chauvin appealed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals, asking the court to reverse his conviction and order a new trial, in a new venue, claiming that the jury of the case in the state had been \"intimidated by excessive pre-trial publicity\" [101] Chauvin's lawyer further stated that the settlement reached between the city of Minneapolis and the Floyd family for $27 million during jury selection amounted to prejudice [102] In April 2023, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals issued a 50-page decision affirming the conviction [103] Chauvin asked the Minnesota Supreme Court to review the case, but was denied in July 2023 [104]\n\n\nSentence\nFollowing his conviction, Chauvin's bail was revoked and he was remanded into custody by the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, which transferred him into the custody of the Minnesota Department of Corrections [110] [111] He was then booked into the Oak Park Heights prison, where he had been incarcerated following his 2020 arrest [111] At Oak Parks, Chauvin was held in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day in an isolated wing of the prison, where he was under constant watch \"for fears for his safety\" [112] [113] Chauvin was held at Oak Park Heights until his sentencing hearing on June 25, 2021 [114] On May 12, 2021, Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill allowed for the prosecution to seek a greater prison sentence after finding that Chauvin treated Floyd \"with particular cruelty\" [115]\n\n\nCivil rights violations case\nThe United States Department of Justice (DOJ) convened a grand jury in February 2021 to investigate whether Chauvin violated Floyd's civil rights as well as another incident in September 2017 when Chauvin restrained a 14-year-old boy for several minutes, using his knee to lean into the boy's back and hitting him with a flashlight several times During the restraint, Chauvin ignored the boy's pleas that he could not breathe and the boy briefly lost consciousness The 2017 incident was deemed inadmissible as evidence in Chauvin's murder trial [122] [123] Following Chauvin's murder conviction, the investigation was still underway, with the DOJ reportedly weighing whether to bring criminal charges against Chauvin for the 2017 incident [44]\n\n\nGuilty plea\nThree months after initially entering a plea of not guilty to the federal charges, Chauvin requested a hearing to offer a revised plea [129] On December 15, 2021, Chauvin pleaded guilty to the federal charges of violating the rights of Floyd and to violating the rights of the 14-year-old boy in the 2017 incident [18] Chauvin admitted for the first time that he willfully violated Floyd's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizure, which includes the right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer, by continuously kneeling on Floyd's neck even though Floyd was handcuffed and not resisting at the time [18] Chauvin also admitted willfully violating Floyd's constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law, including the right to be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to Floyd's serious medical needs [19] Chauvin admitted that his knee had remained on Floyd's neck even after Floyd became unresponsive [18] In the plea, Chauvin also admitted violating the 14-year old's constitutional right to be free from the unreasonable force by a police officer stemming from a 2017 incident when he held the boy by the throat, hit him in the head with a flashlight, and knelt on the upper back of the boy who was prone, handcuffed, and not resisting [18] [19]\n\n\nTax-evasion case\nOn July 22, 2020, after he was charged with murder, Chauvin and his wife Kellie were separately charged in Washington County, Minnesota, with nine counts of felony tax evasion [134] [135] related to allegedly fraudulent state income tax returns from 2014 to 2019 [136] Prosecutors said the couple had under-reported their joint income by $464,433, including more than $95,000 from Chauvin's security work [135] [137] The complaint also alleges failure to pay proper sales tax on a $100,000 BMW purchased in Minnesota in 2018, failure to declare income from Chauvin's wife's business, and improper deductions for a rental home [135] [138] Chauvin first appeared in Washington County District Court for his tax-evasion case (number 82-CR-20-2813) on September 8, 2021 The pre-trial hearing was scheduled for January 21, 2022 [139] [140] Chauvin pleaded guilty on March 17, 2023, and was sentenced to 13 months in prison, to run concurrently with his murder sentence with credit given for time already served [4] [141]\n\n\nRamsey County jail discrimination complaint\nFollowing his arrest on May 29, Chauvin was booked and processed at Ramsey County's Adult Detention Center in Saint Paul [142] In June 2020, eight correctional officers who work at the jail filed a discrimination complaint against their supervisors with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights They alleged that during Chauvin's brief stay before his transfer to a state prison, non-white guards were not allowed to work on the fifth floor where Chauvin was being held The complaint also alleged that a guard had witnessed a white lieutenant sit on Chauvin's bed and that she permitted Chauvin to use her cellphone Responding to the complaint, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights said that it was opening an investigation to determine whether discrimination took place [143]\n\n\nPrison attack\nWhile serving his concurrent state and federal sentences at the FCI Tucson prison, Chauvin was stabbed 22 times with an improvised knife by another inmate while both he and Chauvin were in the facility's law library at about 12:30 p.m local time on November 24, 2023 [145] [146] Prison employees performed \"life-saving\" measures on Chauvin who suffered serious bodily injury and was taken to a hospital for further evaluation and treatment [27] Prior to the assault, Chauvin's lawyer had advocated for keeping him away from other inmates for his own protection [147] The stabbing attack on Chauvin was compared to the July 2023 prison assault on Larry Nassar and it raised further scrutiny of inmate safety in the federal prison system [147] Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison denounced the attack, stating that Chauvin \"was duly convicted of his crimes and, like any incarcerated individual, he should be able to serve his sentence without fear of retaliation or violence.\" [148] [149]\n\n\nPersonal life\nChauvin's ex-wife, a real-estate agent and photographer, [138] is a Hmong refugee from Laos She won the \"Mrs Minnesota\" beauty pageant in 2018 [151] [152] She filed for divorce the day before he was arrested for Floyd's murder, [53] [134] [151] and the divorce was finalized in February 2021 [153] She has two children from a previous marriage [53] In May 2023, she was sentenced to twenty days in prison on tax-evasion charges [154]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Derek Chauvin\n\nDerek Michael Chauvin is a

inadmissible as evidence in Chauvin's murder trial [122] [123] Following Chauvin's murder conviction, the investigation was still underway, with the DOJ reportedly weighing whether to bring criminal charges against Chauvin for the 2017 incident [44]\n\n\nGuilty plea\nThree months after initially entering a plea of not guilty to the federal charges, Chauvin requested a hearing to offer a revised plea [129] On December 15, 2021, Chauvin pleaded guilty to the federal charges of violating the rights of Floyd and to violating the rights of the 14-year-old boy in the 2017 incident [18] Chauvin admitted for the first time that he willfully violated Floyd's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizure, which includes the right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer, by continuously kneeling on Floyd's neck even though Floyd was handcuffed and not resisting at the time [18] Chauvin also admitted willfully violating Floyd's constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law, including the right to be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to Floyd's serious medical needs [19] Chauvin admitted that his knee had remained on Floyd's neck even after Floyd became unresponsive [18] In the plea, Chauvin also admitted violating the 14-year old's constitutional right to be free from the unreasonable force by a police officer stemming from a 2017 incident when he held the boy by the throat, hit him in the head with a flashlight, and knelt on the upper back of the boy who was prone, handcuffed, and not resisting [18] [19]\n\n\nTax-evasion case\nOn July 22, 2020, after he was charged with murder, Chauvin and his wife Kellie were separately charged in Washington County, Minnesota, with nine counts of felony tax evasion [134] [135] related to allegedly fraudulent state income tax returns from 2014 to 2019 [136] Prosecutors said the couple had under-reported their joint income by $464,433, including more than $95,000 from Chauvin's security work [135] [137] The complaint also alleges failure to pay proper sales tax on a $100,000 BMW purchased in Minnesota in 2018, failure to declare income from Chauvin's wife's business, and improper deductions for a rental home [135] [138] Chauvin first appeared in Washington County District Court for his tax-evasion case (number 82-CR-20-2813) on September 8, 2021 The pre-trial hearing was scheduled for January 21, 2022 [139] [140] Chauvin pleaded guilty on March 17, 2023, and was sentenced to 13 months in prison, to run concurrently with his murder sentence with credit given for time already served [4] [141]\n\n\nRamsey County jail discrimination complaint\nFollowing his arrest on May 29, Chauvin was booked and processed at Ramsey County's Adult Detention Center in Saint Paul [142] In June 2020, eight correctional officers who work at the jail filed a discrimination complaint against their supervisors with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights They alleged that during Chauvin's brief stay before his transfer to a state prison, non-white guards were not allowed to work on the fifth floor where Chauvin was being held The complaint also alleged that a guard had witnessed a white lieutenant sit on Chauvin's bed and that she permitted Chauvin to use her cellphone Responding to the complaint, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights said that it was opening an investigation to determine whether discrimination took place [143]\n\n\nPrison attack\nWhile serving his concurrent state and federal sentences at the FCI Tucson prison, Chauvin was stabbed 22 times with an improvised knife by another inmate while both he and Chauvin were in the facility's law library at about 12:30 p.m local time on November 24, 2023 [145] [146] Prison employees performed \"life-saving\" measures on Chauvin who suffered serious bodily injury and was taken to a hospital for further evaluation and treatment [27] Prior to the assault, Chauvin's lawyer had advocated for keeping him away from other inmates for his own protection [147] The stabbing attack on Chauvin was compared to the July 2023 prison assault on Larry Nassar and it raised further scrutiny of inmate safety in the federal prison system [147] Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison denounced the attack, stating that Chauvin \"was duly convicted of his crimes and, like any incarcerated individual, he should be able to serve his sentence without fear of retaliation or violence.\" [148] [149]\n\n\nPersonal life\nChauvin's ex-wife, a real-estate agent and photographer, [138] is a Hmong refugee from Laos She won the \"Mrs Minnesota\" beauty pageant in 2018 [151] [152] She filed for divorce the day before he was arrested for Floyd's murder, [53] [134] [151] and the divorce was finalized in February 2021 [153] She has two children from a previous marriage [53] In May 2023, she was sentenced to twenty days in prison on tax-evasion charges

of 2023, five playable maps are available: a spaceship called \"The Skeld\", an office building called \"MIRA HQ\", a planet base called \"Polus\", [8] \"The Airship\", a setting from Innersloth's Henry Stickmin series, [9] [10] and the Fungle, a mushroom jungle map [11] The Crewmates can win the game one of two ways: either by completing all assigned tasks or by ejecting all Impostors Impostors can likewise win in two ways: either by killing or ejecting all Crewmates, [e] or by sabotaging a critical system on the map (provided the Crewmates do not resolve it in time) [f] [8] [12] At the start of the game, Crewmates are assigned \"tasks\" to complete around the map in the form of minigames, minipuzzles, and simple toggles, mostly consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data [13] Impostors cannot complete tasks but may pretend to perform \"fake\" tasks to feign appearance as legitimate Crewmates Impostors, however, can perform sabotages, ranging from minor (such as disabling lights, limiting the Crewmates' vision) to critical (such as disabling oxygen generators), requiring immediate counteraction by Crewmates to prevent their deaths Impostors may enter and traverse ventilation ducts (commonly known as \"venting\"), and kill nearby Crewmates To help Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various surveillance systems on each map, such as security cameras on The Skeld, [14] a door log system with sensors in MIRA HQ, [15] and a vitals indicator in Polus that shows the living status of all players [8] In addition, certain \"visual tasks\" provide animated cues, such as scanning oneself in the Skeld's medbay As Impostors cannot perform tasks, Crewmates can use visual tasks to confirm their identity to nearby Crewmates [16]\n\n\nDevelopment and release\nAmong Us was inspired by the live party game Mafia, [5] [26] and the science fiction horror film The Thing [27] The idea for the concept was originally given by Marcus Bromander, co-founder of Innersloth, who had played Mafia since he was a kid In the original game, function cards were dealt and players wandered around a house, aimlessly, while another person secretly killed the players, drawing a finger around their neck Most of its mechanics were still present in Among Us, but the team wanted to \"alleviate the need to create an interesting home model and have someone wandering around in a boring environment\" So, they decided that the game would be space-themed and also added tasks, which, according to Forest Willard, programmer at Innersloth, \"changed several times during development\" [27] [28]\n\n\nEarly development\nAmong Us was inspired by the live party game Mafia, [5] [26] and the science fiction horror

focus onto a sequel, Among Us 2 [j] [38] During this time, Forest Willard and Amy Liu continued to update Among Us, increasing the maximum player base, adding four servers and three regions, and implementing longer multiplayer codes to support more concurrent games [39] On September 23, 2020, the team announced that they abandoned development of the sequel in favor of reworking the original game's codebase, which they described as \"outdated and not built to support adding so much new content\", so the team made plans to rework the game's core code to enable adding new features [40] [41] [42] The team subsequently announced their plans to fix the game's server issues and widespread cheating problem, [43] as well as add a system for banning disruptive players [44] In October 2020, colorblind support for the \"wires\" task was added to the Among Us beta on Steam, as well as some previously unannounced lobby customization options [45]\n\n\nConsole releases\nAmid its popularity, Innersloth considered releasing the game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, but encountered a problem in implementing player communication, since standard text-based or voice-based chat seemed unusable They considered a system similar to the \"quick comms\" system from Rocket League, as well as the possibility of developing an entirely new communication system for the game [18] [19] Versions of the game for Xbox consoles were later announced [60]\n\n\nAmong Us VR\nDuring The Game Awards 2021, a standalone VR version titled Among Us VR was announced [67] Co-developed by Schell Games, Innersloth, and Robot Teddy, [68] the game was released on November 10, 2022, for the Meta Quest 2 and Windows via Steam, with a PlayStation 5 version via PlayStation VR2 planned for the future [69]\n\n\nReception\nAmong Us was well received by critics On the aggregator website Metacritic, the PC port received a 85 of 100 score based on 9 critic reviews, while the Nintendo Switch version received a 79 of 100 score based on 9 critic reviews, both them indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [71] [72] It was also considered one of the \"Best PC Games for 2018\", being ranked 17th, and as the \"#38 Best Discussed PC Game of 2018\" [81] [82] Since December 2020, IGN considered it one of 2020's best reviewed games so far [83]\n\n\nSales\nAs of September 2020 [update], Steam Spy estimated that the game had more than 10 million owners on Steam [91] The Associated Press noted the game was the most downloaded app on the iOS App Store for both iPhones and iPads in October 2020 [92] According to SuperData Research, the game had roughly 500 million players worldwide as of November 2020 [update], with the free-to-play mobile version accounting for 97% of players and the buy-to-play PC version accounting for 3% of players, though it was the buy-to-play PC version that generated 64% of the game's gross revenue [93] Among Us became one of the best selling games of 2020 on Steam, being listed on the platinum category on \"The Year's Top 100\" list [94] [95] The Nintendo Switch version's launch sold 3.2 million digital units in December 2020, making it the highest-earning version of the game for the month and one of the best-selling games on the Nintendo Switch [96] [97]\n\n\nAwards\nWhile Among Us was released in 2018, it was not until mid-2020 that it saw a surge of popularity, initially driven by content creators online in South Korea and Brazil Bromander stated that the game is more popular in Mexico, Brazil, and South Korea than in the United States [29] [5] According to Willard, Twitch streamer Sodapoppin first popularized the game on Twitch in July 2020 [29] Many other Twitch streamers and YouTubers followed suit, including prominent content creators xQc, Pokimane, Shroud, Ninja, MrBeast, Disguised Toast and PewDiePie [41] [114] [26] [115] [116]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nWhile Among Us was released in 2018, it was not until

Among Us themed merchandise [23] The game's popularity inspired many original songs, fan art and internet memes, [14] [17] [32] Willard expressed that fan-created content \"really is the best part\" of making Among Us, and Bromander called it \"my favorite thing to see\" [32] The game popularized the slang word \"sus\" (meaning \"suspicious\" or \"suspect\"), [127] [128] [129] which had been used before the game's release [130] Other slang terms as well as internet memes popularized and inspired by Among Us include \"sussy\" and \"sussy baka\" (derived from \"sus\"), [131] \"when the imposter is sus\" (a meme based on Among Us, usually alongside an edited photo of Jerma985), [132] and \"amogus\" (a satiric misspelling of \"Among Us\") [133] [l] In addition, the meme \"Among Us everywhere\" is a phenomenon where unexpected objects resemble the Crewmate character [135] In September 2022, \"sus\" was added to Merriam-Webster's dictionary [136]\n\n\nChicken nugget auction\nIn May 2021, an eBay user named Tav listed a Chicken McNugget from the 2021 BTS Meal by McDonald's for online auction The nugget was listed because the seller felt it resembled a Crewmate, and was inspired by a 2017 auction for a Cheeto that looked similar to the gorilla Harambe, which sold for US$99,900 Despite Tav only expecting the nugget to sell for around US$50, a bidding war began two days later, [145] and the nugget was sold to an anonymous buyer for US$99,997 [146] Tav decided to include Szechuan sauce after a comment on social media from Xbox [146] Several news outlets covered the auction, who largely cited it as an example of an absurd price caused by internet memes, [147] and following the sale, multiple other listings selling nuggets of a similar shape were made in hopes of profiting from the popularity of the original listing [148] [149] Several TikTokers and QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theorists promoted misinformation and rumors claiming that the high price of the listing was a front for child sex trafficking [147] In 2022, the listing was recognized by Guinness World Records as the \"most expensive chicken nugget sold at online auction\" [150] That October, Chilean chicken brand Super Pollo partnered with Innersloth to launch a Crewmate-shaped chicken nugget into the Earth's thermosphere [151]\n\n\nOctober 2020 and January 2021 hacks\nIn mid-October 2020, a hacker known as \"Eris Loris\" began targeting mainly North American servers Several players on the Among Us subreddit and Twitter reported this player hacking their lobbies and spamming in-game chat with promotions for his YouTube channel, links to his Discord server, and controversial political messages [152] Eris Loris threatened to personally hack players that refused to subscribe to his YouTube channel The Discord server has been found to contain large amounts of offensive content, such as racist language, gore, pornography, and images depicting animal abuse [153]\n\n\nLegacy\nAmong Us has done collaborations and cross-overs with other games and studios The first game they collaborated with was Fall Guys, who added Among Us-themed skins to their game [155] Characters from Among Us have made cameos in the indie games Astroneer, [156] Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, [157] Cosmonious High, [158] Samurai Gunn 2, [159] and Fraymakers, [160] and Among Us is referenced in several stickers in the game A Hat in Time [161] In a major update in collaboration with Innersloth, indie developer Triband added characters and 35 Among Us-themed levels to the game What The Golf? [162] Several Among Us-themed cards are included in The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Requiem [163]\n\n\nArtificial intelligence research\nA simplified variation of Among Us called Hidden Agenda is used in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning to show that artificial intelligence agents are able to learn a variety of social behaviors, including partnering and voting without need for communication in natural language [182]\n\n\nAdaptations\nOn December 28, 2021, H2 Interactive, who publishes Among Us in Japan, announced that a one-shot manga based on the game would be published in Bessatsu CoroCoro's April issue on February 28, 2022 [183]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Among Us**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAmong Us is a popular multiplayer online social deduction game that has gained a massive following worldwide.

mods\nIn August 2020, Innersloth opened an online store for Among Us themed merchandise [23] The game's popularity inspired many original songs, fan art and internet memes, [14] [17] [32] Willard expressed that fan-created content \"really is the best part\" of making Among Us, and Bromander called it \"my favorite thing to see\" [32] The game popularized the slang word \"sus\" (meaning \"suspicious\" or \"suspect\"), [127] [128] [129] which had been used before the game's release [130] Other slang terms as well as internet memes popularized and inspired by Among Us include \"sussy\" and \"sussy baka\" (derived from \"sus\"), [131] \"when the imposter is sus\" (a meme based on Among Us, usually alongside an edited photo of Jerma985), [132] and \"amogus\" (a satiric misspelling of \"Among Us\") [133] [l] In addition, the meme \"Among Us everywhere\" is a phenomenon where unexpected objects resemble the Crewmate character [135] In September 2022, \"sus\" was added to Merriam-Webster's dictionary [136]\n\n\nChicken nugget auction\nIn May 2021, an eBay user named Tav listed a Chicken McNugget from the 2021 BTS Meal by McDonald's for online auction The nugget was listed because the seller felt it resembled a Crewmate, and was inspired by a 2017 auction for a Cheeto that looked similar to the gorilla Harambe, which sold for US$99,900 Despite Tav only expecting the nugget to sell for around US$50, a bidding war began two days later, [145] and the nugget was sold to an anonymous buyer for US$99,997 [146] Tav decided to include Szechuan sauce after a comment on social media from Xbox [146] Several news outlets covered the auction, who largely cited it as an example of an absurd price caused by internet memes, [147] and following the sale, multiple other listings selling nuggets of a similar shape were made in hopes of profiting from the popularity of the original listing [148] [149] Several TikTokers and QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theorists promoted misinformation and rumors claiming that the high price of the listing was a front for child sex trafficking [147] In 2022, the listing was recognized by Guinness World Records as the \"most expensive chicken nugget sold at online auction\" [150] That October, Chilean chicken brand Super Pollo partnered with Innersloth to launch a Crewmate-shaped chicken nugget into the Earth's thermosphere [151]\n\n\nOctober 2020 and January 2021 hacks\nIn mid-October 2020, a hacker known as \"Eris Loris\" began targeting mainly North American servers Several players on the Among Us subreddit and Twitter reported this player hacking their lobbies and spamming in-game chat with promotions for his YouTube channel, links to his Discord server, and controversial political messages [152] Eris Loris threatened to personally hack players that refused to subscribe to his YouTube channel The Discord server has been found to contain large amounts of offensive content, such as racist language, gore, pornography, and images depicting animal abuse [153]\n\n\nLegacy\nAmong Us has done collaborations and cross-overs with other games and studios The first game they collaborated with was Fall Guys, who added Among Us-themed skins to their game [155] Characters from Among Us have made cameos in the indie games Astroneer, [156] Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, [157] Cosmonious High, [158] Samurai Gunn 2, [159] and Fraymakers, [160] and Among Us is referenced in several stickers in the game A Hat in Time [161] In a major update in collaboration with Innersloth, indie developer Triband added characters and 35 Among Us-themed levels to the game What The Golf? [162] Several Among Us-themed cards are included in The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Requiem [163]\n\n\nArtificial intelligence research\nA simplified variation of Among Us called Hidden Agenda is used in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning to show that artificial intelligence agents are able to learn a variety of social behaviors, including partnering and voting without need for communication in natural language [182]\n\n\nAdaptations\nOn December 28, 2021, H2 Interactive, who publishes Among Us in Japan, announced that a one-shot manga based on the game would be published in Bessatsu CoroCoro's April issue on February 28, 2022 [183]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born [26] [27]\n\n\n1899–1922: Beginnings\nOn 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born [26] [27]\n\n\n1923–1957: Rivera, Republic and Civil War\nOn 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club [43] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club [39]\n\n\n1957–1978: Club de Fútbol Barcelona\nWith Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960 In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final [63] [64]\n\n\n1978–2000: Núñez and stabilization\nIn 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands [72] [73]\n\n\n2000–2008: Exit Núñez, enter Laporta\nThe departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd [90] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification [91] [92] [93]\n\n\n2008–2012: Guardiola era\nBarcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season [102] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi [104]\n\n\n2014–2020: Bartomeu era\nOn 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season [139] Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals [140] On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar [141] Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term [142]\n\n\n2021–present: Return of Laporta and post-Messi era\nOn 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote [173] Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final [174] In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain [175] [176] The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players [177]\n\n\nSupport\nThe nickname culer for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand [183] [184] In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population [185] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club [186] The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009, [187] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media [188] [189] As of 31 May 2023 [update], the club has 150,317 memberships, called socis [190]\n\n\nClub rivalries\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico) From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War [196] Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws [197]\n\n\nEl Clásico\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national

victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws [197]\n\n\nEl derbi Barceloní\nBarça's local rival has always been Espanyol Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners [209] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid [210] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià [211] [212]\n\n\nRivalry with AC Milan\nOne of Barcelona's rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan [216] [217] [218] [219] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26) [220] [221] [222] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups [223] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 23 [224]\n\n\nOwnership and finances\nAlong with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association [230] [231] Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership [232] The members of Barcelona, called socis, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club [233] As of 31 May 2023 [update], the club has 150,317 socis [190]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nSince its origins, Barcelona has had a close relationship with the world of culture, especially, with Catalan culture [245] [246] [247] The club's statutes from 1932 already said that Barça \"is an association of a cultural and sporting nature\" [248] The club and its players have been a source of inspiration for writers, musicians, visual artists, journalists, cartoonists, theater, and film people [249] [250]\n\n\nRecords\nIn March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi's record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520 [263]\n\n\nKits and crest\nThe club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm [32] The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one [291] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom [292]\n\n\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\nSince 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record €155 million per year The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga [302] [303] In 2023, Barcelona became the revenue leader from the sale of kits and merchandising in Europe with a turnover of €179 million [304] [305]\n\n\nAnthems\nThroughout its history, the club has had various official songs The anthem in use today is \"Cant del Barça\" (The Song of Barça), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary Authors Josep Maria Espinàs and Jaume Picas composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by Manuel Valls [316] [317]\n\n\nStadium\nBarcelona initially played on different fields, one of the first to represent a fixed venue was the Camp de la Indústria The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership [320]\n\n\nHonours\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country Also, players from the ACP

Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born [26] [27]\n\n\n1923–1957: Rivera, Republic and Civil War\nOn 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club [43] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club [39]\n\n\n1957–1978: Club de Fútbol Barcelona\nWith Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960 In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final [63] [64]\n\n\n1978–2000: Núñez and stabilization\nIn 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands [72] [73]\n\n\n2000–2008: Exit Núñez, enter Laporta\nThe departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd [90] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification [91] [92] [93]\n\n\n2008–2012: Guardiola era\nBarcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season [102] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi [104]\n\n\n2014–2020: Bartomeu era\nOn 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season [139] Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals [140] On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar [141] Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term [142]\n\n\n2021–present: Return of Laporta and post-Messi era\nOn 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote [173] Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final [174] In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain [175] [176] The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players [177]\n\n\nSupport\nThe nickname culer for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand [183] [184] In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population [185] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club [186] The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009, [187] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media [188] [189] As of 31 May 2023 [update], the club has 150,317 memberships, called socis [190]\n\n\nClub rivalries\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico) From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War [196] Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws [197]\n\n\nEl Clásico\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly

[197]\n\n\nEl derbi Barceloní\nBarça's local rival has always been Espanyol Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners [209] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid [210] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià [211] [212]\n\n\nRivalry with AC Milan\nOne of Barcelona's rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan [216] [217] [218] [219] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26) [220] [221] [222] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups [223] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 23 [224]\n\n\nOwnership and finances\nAlong with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association [230] [231] Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership [232] The members of Barcelona, called socis, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club [233] As of 31 May 2023 [update], the club has 150,317 socis [190]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nSince its origins, Barcelona has had a close relationship with the world of culture, especially, with Catalan culture [245] [246] [247] The club's statutes from 1932 already said that Barça \"is an association of a cultural and sporting nature\" [248] The club and its players have been a source of inspiration for writers, musicians, visual artists, journalists, cartoonists, theater, and film people [249] [250]\n\n\nRecords\nIn March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi's record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520 [263]\n\n\nKits and crest\nThe club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm [32] The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one [291] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom [292]\n\n\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\nSince 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record €155 million per year The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga [302] [303] In 2023, Barcelona became the revenue leader from the sale of kits and merchandising in Europe with a turnover of €179 million [304] [305]\n\n\nAnthems\nThroughout its history, the club has had various official songs The anthem in use today is \"Cant del Barça\" (The Song of Barça), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary Authors Josep Maria Espinàs and Jaume Picas composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by Manuel Valls [316] [317]\n\n\nStadium\nBarcelona initially played on different fields, one of the first to represent a fixed venue was the Camp de la Indústria The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership [320]\n\n\nHonours\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country Also, players from the ACP countries that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling [336]\n\n\nPlayers\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship The squad list includes only the

Roxxon's Man-Thing enough to put out the forest fire This same Man-Thing was held in a cage with the Brood-infected human Blake in a Roxxon facility as they are freed by Weapon H [77] When it was revealed that Roxxon had opened a portal to Weirdworld, the Man-Thing took his leave, as Blake claims that he will find a pond to settle in When the Skrullduggers emerge from the portal and start attacking the nearby humans, the Man-Thing and Blake assist Weapon H in fighting them until it was discovered that the Skrullduggers are shapeshifters [78] After the Man-Thing secures the defeated Skrullduggers, he is later sent with Blake to keep more Skrullduggers from emerging from the portal When Weapon H and Dario later check up on them, it was discovered that they had some help in defeating the Skrullduggers from Korg [79] When the Man-Thing agreed to help in fighting the Skrullduggers, Blake asked him if he had a human form, which the Man-Thing does not respond to As Weapon H

magazine in which the character debuted in an 11-page origin story, the Man-Thing was conceived in discussions between Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and writer Roy Thomas Together they created five possible origins for the character Lee provided the name, which had previously been used for unrelated creatures in Marvel's early science-fiction/fantasy anthology Tales of Suspense #7 (January 1960) and #81 (September 1966), [7] [8] as well as the concept of the man losing sentience.\n\n\nFictional character biography\nYoung biochemist Dr Theodore \"Ted\" Sallis, a native of Omaha, Nebraska, [29] is working in the Everglades as part of Dr Wilma Calvin's Project: Gladiator team, which includes Dr Barbara Morse and her fiancé Dr Paul Allen, and an assistant named Jim A Dr Wendell is later cited as being on the staff after Dr Calvin is shot [30] The group is attempting to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum that had created Captain America [31] Web of Spider-Man vol 2 #6 revealed that Sallis at one point treated and worked alongside Dr Curtis Connors shortly after Connors' arm was amputated, driving the research that would eventually transform Connors into the Lizard [citation

appearance:\n\n\nSavage Land's Man-Thing\nIn the pages of Savage Wolverine as part of the \"Marvel NOW!\" branding, a different Man-Thing appeared where it resided on a mysterious island somewhere in

Roxxon's Man-Thing enough to put out the forest fire This same Man-Thing was held in a cage with the Brood-infected human Blake in a Roxxon facility as they are freed by Weapon H [77] When it was revealed that Roxxon had opened a portal to Weirdworld, the Man-Thing took his leave, as Blake claims that he will find a pond to settle in When the Skrullduggers emerge from the portal and start

Skrullduggers, he is later sent with Blake to keep more Skrullduggers from emerging from the portal When Weapon H and Dario later check up on them, it was discovered that they had some help in defeating the Skrullduggers from Korg [79] When the Man-Thing agreed to help in fighting the Skrullduggers, Blake asked him if he had a human form, which the Man-Thing does not respond to As Weapon H leads the mission to Weirdworld, they are attacked by a tribe of blue-skinned humanoids called the Inaku, who blame them for breaking the Earth and allowing the Skrullduggers to take their queen [80]

protect the Inaku village [81] When the Skrullduggers attack, the Man-Thing, Korg, and Titania assist the Inaku in defending their fortified village from the Skrullduggers, until they suddenly go in one direction [82] The Man-Thing, Korg, and Titania find Weapon H with the Skrullduggers under Morgan le Fay's control, so they attack the Inaku village, as they recognize Morgan le Fay of Earth-15238 as their queen When Morgan le Fay orders Protector Hara to assist Weapon H and the Skrullduggers in attacking those who were sent by Roxxon, the Man-Thing goes on the defense to protect his allies [83] As the Minotaur fights Morgan le Fay, the Man-Thing is among those who are evacuated through the portal After Dario pays them the terms of their contract, Titania takes Blake, Korg, and the Man-Thing out to a burger joint down the street [84]\n\n\nBoy-Thing\nXarus got a piece of the original Man-Thing to grow his own similar creature that was called the Boy-Thing Boy-Thing spent all of

Killraven stumbled across the Miami Museum of Cultural Development and became caught up in the projected dreams of an astronaut from the \"Mars launch in 1999\" During the hallucination, Killraven encountered distorted versions of numerous Marvel characters Rather ambiguously, the awakened astronaut later described the figures as \"all the heroes from my youth\" but he also often referred to them as \"myths\" The only Marvel character that is definitely \"real\" in the projected nightmare is the Man-Thing, who appears as part of an actual memory of an encounter that the astronaut had with

of five children to Susheela Vasudev (mother) and B.V Vasudev (father) His father was an ophthalmologist at the Mysuru Railway Hospital and his mother a homemaker [6] [7]\n\n\nEducation\nAfter completing his formal education, Vasudev was uninterested in post-secondary schooling One year later, however, he enrolled at the University of Mysore, where he studied English literature While studying literature, Vasudev received second rank [7] Although his parents wanted him to continue his education with postgraduate studies, Vasudev disagreed and began a career in business [8]\n\n\nWork\nAfter graduating from the University of Mysore, Vasudev went on to build his first business, a poultry farm, in Mysore [9] Vasudev explained that his motivation to start a poultry farm was driven by the serenity it yielded in the hours he was not working [7] The business required minimal attention throughout the day, so Vasudev was able to pursue other interests during his time off, like writing poetry [7] The business grew profitable, but his family repeatedly criticized and opposed his decision to work with poultry [7] This led Vasudev to enter the construction industry with a company named Buildaids [7] He started the company in partnership with a friend, who was a civil engineer Though Vasudev had no formal engineering training, he used the experience gained from building his poultry farm in his new endeavour [7]\n\n\nSpirituality\nAlthough Vasudev was not brought up in a spiritual household, he recollects one of his first spiritual experiences occurring after he turned 25 [8] On 23 September 1982, he drove up Chamundi Hill, and as he sat on a stone, Vasudev had his first spiritual experience [7] [8] He explained that, \"All my life I had thought, this is me...But now the air I was breathing, the rock on which I was sitting, the atmosphere around me — everything had become me.\" [7] [8] After about six days, Vasudev had another similar experience at home [7] [8] Six weeks later, he left his businesses and travelled extensively, in an effort to seek insight into his spiritual experiences [8] After about a year of meditation and travel, he decided to teach yoga to share his inner experience [8]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn his earlier years, Vasudev had a love for driving motorcycles [7] [10] One of his favourite places to drive was the Chamundi Hills in Mysore, though he sometimes drove much further, including to Nepal [7] [10] Vasudev advocates vegetarianism, but whilst traveling with no vegetarian food sources available, he eats seafood [11] He practices the Sun Salutation for 40 minutes a day [11]\n\n\nIsha Foundation\nIn 1992, Sadhguru established the Isha Foundation [17] as a platform for his spiritual, environmental, and educational activities [18] [19] [20] In 1993, he began searching for a location to establish an ashram to cater to the growing interest in his yoga classes [7] In 1994, he purchased land near the Velliangiri mountains in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, and inaugurated the Isha Yoga Center [7] Since establishing the Isha Foundation, he remains its head The foundation's activities are run mostly by volunteers [21] The organisation offers yoga programmes, known as Isha Yoga [22] The foundation aims to improve the quality of education in rural India through an initiative called Isha Vidhya [23]\n\n\nEnvironmental activism\nThrough the Isha Foundation, Sadhguru has launched several projects and campaigns focused on environmental conservation and protection, including Project GreenHands (PGH), Rally for Rivers, Cauvery Calling, and Save Soil [24] [25] [26] [27] Sadhguru established PGH to address water and soil issues in Tamil Nadu through reforestation efforts [28] Launched in July 2019, the \"Cauvery Calling\" campaign focused on planting trees along the Cauvery river's 0.65-mile wide area to replenish water levels in the river and the groundwater table [26] [29] [30] In 2017, Sadhguru launched \"Rally for Rivers\", a campaign intended to build widespread support for river revitalization efforts across India, similar to the \"Cauvery Calling\" campaign [28] [31] In 2022, Sadhguru completed a 100-day motorcycle journey from London to India to bring attention to his \"Journey to Save Soil\" campaign, which focuses on raising awareness about soil degradation issues and the benefits of using organic matter in farming [27] [32]\n\n\nSpeeches and writings\nSadhguru has authored over thirty books, including the New York Times bestsellers Inner Engineering: A Yogi's Guide to Joy [39] and Karma: A Yogi's Guide to Crafting Your Destiny [40] [41] [42]\n\n\nHonors\nIn 2017, Sadhguru was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award from the

Isha Foundation, in Coimbatore, standing at 34 metres (112 feet) tall [50] This was declared as the world's largest bust by Guinness World Records [51] [52]\n\n\nPolitical views\nWhen Ayushmann Khurrana asked him how to choose the \"correct political stance\", Sadhguru responded by saying that he does not subscribe to a political party, and others should not either [55] He stated that, \"party membership should be cancelled because this is becoming a tribe.\" [55] Accordingly, he encourages individuals to vote for a given party after evaluating their performance in office to \"see who makes more sense\" [55] However, his views are occasionally perceived as Hindu nationalist and thus close to the Bharatiya Janata Party [5] [56] [57] [58]\nIn 2019 he referred to a Muslim student in London as a \"Taliban,\" for which he apologized after heavy criticism [59]\nAfter recognizing the failure in the \"government's communication\" of the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act in India, Sadhguru spoke in support of the act [60] [61] [62] In 2018, he accused liberals of being fanatics [63]\n\n\nPseudoscience\nSadhguru has made a number claims that are inconsistent with scientific consensus [3] [64] [2] Although India approved the ratification of the international Minamata Convention on Mercury to ban its usage, Sadhguru advocates for the use of mercury in the context of traditional Indian medicine such as Siddha medicine [65] [66] [2] [67] He has also repeatedly stated he can solidify mercury at room temperature; a claim refuted by Australian scientist Sumaiya Shaikh

R. Martin. The book is presented as a scholarly treatise written by Archmaester Gyldayn, a historian within the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. It provides a detailed account of the history of House Targaryen, from their conquest of Westeros to the events leading up to the Dance of Dragons civil war.\n\n## Publication History\n\nFire & Blood was first published in 2018 by Bantam Books in the United States and by HarperCollins in the United Kingdom. The book is a companion to The World of Ice & Fire, a companion book to A Song of Ice and Fire that provides an in-depth look at the world and its history. In the process of writing The World of Ice & Fire, Martin realized that a significant portion of the material he had written was not suitable for the book's format. As a result, over 200,000 words were removed from the manuscript and incorporated into Fire & Blood.\n\n## Contents\n\nFire & Blood takes the form of a scholarly treatise written by Archmaester Gyldayn, a historian within the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. The book is presented as a collection of primary sources, including chronicles, letters, and other documents that provide insight into the history of House Targaryen. Gyldayn's account is often biased and incomplete, reflecting the medieval methods of historiography that were prevalent during the time period in which the events took place. This makes Gyldayn an unreliable narrator, and readers must be cautious when interpreting the information presented.\n\nThe book is divided into several sections, each of which covers a different period in the history of House Targaryen. The first section provides an account of the Targaryen conquest of Westeros, including the events that led up to the conquest and the initial years of Targaryen rule. The second section covers the reign of King Aegon I Targaryen, also known as Aegon the Conqueror, and his successors. The final section provides an account of the Dance of Dragons civil war, which took place during the reign of King Viserys I Targaryen.\n\n## Reception\n\nFire & Blood received mixed reviews from critics. Some reviewers praised the book for its detailed and nuanced account of the history of House Targaryen, while others criticized it for being overly long and dry. The book's use of primary sources and medieval methods of historiography was seen as a unique and interesting aspect of the book, but it also made it difficult to follow at times.\n\n## Adaptation\n\nThe HBO series House of the Dragon, a prequel to Game of Thrones, is based on material from Fire & Blood. The show is produced by George R. R. Martin, Vince Gerardis, Ryan Condal, and Miguel Sapochnik, who also serves as the showrunner. The show follows the events of the Dance of Dragons civil war, which is covered in the final section of Fire & Blood. The show has received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, and it has been praised for its detailed and nuanced account of the history of House Targaryen.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFire & Blood is a unique and interesting companion book to A Song of Ice and Fire.

It's just that this happened, and I'm down to get in front of the fire, as long as it never happens again\" [29]\n\n\nCeremony\nDuring the ceremony, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion performed the song \"WAP.\" [36] Grammys host Trevor Noah prefaced the performance with, \"If you have small children in the room, just tell them it's a song about giving a cat a bath\", and the chorus \"wet and gushy,\" was changed to \"wet, wet, wet\" [37] Billboard ranked it as the best performance of the ceremony, commenting that \"this had to be one of the most insane television debut performances of all time.\" [38] Music critic Jon Caramanica called the performance \"wildly and charmingly salacious, frisky and genuine in a way that the Grammys has rarely if ever made room for\" [39] However, the performance received criticism for being \"non-family-friendly\" [40]\n\n\nViewership\nThe broadcast received an average of 8.8 million viewers in the United States, with a 2.1 Nielsen rating among adults aged 18 to 49, marking a more than 50 percent decline from the previous year's ceremony, and making it the least-viewed telecast in the history of the Grammys Conversely, the live streaming audience for the show was up 83 percent over 2020 and the hashtag, #Grammys trended for 18 hours and peaked in the number one position [2]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Azov_Battalion", "content": "\nHistory\nAccording to right‑wing radicalism researcher Vyacheslav Likhachev, Azov had many roots [27] The brigade was founded by the activists of Patriot of Ukraine, Automaidan, Social-National Assembly and other organisations active during the Euromaidan [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]\n\n\nBackground and founding, February–April 2014\nAccording to right‑wing radicalism researcher Vyacheslav Likhachev, Azov had many roots [27] The brigade was founded by the activists of Patriot of Ukraine, Automaidan, Social-National Assembly and other organisations active during the Euromaidan [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]\n\n\nSpecial Tasks Patrol Police, May 2014\nThe battalion had its baptism by fire in Mariupol in May 2014, where it was involved in combat during the First Battle of Mariupol as part of a counter-offensive to recapture the city from separatists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) [54] [44] On 13 June, together with fellow Special Tasks Patrol Police battalion Dnipro-1, they retook key buildings and strongholds occupied by separatists, killing at least five separatists and destroying one enemy BRDM-2 armoured vehicle and one armored truck during battle [55] [56] After the battle, Azov remained as a garrison in Mariupol for a time, where they were tasked of patrolling the region around the Sea of Azov to prevent arms trafficking from Russia into separatist hands, [57] and was briefly relocated to Berdiansk [58] On 10 June, the battalion dismissed deputy commander Yaroslav Honchar and distanced themselves from him after he made statements critical of looting and debauchery in the Azov Battalion [59] Ihor Mosiychuk became deputy commander [60]\n\n\nReorganisation and incorporation into the National Guard of Ukraine, November 2014\nIn September 2014, the Azov Battalion underwent a reorganisation, and was upgraded to a regiment, [10] [77] and on 11 November, the regiment was officially enrolled into the National Guard of Ukraine [10] This was part of larger policy changes by the Ukrainian government of integrating the independent volunteer battalions under either the Ukrainian Ground Forces or the National Guard into the formal chain-of-command of the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) [78] The now-Azov Regiment was designated as \"Military Unit 3057\" and officially named the \"Azov\" Special Operations Detachment\" [79]\n\n\nBattle of Shyrokyne, January 2015\nOn 24 January 2015, Mariupol came under an indiscriminate rocket bombing by separatists, which left 31 dead and 108 injured [82] On 28 January, two Azov members were killed in a shelling of a checkpoint in the eastern part of Mariupol [83] Both attacks were conducted from an area near the village of Shyrokyne, 11 km east of Mariupol, where there was significant movement of separatist troops in the region, stoking fears of a third offensive against Mariupol.\n\n\n2016–2019\nOn 27 April 2016, 300 troops and light armored vehicles from the regiment were assigned to Odesa to safeguard public order after Oblast Governor Mikheil Saakashvili wrote in social media about a rash of pro-Russian \"titushki\" attacks on civilians [105] In 2017, the size of the regiment was estimated at more than 2,500 members [3]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nThe Azov Regiment regained attention during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 Before the conflict, Azov was the subject of a propaganda war: Russia used the regiment's official incorporation into the National Guard of Ukraine as one of the proofs for its portrait of the Ukrainian government and military as under Nazi control, with \"denazification\" as a key casus belli [110] [111] The regiment, on the other hand, was noted for its ability to self-promote, producing high quality videos of its drone strikes and other military activities; The Daily Telegraph called it a \"well-oiled publicity machine\" [16] Others have noted how their participation in the war and defense of Mariupol have increased national and international notoriety and popularity of the unit [112] [failed verification] The regiment's destruction has been among Moscow's war objectives [113]\n\n\nDefense of Mariupol\nMost of the Azov Regiment was stationed in Mariupol at the beginning of the invasion In March 2022, Deutsche Welle reported that the regiment was the primary unit defending Mariupol in the siege of Mariupol [119] As the battle raged, Azov became notable for its fierce defense of the city For example, PBS called it \"a seasoned volunteer force that is widely considered one of the country's most capable units\" [120] On 19 March 2022, president Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to Azov's commander in Mariupol, Lieutenant Colonel Denys Prokopenko [121]\n\n\nOther 'Azov' units\nWhile the bulk of the Azov Regiment was based in Mariupol, with the full-scale invasion new Azov units began to be organized outside of the city, in particular in Kyiv and Kharkiv [173] Veterans of the Azov Regiment formed the \"backbone\" of these units [174] These units were initially part of the Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine (TDF) The Azov TDF units proved themselves to be particularly effective in combat, and thus they were turned into regiments and reassigned as part of the Special Operations Forces of Ukraine (SSO), where they received special training and equipment These units are known as the \"Azov SSO\", with units in Kyiv, Kharkiv and a new one in Sumy [173] In May 2022, The Times reported that a new Azov unit had been created in Kharkiv, bearing a new insignia of a stylized Tryzub formed by three golden swords [172] In January 2023, the Azov SSO units were merged and reformed into the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade under the Ukrainian Ground Forces It is a mechanised infantry unit with the aim of providing a highly mobile, well-armed and well-trained unit that can effectively engage in both defensive and offensive operations [175] In January, the unit was deployed to the battle of Bakhmut [176]\n\n\nLeadership and organisation\nThe brigade's first commander and founder was Andriy Biletsky [16] Biletsky stayed out of the public spotlight working on expanding Azov to battalion size In summer 2014, he took command of the unit In August 2014, he was awarded the military decoration \"Order for Courage\" by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Interior Ministry's police forces [179] After Biletsky was elected into the Ukrainian parliament in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election he left the regiment, and terminated his contract with the National Guard in 2016 (Ukrainian elected officials cannot be in the military, nor the police) [180] [181] [182]\n\n\nCommanders\nBiletsky led Azov from its inception as a volunteer battalion in May to October 2014, when he ran for office in the 2014 parliamentary elections [186] Previous Azov commanders included Ihor Mykhailenko and Maksym Zhorin [187] [when?]  From July 2017 to May 2022, the unit's commander was Lieutenant Colonel Denys Prokopenko, who became the youngest commander in the history of the armed forces of Ukraine [188] [6] [189] In May 2022, the unit's second in command was Captain Sviatoslav Palamar, [190] who was captured by Russian forces and later released in a prisoner swap On 18 June 2022, Mykyta Nadtochiy was appointed as new commander of the Azov Regiment [191]\n\n\nStatus\nAzov was initially formed as a volunteer militia in May 2014 [23] In 2015, the Ukrainian government decided to turn all volunteer battalions — both the Territorial Defence Battalions associated with the armed forces, and the Special Tasks Patrol Police of the interior ministry — into regular units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the National Guard, respectively Azov is one of the latter The Ukrainian government also opted to deploy only volunteer units to the Donbas front, [citation needed] pledging that conscripts would not be sent into combat.\n\n\nForeign fighters\nAccording to The Daily Telegraph in August 2014, the Azov Battalion's extremist politics and professional English social media pages had attracted foreign fighters, [69] including people from Brazil, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Greece, Sweden, [183] [69] Spain, Slovakia, Croatia, Czechia, and Russia [183] [195] [196] [197]\n\n\nAzov movement\nThe Azov Battalion has created its own civilian political movement, collectively known as the \"Azov movement\", made up of an umbrella of organizations formed by former Azov veterans or groups linked to Azov, and with roots in the ultranationalist paramilitary Patriot of Ukraine group led by Azov founder Andriy Biletsky and the associated far right Social-National Assembly [181] [77] According to Radio Free Europe in 2018, the Azov movement \"considers close allies\" several far-right organisations around the world, like CasaPound, Golden Dawn, Szturmowcy, National Democratic Party of Germany and Alternative For Germany [217]\n\n\nAzov Civil Corps\nIn the spring of 2015, veterans of the Azov Battalion created the core of a non-military non-governmental organization, the Azov Civil Corps (Tsyvilnyi Korpus \"Azov\"), for the purpose of \"political and social struggle\" [227] [228]\n\n\nNational Corps\nIn 2016, veterans of the regiment and members of the Azov Civil Corps founded the political party National Corps [228] The party advocates for a stronger government control over politics and economy, completely breaking ties with Russia and opposes Ukraine joining both the European Union and NATO [228] [30] The party's first leader was Andriy Biletsky [181] According to an expert in a 2022 article by Bayerischer Rundfunk, there is an \"incompatibility resolution\", which meant that active fighters could not become members of the National Corps [229]\n\n\nYouth Corps\nThe Youth Corps (Yunatskyy Korpus) is a non-governmental organization engaged in the \"patriotic upbringing\" of children, and to take them once they grow up, to the National Militia of \"Azov movement\" [231] Many members of the Youth Corps, beginning in 2015, organized summer camps where children and teenagers received combat training mixed with lectures on Ukrainian nationalism [30] [232]\n\n\nNational Militia, 2017–2020\nIn 2017, a paramilitary group called the National Militia (Natsionalni Druzhyny), closely linked to the Azov movement, was formed Its stated aim was to assist law enforcement agencies, which is allowed under Ukrainian law, and it has conducted street patrols [233] [234] In March 2019, its membership was reportedly \"in the low thousands\" [235] On 29 January 2018, members of the National Militia stormed a municipal council meeting in Cherkasy, and refused to let officials leave the building until they had approved the city's long-delayed budget [236] In 2018, the National Militia carried out a series of attacks on Romani settlements [237] [238] In one attack on June 7 2018, it used axes and sledgehammers to dismantle a Romani community in Holosiyivskiy Park in Kiyv, which was the fourth such instance of attacks by far-right groups against Romani settlements in Ukraine in the past month and a half [237]\n\n\nCenturia\nAccording to Oleksiy Kuzmenko, in a piece published for the George Washington University's Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian studies, the leadership of Centuria – a self-described \"European traditionalist\" group of military officers that aims to \"defend\" the \"cultural and ethnic identity\" of European peoples against \"Brussels' politicos and bureaucrats\" — has ties to the Azov movement [241] The organization \"has promoted Azov to Hetman Petro Sahaidachny National Army Academy (NAA) cadets, and credibly claimed that its members lectured in the Azov Regiment of the National Guard, the military wing of the Azov movement.\" Belltower.News similarly states that Centuria has \"close connections with the Ukrainian neo-Nazi scene\" while both Belltower and Colborne say that Centuria is the successor organization to the National Militia [242] [240]\n\n\nHuman rights violations\nIn 2016, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch received several credible allegations of abuse and torture by the regiment [244] Reports published by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented looting of civilian homes and unlawful detention and torture of civilians between September 2014 and February 2015 \"by Ukrainian armed forces and the Azov regiment in and around Shyrokyne\" [245] [246]\n\n\nNeo-Nazism allegations\nThe unit has drawn controversy since its founding over its early association with far-right groups and neo-Nazi ideology, and its use of controversial symbols linked to Nazism [69] [252] Academic researchers argue that the regiment has changed since its integration into the National Guard, tempering far-right elements and distancing from the movement [253] [254] Alexander Ritzmann, a Senior Advisor to the Counter Extremism Project, wrote of the Azov Battalion: \"when your country is under attack by foreign invaders, it is understandable that Ukrainians will not focus on the political views of their co-defenders, but on who can and will fight the invaders\" [21] Researchers note that since its formation, Azov has been through general depolitization, acted \"with considerably less neo-Nazism and extremism\", \"and included Muslims, Jews, and other minorities within its ranks\" [34] Some independent researchers and journalists have still been critical of the regiment's role within the larger far-right Azov Movement [220] [255]\n\n\nConnection to antisemitism\nThe founder of the battalion, Andriy Biletsky, said in 2010 that the Ukrainian nation's mission is to \"lead the white races of the world in a final crusade … against Semite-led Untermenschen\" [295] [236] According to the Freedom House initiative, Reporting Radicalism, Biletsky stopped making anti-Semitic statements after February 2014 But it said \"anti-Semitism is sometimes manifested at the local level\" of his political party [296]\n\n\nInternational arms and training controversies\nIn March 2015, Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that the Azov Regiment would be among the first units to be trained by United States Army troops in the Operation Fearless Guardian training mission [297] [298] US training however was withdrawn on 12 June 2015, as the US House of Representatives passed an amendment blocking any aid (including arms and training) to the regiment due to its neo-Nazi background [299] [300] However, the amendment was later removed in November 2015, [299] with James Carden writing in The Nation that an \"official familiar with the debate\" told him that the \"House Defense Appropriations Committee came under pressure from the Pentagon to remove the Conyers-Yoho amendment from the text of the bill.\" [301] The decision was opposed by the Simon Wiesenthal Center

Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that the Azov Regiment would be among the first units to be trained by United States Army troops in the Operation Fearless Guardian training mission

background [299] [300] However, the amendment was later removed in November 2015, [299] with James Carden writing in The Nation that an \"official familiar with the debate\" told him that the \"House Defense Appropriations Committee came under pressure from the Pentagon to remove the Conyers-Yoho amendment from the text of the bill.\" [301] The decision was opposed by the Simon Wiesenthal Center which stated that lifting the ban highlighted the danger of Holocaust distortion in Ukraine, and by a Likud MP, but supported by Ukraine's Jewish community [299]\n\n\nCanada\nIn June 2015, the Canadian defense minister declared that Canadian forces would not provide training or support to the Azov Regiment [311]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn 2018, more than 40 Israeli human rights activists signed a petition to stop arms sales to Ukraine, saying there was evidence some of these arms might end up in the hands of the forces that the activists said openly espouse a neo-Nazi ideology, such as the Azov Regiment [313] In 2022, The Jerusalem Post raised concerns about the MATADOR anti-tank weapon, co-developed by Germany, Israel and Singapore, being shown in videos fired by a fighter from what it characterized as \"the Neo-Nazi Azov Battalion\" [314]\n\n\nGreece\nIn April 2022, a controversy occurred in Greece when Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared with a soldier from the Azov Regiment via video link to address the Hellenic Parliament This soldier had allegedly been chosen to speak on the destruction of Mariupol because of his Greek ethnicity and knowledge of the language The appearance caused outrage by opposition parties SYRIZA and KINAL and was labelled a \"provocation\" because of the association of the Azov Regiment with neo-Nazism [315] Giannis Oikonomou  [el], spokesperson of the Greek Government, said the inclusion of the Azov Regiment message was \"incorrect and inappropriate\", but criticized SYRIZA for using the incident for political gain

the creation of Azov, with anti-Euromaidan and the Russian neo-Nazi figures [33] More academic researchers note the connection between extremist groups within Ukraine and Russian intelligence services, where Russia utilizes these far-right groups as tools for its hybrid propaganda warfare One of the tactics Russia used was to employ these groups, contribute to their growth and expose their extremes to indirectly advance Russian narratives [316] The regiment, along with other similar groups, has been central to Russia's narrative that there is a Nazi influence that permeates Ukraine, justifying intervention by the Russian armed forces in efforts to \"denazify\" it The unit is regularly singled out by Russia as proof that the Ukrainian armed forces are plagued with neo-Nazism [317] This narrative has been a part of Russian propaganda since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to Russia scholar Izabella Tabarovsky of the Wilson Center, who said \"there has been an intensive campaign of demonization, a certain resonance for Putin's core supporters in Russia\" because \"there is a national historical memory formed around World War II and the victory over Nazis It is a strong part of the  [Russian] national identity.\" [305]\n\n\nPre-2022\nNationalism researcher Andreas Umland notes \"a contradictory, if not paradoxical history of cooperation\" of

Ukrainian neo-Nazism continued, and the Azov Regiment has similarly played a central role under the pretext of \"denazifying\" Ukraine, with Russian media claiming its overwhelming presence and influence within Ukraine to paint a picture of the whole of the Ukrainian government and military as under Nazi control [110] [111] [253] In addition, another of Russia's claimed justifications for its invasion was that members of the Azov Regiment in Mariupol were responsible for war crimes Chief Spokesman Igor Konashenkov of Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed: \"It was these Azov Battalion Nazis who had been exterminating civilian population in Donetsk and Luhansk republics, deliberately and with exceptional cruelty, for eight years.\" [326]\n\n\nSham trials in Russia\nThe Azov Regiment

August 2022, Russia declared the Azov regiment as a terrorist organization This decision supports \"the use of Russian criminal law against prisoners of war\", and opens the possibility to manipulate with the accusations of war crimes and fictional charges \"to punish participants in the Ukrainian war\" [345]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n",

Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The unit was founded in 2014 and has been associated with far-right and neo-Nazi ideologies, although its leaders have denied these allegations.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Azov Battalion was founded by a group of activists from the Patriot of Ukraine, Automaidan, Social-National Assembly, and other organizations that were active during the Euromaidan protests. The unit was formed in February 2014, and its initial goal was to provide security for the city of Mariupol, which was located in the Donetsk Oblast. The battalion was initially composed of around 100 volunteers, but its numbers grew rapidly as the conflict escalated.\n\n**Background and founding, February–April 2014**\n\nThe Azov Battalion was founded in the midst of the Euromaidan protests, which were a wave of protests and demonstrations that swept across Ukraine in November 2013. The protests were sparked by the Ukrainian government's decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the European Union, which many Ukrainians saw as a betrayal of their country's aspirations to join the EU. The protests were led by a coalition of opposition parties, civil society groups, and ordinary citizens, who were demanding greater democracy, economic reform, and greater integration with the EU.\n\nThe Azov Battalion was founded by a group of activists from the Patriot of Ukraine, Automaidan, Social-National Assembly, and other organizations that were active during the Euromaidan protests. The unit was formed in February 2014, and its initial goal was to provide security for the city of Mariupol, which was located in the Donetsk Oblast. The battalion was initially composed of around 100 volunteers, but its numbers grew rapidly as the conflict escalated.\n\n**Special Tasks Patrol Police, May 2014**\n\nIn May 2014, the Azov Battalion was involved in the First Battle of Mariupol, which was a counter-offensive to recapture the city from separatists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). The battalion fought alongside other Special Tasks Patrol Police units, and together they were able to retake key buildings and strongholds occupied by separatists. The Azov Battalion suffered casualties during the battle, but they were able to hold their ground and prevent the separatists from advancing further.\n\n**Reorganisation and incorporation into the National Guard of Ukraine, November 2014**\n\nIn September 2014, the Azov Battalion underwent a reorganisation, and was upgraded to a regiment. On 11 November, the regiment was officially enrolled into the National Guard of Ukraine, which was a significant development for the unit. The National Guard of Ukraine was a professional military force that was responsible for maintaining law and order in Ukraine, and the incorporation of the Azov Regiment into this force marked a significant step towards its formalisation.\n\n**Battle of Shyrokyne, January 2015**\n\nIn January 2015, Mariupol came under an indiscriminate rocket bombing by separatists, which left 31 dead and 108 injured. The Azov Regiment was involved in the defense of Mariupol during this attack, and they were able to hold their ground against the separatist forces. However, the attack highlighted the ongoing conflict in the region and the need for continued military action to protect Ukrainian civilians.\n\n**2016–2019**\n\nIn 2016, the Azov Regiment was assigned to Odesa to safeguard public order after Oblast Governor Mikheil Saakashvili wrote in social media about a rash of pro-Russian \"titushki\" attacks on civilians. The regiment was able to maintain order in the region and prevent further violence. In 2017, the size of the regiment was estimated at more than 2,500 members.\n\n**Russian invasion of Ukraine**\n\nThe Azov Regiment regained attention during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The regiment, along with other Ukrainian military units, was involved in the defense of Mariupol, which was a key city in the conflict. The Azov Regiment was able to hold its ground against the Russian forces, but they were eventually forced to surrender.\n\n**Leadership and organisation**\n\nThe Azov Regiment was founded by Andriy Biletsky, who was its first commander and founder. Biletsky was a key figure in the unit's early development and played a significant role in its growth and expansion. After Biletsky was elected into the Ukrainian parliament in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, he left the regiment, and terminated his contract with the National Guard in 2016.\n\n**Commanders**\n\nPrevious Azov commanders included Ihor Mykhailenko and Maksym Zhorin. From July 2017 to May 2022, the unit's commander was Lieutenant Colonel Denys Prokopenko, who became the youngest commander in the history of the armed forces of Ukraine. In May 2022, the unit's second in command was Captain Sviatoslav Palamar. On 18 June 2022, Mykyta Nadtochiy was appointed as new commander of the Azov Regiment.\n\n**Status**\n\nThe Azov Regiment was initially formed as a volunteer militia in May 2014. In 2015, the Ukrainian government decided to turn all volunteer battalions, including the Azov Regiment, into regular units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the National Guard, respectively. The regiment was officially enrolled into the National Guard of Ukraine on 11 November 2014.\n\n**Foreign fighters**\n\nAccording to reports, the Azov Regiment has attracted foreign fighters, including people from Brazil, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Greece, Sweden, Spain, Slovakia, Croatia, Czechia, and Russia. These foreign fighters were drawn to the unit's extremist ideology and were willing to fight alongside Ukrainian nationalists against Russian-backed separatists.\n\n**Azov movement**\n\nThe Azov Regiment has created its own civilian political movement, known as the Azov movement, which is an umbrella of organizations formed by former Azov veterans or groups linked to Azov. The movement is associated with far-right and neo-Nazi ideologies and has been criticized for its extremist views.\n\n**Azov Civil Corps**\n\nIn the spring of 2015, veterans of the Azov Regiment created the core of a non-military non-governmental organization, the Azov Civil Corps (Tsyvilnyi Korpus \"Azov\"), for the purpose of \"political and social struggle\".\n\n**National Corps**\n\nIn 2016, veterans of the regiment and members of the Azov Civil Corps founded the political party National Corps. The party advocates for a stronger government control over politics and economy, completely breaking ties with Russia and opposes Ukraine joining both the European Union and NATO.\n\n**Youth Corps**\n\nThe Youth Corps (Yunatskyy Korpus) is a non-governmental organization engaged in the \"patriotic upbringing\" of children, and to take them once they grow up, to the National Militia of \"Azov movement\". Many members of the Youth Corps, beginning in 2015, organized summer camps where children and teenagers received combat training mixed with lectures on Ukrainian nationalism.\n\n**National Militia**\n\nIn 2017, a paramilitary group called the National Militia (Natsionalni Druzhyny), closely linked to the Azov movement, was formed. The stated aim of the National Militia was to assist law enforcement agencies, which is allowed under Ukrainian law, and it has conducted street patrols.\n\n**Centuria**\n\nThe leadership of Centuria, a self-described \"European traditionalist\" group of military officers, has ties to the Azov movement. Centuria has promoted Azov to Hetman Petro Sahaidachny National Army Academy (NAA) cadets, and it claimed that its members lectured in the Azov Regiment of the National Guard, the military wing of the Azov movement.\n\n**Human rights violations**\n\nIn 2016, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch received several credible allegations of abuse and torture by the Azov Regiment. Reports published by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented looting of civilian homes and unlawful detention and torture of civilians between September 2014 and February 2015 \"by Ukrainian armed forces and the Azov regiment in and around Shyrokyne\".\n\n**Neo-Nazism allegations**\n\nThe Azov Regiment has drawn controversy since its founding over its early association with far-right groups and neo-Nazi ideology, and its use of controversial symbols linked to Nazism. Academic researchers argue that the regiment has changed since its integration into the National Guard, tempering far-right elements and distancing from the movement.\n\n**Connection to antisemitism**\n\nThe founder of the Azov Regiment, Andriy Biletsky, said in 2010 that the Ukrainian nation's mission is to \"lead the white races of the world in a final crusade … against Semite-led Untermenschen\". According to the Freedom House initiative, Reporting Radicalism, Biletsky stopped making anti-Semitic statements after February 2014.\n\n**International arms and training controversies**\n\nIn March 2015, Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that the Azov Regiment would be among the first units to be trained by United States Army troops in the Operation Fearless Guardian training mission. However, US training was withdrawn on 12 June 2015, as the US House of Representatives passed an amendment blocking any aid (including arms and training) to the regiment due to its neo-Nazi background.\n\n**Use in Russian propaganda and information campaigns**\n\nThe Azov Regiment has been central to Russia's narrative that there is a Nazi influence that permeates Ukraine, justifying intervention by the Russian armed forces in efforts to \"denazify\" it. The unit is regularly singled out by Russia as proof that the Ukrainian armed forces are plagued with neo-Nazism.\n\n**Sham trials in Russia**\n\nIn August 2022, Russia declared the Azov Regiment as a terrorist organization.

participants in the Ukrainian war\".", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Azov_Battalion\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to right‑wing radicalism researcher Vyacheslav Likhachev, Azov had many roots [27] The brigade was founded by the activists of Patriot of Ukraine, Automaidan, Social-National Assembly and other organisations active during the Euromaidan [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]\n\n\nBackground and founding, February–April 2014\nAccording to right‑wing radicalism researcher Vyacheslav Likhachev, Azov had many roots [27] The brigade was founded by the activists of Patriot of Ukraine, Automaidan, Social-National Assembly and other organisations active during the Euromaidan [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]\n\n\nSpecial Tasks Patrol Police, May 2014\nThe battalion had its baptism by fire in Mariupol in May 2014, where it was involved in combat during the First Battle of Mariupol as part of a counter-offensive to recapture the city from separatists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) [54] [44] On 13 June, together with fellow Special Tasks Patrol Police battalion Dnipro-1, they retook key buildings and strongholds occupied by separatists, killing at least five separatists and destroying one enemy BRDM-2 armoured vehicle and one armored truck during battle [55] [56] After the battle, Azov remained as a garrison in Mariupol for a time, where they were tasked of patrolling the region around the Sea of Azov to prevent arms trafficking from Russia into separatist hands, [57] and was briefly relocated to Berdiansk [58] On 10 June, the battalion dismissed deputy commander Yaroslav Honchar and distanced themselves from him after he made statements critical of looting and debauchery in the Azov Battalion [59] Ihor Mosiychuk became deputy commander [60]\n\n\nReorganisation and incorporation into the National Guard of Ukraine, November 2014\nIn September 2014, the Azov Battalion underwent a reorganisation, and was upgraded to a regiment, [10] [77] and on 11 November, the regiment was officially enrolled into the National Guard of Ukraine [10] This was part of larger policy changes by the Ukrainian government of integrating the independent volunteer battalions under either the Ukrainian Ground Forces or the National Guard into the formal chain-of-command of the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) [78] The now-Azov Regiment was designated as \"Military Unit 3057\" and officially named the \"Azov\" Special Operations Detachment\" [79]\n\n\nBattle of Shyrokyne, January 2015\nOn 24 January 2015, Mariupol came under an indiscriminate rocket bombing by separatists, which left 31 dead and 108 injured [82] On 28 January, two Azov members were killed in a shelling of a checkpoint in the eastern part of Mariupol [83] Both attacks were conducted from an area near the village of Shyrokyne, 11 km east of Mariupol, where there was significant movement of separatist troops in the region, stoking fears of a third offensive against Mariupol.\n\n\n2016–2019\nOn 27 April 2016, 300 troops and light armored vehicles from the regiment were assigned to Odesa to safeguard public order after Oblast Governor Mikheil Saakashvili wrote in social media about a rash of pro-Russian \"titushki\" attacks on civilians [105] In 2017, the size of the regiment was estimated at more than 2,500 members [3]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nThe Azov Regiment regained attention during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 Before the conflict, Azov was the subject of a propaganda war: Russia used the regiment's official incorporation into the National Guard of Ukraine as one of the proofs for its portrait of the Ukrainian government and military as under Nazi control, with \"denazification\" as a key casus belli [110] [111] The regiment, on the other hand, was noted for its ability to self-promote, producing high quality videos of its drone strikes and other military activities; The Daily Telegraph called it a \"well-oiled publicity machine\" [16] Others have noted how their participation in the war and defense of Mariupol have increased national and international notoriety and popularity of the unit [112] [failed verification] The regiment's destruction has been among Moscow's war objectives [113]\n\n\nDefense of Mariupol\nMost of the Azov Regiment was stationed in Mariupol at the beginning of the invasion In March 2022, Deutsche Welle reported that the regiment was the primary unit defending Mariupol in the siege of Mariupol [119] As the battle raged, Azov became notable for its fierce defense of the city For example, PBS called it \"a seasoned volunteer force that is widely considered one of the country's most capable units\" [120] On 19 March 2022, president Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to Azov's commander in Mariupol, Lieutenant Colonel Denys Prokopenko [121]\n\n\nOther 'Azov' units\nWhile the bulk of the Azov Regiment was based in Mariupol, with the full-scale invasion new Azov units began to be organized outside of the city, in particular in Kyiv and Kharkiv [173] Veterans of the Azov Regiment formed the \"backbone\" of these units [174] These units were initially part of the Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine (TDF) The Azov TDF units proved themselves to be particularly effective in combat, and thus they were turned into regiments and reassigned as part of the Special Operations Forces of Ukraine (SSO), where they received special training and equipment These units are known as the \"Azov SSO\", with units in Kyiv, Kharkiv and a new one in Sumy [173] In May 2022, The Times reported that a new Azov unit had been created in Kharkiv, bearing a new insignia of a stylized Tryzub formed by three golden swords [172] In January 2023, the Azov SSO units were merged and reformed into the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade under the Ukrainian Ground Forces It is a mechanised infantry unit with the aim of providing a highly mobile, well-armed and well-trained unit that can effectively engage in both defensive and offensive operations [175] In January, the unit was deployed to the battle of Bakhmut [176]\n\n\nLeadership and organisation\nThe brigade's first commander and founder was Andriy Biletsky [16] Biletsky stayed out of the public spotlight working on expanding Azov to battalion size In summer 2014, he took command of the unit In August 2014, he was awarded the military decoration \"Order for Courage\" by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Interior Ministry's police forces [179] After Biletsky was elected into the Ukrainian parliament in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election he left the regiment, and terminated his contract with the National Guard in 2016 (Ukrainian elected officials cannot be in the military, nor the police) [180] [181] [182]\n\n\nCommanders\nBiletsky led Azov from its inception as a volunteer battalion in May to October 2014, when he ran for office in the 2014 parliamentary elections [186] Previous Azov commanders included Ihor Mykhailenko and Maksym Zhorin [187] [when?]  From July 2017 to May 2022, the unit's commander was Lieutenant Colonel Denys Prokopenko, who became the youngest commander in the history of the armed forces of Ukraine [188] [6] [189] In May 2022, the unit's second in command was Captain Sviatoslav Palamar, [190] who was captured by Russian forces and later released in a prisoner swap On 18 June 2022, Mykyta Nadtochiy was appointed as new commander of the Azov Regiment [191]\n\n\nStatus\nAzov was initially formed as a volunteer militia in May 2014 [23] In 2015, the Ukrainian government decided to turn all volunteer battalions — both the Territorial Defence Battalions associated with the armed forces, and the Special Tasks Patrol Police of the interior ministry — into regular units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the National Guard, respectively Azov is one of the latter The Ukrainian government also opted to deploy only volunteer units to the Donbas front, [citation needed] pledging that conscripts would not be sent into combat.\n\n\nForeign fighters\nAccording to The Daily Telegraph in August 2014, the Azov Battalion's extremist politics and professional English social media pages had attracted foreign fighters, [69] including people from Brazil, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Greece, Sweden, [183] [69] Spain, Slovakia, Croatia, Czechia, and Russia [183] [195] [196] [197]\n\n\nAzov movement\nThe Azov Battalion has created its own civilian political movement, collectively known as the \"Azov movement\", made up of an umbrella of organizations formed by former Azov veterans or groups linked to Azov, and with roots in the ultranationalist paramilitary Patriot of Ukraine group led by Azov founder Andriy Biletsky and the associated far right Social-National Assembly [181] [77] According to Radio Free Europe in 2018, the Azov movement \"considers close allies\" several far-right organisations around the world, like CasaPound, Golden Dawn, Szturmowcy, National Democratic Party of Germany and Alternative For Germany [217]\n\n\nAzov Civil Corps\nIn the spring of 2015, veterans of the Azov Battalion created the core of a non-military non-governmental organization, the Azov Civil Corps (Tsyvilnyi Korpus \"Azov\"), for the purpose of \"political and social struggle\" [227] [228]\n\n\nNational Corps\nIn 2016, veterans of the regiment and members of the Azov Civil Corps founded the political party National Corps [228] The party advocates for a stronger government control over politics and economy, completely breaking ties with Russia and opposes Ukraine joining both the European Union and NATO [228] [30] The party's first leader was Andriy Biletsky [181] According to an expert in a 2022 article by Bayerischer Rundfunk, there is an \"incompatibility resolution\", which meant that active fighters could not become members of the National Corps [229]\n\n\nYouth Corps\nThe Youth Corps (Yunatskyy Korpus) is a non-governmental organization engaged in the \"patriotic upbringing\" of children, and to take them once they grow up, to the National Militia of \"Azov movement\" [231] Many members of the Youth Corps, beginning in 2015, organized summer camps where children and teenagers received combat training mixed with lectures on Ukrainian nationalism [30] [232]\n\n\nNational Militia, 2017–2020\nIn 2017, a paramilitary group called the National Militia (Natsionalni Druzhyny), closely linked to the Azov movement, was formed Its stated aim was to assist law enforcement agencies, which is allowed under Ukrainian law, and it has conducted street patrols [233] [234] In March 2019, its membership was reportedly \"in the low thousands\" [235] On 29 January 2018, members of the National Militia stormed a municipal council meeting in Cherkasy, and refused to let officials leave the building until they had approved the city's long-delayed budget [236] In 2018, the National Militia carried out a series of attacks on Romani settlements [237] [238] In one attack on June 7 2018, it used axes and sledgehammers to dismantle a Romani community in Holosiyivskiy Park in Kiyv, which was the fourth such instance of attacks by far-right groups against Romani settlements in Ukraine in the past month and a half [237]\n\n\nCenturia\nAccording to Oleksiy Kuzmenko, in a piece published for the George Washington University's Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian studies, the leadership of Centuria – a self-described \"European traditionalist\" group of military officers that aims to \"defend\" the \"cultural and ethnic identity\" of European peoples against \"Brussels' politicos and bureaucrats\" — has ties to the Azov movement [241] The organization \"has promoted Azov to Hetman Petro Sahaidachny National Army Academy (NAA) cadets, and credibly claimed that its members lectured in the Azov Regiment of the National Guard, the military wing of the Azov movement.\" Belltower.News similarly states that Centuria has \"close connections with the Ukrainian neo-Nazi scene\" while both Belltower and Colborne say that Centuria is the successor organization to the National Militia [242] [240]\n\n\nHuman rights violations\nIn 2016, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch received several credible allegations of abuse and torture by the regiment [244] Reports published by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented looting of civilian homes and unlawful detention and torture of civilians between September 2014 and February 2015 \"by Ukrainian armed forces and the Azov regiment in and around Shyrokyne\" [245] [246]\n\n\nNeo-Nazism allegations\nThe unit has drawn controversy since its founding over its early association with far-right groups and neo-Nazi ideology, and its use of controversial symbols linked to Nazism [69] [252] Academic researchers argue that the regiment has changed since its integration into the National Guard, tempering far-right elements and distancing from the movement [253] [254] Alexander Ritzmann, a Senior Advisor to the Counter Extremism Project, wrote of the Azov Battalion: \"when your country is under attack by foreign invaders, it is understandable that Ukrainians will not focus on the political views of their co-defenders, but on who can and will fight the invaders\" [21] Researchers note that since its formation, Azov has been through general depolitization, acted \"with considerably less neo-Nazism and extremism\", \"and included Muslims, Jews, and other minorities within its ranks\" [34] Some independent researchers and journalists have still been critical of the regiment's role within the larger far-right Azov Movement [220] [255]\n\n\nConnection to antisemitism\nThe founder of the battalion, Andriy Biletsky, said in 2010 that the Ukrainian nation's mission is to \"lead the white races of the world in a final crusade … against Semite-led Untermenschen\" [295] [236] According to the Freedom House initiative, Reporting Radicalism, Biletsky stopped making anti-Semitic statements after February 2014 But it said \"anti-Semitism is sometimes manifested at the local level\" of his political party [296]\n\n\nInternational arms and training controversies\nIn March 2015, Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that the Azov Regiment would be among the first units to be trained by United States Army troops in the Operation Fearless Guardian training mission [297] [298] US training however was withdrawn on 12 June 2015, as the US House of Representatives passed an amendment blocking any aid (including arms and training) to the regiment due to its neo-Nazi background [299] [300] However, the amendment was later removed in November 2015, [299] with James Carden writing in The Nation that an \"official familiar with the debate\" told him that the \"House Defense Appropriations Committee came under pressure from the Pentagon to remove the Conyers-Yoho amendment from the text of the bill.\" [301] The decision was opposed by the Simon Wiesenthal Center which stated that lifting the ban highlighted the danger of Holocaust distortion in Ukraine, and by a Likud MP, but supported by Ukraine's Jewish community [299]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn March 2015, Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that the Azov Regiment would be among the first units to be trained by United States Army troops in the Operation Fearless Guardian training mission [297] [298] US training however was withdrawn on 12 June 2015, as the US House of Representatives passed an amendment

supported by Ukraine's Jewish community [299]\n\n\nCanada\nIn June 2015, the Canadian defense minister declared that Canadian forces would not provide training or support to the Azov Regiment [311]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn 2018, more than 40 Israeli human rights activists signed a petition to stop arms sales to Ukraine, saying there was evidence some of these arms might end up in the hands of the forces that the activists said openly espouse a neo-Nazi ideology, such as the Azov Regiment [313] In 2022, The Jerusalem Post raised concerns about the MATADOR anti-tank weapon, co-developed by Germany, Israel and Singapore, being shown in videos fired by a fighter from what it characterized as \"the Neo-Nazi Azov Battalion\" [314]\n\n\nGreece\nIn April 2022, a controversy occurred in Greece when Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared with a soldier from the Azov Regiment via video link to address the Hellenic Parliament This soldier had allegedly been chosen to speak on the destruction of Mariupol because of his Greek ethnicity and knowledge of the language The appearance caused outrage by opposition parties SYRIZA and KINAL and was labelled a \"provocation\" because of the association of the Azov Regiment with neo-Nazism [315] Giannis Oikonomou  [el], spokesperson of the Greek Government, said the inclusion of the Azov Regiment message was \"incorrect and inappropriate\", but criticized SYRIZA for using the incident for political gain [315]\n\n\nUse in Russian propaganda and information campaigns\nNationalism researcher Andreas Umland notes \"a contradictory, if not paradoxical history of cooperation\" of organizations, involved in the creation of Azov, with anti-Euromaidan and the Russian neo-Nazi figures [33] More academic researchers note the connection between extremist groups within Ukraine and Russian intelligence services, where Russia utilizes these far-right groups as tools for its hybrid propaganda warfare One of the tactics Russia used was to employ these groups, contribute to their growth and expose their extremes to indirectly advance Russian narratives [316] The regiment, along with other similar groups, has been central to Russia's narrative that there is a Nazi influence that permeates Ukraine, justifying intervention by the Russian armed forces in efforts to \"denazify\" it The unit is regularly singled out by Russia as proof that the Ukrainian armed forces are plagued with neo-Nazism [317] This narrative has been a part of Russian propaganda since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to Russia scholar Izabella Tabarovsky of the Wilson Center, who said \"there has been an intensive campaign of demonization, a certain resonance for Putin's core supporters in Russia\" because \"there is a national historical memory formed around World War II and the victory over Nazis It is a strong part of the  [Russian] national identity.\" [305]\n\n\nPre-2022\nNationalism researcher Andreas Umland

because \"there is a national historical memory formed around World War II and the victory over Nazis It is a strong part of the  [Russian] national identity.\" [305]\n\n\nRussian invasion\nIn justifying the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the narrative oriented around Ukrainian neo-Nazism continued, and the Azov Regiment has similarly played a central role under the pretext of \"denazifying\" Ukraine, with Russian media claiming its overwhelming presence and influence within Ukraine to paint a picture of the whole of the Ukrainian government and military as under Nazi control [110] [111] [253] In addition, another of Russia's claimed justifications for its invasion was that members of the Azov Regiment in Mariupol were responsible for war crimes Chief Spokesman Igor Konashenkov of Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed: \"It was these Azov Battalion Nazis who had been exterminating civilian population in Donetsk and Luhansk republics, deliberately and with exceptional cruelty, for eight years.\" [326]\n\n\nSham trials in Russia\nThe Azov Regiment led the defense of Mariupol at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 Around 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers were taken prisoners by Russia in Mariupol in May 2022 In August 2022, Russia declared the Azov regiment as a terrorist organization This decision supports \"the use of Russian criminal law against prisoners of war\", and opens the possibility to manipulate with the accusations of war crimes and fictional charges \"to punish participants in the Ukrainian war\"

another year [17] Carson, who had played for five different clubs since making his debut for Leeds in 2004, explained that he wanted to get settled at one club, saying \"I've been like a nomad for three or four years It'll be good to get some roots and hopefully settle I can see myself here for four or five years, even longer.\" [42] He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Arsenal in the opening match of the 2008–09 Premier League season [citation needed] Despite relegation to the Championship, Carson kept his first team place and after the departure of captain Jonathan Greening he was given the captaincy [citation needed] West Bromwich Albion won promotion back to the Premier League, finishing second, 12 points clear of third place Nottingham Forest with Carson keeping 15 clean sheets out of 43 matches [citation needed] He had been playing regular football for the Midlands club, but in the 2010–11 season, his form seemed to dip and in January 2011, Carson was briefly dropped to the bench for Welsh goalkeeper Boaz Myhill [43] After the appointment of Roy Hodgson as West Bromwich Albion head coach, he swiftly found himself back in favour at The Hawthorns [citation needed]\n\n\nBursaspor\nOn 1 July 2011, Carson completed a move to Turkish Süper Lig club Bursaspor [44] for a £2 million fee [45] Carson enjoyed a good first season with Bursaspor [citation needed] He was an ever-present as they finished eighth, conceding 35 goals in 34 matches, the fifth-lowest in the 2011–12 Süper Lig season [citation needed] He also received a runner-up medal for the 2011–12 Turkish Cup [citation needed]\n\n\nWigan Athletic\nCarson joined Wigan Athletic for £700,000 on a three-year deal on 4 July 2013 [46]\n\n\nDerby County\nAfter Wigan's relegation to League One, Carson signed a two-year deal with Championship club Derby County with an option for a third year The fee was undisclosed [47] At the end of the 2016–17 season, Carson was announced as Derby's Player of the Year [48]\n\n\nManchester City\nCarson signed for reigning Premier League champions Manchester City on 8 August 2019 on loan for the 2019–20 season, as the third-choice goalkeeper behind Ederson and Claudio Bravo [49] He extended his loan for the 2020–21 season [50] On 14 May 2021, he made his first Premier League appearance in almost a decade in a 4–3 away win over Newcastle United During the match, Carson saved a Joe Willock penalty but let in the rebound after the ball fell kindly back to Willock [51]\n\n\nInternational career\nCarson was first called up to the England under-21 squad in October 2003, a month after his 18th birthday, for the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifier against Turkey [8] At the time he was yet to make his competitive debut for Leeds United's first team, [8] and had previously played only four matches for England at other levels [8] He made his under-21 debut in a 3–2 win for England against the Netherlands in February 2004 [61] He was selected in the squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and in the third match against Serbia, he earned his 28th under-21 cap, [62] [63] eclipsing the record held by Gareth Barry and Jamie Carragher [64] His 29th and final cap came against the hosts, the Netherlands, in the semi-final, which finished level at 1–1 after extra-time [citation needed] In the resultant penalty shoot-out, he saved one of the 16 penalties he faced and also scored one himself, but England lost 13–12 [65] Carson has since been overtaken by James Milner as the England Under-21 team's most-capped player [66]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nLiverpool\n\n\nClub\nLiverpool\n\n\nInternational\nLiverpool\n\n\nHonours\nLiverpool\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

dwarf in the Völuspá's Dvergatal, a list of dwarf-names [1] In Old Norse, the name means staff-elf This is reflected in his name Tharkûn, which is \"said to mean 'Staff-man'\" in Khuzdul, the language Tolkien invented for his Dwarves [T 1]\n\n\nIn-universe names\nGandalf is given several names and epithets in Tolkien's writings Faramir calls him the Grey Pilgrim, and reports Gandalf as saying, \"Many are my names in many countries Mithrandir [a] among the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves, Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not.\" [T 2] In an early draft of The Hobbit, he is called Bladorthin, while the name Gandalf is used by the dwarf who later became Thorin Oakenshield [2]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in Middle-earth, one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a staff\" [T 1] Yet the Elf Círdan who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven Ring of Power called Narya, the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element fire later in the same essay: [T 1]\n\n\nFictional biography\nIn Valinor, Gandalf was called Olórin [T 1] He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, one of the people of the Vala Manwë; he was said to be the wisest of the Maiar He was closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose

Ring of Fire Saruman, the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely known until he left with the other ring-bearers at the end of the Third Age that he, and not Círdan, was the holder of the third of the Elven-rings [T 1]\n\n\nThe White Council\nGandalf suspected early on that an evil presence, the Necromancer of Dol Guldur, was not a Nazgûl but Sauron himself He went to Dol Guldur [T 3] to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before him, only to return with greater force, [T 3] and the White Council was formed in response [T

work in the Second Age [T 4] [T 1]\n\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\"The Quest of Erebor\" in Unfinished Tales elaborates upon the story behind The Hobbit It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield, a Dwarf-king in exile, in the Prancing Pony inn at Bree Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with Sauron, and knew that the North was especially vulnerable If Rivendell were to be attacked, the dragon Smaug could cause great devastation He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of Erebor from Smaug, and so the quest was born [T

narrative Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor to assist the quest [T 6] On this quest Gandalf acquires the sword, Glamdring, from the trolls' treasure hoard [T 7] Elrond informs them that the sword was made in Gondolin, a city long ago destroyed, where Elrond's father lived as a child [T 8]\n\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\nGandalf spent the years between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings travelling Middle-earth in search of information on Sauron's resurgence and Bilbo Baggins's mysterious ring, spurred particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a \"present\" from Gollum During this period, he befriended Aragorn and became suspicious of Saruman He spent as much time as he could in the Shire, strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and Frodo,

\"the origin of Gandalf\" [3] It shows a white-bearded man in a large hat and cloak seated among boulders in a mountain forest Carpenter said that Tolkien recalled buying the postcard during his holiday in Switzerland in 1911 Manfred Zimmerman, however, discovered that the painting was by the German artist Josef Madlener and dates from the mid-1920s Carpenter acknowledged that Tolkien was

later called Thorin Oakenshield The name is taken from the same source as all the other Dwarf names (save Balin) in The Hobbit: the \"Catalogue of Dwarves\" in the Völuspá [7] The Old Norse name Gandalfr incorporates the words gandr meaning \"wand\", \"staff\" or (especially in compounds) \"magic\" and álfr \"elf\" The name Gandalf is found in at least one more place in Norse myth, in the semi-historical Heimskringla, which briefly describes Gandalf Alfgeirsson, a legendary Norse king from eastern Norway and rival of Halfdan the Black [8] Gandalf is also the name of a Norse sea-king in Henrik Ibsen's second play, The Burial Mound The name \"Gandolf\" occurs as a character in William Morris' 1896 fantasy novel The Well at the World's End, along with the horse \"Silverfax\", adapted by Tolkien as Gandalf's horse \"Shadowfax\" Morris' book, inspired by Norse myth, is set in a pseudo-medieval landscape; it deeply influenced Tolkien The wizard that became Gandalf was originally named Bladorthin [T 33]\n\n\nGuide\nGandalf's role and importance was substantially increased in the conception of The Lord of the Rings, and in a letter of 1954, Tolkien refers to Gandalf as an \"angel incarnate\" [T 36] In the same letter Tolkien states he was given the form of an old man in order to limit his powers on Earth Both in 1965 and 1971 Tolkien again refers to Gandalf as an angelic being [T 37] [T 38]\n\n\nChrist-figure\nThe critic Anne C Petty, writing about \"Allegory\" in the J.R.R Tolkien Encyclopedia, discusses Gandalf's death and reappearance in Christian terms She cites Michael W Maher, S.J.: \"who could not think of Gandalf's descent into the pits of Moria and his return clothed in white as a death-resurrection motif?\" [15] [16] She at once notes, however, that \"such a narrow  [allegorical] interpretation\" limits the reader's imagination by demanding a single meaning for each character and event [15] Other scholars and theologians have likened Gandalf's return as a \"gleaming white\" figure to the transfiguration of Christ [17] [18] [19]\n\n\nAdaptations\nIn the BBC Radio dramatisations, Gandalf has been voiced by Norman Shelley in The Lord of the Rings (1955–1956), [25] Heron Carvic in The Hobbit (1968), Bernard Mayes in The Lord of the Rings (1979), [26] and Sir Michael Hordern in The Lord of the Rings (1981)

Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. He is one of the most iconic and beloved characters in the series, known for his wisdom, courage, and magical abilities. In this article, we will explore Gandalf's origins, characteristics, and role in Tolkien's stories.\n\n**Names**\n\nTolkien derived the name Gandalf from Gandálfr, a dwarf in the Völuspá's Dvergatal, a list of dwarf-names. In Old Norse, the name means \"staff-elf.\" This is reflected in his name Tharkûn, which is \"said to mean 'Staff-man'\" in Khuzdul, the language Tolkien invented for his Dwarves.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nTolkien derived the name Gandalf from Gandálfr, a dwarf in the Völuspá's Dvergatal, a list of dwarf-names. In Old Norse, the name means \"staff-elf.\" This is reflected in his name Tharkûn, which is \"said to mean 'Staff-man'\" in Khuzdul, the language Tolkien invented for his Dwarves.\n\n**In-universe names**\n\nGandalf is given several names and epithets in Tolkien's writings. Faramir calls him the Grey Pilgrim, and reports Gandalf as saying, \"Many are my names in many countries. Mithrandir [a] among the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves, Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not.\" In an early draft of The Hobbit, he is called Bladorthin, while the name Gandalf is used by the dwarf who later became Thorin Oakenshield.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in Middle-earth, one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a staff.\" Yet the Elf Círdan who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven Ring of Power called Narya, the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element fire later in the same essay.\n\n**Fictional biography**\n\nIn Valinor, Gandalf was called Olórin. He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, one of the people of the Vala Manwë; he was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and Nienna, the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage.

His role as a wizard and his interactions with other characters in the stories have been seen as reflecting various themes and motifs, including the struggle between good and evil, the nature of power

He played a significant role in the transfer of the remains of St Cuthbert from Chester-le-Street to Durham and was a key figure in the founding of the new cathedral at Durham. Uhtred was a skilled military leader who campaigned with Edmund Ironside in Cheshire and later did homage to Cnut as King of England.\n\n**Accomplishments**\n\nIn 995, according to Symeon of Durham, Uhtred went to Durham with his monks to clear the site of the new cathedral. The new cathedral was founded by Bishop Aldhun, and Uhtred married Aldhun's daughter, Ecgfrida, probably at about this time. From his marriage, he received several estates that had belonged to the church. This union marked the beginning of a long and complex relationship between the Uhtred family and the church in Durham.\n\nThe strategic marriage also highlighted Uhtred's importance as a military leader and a landowner. As a member of the powerful Northumbrian family, Uhtred would have played a significant role in the politics of the region. His marriage to Ecgfrida and his subsequent receipt of church estates demonstrate his ability to form alliances and secure his position in Northumbrian society.\n\nUhtred's accomplishments extend beyond his military and marital endeavors. He was a key figure in the founding of the new cathedral at Durham, which would go on to become one of the most important ecclesiastical centers in medieval England. The cathedral's establishment marked a significant shift in the power dynamics of Northumbria, with the church emerging as a dominant force in the region.\n\n**Death**\n\nIn 1016, Uhtred campaigned with Æthelred's son Edmund Ironside in Cheshire and the surrounding shires. While Uhtred was away from his lands, Sweyn's son, Cnut, invaded Yorkshire. Cnut's forces were too strong for Uhtred to fight, and so Uhtred did homage to him as King of England. This marked a significant turning point in Uhtred's life, as he was forced to submit to the Danish king and abandon his claims to power in Northumbria.\n\nUhtred's decision to do homage to Cnut highlights the complexities of 11th-century politics in England. The period was marked by ongoing conflicts between the English and Danish factions, with the Danish king Cnut seeking to consolidate his power over the region. Uhtred's submission to Cnut demonstrates his pragmatism and willingness to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Uhtred's death are not well-documented. However, it is known that he was killed by Thurbrand the Hold, an event that started a long and bloody feud between the Uhtred and Hold families. This feud would go on to shape the history of Northumbria for generations to come.\n\n**Marriages and Issue**\n\nUhtred married three times, each marriage producing children. His first marriage was to Ecgfrida, the daughter of Bishop Aldhun, which secured his position in the church and the region. His second marriage is not well-documented, but it is known that he had children from this union as well. Uhtred's third marriage was to a woman named Gytha, who was the mother of his son Ealdred.\n\nUhtred's children played a significant role in the events that unfolded after his death. Ealdred, in particular, would go on to avenge his father's killing by defeating Thurbrand's son Carl. However, this victory would come at a great cost, as Ealdred was subsequently killed by Carl in retaliation.\n\n**Descendants**\n\nThe killing of Uhtred by Thurbrand the Hold started a blood feud that lasted for many years and is the subject of the historical work, De obsessione Dunelmi. Uhtred's son Ealdred subsequently avenged his father by killing Thurbrand, but Ealdred in turn was killed by Thurbrand's son, Carl. This cycle of violence highlights the complexities of medieval Northumbrian society, where family feuds and vendettas played a significant role in shaping the region's history.\n\nThe descendants of Uhtred the Bold continued to play a significant role in Northumbrian society for generations to come. His family's involvement in the church and politics marked them as one of the most influential families in the region.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nAuthor Bernard Cornwell was inspired to write his series The Saxon Stories after learning he was a descendant of Uhtred the Bold, who is the inspiration behind the series protagonist Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg. Several events in the series are based on events in the life of Uhtred the Bold, such as the siege of Bebbanburg by the Scots and the severed heads on poles. However, unlike many other characters in the book series who correspond closely to historical figures, such as Alfred the Great, Guthrum, and King Guthred, the main character Uhtred is fictitious and lives in the middle of the 9th century, more than a hundred years before the historical Uhtred the Bold.\n\nThe series was adapted into a television series, The Last Kingdom, which follows the story of Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg and his struggles against the Viking invaders. The show was a critical and commercial success and cemented Cornwell's reputation as a master of historical fiction.\n\nIn conclusion, Uhtred the Bold was a significant figure in the history of Northumbria, known for his military prowess, strategic marriages, and his role in the founding of the new cathedral at Durham. His descendants went on to play a significant role in shaping the region's history, and his legacy continues to inspire writers and historians to this day.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Uhtred_the_Bold\" following this outline:\n\n\nAccomplishments\nIn 995, according to Symeon of Durham, when the remains of St Cuthbert were transferred from Chester-le-Street to Durham, Uhtred went to Durham with his monks to clear the site of the new cathedral The new cathedral was founded by Bishop Aldhun, and Uhtred married Aldhun's daughter, Ecgfrida, probably at about this time From his marriage he received several estates that had belonged to the church [1]\n\n\nDeath\nIn 1016 Uhtred campaigned with Æthelred's son Edmund Ironside in Cheshire and the surrounding shires While Uhtred was away from his lands, Sweyn's son, Cnut, invaded Yorkshire Cnut's forces were too strong for Uhtred to fight, and so Uhtred did homage to him as King of England  \n\n\nMarriages and issue\nUhtred married three times, each marriage produced children.\n\n\nDescendants\nThe killing of Uhtred by Thurbrand the Hold started a blood feud that lasted for many years and is the subject of the historical work, De obsessione Dunelmi Uhtred's son Ealdred subsequently avenged his father by killing Thurbrand, but Ealdred in turn was killed by Thurbrand's son, Carl \n\n\nIn popular culture\nAuthor Bernard Cornwell was inspired to write his series The Saxon Stories after learning he was a descendant of Uhtred the Bold, who is the inspiration behind the series protagonist Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg [6] [7] Several events in the series are based on events in the life of Uhtred the Bold, such as the siege of Bebbanburg by the Scots and the severed heads on poles; however, unlike many other characters in the book series who correspond closely to historical figures, such as Alfred the Great, Guthrum and King Guthred, the main character Uhtred is fictitious: he lives in the middle of the 9th century—being aged about ten at the battle of York (867)—more than a hundred years before the historical Uhtred the Bold This fictitious Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg is the protagonist in the television series The Last Kingdom and the movie The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die, which are based on The Saxon Stories.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

all essential, and they're very limited and every country needs it Because every country knows that raising the standard of living (and populations are getting bigger) is the way we're all going.\n\nFilming\nQuantum of Solace was shot in six countries [5] Second unit filming began in Italy at the Palio di Siena horse race on 16 August 2007, [57] although at that point Forster was unsure how it would fit into the film [51] Some scenes were filmed also in Maratea and Craco, two small distinctive towns in Basilicata in southern Italy [58] Other places used for location shooting were Madrid in August 2007; [59] Baja California, Mexico in early 2008, for shots of the aerial battle; [60] [61] Malcesine, Limone sul Garda and Tremosine in Italy during March, [62] and at Talamone during the end of April [63] The main unit began on 3 January 2008 [18] at Pinewood Studios The 007 Stage was used for the fight in the art gallery, [15] and an MI6 safehouse hidden within the city's cisterns, [64] while other stages housed Bond's Bolivian hotel suite, [65] and the MI6 headquarters [64] Interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot [66]\n\n\nDesign\nProduction designer Peter Lamont, a crew member on 18 previous Bond films, retired after Casino Royale [85] Forster hired Dennis Gassner in his stead, having admired his work on The Truman Show and the films of the Coen brothers [48] Craig said the film would have \"a touch of Ken Adam\", [86] while Michael G Wilson also called Gassner's designs \"a postmodern look at modernism\" [65] Forster said he felt the early Bond films' design \"were ahead of their time\", [48] and enjoyed the clashing of an older style with his own because it created a unique look unto itself [87] Gassner wanted his sets to emphasise Craig's \"great angular, textured face and wonderful blue eyes\", and totally redesigned the MI6 headquarters because he felt Judi Dench \"was a bit tired in the last film, so I thought, let's bring her into a new world\" [88]\n\n\nEffects\nQuantum of Solace was the last in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's Die Another Day Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 returned for the film's car chase around Lake Garda; [95] Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of his work on the second and third Bourne films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in Casino Royale [96] He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase, [97] but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159 [98] After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars and the truck were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen [99] Originally, three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence, but Forster felt the scene was too long and re-edited it so there would be two Alfas chasing Bond [100] Ten cars were supplied by Aston Martin Six 'hero' cars, needed for close-ups and promotional work, all survived filming unharmed with four more cars used for special effects and stunts [101] [self-published source?]\n\n\nMusic\nDavid Arnold, who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for Quantum of Solace He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on Casino Royale, the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to \"really work it out.\" He also said he would be \"taking a different approach\" with the score [106] Arnold composed the music based on impressions from reading the script, and Forster edited those into the film [107] As with Casino Royale, Arnold kept use of the \"James Bond Theme\" to a minimum [51] Arnold collaborated with Kieran Hebden for \"Crawl, End Crawl\", a remix of the score played during the end credits [108]\n\n\nRelease\nThe film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008 Princes William and Harry attended, and proceeds from the screening were donated to the charities Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion [115] The film was originally scheduled to be released in the UK and North America on 7 November; however, Eon pushed forward the British date to 31 October during filming, [116] while the American date was pushed back in August to 14 November, after Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince had been moved to 2009, thereby allowing the distributors to market the film over the autumn blockbuster Thanksgiving holiday weekend [117] In Australia, the film was moved a week to 19 November, after 20th Century Fox chose to release Australia on Quantum of Solace's original date of 26 November [118]\n\n\nMarketing\nReturning product placement partners from Casino Royale included Ford, Heineken, Smirnoff, Omega SA, Virgin Atlantic and Sony Ericsson [119] A reported £50 million was earned in product placement, which tops the Bond films' record of £44 million for Die Another Day [120] The 2009 Ford Ka is driven by Camille in the film [121] Avon created a fragrance called Bond Girl 007 with Gemma Arterton as the \"face\" of the product [122] Coca-Cola became a promotional partner, rebranding Coke Zero as \"Coke Zero Zero 7.\" A tie-in advert featured the orchestral element of \"Another Way to Die.\" [123] In the film, Coca-Cola was briefly seen being served at Dominic Greene's party Sony held a competition, \"Mission for a Million,\" enabling registered players to use their products to complete certain tasks Each completed \"mission\" gave consumers a chance to win $1 million and a trip to a top-secret location [124]\n\n\nMerchandise\nCorgi International Limited made 5-inch action figures and gadgets (such as a voice-activated briefcase), as well as its traditional die-cast toy vehicles [125] [126] It also created 7-inch figures of characters from the previous films [127] Scalextric released four racing sets to coincide with the film [128] Activision released its first James Bond game, also titled Quantum of Solace, which is based on both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace It is the first Bond game to feature Craig's likeness and the first seventh-generation console game in the series Swatch designed a series of wrist watches, each of them inspired by a Bond villain [129]\n\n\nHome media\nQuantum of Solace was released on DVD and Blu-ray by MGM via 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in Australia, the UK and North America from 18 to 24 March 2009

the UK [134] The film then broke the UK opening-weekend record, taking £15.5 million ($25 million) in its first weekend, surpassing the previous record of £14.9 million held by Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire It earned a further £14 million in France and Sweden—where it opened on the same day The weekend gross of the equivalent of $10.6 million in France was a record for the series,

of 6.1/10 The site's critical consensus reads: \"Brutal and breathless, Quantum Of Solace delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of Casino Royale, it's still a bit of a disappointment.\" [141] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [142] Critics generally preferred Casino Royale, but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew

produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. It is the 22nd film in the James Bond series and the second installment in the series to star Daniel Craig as the fictional character James Bond.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with Bond on a mission to capture the mercenary Mr. White (Jesper Christensen), who has information about the mysterious organization known as Quantum. Bond's pursuit of White leads him from Lake Garda in Italy to Siena, where he delivers White to M (Judi Dench) at MI6 headquarters. However, things take a turn when Craig Mitchell (Logan Lucky), M's bodyguard, shoots a guard and attacks M. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him, and in the confusion, White escapes.\n\nBond then searches Mitchell's flat in London and discovers that Mitchell had a contact named Edmund Slate (Tim Pigott-Smith) in Haiti. Slate is a hitman who was sent to kill Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko), a former Bolivian secret service agent, at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a number of notable actors, including Daniel Craig as James Bond, Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes, Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene, Judi Dench as M, and Jesper Christensen as Mr. White. Marc Forster also asked his friends and fellow directors Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuarón to appear in cameos. Cuarón appears as a Bolivian helicopter pilot, while del Toro provides several other voices.\n\n**Production**\n\nQuantum of Solace was shot in six countries, including Italy, Mexico, and Bolivia. Second unit filming began in Italy at the Palio di Siena horse race on August 16, 2007, although at that point Forster was unsure how it would fit into the film. Some scenes were also filmed in Maratea and Craco, two small distinctive towns in Basilicata in southern Italy. Other places used for location shooting were Madrid in August 2007, Baja California in Mexico in early 2008 for shots of the aerial battle, Malcesine, Limone sul Garda, and Tremosine in Italy during March, and at Talamone during the end of April. The main unit began on January 3, 2008, at Pinewood Studios.\n\n**Design**\n\nPeter Lamont, a crew member on 18 previous Bond films, retired after Casino Royale. Forster hired Dennis Gassner in his stead, having admired his work on The Truman Show and the films of the Coen brothers. Craig said the film would have \"a touch of Ken Adam,\" while Michael G. Wilson also called Gassner's designs \"a postmodern look at modernism.\" Forster said he felt the early Bond films' design \"were ahead of their time,\" and enjoyed the clashing of an older style with his own because it created a unique look unto itself.\n\n**Effects**\n\nQuantum of Solace was the last in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's Die Another Day. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 returned for the film's car chase around Lake Garda. Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of his work on the second and third Bourne films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in Casino Royale.\n\n**Music**\n\nDavid Arnold, who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for Quantum of Solace. He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on Casino Royale, the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to \"really work it out.\" He also said he would be \"taking a different approach\" with the score. Arnold composed the music based on impressions from reading the script, and Forster edited those into the film. As with Casino Royale, Arnold kept use of the \"James Bond Theme\" to a minimum.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on October 29, 2008. Princes William and Harry attended, and proceeds from the screening were donated to the charities Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion. The film was originally scheduled to be released in the UK and North America on November 7, but Eon pushed forward the British date to October 31 during filming, while the American date was pushed back in August to November 14, after Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince had been moved to 2009.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nReturning product placement partners from Casino Royale included Ford, Heineken, Smirnoff, Omega SA, Virgin Atlantic, and Sony Ericsson. A reported £50 million was earned in product placement, which tops the Bond films' record of £44 million for Die Another Day. The 2009 Ford Ka is driven by Camille in the film. Avon created a fragrance called Bond Girl 007 with Gemma Arterton as the \"face\" of the product. Coca-Cola became a promotional partner, rebranding Coke Zero as \"Coke Zero Zero 7.\" A tie-in advert featured the orchestral element of \"Another Way to Die.\"\n\n**Merchandise**\n\nCorgi International Limited made 5-inch action figures and gadgets (such as a voice-activated briefcase), as well as its traditional die-cast toy vehicles. It also created 7-inch figures of characters from the previous films. Scalextric released four racing sets to coincide with the film. Activision released its first James Bond game, also titled Quantum of Solace, which is based on both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. It is the first Bond game to feature Craig's likeness and the first seventh-generation console game in the series. Swatch designed a series of wrist watches, each of them inspired by a Bond villain.\n\n**Home media**\n\nQuantum of Solace was released on DVD and Blu-ray by MGM via 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in Australia, the UK, and North America from March 18 to 24, 2009. On the DVD sales chart, the film opened at No. 3, grossing $21,894,957 from 1.21 million DVD units sold. As of November 1, 2009, 2,643,250 DVD units were sold, generating $44,110,750 in sales revenue.\n\n**Reception**\n\nUpon its opening in the UK, the film grossed £4.9 million, breaking the record for the largest Friday opening (October 31, 2008) in the UK. The film then broke the UK opening-weekend record, taking £15.5 million in its first weekend, surpassing the previous record of £14.9 million held by Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It earned a further £14 million in France and Sweden—where it opened on the same day. The weekend gross of the equivalent of $10.6 million in France was a record for the series, surpassing what Casino Royale made in five days by 16%.

The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feeling that the film carried over. The film earned an average grade of \"B−\" from CinemaScore's audience surveys, on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the Craig era as Bond.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing at the 2008 Satellite Awards, winning Best Song.

He is the only member of his family with achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that affects bone growth. As a result, Dinklage stands at 4 feet 5 inches (1.35 m) tall, with an average-sized head and torso but shorter than average limbs.\n\nDinklage was raised in the historic Brookside section of Mendham Township, New Jersey, with his parents and older brother, Jonathan. He was raised Catholic and was a shy and introverted child, often struggling to fit in with his peers. However, he later developed a sense of humor about his condition and learned to accept himself.\n\n**Career**\n\nDinklage initially struggled to find acting work, partially because he refused to take roles that were stereotypical for actors with dwarfism, such as elves or leprechauns. He made his credited film debut in the low-budget independent comedy-drama Living in Oblivion (1995), where he starred alongside Steve Buscemi. The film tells the story of a director, crew, and cast filming a low-budget independent film in New York City, and Dinklage's role was that of a frustrated actor with dwarfism who complains about his clichéd roles.\n\nEven after his well-received performance in Living in Oblivion, Dinklage could not find someone willing to be his agent. However, a recommendation from Buscemi to director Alexandre Rockwell led to Dinklage being cast in the comedy 13 Moons (2002). In an interview, Dinklage was asked what his ideal role was, and he replied, \"to play the romantic lead and get the girl.\"\n\n**Breakthrough**\n\nDinklage's breakthrough role came in 2003, when he played Finbar McBride in the Tom McCarthy-directed film The Station Agent. The film tells the story of a quiet, withdrawn, unmarried man who is a train enthusiast and has chosen to isolate himself from the world. Dinklage's performance in the film earned him the Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor nominations. The film was modestly successful at the box office, earning over $8 million against its small budget.\n\nDinklage has said that he was attracted to the character of McBride because it was not one of the stereotypical roles people with dwarfism play. Instead, McBride has romantic feelings, anger, and flaws, which made the role more nuanced and interesting for Dinklage. The Station Agent was Dinklage's highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with a score of 88%.\n\n**Mainstream and Critical Success**\n\nBetween 2011 and 2019, Dinklage portrayed Tyrion Lannister in HBO's fantasy drama Game of Thrones, an adaptation of author George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire novels. Game of Thrones takes place on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos and chronicles the power struggles among noble families as they fight for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion is a member of House Lannister, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Westeros, and uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life.\n\nDinklage's performance in Game of Thrones earned him widespread critical acclaim and numerous awards and nominations. He received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and won one award for his performance in the episode \"The Lion and the Rose\". He also received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture Made for Television.\n\n**Other Performances**\n\nIn addition to his work on Game of Thrones, Dinklage has appeared in a number of other films and television shows, including Little Bit of Heaven (2011), Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012), and Saturday Night Live (2013). He has also hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live and has appeared in a number of other television shows and films, including The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Simpsons.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nDinklage is married to Erica Schmidt, a theater director, and they have two children together. He is known for his sense of humor and his ability to poke fun at himself and his condition. In an interview, he said, \"I'm not a victim. I'm a guy with a condition that's made me who I am. And I'm proud of who I am.\"\n\n**Dwarfism**\n\nDinklage has achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that affects bone growth. As a result, he is 4 feet 5 inches (1.35 m) tall, with an average-sized head and torso but shorter than average limbs. He has come to accept his condition and has learned to live with it. In an interview, he said, \"I'm not a victim. I'm a guy with a condition that's made me who I am. And I'm proud of who I am.\"\n\n**Works and Accolades**\n\nDinklage's most critically acclaimed films are Living in Oblivion (1995), The Station Agent (2003), Lassie (2005), X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). He has received numerous awards and nominations for his performances, including four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and one award for his performance in the episode \"The Lion and the Rose\". He has also received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture Made for Television.\n\n**Discography**\n\nDinklage has not released any music albums, but he has appeared in a number of films and television shows that feature music.

independent sovereign states and no longer under British rule The affirmation was made in the Declaration of Independence, which was written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson and adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress [24] Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British, [25] the Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the states together There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government [26] Congress finished work on the Articles of Confederation to establish a perpetual union between the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for ratification [24]\n\n\n1789–1933\nAs the nation's first president, George Washington established many norms that would come to define the office [29] [30] His decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy, [31] and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the Twenty-Second Amendment By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed, [32] with John Adams defeating Thomas Jefferson in 1796, the first truly contested presidential election [33]  After Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians James Madison and James Monroe would each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the Era of Good Feelings until Adams' son John Quincy Adams won election in 1824 after the Democratic-Republican Party split.\n\n\nImperial presidency\nThe ascendancy of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1933 led further toward what historians now describe as the Imperial presidency [49] Backed by enormous Democratic majorities in Congress and public support for major change, Roosevelt's New Deal dramatically increased the size and scope of the federal government, including more executive agencies [50]: 211–12  The traditionally small presidential staff was greatly expanded, with the Executive Office of the President being created in 1939, none of whom require Senate confirmation [50]: 229–231  Roosevelt's unprecedented re-election to a third and fourth term, the victory of the United States in World War II, and the nation's growing economy all helped established the office as a position of global leadership [50]: 269  His successors, Harry Truman and Dwight D Eisenhower, each served two terms as the Cold War led the presidency to be viewed as the \"leader of the free world\", [51] while John F Kennedy was a youthful and popular leader who benefited from the rise of television in the 1960s [52] [53]\n\n\nCritics of presidency's evolution\nThe nation's Founding Fathers expected the Congress, which was the first branch of government described in the Constitution, to be the dominant branch of government; however, they did not expect a strong executive department [65] However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful, [66] [67] unchecked, unbalanced, [68] and \"monarchist\" in nature [69] In 2008 professor Dana D Nelson expressed belief that presidents over the previous thirty years worked towards \"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\" [70] She criticized proponents of the unitary executive theory for expanding \"the many existing uncheckable executive powers—such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements—that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\" [70] Bill Wilson, board member of Americans for Limited Government, opined that the expanded presidency was \"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\" [71]\n\n\nLegislative powers\nArticle I, Section 1 of the Constitution vests all lawmaking power in Congress's hands, and Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2 prevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\n\n\nSigning and vetoing bills\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the Presentment Clause, which gives the president the power to veto any bill passed by Congress While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a two-thirds vote of both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \"tyranny of the majority\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill  The veto – or threat of a veto – has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\n\n\nSetting the agenda\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda Article II, Section 3, Clause 2 requires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \"necessary and expedient\" This is done through the constitutionally-based State of the Union address, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\n\n\nPromulgating regulations\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\n\n\nConvening and adjourning Congress\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution to call a special session of one or both houses of Congress Since John Adams first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions Harry S Truman was the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the Turnip Day Session In addition, prior to ratification of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly inaugurated presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power [79] [80]\n\n\nExecutive powers\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\n\n\nAdministrative powers\nPresidents make political appointments An incoming president may make up to 4,000 upon taking office, 1200 of which must be confirmed by the U.S Senate Ambassadors, members of the Cabinet, and various officers, are among the positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation [83] [84]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 4 requires the president to \"receive Ambassadors.\" This clause, known as the Reception Clause, has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy, [88] and to provide support for the president's exclusive authority to grant recognition to a foreign government [89] The Constitution also empowers the president to appoint United States ambassadors, and to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S Senate (by a two-thirds majority vote), become binding with the force of federal law.\n\n\nCommander-in-chief\n\nOne of the most important of executive powers is the president's role as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces The power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the military The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority [90] The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explained this in Federalist No 69:\n\nJuridical powers and privileges\nThe president has the power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States However, these nominations require Senate confirmation before they may take office Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance When nominating judges to U.S district courts, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of senatorial courtesy Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon a month after taking office Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when Bill Clinton pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office; this is often controversial [103] [104] [105]\n\n\nLeadership roles\nAs head of state, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F Kennedy in 1961 [115] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening [116]\n\n\nHead of state\nAs head of state, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world For example,

state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening [116]\n\n\nHead of party\nThe president is typically considered to be the head of their political party Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\n\n\nGlobal leader\nWith the rise of the United States as a superpower in the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led to the moniker that the president is the \"leader of the free world\".\n\n\nSelection process\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency To serve as president, one must:\n\n\nEligibility\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency To serve as president, one must:\n\n\nCampaigns and nomination\nThe modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections, which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions, where the most successful candidate is made the party's presidential nominee Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention The most common previous profession of presidents is lawyer [135]\n\n\nElection\nThe president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state [136] Currently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election [137] In all but two states, the party whose presidential–vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors [138] Maine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district [139] [140]\n\n\nInauguration\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election [147] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937 [148] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4 As a result of the date change, the first term (1933–37) of both men had been shortened by 43 days [149]\n\n\nIncumbency\nWhen the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two terms then out\" precedent Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe [153] In spite of the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S Grant sought nomination at the 1880 Republican National Convention for a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful [154]\n\n\nTerm limit\nWhen the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two terms then out\" precedent Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe [153] In spite of the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S Grant sought nomination at the 1880 Republican National Convention for a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful [154]\n\n\nVacancies and succession\nUnder Section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the president Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\n\n\nDeclarations of inability\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes acting president, by transmitting to the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate a statement that he is unable to discharge his duties The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able The mechanism has been used by Ronald Reagan (once), George W Bush (twice), and Joe Biden (once), each in anticipation of surgery [159] [160]\n\n\nRemoval\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 authorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \"grand jury\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote [161] Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 authorizes the Senate to serve as a court with the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict [162]\n\n\nCircumvention of authority\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders This has ranged from Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from Donald Trump's desk [163] Decades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a stroke that left him partly incapacitated  First lady Edith Wilson kept this condition a secret from the public for a while, and controversially became the sole gatekeeper for access to the president (aside from his doctor), assisting him with paperwork and deciding which information was \"important\" enough to share with him.\n\n\nCompensation\nSince 2001, the president's annual salary has been $400,000, along with a $50,000 expense allowance; a $100,000 nontaxable travel account; and a $19,000 entertainment [clarification needed] account The president's salary is set by Congress, and under Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution, any increase or reduction in presidential salary cannot take effect before the next presidential term of office [167] [168]\n\n\nResidence\nThe Executive Residence of the White House in Washington, D.C is the official residence of the president The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792 Every president since John Adams (in 1800) has lived there At various times in U.S history, it has been known as the \"President's Palace\", the \"President's House\", and the \"Executive Mansion\" Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901 [169] The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food [170]\n\n\nTravel\nThe primary means of long-distance air travel for the president is one of two identical Boeing VC-25 aircraft, which are extensively modified Boeing 747 airliners and are referred to as Air Force One while the president is on board (although any U.S Air Force aircraft the president is aboard is designated as \"Air Force One\" for the duration of the flight) In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the Boeing C-32, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated Executive One for the flight [173] [174]\n\n\nProtection\nThe U.S Secret Service is charged with protecting the president and the first family As part of their protection, presidents, first ladies, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames [178] The use of such names was originally for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications were not routinely encrypted; today, the names simply serve for purposes of brevity, clarity, and tradition [179]\n\n\nPost-presidency\nSome former presidents have had significant careers after leaving office Prominent examples include William Howard Taft's tenure as chief justice of the United States and Herbert Hoover's work on government reorganization after World War II Grover Cleveland, whose bid for reelection failed in 1888, was elected president again four years later in 1892, and Donald Trump, whose bid for reelection failed in 2020, was elected president again four years later in 2024 Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House: John Quincy Adams was elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and Andrew Johnson returned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after Some ex-presidents were very active, especially in international affairs, most notably Theodore Roosevelt; [180] Herbert Hoover; [181] Richard Nixon; [182] and Jimmy Carter [183] [184]\n\n\nActivities\nSome former presidents have had significant careers after leaving office Prominent examples include William

[184]\n\n\nPension and other benefits\nThe Former Presidents Act (FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by impeachment [188]\n\n\nPresidential libraries\nEvery president since Herbert Hoover has created a repository known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources [195] There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\n\n\nPolitical affiliation\nPolitical parties have dominated American politics for most of the nation's history Though the Founding Fathers generally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S in the mid-1790s nonetheless They evolved from political factions, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence Those who supported the Washington administration were referred to as \"pro-administration\" and would eventually form the Federalist Party, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging Democratic-Republican Party [196]\n\n\nTimeline of presidents\nThe

state and head of government of the United States. The current president is Joe Biden, who took office on January 20, 2021. The president is elected through the Electoral College system, where each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. The president serves a four-year term and can be re-elected for a second term.\n\n**History and Development**\n\nThe concept of the presidency in the United States dates back to the American Revolution, when the Continental Congress declared independence from Great Britain in 1776. The Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson, established the principles of equality and liberty that would shape the country's future. After the revolution, the Articles of Confederation were drafted to establish a perpetual union between the states, but it was soon realized that a stronger central government was needed.\n\nIn 1789, the United States Constitution was ratified, establishing the office of the presidency. George Washington, the first president, set many norms that would come to define the office, including the decision to retire after two terms. This precedent would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the Twenty-Second Amendment.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe presidency was established by the Constitution, which defined the powers and responsibilities of the office. The president was given the authority to serve as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, to negotiate treaties, and to appoint federal judges. The first president, George Washington, was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, and established many of the traditions and customs that would become associated with the office.\n\n**1789-1933**\n\nThe early years of the presidency saw the establishment of many of the office's traditions and customs. George Washington's decision to retire after two terms helped to establish a precedent that would be followed by his successors. The first truly contested presidential election was held in 1796, when John Adams defeated Thomas Jefferson. The Democratic-Republican Party, led by Jefferson, would eventually dominate the nation's politics during the Era of Good Feelings.\n\n**Imperial Presidency**\n\nThe ascendancy of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 led further toward what historians now describe as the Imperial presidency. Roosevelt's New Deal dramatically increased the size and scope of the federal government, including more executive agencies. The traditionally small presidential staff was greatly expanded, with the Executive Office of the President being created in 1939. Roosevelt's unprecedented re-election to a third and fourth term, the victory of the United States in World War II, and the nation's growing economy all helped establish the office as a position of global leadership.\n\n**Critics of Presidency's Evolution**\n\nThe nation's Founding Fathers expected the Congress, which was the first branch of government described in the Constitution, to be the dominant branch of government. However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful, unchecked, unbalanced, and \"monarchist\" in nature.\n\n**Legislative Powers**\n\nArticle I, Section 1 of the Constitution vests all lawmaking power in Congress's hands, and Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2 prevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress. The modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\n\n**Signing and Vetoing Bills**\n\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the Presentment Clause, which gives the president the power to veto any bill passed by Congress. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a two-thirds vote of both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation.\n\n**Setting the Agenda**\n\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda. Article II, Section 3, Clause 2 requires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \"necessary and expedient.\" This is done through the constitutionally-based State of the Union address, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\n\n**Promulgating Regulations**\n\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\n\n**Convening and Adjourning Congress**\n\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution to call a special session of one or both houses of Congress.\n\n**Executive Powers**\n\nThe president is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\n\n**Administrative Powers**\n\nPresidents make political appointments. An incoming president may make up to 4,000 upon taking office, 1200 of which must be confirmed by the U.S Senate.\n\n**Foreign Affairs**\n\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 4 requires the president to \"receive Ambassadors.\" This clause has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy.\n\n**Commander-in-Chief**\n\nOne of the most important of executive powers is the president's role as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n**Juridical Powers and Privileges**\n\nThe president has the power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations require Senate confirmation before they may take office.\n\n**Leadership Roles**\n\nAs head of state, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world.\n\n**Global Leader**\n\nWith the rise of the United States as a superpower in the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure.\n\n**Selection Process**\n\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency: the person must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for at least 14 years.\n\n**Election**\n\nThe president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College system.\n\n**Inauguration**\n\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\n\n**Incumbency**\n\nWhen the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two terms then out\" precedent.\n\n**Term Limit**\n\nWhen the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two terms then out\" precedent.\n\n**Vacancies and Succession**\n\nUnder Section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the president.\n\n**Declarations of Inability**\n\nThe president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes acting president, by transmitting to the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate a statement that he is unable to discharge his duties.\n\n**Removal**\n\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\n**Circumvention of Authority**\n\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability.\n\n**Pension and Other Benefits**\n\nThe Former Presidents Act (FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection.\n\n**Presidential Libraries**\n\nEvery president since Herbert Hoover has created a repository known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials.\n\n**Political Affiliation**\n\nPolitical parties have dominated American politics for most of the nation's history.

His decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy, [31] and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the Twenty-Second Amendment By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed, [32] with John Adams defeating Thomas Jefferson in 1796, the first truly contested presidential election [33]  After Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians James Madison and James Monroe would each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the Era of Good Feelings until Adams' son John Quincy Adams won election in 1824 after the Democratic-Republican Party split.\n\n\nImperial presidency\nThe ascendancy of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1933 led further toward what historians now describe as the Imperial presidency [49] Backed by enormous Democratic majorities in Congress and public support for major change, Roosevelt's New Deal dramatically increased the size and scope of the federal government, including more executive agencies [50]: 211–12  The traditionally small presidential staff was greatly expanded, with the Executive Office of the President being created in 1939, none of whom require Senate confirmation [50]: 229–231  Roosevelt's unprecedented re-election to a third and fourth term, the victory of the United States in World War II, and the nation's growing economy all helped established the office as a position of global leadership [50]: 269  His successors, Harry Truman and Dwight D Eisenhower, each served two terms as the Cold War led the presidency to be viewed as the \"leader of the free world\", [51] while John F Kennedy was a youthful and popular leader who benefited from the rise of television in the 1960s [52] [53]\n\n\nCritics of presidency's evolution\nThe nation's Founding Fathers expected the Congress, which was the first branch of government described in the Constitution, to be the dominant branch of government; however, they did not expect a strong executive department [65] However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful, [66] [67] unchecked, unbalanced, [68] and \"monarchist\" in nature [69] In 2008 professor Dana D Nelson expressed belief that presidents over the previous thirty years worked towards \"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\" [70] She criticized proponents of the unitary executive theory for expanding \"the many existing uncheckable executive powers—such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements—that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\" [70] Bill Wilson, board member of Americans for Limited Government, opined that the expanded presidency was \"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\" [71]\n\n\nLegislative powers\nArticle I, Section 1 of the Constitution vests all lawmaking power in Congress's hands, and Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2 prevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\n\n\nSigning and vetoing bills\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the Presentment Clause, which gives the president the power to veto any bill passed by Congress While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a two-thirds vote of both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \"tyranny of the majority\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill  The veto – or threat of a veto – has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\n\n\nSetting the agenda\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda Article II, Section 3, Clause 2 requires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \"necessary and expedient\" This is done through the constitutionally-based State of the Union address, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\n\n\nPromulgating

the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\n\n\nConvening and adjourning Congress\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution to call a special session of one or both houses of Congress Since John Adams first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions Harry S Truman was the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the Turnip Day Session In addition, prior to ratification of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly inaugurated presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power [79] [80]\n\n\nExecutive powers\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\n\n\nAdministrative powers\nPresidents make political appointments An incoming president may make up to 4,000 upon taking office, 1200 of which must be confirmed by the U.S Senate Ambassadors, members of the Cabinet, and various officers, are among the positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation [83] [84]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 4 requires the president to \"receive Ambassadors.\" This clause, known as the Reception Clause, has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy, [88] and to provide support for the president's exclusive authority to grant recognition to a foreign government [89] The Constitution also empowers the president to appoint United States ambassadors, and to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S Senate (by a two-thirds majority vote), become binding with the force of federal law.\n\n\nCommander-in-chief\n\nOne of the most important of executive powers is the president's role as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces The power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the military The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority [90] The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explained this in Federalist No 69:\n\nJuridical powers and privileges\nThe president has the power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States However, these nominations require Senate confirmation before they may take office Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance When nominating judges to U.S district courts, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of senatorial courtesy Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon a month after taking office Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when Bill Clinton pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office; this is often controversial [103] [104] [105]\n\n\nLeadership roles\nAs head of state, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F Kennedy in 1961 [115] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening [116]\n\n\nHead of state\nAs head of state, the president represents the United States government

South Lawn, a custom begun by John F Kennedy in 1961 [115] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening [116]\n\n\nHead of party\nThe president is typically considered to be the head of their political party Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\n\n\nGlobal leader\nWith the rise of the United States as a superpower in the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led to the moniker that the president is the \"leader of the free world\".\n\n\nSelection process\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency To serve as president, one must:\n\n\nEligibility\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency To serve as president, one must:\n\n\nCampaigns and nomination\nThe modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections, which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions, where the most successful candidate is made the party's presidential nominee Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention The most common previous profession of presidents is lawyer [135]\n\n\nElection\nThe president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state [136] Currently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election [137] In all but two states, the party whose presidential–vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors [138] Maine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district [139] [140]\n\n\nInauguration\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election [147] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937 [148] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4 As a result of the date change, the first term (1933–37) of both men had been shortened by 43 days [149]\n\n\nIncumbency\nWhen the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two terms then out\" precedent Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe [153] In spite of the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S Grant sought nomination at the 1880 Republican National Convention for a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful [154]\n\n\nTerm limit\nWhen the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two terms then out\" precedent Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe [153] In spite of the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S Grant sought nomination at the 1880 Republican National Convention for a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful [154]\n\n\nVacancies and succession\nUnder Section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the president Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\n\n\nDeclarations of inability\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes acting president, by transmitting to the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate a statement that he is unable to discharge his duties The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able The mechanism has been used by Ronald Reagan (once), George W Bush (twice), and Joe Biden (once), each in anticipation of surgery [159] [160]\n\n\nRemoval\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 authorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \"grand jury\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote [161] Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 authorizes the Senate to serve as a court with the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict [162]\n\n\nCircumvention of authority\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders This has ranged from Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from Donald Trump's desk [163] Decades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a stroke that left him partly incapacitated  First lady Edith Wilson kept this condition a secret from the public for a while, and controversially became the sole gatekeeper for access to the president (aside from his doctor), assisting him with paperwork and deciding which information was \"important\" enough to share with him.\n\n\nCompensation\nSince 2001, the president's annual salary has been $400,000, along with a $50,000 expense allowance; a $100,000 nontaxable travel account; and a $19,000 entertainment [clarification needed] account The president's salary is set by Congress, and under Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution, any increase or reduction in presidential salary cannot take effect before the next presidential term of office [167] [168]\n\n\nResidence\nThe Executive Residence of the White House in Washington, D.C is the official residence of the president The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792 Every president since John Adams (in 1800) has lived there At various times in U.S history, it has been known as the \"President's Palace\", the \"President's House\", and the \"Executive Mansion\" Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901 [169] The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food [170]\n\n\nTravel\nThe primary means of long-distance air travel for the president is one of two identical Boeing VC-25 aircraft, which are extensively modified Boeing 747 airliners and are referred to as Air Force One while the president is on board (although any U.S Air Force aircraft the president is aboard is designated as \"Air Force One\" for the duration of the flight) In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the Boeing C-32, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated Executive One for the flight [173] [174]\n\n\nProtection\nThe U.S Secret Service is charged with protecting the president and the first family As part of their protection, presidents, first ladies, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames [178] The use of such names was originally for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications were not routinely encrypted; today, the names simply serve for purposes of brevity, clarity, and tradition [179]\n\n\nPost-presidency\nSome former presidents have had significant careers after leaving office Prominent examples include William Howard Taft's tenure as chief justice of the United States and Herbert Hoover's work on government reorganization after World War II Grover Cleveland, whose bid for reelection failed in 1888, was elected president again four years later in 1892, and Donald Trump, whose bid for reelection failed in 2020, was elected president again four years later in 2024 Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House: John Quincy Adams was elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and Andrew Johnson returned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after Some ex-presidents were very active, especially in international affairs, most notably Theodore Roosevelt; [180] Herbert Hoover; [181] Richard Nixon; [182] and Jimmy Carter [183] [184]\n\n\nActivities\nSome former presidents have had significant careers after leaving office Prominent examples include William Howard Taft's tenure as chief justice of the United

international affairs, most notably Theodore Roosevelt; [180] Herbert Hoover; [181] Richard Nixon; [182] and Jimmy Carter [183] [184]\n\n\nPension and other benefits\nThe Former Presidents Act (FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by impeachment [188]\n\n\nPresidential libraries\nEvery president since Herbert Hoover has created a repository known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources [195] There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\n\n\nPolitical affiliation\nPolitical parties have dominated American politics for most of the nation's history Though the Founding Fathers generally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S in the mid-1790s nonetheless They evolved from political factions, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence Those who supported the Washington administration were referred to as \"pro-administration\" and would eventually form the Federalist Party, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging Democratic-Republican Party [196]\n\n\nTimeline of presidents\nThe following timeline depicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation

{"title": "Modernism", "content": "\nOverview and definition\nModernism was a cultural movement that impacted the arts as well as the broader Zeitgeist It is commonly described as a system of thought and behavior marked by self-consciousness or self-reference, prevalent within the avant-garde of various arts and disciplines [14] It is also often perceived, especially in the West, as a socially progressive movement that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve, and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology [c] From this perspective, modernism encourages the re-examination of every aspect of existence Modernists analyze topics to find the ones they believe to be holding back progress, replacing them with new ways of reaching the same end.\n\n\nModernism, Romanticism, Philosophy and Symbol\nLiterary modernism is often summed up in a line from W B Yeats: \"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold\" (in 'The Second Coming') [17] Modernists often search for a metaphysical 'centre' but experience its collapse [18] (Postmodernism, by way of contrast, celebrates that collapse, exposing the failure of metaphysics, such as Jacques Derrida's deconstruction of metaphysical claims.) [19]\n\n\nOrigins and early history\nModernism developed out of Romanticism's revolt against the effects of the Industrial Revolution and bourgeois values Literary scholar Gerald Graff, argues that, \"The ground motive of modernism was criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and its world view; the modernists, carrying the torch of Romanticism.\" [d] [31] [32]\n\n\nRomanticism and realism\nModernism developed out of Romanticism's revolt against the effects of the Industrial Revolution and bourgeois values Literary scholar Gerald Graff, argues that, \"The ground motive of modernism was criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and its world view; the modernists, carrying the torch of Romanticism.\" [d] [31] [32]\n\n\nThe early 19th century\nIn the context of the Industrial Revolution (~1760–1840), influential innovations included steam-powered industrialization, especially the development of railways starting in Britain in the 1830s, [37] and the subsequent advancements in physics, engineering, and architecture they led to A major 19th-century engineering achievement was the Crystal Palace, the huge cast-iron and plate-glass exhibition hall built for the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London Glass and iron were used in a similar monumental style in the construction of major railway terminals throughout the city, including  King's Cross station (1852) [38] and Paddington Station (1854) [39] These technological advances spread abroad, leading to later structures such as the Brooklyn Bridge (1883) and the Eiffel Tower (1889), the latter of which broke all previous limitations on how tall man-made objects could be While such engineering feats radically altered the 19th-century urban environment and the daily lives of people, the human experience of time itself was altered with the development of the electric telegraph in 1837, [40] as well as the adoption of \"standard time\" by British railway companies from 1845, a concept which would be adopted throughout the rest of the world over the next fifty years [41]\n\n\nThe late 19th century\nArt historians have suggested various dates as starting points for modernism Historian William Everdell argued that modernism began in the 1870s when metaphorical (or ontological) continuity began to yield to the discrete with mathematician Richard Dedekind's (1831–1916) Dedekind cut and Ludwig Boltzmann's (1844–1906) statistical thermodynamics [14] Everdell also believed modernism in painting began in 1885–1886 with post-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat's development of Divisionism, the \"dots\" used to paint A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte On the other hand, visual art critic Clement Greenberg called German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) \"the first real modernist\", [49] although he also wrote, \"What can be safely called modernism emerged in the middle of the last century—and rather locally, in France, with Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) in literature and Manet in painting, and perhaps with Gustave Flaubert (1821–1880), too, in prose fiction (It was a while later, and not so locally, that modernism appeared in music and architecture).\" [45] The poet Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil) and the author Flaubert's Madame Bovary were both published in 1857 Baudelaire's essay \"The Painter of Modern Life\" (1863) inspired young artists to break away from tradition and innovate new ways of portraying their world in art.\n\n\nModernism emerges\nOut of the collision of ideals derived from Romanticism and an attempt to find a way for knowledge to explain that which was as yet unknown, came the first wave of modernist works in the opening decade of the 20th century Although their authors considered them to be extensions of existing trends in art, these works broke the implicit understanding the general public had of art: that artists were the interpreters and representatives of bourgeois culture and ideas These \"modernist\" landmarks include the atonal ending of Arnold Schoenberg's Second String Quartet in 1908, the Expressionist paintings of Wassily Kandinsky starting in 1903, and culminating with his first abstract painting and the founding of the Blue Rider group in Munich in 1911, and the rise of fauvism and the inventions of Cubism from the studios of Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and others, in the years between 1900 and 1910.\n\n\n1901 to 1930\nOut of the collision of ideals derived from Romanticism and an attempt to find a way for

in the years between 1900 and 1910.\n\n\nModernism continues: 1930–1945\nModernism continued to evolve during the 1930s Between 1930 and 1932 composer Arnold Schoenberg worked on Moses und Aron, one of the first operas to make use of the twelve-tone technique, [96] Pablo Picasso painted in 1937 Guernica, his cubist condemnation of fascism, while in 1939 James Joyce pushed the boundaries of the modern novel further with Finnegans Wake Also by 1930 modernism began to influence mainstream culture, so that, for example, The New Yorker magazine began publishing work, influenced by modernism, by young writers and humorists like Dorothy Parker, [97] Robert Benchley, E B White, S J Perelman, and James Thurber, amongst others [98] Perelman is highly regarded for his humorous short stories that he published in magazines in the 1930s and 1940s, most often in The New Yorker, which are considered to be the first examples of surrealist humor in America [99] Modern ideas in art also began to appear more frequently in commercials and logos, an early example of which, from 1916, is the famous London Underground logo designed by Edward Johnston [100]\n\n\nAttacks on early modernism\n\n\n\nAfter 1945\nWhile The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature states that modernism ended by c 1939 [113] with regard to British and American literature, \"When (if) modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to modernism occurred.\" [114] Clement Greenberg sees modernism ending in the 1930s, with the exception of the visual and performing arts, [45] but with regard to music, Paul Griffiths notes that, while modernism \"seemed to be a spent force\" by the late 1920s, after World War II, \"a new generation of composers—Boulez, Barraqué, Babbitt, Nono, Stockhausen, Xenakis\" revived modernism\" [115] In fact, many literary modernists lived into the 1950s and 1960s, though generally they were no longer producing major works The term \"late modernism\" is also sometimes applied to modernist works published after 1930 [116] [117] Among the modernists (or late modernists) still publishing after 1945 were Wallace Stevens, Gottfried Benn, T S Eliot, Anna Akhmatova, William Faulkner, Dorothy Richardson, John Cowper Powys, and Ezra Pound Basil Bunting, born in 1901, published his most important modernist poem, Briggflatts in 1965 In addition, Hermann Broch's The Death of Virgil was published in 1945 and Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus in 1947 Samuel Beckett, who died in 1989, has been described as a \"later modernist\" [118] Beckett is a writer with roots in the Expressionist tradition of modernism, who produced works from the 1930s until the 1980s, including Molloy (1951), Waiting for Godot (1953), Happy Days (1961), and Rockaby (1981) The terms \"minimalist\" and \"post-modernist\" have also been applied to his later works [119] The poets Charles Olson (1910–1970) and J H Prynne (born 1936) are among the writers in the second half of the 20th century who have been described as late modernists [120]\n\n\nTheatre of the Absurd\nThe term \"Theatre of the Absurd\" is applied to plays, written primarily by Europeans, that express the belief that human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence [123] While there are significant precursors, including Alfred Jarry (1873–1907), the Theatre of the Absurd is generally seen as beginning in the 1950s with the plays of Samuel Beckett.\n\n\nPollock and abstract influences\nDuring the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all contemporary art that followed him To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself Like Pablo Picasso's innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture in the early 20th century via Cubism and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art is made His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all who came after Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—placing unstretched raw canvas on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artistic and industrial materials; dripping and throwing linear skeins of paint; drawing, staining, and brushing; using imagery and non-imagery—essentially blasted art-making beyond any prior boundary Abstract Expressionism generally expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities available to artists for the creation of new works of art.\n\n\nInternational figures from British art\nHenry Moore (1898–1986) emerged after World War II as Britain's leading sculptor He was best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures, usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces.\n\n\nAfter Abstract Expressionism\nIn abstract painting during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions like hard-edge painting and other forms of geometric abstraction began to appear in artist studios and in radical avant-garde circles as a reaction against the subjectivism of Abstract Expressionism Clement Greenberg became the voice of post-painterly abstraction when he curated an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964 Color field painting, hard-edge painting, and lyrical abstraction [142] emerged as radical new directions.\n\n\nPop art\nIn 1962, the Sidney Janis Gallery mounted The New Realists, the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City [145] Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery The show had a great impact on the New York School as well as the greater worldwide art scene Earlier in England in 1958 the term \"Pop Art\" was used by Lawrence Alloway to describe paintings associated with the consumerism of the post World War II era [146] This movement rejected Abstract Expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior in favor of art that depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and the iconography of the mass production age [147] The early works of David Hockney and the works of Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi (who created the ground-breaking I was a Rich Man's Plaything, 1947 [148]) are considered seminal examples in the movement [149] Meanwhile, in the downtown scene in New York's East Village 10th Street galleries, artists were formulating an American version of pop art Claes Oldenburg had his storefront, and the Green Gallery on 57th Street began to show the works of Tom Wesselmann and James Rosenquist Later Leo Castelli exhibited the works of other American artists, including those of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein for most of their careers [150] There is a connection between the radical works of Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, the rebellious Dadaists with a sense of humor, and pop artists like Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein, whose paintings reproduce the look of Ben-Day dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction  [151].\n\n\nMinimalism\nMinimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially visual art and music, wherein artists intend to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all nonessential forms, features, or concepts Minimalism is any design or style wherein the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect.\n\n\nMinimal music\nThe terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music that features such repetition and iteration as those of the compositions of La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams Minimalist compositions are sometimes known as systems music The term 'minimal music' is generally used to describe a style of music that developed in America in the late 1960s and 1970s; and that was initially connected with the composers [155] The minimalism movement originally involved some composers, and other lesser known pioneers included Pauline Oliveros, Phill Niblock, and Richard Maxfield In Europe, the music of Louis Andriessen, Karel Goeyvaerts, Michael Nyman, Howard Skempton, Eliane Radigue, Gavin Bryars, Steve Martland, Henryk Górecki, Arvo Pärt and John Tavener.\n\n\nPostminimalism\nIn the late 1960s, Robert Pincus-Witten [143] coined the term \"postminimalism\" to describe minimalist-derived art which had content and contextual overtones that minimalism rejected The term was applied by Pincus-Witten to the work of Eva Hesse, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra and new work by former minimalists Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, Sol LeWitt, Barry Le Va, and others Other minimalists, including Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Carl Andre, Agnes Martin, John McCracken and others, continued to produce late modernist paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.\n\n\nCollage, assemblage, installations\nRelated to Abstract Expressionism was the emergence of combining manufactured items with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture The work of Robert Rauschenberg exemplifies this trend His \"combines\" of the 1950s were forerunners of pop art and installation art, and used assemblages of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photographs Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Jim Dine, and Edward Kienholz were among important pioneers of both abstraction and pop art Creating new conventions of art-making, they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion in their works of unlikely materials Another pioneer of collage was Joseph Cornell, whose more intimately scaled works were seen as radical because of both his personal iconography and his use of found objects.\n\n\nNeo-Dada\nIn 1917, Marcel Duchamp submitted a urinal as a sculpture for the inaugural exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, which was to be staged at the Grand Central Palace in New York [156] He professed his intent that people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art because he said it was a work of art This urinal, named Fountain was signed with the pseudonym \"R Mutt\" It is also an example of what Duchamp would later call \"readymades\" This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as Dada Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, other famous examples being John Cage's 4′33″, which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence, and Rauschenberg's Erased de Kooning Drawing Many conceptual works take the position that art is the result of the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not of the intrinsic qualities of the work itself In choosing \"an ordinary article of life\" and creating \"a new thought for that object\", Duchamp invited onlookers to view Fountain as a sculpture [157]\n\n\nPerformance and happenings\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of contemporary art Yves Klein in France, Carolee Schneemann, Yayoi Kusama, Charlotte Moorman and Yoko Ono in New York City, and Joseph Beuys, Wolf Vostell and Nam June Paik in Germany were pioneers of performance-based works of art Groups like The Living Theatre with Julian Beck and Judith Malina collaborated with sculptors and painters to create environments, radically changing the relationship between audience and performer, especially in their piece Paradise Now The Judson Dance Theater, located at the Judson Memorial Church, New York; and the Judson dancers, notably Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Elaine Summers, Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, Deborah Hay, Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton and others; collaborated with artists Robert Morris, Robert Whitman, John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, and engineers like Billy Klüver Park Place Gallery was a center for musical performances by electronic composers Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and other notable performance artists, including Joan Jonas.\n\n\nIntermedia, multi-media\nAnother trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together Intermedia is a term coined by Dick Higgins and meant to convey new art forms along the lines of Fluxus, concrete poetry, found objects, performance art, and computer art Higgins was the publisher of the Something Else Press, a concrete poet married to artist Alison Knowles and an admirer of Marcel Duchamp Ihab Hassan includes \"Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms,\" in his list of the characteristics of postmodern art [162] One of the most common forms of \"multi-media art\" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed video art While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with performance art, where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.\n\n\nFluxus\nFluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by George Maciunas (1931–1978), a Lithuanian-born American artist Fluxus traces its beginnings to John Cage's 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at The New School for Social Research in New York City Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music Cage's students included Fluxus founding members Jackson Mac Low, Al Hansen, George Brecht and Dick Higgins.\n\n\nAvant-garde popular music\nModernism had an uneasy relationship with popular forms of music (both in form and aesthetic) while rejecting popular culture [164] Despite this, Stravinsky used jazz idioms on his pieces like \"Ragtime\" from his 1918 theatrical work Histoire du Soldat and 1945's Ebony Concerto [165]\n\n\nLate period\nThe continuation of Abstract Expressionism, color field painting, lyrical abstraction, geometric abstraction, minimalism, abstract illusionism, process art, pop art, postminimalism, and other late 20th-century modernist movements in both painting and sculpture continued through the first decade of the 21st century and constitute radical new directions in those mediums [168] [169] [170]\n\n\nModern architecture\nMany skyscrapers in Hong Kong and Frankfurt have been inspired by Le Corbusier and modernist architecture, and his style is still used as influence for buildings worldwide [171]\n\n\nModernism in Asia\nThe terms \"modernism\" and \"modernist\", according to scholar William J Tyler, \"have only recently become part of the standard discourse in English on modern Japanese literature and doubts concerning their authenticity vis-à-vis Western European modernism remain\" Tyler finds this odd, given \"the decidedly modern prose\" of such \"well-known Japanese writers as Kawabata Yasunari, Nagai Kafu, and Jun'ichirō Tanizaki\" However, \"scholars in the visual and fine arts, architecture, and poetry readily embraced \"modanizumu\" as a key concept for describing and analysing Japanese culture in the 1920s and 1930s\" [172] In 1924, various young Japanese writers, including Kawabata and Riichi Yokomitsu started a literary journal Bungei Jidai (\"The Artistic Age\") This journal was \"part of an 'art for art's sake' movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles\" [173]\n\n\nModernism in Africa\nPeter Kalliney suggests that \"Modernist concepts, especially aesthetic autonomy, were fundamental to the literature of decolonization in anglophone Africa.\" [175] In his opinion, Rajat Neogy, Christopher Okigbo, and Wole Soyinka, were among the writers who \"repurposed modernist versions of aesthetic autonomy to declare their freedom from colonial bondage, from systems of racial discrimination, and even from the new postcolonial state\" [176]\n\n\nRelationship with postmodernism\nBy the early 1980s, the postmodern movement in art and architecture began to establish its position through various conceptual and intermedia formats Postmodernism in music and literature began to take hold earlier In music, postmodernism is described in one reference work as a \"term introduced in the 1970s\", [177] while in British literature, The Oxford Encyclopaedia of British Literature sees modernism \"ceding its predominance to postmodernism\" as early as 1939 [113] However, dates are highly debatable, especially as, according to Andreas Huyssen: \"one critic's postmodernism is another critic's modernism.\" [178] This includes those who are critical of the division between the two, see them as two aspects of the same movement, and believe that late modernism continues [178]\n\n\nCriticism of late modernity\nAlthough artistic modernism tended to reject capitalist values such as consumerism, 20th century civil society embraced global mass production and the proliferation of cheap and accessible commodities This period of social development is known as \"late or high modernity\" and originates in advanced in Western societies The German sociologist Jürgen Habermas, in The Theory of Communicative Action (1981), developed the first substantive critique of the culture of late modernity Another important early critique of late modernity is the American sociologist George Ritzer's The McDonaldization of Society (1993) Ritzer describes how late modernity became saturated with fast food consumer culture Other authors have demonstrated how modernist devices appeared in popular cinema, and later on in music videos Modernist design has entered the mainstream of popular culture, as simplified and stylized forms became popular, often associated with dreams of a space age high-tech future [187] [188]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n",

It is commonly described as a system of thought and behavior marked by self-consciousness or self-reference, prevalent within the avant-garde of various arts and disciplines. Modernism is also often perceived, especially in the West, as a socially progressive movement that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve, and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology.\n\n**Modernism, Romanticism, Philosophy and Symbol**\n\nLiterary modernism is often summed up in a line from W.B. Yeats: \"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold\" (in 'The Second Coming'). Modernists often search for a metaphysical 'centre' but experience its collapse. (Postmodernism, by way of contrast, celebrates that collapse, exposing the failure of metaphysics, such as Jacques Derrida's deconstruction of metaphysical claims.)\n\n**Origins and early history**\n\nModernism developed out of Romanticism's revolt against the effects of the Industrial Revolution and bourgeois values. Literary scholar Gerald Graff argues that \"The ground motive of modernism was criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and its world view; the modernists, carrying the torch of Romanticism.\"\n\n**Romanticism and realism**\n\nIn the context of the Industrial Revolution (~1760–1840), influential innovations included steam-powered industrialization, especially the development of railways starting in Britain in the 1830s, and the subsequent advancements in physics, engineering, and architecture they led to. A major 19th-century engineering achievement was the Crystal Palace, the huge cast-iron and plate-glass exhibition hall built for the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London.\n\n**The early 19th century**\n\nIn the early 19th century, art historians have suggested various dates as starting points for modernism. Historian William Everdell argued that modernism began in the 1870s when metaphorical (or ontological) continuity began to yield to the discrete with mathematician Richard Dedekind's (1831–1916) Dedekind cut and Ludwig Boltzmann's (1844–1906) statistical thermodynamics.\n\n**The late 19th century**\n\nArt historians have also suggested that modernism began in the late 19th century. Visual art critic Clement Greenberg called German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) \"the first real modernist\". Greenberg also wrote that \"What can be safely called modernism emerged in the middle of the last century—and rather locally, in France, with Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) in literature and Manet in painting, and perhaps with Gustave Flaubert (1821–1880), too, in prose fiction.\"\n\n**Modernism emerges**\n\nOut of the collision of ideals derived from Romanticism and an attempt to find a way for knowledge to explain that which was as yet unknown, came the first wave of modernist works in the opening decade of the 20th century. Although their authors considered them to be extensions of existing trends in art, these works broke the implicit understanding the general public had of art: that artists were the interpreters and representatives of bourgeois culture and ideas.\n\n**1901 to 1930**\n\nThe first wave of modernist works in the opening decade of the 20th century included the atonal ending of Arnold Schoenberg's Second String Quartet in 1908, the Expressionist paintings of Wassily Kandinsky starting in 1903, and culminating with his first abstract painting and the founding of the Blue Rider group in Munich in 1911.\n\n**Modernism continues: 1930–1945**\n\nModernism continued to evolve during the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1932 composer Arnold Schoenberg worked on Moses und Aron, one of the first operas to make use of the twelve-tone technique. Pablo Picasso painted in 1937 Guernica, his cubist condemnation of fascism, while in 1939 James Joyce pushed the boundaries of the modern novel further with Finnegans Wake.\n\n**After 1945**\n\nWhile The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature states that modernism ended by c. 1939 with regard to British and American literature, \"When (if) modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to modernism occurred.\" Clement Greenberg sees modernism ending in the 1930s, with the exception of the visual and performing arts.\n\n**Theatre of the Absurd**\n\nThe term \"Theatre of the Absurd\" is applied to plays, written primarily by Europeans, that express the belief that human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down. While there are significant precursors, including Alfred Jarry (1873–1907), the Theatre of the Absurd is generally seen as beginning in the 1950s with the plays of Samuel Beckett.\n\n**Pollock and abstract influences**\n\nDuring the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all contemporary art that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like Pablo Picasso's innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture in the early 20th century via Cubism and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art is made.\n\n**International figures from British art**\n\nHenry Moore (1898–1986) emerged after World War II as Britain's leading sculptor. He was best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art.\n\n**After Abstract Expressionism**\n\nIn abstract painting during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions like hard-edge painting and other forms of geometric abstraction began to appear in artist studios and in radical avant-garde circles as a reaction against the subjectivism of Abstract Expressionism.\n\n**Pop art**\n\nIn 1962, the Sidney Janis Gallery mounted The New Realists, the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Pop art rejected Abstract Expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior in favor of art that depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and the iconography of the mass production age.\n\n**Minimalism**\n\nMinimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially visual art and music, wherein artists intend to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all nonessential forms, features, or concepts. Minimalism is any design or style wherein the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect.\n\n**Minimal music**\n\nThe terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music that features such repetition and iteration as those of the compositions of La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams. Minimalist compositions are sometimes known as systems music.\n\n**Postminimalism**\n\nIn the late 1960s, Robert Pincus-Witten coined the term \"postminimalism\" to describe minimalist-derived art which had content and contextual overtones that minimalism rejected.\n\n**Collage, assemblage, installations**\n\nRelated to Abstract Expressionism was the emergence of combining manufactured items with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture.

Intermedia is a term coined by Dick Higgins and meant to convey new art forms along the lines of Fluxus, concrete poetry, found objects, performance art, and computer art.\n\n**Fluxus**\n\nFluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by George Maciunas (1931–1978), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to John Cage's 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at The New School for Social Research in New York City.\n\n**Avant-garde popular music**\n\nModernism had an uneasy relationship with popular forms of music (both in form and aesthetic) while rejecting popular culture. Despite this, Stravinsky used jazz idioms on his pieces like \"Ragtime\" from his 1918 theatrical work Histoire du Soldat and 1945's Ebony Concerto.\n\n**Late period**\n\nThe continuation of Abstract Expressionism, color field painting, lyrical abstraction, geometric abstraction, minimalism, abstract illusionism, process art, pop art, postminimalism, and other late 20th-century modernist movements in both painting and sculpture continued through the first decade of the 21st century and constitute radical new directions in those mediums.\n\n**Modern architecture**\n\nMany skyscrapers in Hong Kong and Frankfurt have been inspired by Le Corbusier and modernist architecture, and his style is still used as influence for buildings worldwide.\n\n**Modernism in Asia**\n\nThe terms \"modernism\" and \"modernist\" have only recently become part of the standard discourse in English on modern Japanese literature and doubts concerning their authenticity vis-à-vis Western European modernism remain.

subsequent advancements in physics, engineering, and architecture they led to A major 19th-century engineering achievement was the Crystal Palace, the huge cast-iron and plate-glass exhibition hall built for the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London Glass and iron were used in a similar monumental style in the construction of major railway terminals throughout the city, including  King's Cross station (1852) [38] and Paddington Station (1854) [39] These technological advances spread abroad, leading to later structures such as the Brooklyn Bridge (1883) and the Eiffel Tower (1889), the latter of which broke all previous limitations on how tall man-made objects could be While such engineering feats radically altered the 19th-century urban environment and the daily lives of people, the human experience of time itself was altered with the development of the electric telegraph in 1837, [40] as well as the adoption of \"standard time\" by British railway companies from 1845, a concept which would be adopted throughout the rest of the world over the next fifty years [41]\n\n\nThe late 19th century\nArt historians have suggested various dates as starting points for modernism Historian William Everdell argued that modernism began in the 1870s when metaphorical (or ontological) continuity began to yield to the discrete with mathematician Richard Dedekind's (1831–1916) Dedekind cut and Ludwig Boltzmann's (1844–1906) statistical thermodynamics [14] Everdell also believed modernism in painting began in 1885–1886 with post-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat's development of Divisionism, the \"dots\" used to paint A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte On the other hand, visual art critic Clement Greenberg called German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) \"the first real modernist\", [49] although he also wrote, \"What can be safely called modernism emerged in the middle of the last century—and rather locally, in France, with Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) in literature and Manet in painting, and perhaps with Gustave Flaubert (1821–1880), too, in prose fiction (It was a while later, and not so locally, that modernism appeared in music and architecture).\" [45] The poet Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil) and the author Flaubert's Madame Bovary were both published in 1857 Baudelaire's essay \"The Painter of Modern Life\" (1863) inspired young artists to break away from tradition and innovate new ways of portraying their world in art.\n\n\nModernism emerges\nOut of the collision of ideals derived from

of the first operas to make use of the twelve-tone technique, [96] Pablo Picasso painted in 1937 Guernica, his cubist condemnation of fascism, while in 1939 James Joyce pushed the boundaries of the modern novel further with Finnegans Wake Also by 1930 modernism began to influence mainstream culture, so that, for example, The New Yorker magazine began publishing work, influenced by modernism, by young writers and humorists like Dorothy Parker, [97] Robert Benchley, E B White, S J Perelman, and James Thurber, amongst others [98] Perelman is highly regarded for his humorous short stories that he published in magazines in the 1930s and 1940s, most often in The New Yorker, which are considered to be the first examples of surrealist humor in America [99] Modern ideas in art also began to appear more frequently in commercials and logos, an early example of which, from 1916, is the famous London Underground logo designed by Edward Johnston [100]\n\n\nAttacks on early modernism\n\n\n\nAfter 1945\nWhile The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature states that modernism ended by c 1939 [113] with regard to British and American literature, \"When (if) modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to modernism occurred.\" [114] Clement Greenberg sees modernism ending in the 1930s, with the exception of the visual and performing arts, [45] but with regard to music, Paul Griffiths notes that, while modernism \"seemed to be a spent force\" by the late 1920s, after World War II, \"a new generation of composers—Boulez, Barraqué, Babbitt, Nono, Stockhausen, Xenakis\" revived modernism\" [115] In fact, many literary modernists lived into the 1950s and 1960s, though generally they were no longer producing major works The term \"late modernism\" is also sometimes applied to modernist works published after 1930 [116] [117] Among the modernists (or late modernists) still publishing after 1945 were Wallace Stevens, Gottfried Benn, T S Eliot, Anna Akhmatova, William Faulkner, Dorothy Richardson, John Cowper Powys, and Ezra Pound Basil Bunting, born in 1901, published his most important modernist poem, Briggflatts in 1965 In addition, Hermann Broch's The Death of Virgil was published in 1945 and Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus in 1947 Samuel Beckett, who died in 1989, has been described as a \"later modernist\" [118] Beckett is a writer with roots in the Expressionist tradition of modernism, who produced works from the 1930s until the 1980s, including Molloy (1951), Waiting for Godot (1953), Happy Days (1961), and Rockaby (1981) The terms \"minimalist\" and \"post-modernist\" have also been applied to his later works [119] The poets Charles Olson (1910–1970) and J H Prynne (born 1936) are among the writers in the second half of the 20th century who have been described as late modernists [120]\n\n\nTheatre of the Absurd\nThe term \"Theatre of the Absurd\" is applied to plays, written primarily by Europeans, that express the belief that human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence [123] While there are significant precursors, including Alfred Jarry (1873–1907), the Theatre of the Absurd is generally seen as beginning in the 1950s with the plays of Samuel Beckett.\n\n\nPollock and abstract influences\nDuring the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all contemporary art that followed him To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself Like Pablo Picasso's innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture in the early 20th century via Cubism and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art is made His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all who came after Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—placing unstretched raw canvas on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artistic and industrial materials; dripping and throwing linear skeins of paint; drawing, staining, and brushing; using imagery and non-imagery—essentially blasted art-making beyond any prior boundary Abstract Expressionism generally expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities available to artists for the creation of new works of art.\n\n\nInternational figures from British art\nHenry Moore (1898–1986) emerged after World War II as Britain's leading sculptor He was best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures, usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces.\n\n\nAfter Abstract Expressionism\nIn abstract painting during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions like hard-edge painting and other forms of geometric abstraction began to appear in artist studios and in radical avant-garde circles as a reaction against the subjectivism of Abstract Expressionism Clement Greenberg became the voice of post-painterly abstraction when he curated an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964 Color field painting, hard-edge painting, and lyrical abstraction [142] emerged as radical new directions.\n\n\nPop art\nIn 1962, the Sidney Janis Gallery mounted The New Realists, the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City [145] Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery The show had a great impact on the New York School as well as the greater worldwide art scene Earlier in England in 1958 the term \"Pop Art\" was used by Lawrence Alloway to describe paintings associated with the consumerism of the post World War II era [146] This movement rejected Abstract Expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior in favor of art that depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and the iconography of the mass production age [147] The early works of David Hockney and the works of Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi (who created the ground-breaking I was a Rich Man's Plaything, 1947 [148]) are considered seminal examples in the movement [149] Meanwhile, in the downtown scene in New York's East Village 10th Street galleries, artists were formulating an American version of pop art Claes Oldenburg had his storefront, and the Green Gallery on 57th Street began to show the works of Tom Wesselmann and James Rosenquist Later Leo Castelli exhibited the works of other American artists, including those of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein for most of their careers [150] There is a connection between the radical works of Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, the rebellious Dadaists with a sense of humor, and pop artists like Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein, whose paintings reproduce the look of Ben-Day dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction  [151].\n\n\nMinimalism\nMinimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially visual art and music, wherein artists intend to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all nonessential forms, features, or concepts Minimalism is any design or style wherein the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect.\n\n\nMinimal music\nThe terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music that features such repetition and iteration as those of the compositions of La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams Minimalist compositions are sometimes known as systems music The term 'minimal music' is generally used to describe a style of music that developed in America in the late 1960s and 1970s; and that was initially connected with the composers [155] The minimalism movement originally involved some composers, and other lesser known pioneers included Pauline Oliveros, Phill Niblock, and Richard Maxfield In Europe, the music of Louis Andriessen, Karel Goeyvaerts, Michael Nyman, Howard Skempton, Eliane Radigue, Gavin Bryars, Steve Martland, Henryk Górecki, Arvo Pärt and John Tavener.\n\n\nPostminimalism\nIn the late 1960s, Robert Pincus-Witten [143] coined the term \"postminimalism\" to describe minimalist-derived art which had content and contextual overtones that minimalism rejected The term was applied by Pincus-Witten to the work of Eva Hesse, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra and new work by former minimalists Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, Sol LeWitt, Barry Le Va, and others Other minimalists, including Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Carl Andre, Agnes Martin, John McCracken and others, continued to produce late modernist paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.\n\n\nCollage, assemblage, installations\nRelated to Abstract Expressionism was the emergence of combining manufactured items with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture The work of Robert Rauschenberg exemplifies this trend His \"combines\" of the 1950s were forerunners of pop art and installation art, and used assemblages of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photographs Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Jim Dine, and Edward Kienholz were among important pioneers of both abstraction and pop art Creating new conventions of art-making, they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion in their works of unlikely materials Another pioneer of collage was Joseph Cornell, whose more intimately scaled works were seen as radical because of both his personal iconography and his use of found objects.\n\n\nNeo-Dada\nIn 1917, Marcel Duchamp submitted a urinal as a sculpture for the inaugural exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, which was to be staged at the Grand Central Palace in New York [156] He professed his intent that people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art because he said it was a work of art This urinal, named Fountain was signed with the pseudonym \"R Mutt\" It is also an example of what Duchamp would later call \"readymades\" This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as Dada Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, other famous examples being John Cage's 4′33″, which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence, and Rauschenberg's Erased de Kooning Drawing Many conceptual works take the position that art is the result of the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not of the intrinsic qualities of the work itself In choosing \"an ordinary article of life\" and creating \"a new thought for that object\", Duchamp invited onlookers to view Fountain as a sculpture [157]\n\n\nPerformance and happenings\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of contemporary art Yves Klein in France, Carolee Schneemann, Yayoi Kusama, Charlotte Moorman and Yoko Ono in New York City, and Joseph Beuys, Wolf Vostell and Nam June Paik in Germany were pioneers of performance-based works of art Groups like The Living Theatre with Julian Beck and Judith Malina collaborated with sculptors and painters to create environments, radically changing the relationship between audience and performer, especially in their piece Paradise Now The Judson Dance Theater, located at the Judson Memorial Church, New York; and the Judson dancers, notably Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Elaine Summers, Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, Deborah Hay, Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton and others; collaborated with artists Robert Morris, Robert Whitman, John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, and engineers like Billy Klüver Park Place Gallery was a center for musical performances by electronic composers Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and other notable performance artists, including Joan Jonas.\n\n\nIntermedia, multi-media\nAnother trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together Intermedia is a term coined by Dick Higgins and meant to convey new art forms along the lines of Fluxus, concrete poetry, found objects, performance art, and computer art Higgins was the publisher of the Something Else Press, a concrete poet married to artist Alison Knowles and an admirer of Marcel Duchamp Ihab Hassan includes \"Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms,\" in his list of the characteristics of postmodern art [162] One of the most common forms of \"multi-media art\" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed video art While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with performance art, where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.\n\n\nFluxus\nFluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by George Maciunas (1931–1978), a Lithuanian-born American artist Fluxus traces its beginnings to John Cage's 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at The New School for Social Research in New York City Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music Cage's students included Fluxus founding members Jackson Mac Low, Al Hansen, George Brecht and Dick Higgins.\n\n\nAvant-garde popular music\nModernism had an uneasy relationship with popular forms of music (both in form and aesthetic) while rejecting popular culture [164] Despite this, Stravinsky used jazz idioms on his pieces like \"Ragtime\" from his 1918 theatrical work Histoire du Soldat and 1945's Ebony Concerto [165]\n\n\nLate period\nThe continuation of Abstract Expressionism, color field painting, lyrical abstraction, geometric abstraction, minimalism, abstract illusionism, process art, pop art, postminimalism, and other late 20th-century modernist movements in both painting and sculpture continued through the first decade of the 21st century and constitute radical new directions in those mediums [168] [169] [170]\n\n\nModern architecture\nMany skyscrapers in Hong Kong and Frankfurt have been inspired by Le Corbusier and modernist architecture, and his style is still used as influence for buildings worldwide [171]\n\n\nModernism in Asia\nThe terms \"modernism\" and \"modernist\", according to scholar William J Tyler, \"have only recently become part of the standard discourse in English on modern Japanese literature and doubts concerning their authenticity vis-à-vis Western European modernism remain\" Tyler finds this odd, given \"the decidedly modern prose\" of such \"well-known Japanese writers as Kawabata Yasunari, Nagai Kafu, and Jun'ichirō Tanizaki\" However, \"scholars in the visual and fine arts, architecture, and poetry readily embraced \"modanizumu\" as a key concept for describing and analysing Japanese culture in the 1920s and 1930s\" [172] In 1924, various young Japanese writers, including Kawabata and Riichi Yokomitsu started a literary journal Bungei Jidai (\"The Artistic Age\") This journal was \"part of an 'art for art's sake' movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles\" [173]\n\n\nModernism in Africa\nPeter Kalliney suggests that \"Modernist concepts, especially aesthetic autonomy, were fundamental to the literature of decolonization in anglophone Africa.\" [175] In his opinion, Rajat Neogy, Christopher Okigbo, and Wole Soyinka, were among the writers who \"repurposed modernist versions of aesthetic autonomy to declare their freedom from colonial bondage, from systems of racial discrimination, and even from the new postcolonial state\" [176]\n\n\nRelationship with postmodernism\nBy the early 1980s, the postmodern movement in art and architecture began to establish its position through various conceptual and intermedia formats Postmodernism in music and literature began to take hold earlier In music, postmodernism is described in one reference work as a \"term introduced in the 1970s\", [177] while in British literature, The Oxford Encyclopaedia of British Literature sees modernism \"ceding its predominance to postmodernism\" as early as 1939 [113] However, dates are highly debatable, especially as, according to Andreas Huyssen: \"one critic's postmodernism is another critic's modernism.\" [178] This includes those who are critical of the division between the two, see them as two aspects of the same movement, and believe that late modernism continues [178]\n\n\nCriticism of late modernity\nAlthough artistic modernism tended to reject capitalist values such as consumerism, 20th century civil society embraced global mass production and the proliferation of cheap and accessible commodities This period of social development is known as \"late or high modernity\" and originates in advanced in Western societies The German sociologist Jürgen Habermas, in The Theory of Communicative Action (1981), developed the first substantive critique of the culture of late modernity Another important early critique of late modernity is the American sociologist George Ritzer's The McDonaldization of Society (1993) Ritzer describes how late modernity became saturated with fast food consumer culture Other authors have demonstrated how modernist devices appeared in popular cinema, and later on in music videos Modernist design has entered the mainstream of popular culture, as simplified and stylized forms became popular, often associated with dreams of a space age high-tech future [187] [188]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

[19] Co-creator Alex Kurtzman confirmed a month later that a second season was \"already in the works\" ahead of the first-season premiere in January 2020 [20]\n\n\nWriting\nFollowing the first-season finale, Chabon and Goldsman said the second season would not ignore the fact that Picard's consciousness was transferred into a synthetic body during that episode [37] They added that the season would further explore the personal lives of the series' supporting cast, [27] the first season's Romulan refugee storyline, [31] and the technology and culture of Starfleet [38] Goldsman said the season would continue to explore issues that come up in the last stage of a person's life [39] One lesson learned by the writers during the first season, according to Goldsman, was to plan out the full story and ending of the season before they began filming [39]\n\n\nCasting\nBy June 2020, most of the main cast from the first season were expected to star in the second, including Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard, Alison Pill as Agnes Jurati, Isa Briones as Soji Asha, Evan Evagora as Elnor, Michelle Hurd as Raffi Musiker, and Santiago Cabrera as Cristobal \"Chris\" Rios Harry Treadaway, who portrayed Narek in the first season, did not return for the second [1] [22]\n\n\nDesign\nMatalas said each season would be differentiated visually He wanted to return to the visual style of the Next Generation era while incorporating elements from the Original Series-era films, which were his personal favorites He said new production designer Dave Blass was a long-time Star Trek fan who also wanted to return to that aesthetic, [25] and they both insisted on bringing back several creatives from earlier Star Trek series including Michael and Denise Okuda, who designed the LCARS computer system for The Next Generation; long-time Star Trek concept designer and visual effects artists Doug Drexler; and frequent Star Trek starship designer John Eaves [25] [67] The design team included a lot of references to previous Star Trek projects, which Matalas said was partially \"cheeky, nerdy fun\", but also about honoring the history and legacy of the franchise [25] The series' opening title sequence was updated from the first season by creative agency Prologue to include new imagery from the second season, including adding a Starfleet combadge to Picard's jacket for the ending shot [68] [69]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming was scheduled to begin in mid-June 2020, [29] [30] but was delayed to January 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic [33] [89] In December 2020, Ryan said filming would begin on February 1, [90] but on that date she revealed that it was delayed again [91] Principal photography began on February 16, [34] in California where the series received tax incentives to continue filming after the first season [22] Doug Aarniokoski directed the first two episodes, [92] and Crescenzo Notarile returned as cinematographer from the third season of Discovery [93] [94] Jimmy Lindsey was also a cinematographer for the season [95] Location filming took place later in February at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, to portray Starfleet Academy in the first episode and the Confederation Presidential Palace in the second [96] [97] SoFi Stadium in Inglewood was also used to depict part of Starfleet Academy in the premiere [98] In April, de Lancie said scenes for the second and third seasons of Picard were being filmed simultaneously [99] The two seasons had one of the largest television crews at the time with more than 450 crewmembers [100]\n\n\nVisual effects\nVisual effects vendors for the season included Crafty Apes VFX, [115] Outpost VFX, [116] and Gradient Effects [117] Outpost was initially just hired to work on the La Sirena crash and Chateau Picard location in the third episode, but their work was expanded to include four other episodes in the season when the producers liked the results Shots featuring Chateau Picard used aerial footage of the chateau filming location which needed to be augmented to make it look rundown for the 2024 scenes and \"pristine\" for the 25th century scenes The La Sirena crash required fire and spark effects on the ship as well as simulations of its impact on the chateau grounds [116]\n\n\nMusic\nComposer Jeff Russo said in December 2020 that he was beginning to think about the score for the season, [120] which features an \"up-tempo rearrangement\" of the series' main theme [69] Russo did this because he wanted \"a little more pace and a little more hype\" to reflect the swashbuckling, action-heavy tone of the second season compared to the more contemplative first season that he originally wrote the theme for [121] After referencing Jerry Goldsmith's theme from The Next Generation and Alexander Courage's original Star Trek theme in his initial music for the series, [122] Russo also references Goldsmith's First Contact theme in the second season's score [123]\n\n\nMarketing\nCBS announced in June 2020 that it was participating in the \"All In Challenge\" to raise money for COVID-19 relief Money donated to the campaign would go to charities including Feeding America, Meals on Wheels, World Central Kitchen, and No Kid Hungry, and fans who donated could win the chance to visit the series' set, meet Patrick Stewart, and have a walk-on role in an episode [128] In February 2021, Stewart appeared in a marketing campaign for Super Bowl LV advertising the rebranded streaming service Paramount+ [129] A panel for the season was held during the \"First Contact Day\" virtual event on April 5, 2021, celebrating the franchise on the fictional holiday marking first contact between humans and aliens in the Star Trek universe Stewart and de Lancie discussed the season at the panel, which debuted a teaser revealing the focus on time travel and the return of Q [3] A second teaser was released to coincide with \"Capitan Picard Day\" on June 16, featuring a look at de Lancie's return and teasing an alternate timeline for the characters A teaser poster was also released featuring a contemporary-looking Los Angeles [130] Liz Shannon Miller of Collider highlighted the appearance of Q in the trailer as well as the emphasis on other characters such as Seven of Nine in alternate timeline scenarios [131] Matthew Jackson at Syfy Wire also highlighted the appearance of Q, saying it gave him goosebumps [132] James Whitbrook of io9 focused on Seven of Nine appearing without her Borg implants and described the teaser poster as \"cryptic\" [133]\n\n\nRelease\nThe season

the first-season premiere in January 2020 [20]\n\n\nWriting\nFollowing the first-season finale, Chabon and Goldsman said the second season would not ignore the fact that Picard's consciousness was transferred into a synthetic body during that episode [37] They added that the season would further explore the personal lives of the series' supporting cast, [27] the first season's Romulan refugee storyline, [31] and the technology and culture of Starfleet [38] Goldsman said the season would continue to explore issues that come up in the last stage of a person's life [39] One lesson learned by the writers during the first season, according to Goldsman, was to plan out the full story and ending of the season before they began filming [39]\n\n\nCasting\nBy June 2020, most of the main cast from the first season were expected to star in the second, including Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard, Alison Pill as Agnes Jurati, Isa Briones as Soji Asha, Evan Evagora as Elnor, Michelle Hurd as Raffi Musiker, and Santiago Cabrera as Cristobal \"Chris\" Rios Harry Treadaway, who portrayed Narek in the first season, did not return for the second [1] [22]\n\n\nDesign\nMatalas said each season would be differentiated visually He wanted to return to the visual style of the Next Generation era while incorporating elements from the Original Series-era films, which were his personal favorites He said new production designer Dave Blass was a long-time Star Trek fan who also wanted to return to that aesthetic, [25] and they both insisted on bringing back several creatives from earlier Star Trek series including Michael and Denise Okuda, who designed the LCARS computer system for The Next Generation; long-time Star Trek concept designer and visual effects artists Doug Drexler; and frequent Star Trek starship designer John Eaves [25] [67] The design team included a lot of references to previous Star Trek projects, which Matalas said was partially \"cheeky, nerdy fun\", but also about honoring the history and legacy of the franchise [25] The series' opening title sequence was updated from the first season by creative agency Prologue to include new imagery from the second season, including adding a Starfleet combadge to Picard's jacket for the ending shot [68] [69]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming was scheduled to begin in mid-June 2020, [29] [30] but was delayed to January 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic [33] [89] In December 2020, Ryan said filming would begin on February 1, [90] but on that date she revealed that it was delayed again [91] Principal photography began on February 16, [34] in California where the series received tax incentives to continue filming after the first season [22] Doug Aarniokoski directed the first two episodes, [92] and Crescenzo Notarile returned as cinematographer from the third season of Discovery [93] [94] Jimmy Lindsey was also a cinematographer for the season [95] Location filming took place later in February at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, to portray Starfleet Academy in the first episode and the Confederation Presidential Palace in the second [96] [97] SoFi Stadium in Inglewood was also used to depict part of Starfleet Academy in the premiere [98] In April, de Lancie said scenes for the second and third seasons of Picard were being filmed simultaneously [99] The two seasons had one of the largest television crews at the time with more than 450 crewmembers [100]\n\n\nVisual effects\nVisual effects vendors for the season included Crafty Apes VFX, [115] Outpost VFX, [116] and Gradient Effects [117] Outpost was initially just hired to work on the La Sirena crash and Chateau Picard location in the third episode, but their work was expanded to include four other episodes in the season when the producers liked the results Shots featuring Chateau Picard used aerial footage of the chateau filming location which needed to be augmented to make it look rundown for the 2024 scenes and \"pristine\" for the 25th century scenes The La Sirena crash required fire and spark effects on the ship as well as simulations of its impact on the chateau grounds [116]\n\n\nMusic\nComposer Jeff Russo said in December 2020 that he was beginning to think about the score for the season, [120] which features an \"up-tempo rearrangement\" of the series' main theme [69] Russo did this because he wanted \"a little more pace and a little more hype\" to reflect the swashbuckling, action-heavy tone of the second season compared to the more contemplative first season that he originally wrote the theme for [121] After referencing Jerry Goldsmith's theme from The Next Generation and Alexander Courage's original Star Trek theme in his initial music for the series, [122] Russo also references Goldsmith's First Contact theme in the second season's score [123]\n\n\nMarketing\nCBS announced in June 2020 that it was participating in the \"All In Challenge\" to raise money for COVID-19 relief Money donated to the campaign would go to charities including Feeding America, Meals on Wheels, World Central Kitchen, and No Kid Hungry, and fans who donated could win the chance to visit the series' set, meet Patrick Stewart, and have a walk-on role in an episode [128] In February 2021, Stewart appeared in a marketing campaign for Super Bowl LV advertising the rebranded streaming service Paramount+ [129] A panel for the season was held during the \"First Contact Day\" virtual event on April 5, 2021, celebrating the franchise on the fictional holiday marking first contact between humans and aliens in the Star Trek universe Stewart and de Lancie discussed the season at the panel, which debuted a teaser revealing the focus on time travel and the return of Q [3] A second teaser was released to coincide with \"Capitan Picard Day\" on June 16, featuring a look at de Lancie's return and teasing an alternate timeline for the characters A teaser poster was also released featuring a contemporary-looking Los Angeles [130] Liz Shannon Miller of Collider highlighted the appearance of Q in the trailer as well as the emphasis on other characters such as Seven of Nine in alternate timeline scenarios [131] Matthew Jackson at Syfy Wire also highlighted the appearance of Q, saying it gave him goosebumps [132] James Whitbrook of io9 focused on Seven of Nine appearing without her Borg implants and described the teaser poster as \"cryptic\" [133]\n\n\nRelease\nThe season premiered on March 3, 2022, on Paramount+ in the United States, [142] and ran for 10 episodes until May 5

Elizabeth, later queen of Bohemia; and Charles, James's successor \n\n\nWitch hunts\nJames's visit to Denmark, a country familiar with witch-hunts, sparked an interest in the study of witchcraft, [54] which he considered a branch of theology [55] He attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the Witchcraft Act 1563 Several people were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James's ship, most notably Agnes Sampson [56]\n\n\nHighlands and Islands\nThe forcible dissolution of the Lordship of the Isles by James IV of Scotland in 1493 had led to troubled times for the western seaboard James IV had subdued the organised military might of the Hebrides, but he and his immediate successors lacked the will or ability to provide an alternative form of governance As a result, the 16th century became known as linn nan creach, the time of raids [61] Furthermore, the effects of the Reformation were slow to affect the Gàidhealtachd, driving a religious wedge between this area and centres of political control in the Central Belt [62]\n\n\nTheory of monarchy\nIn 1597–98, James wrote The True Law of Free Monarchies and Basilikon Doron (Royal Gift), in which he argues a theological basis for monarchy In the True Law, he sets out the divine right of kings, explaining that kings are higher beings than other men for Biblical reasons, though \"the highest bench is the sliddriest to sit upon\" [71] The document proposes an absolutist theory of monarchy, by which a king may impose new laws by royal prerogative but must also pay heed to tradition and to God, who would \"stirre up such scourges as pleaseth him, for punishment of wicked kings\" [72]\n\n\nLiterary patronage\nIn the 1580s and 1590s, James promoted the literature of his native country He published his treatise Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody in 1584 at the age of 18 It was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue of Scots, applying Renaissance principles [77] He also made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, seeing the two in connection One act of his reign urges the Scottish burghs to reform and support the teaching of music in Sang Sculis [78]\n\n\nAccession in England\nFrom 1601, in the last years of Elizabeth's life, certain English politicians—notably her chief minister Robert Cecil [f]—maintained a secret correspondence with James to prepare in advance for a smooth succession [86] With the queen clearly dying, Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne in March 1603 Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March, and James was proclaimed king in London later the same day [87] [88]\n\n\nEarly reign in England\nJames survived two conspiracies in the first year of his reign, despite the smoothness of the succession and the warmth of his welcome: the Bye Plot and Main Plot, which led to the arrest of Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham and Walter Raleigh, among others [96] Those hoping for a change in government from James were disappointed at first when he kept Elizabeth's Privy Councillors in office, as secretly planned with Cecil, [96] but James soon added long-time supporter Henry Howard and his nephew Thomas Howard to the Privy Council, as well as five Scottish nobles [96] [g]\n\n\nGunpowder Plot\nA dissident Catholic, Guy Fawkes, was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings on the night of 4–5 November 1605, the eve of the state opening of the second session of James's first English Parliament Fawkes was guarding a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which he intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, \"not only .. of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general\" [106] The sensational discovery of the \"Gunpowder Plot\", as it quickly became known, aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons The Earl of Salisbury exploited this to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than any but one granted to Elizabeth [107] Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed [108]\n\n\nKing and Parliament\nThe co-operation between monarch and Parliament following the Gunpowder Plot was atypical Instead, it was the previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides for the rest of the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity [109] On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies \"I will not thank where I feel no thanks due\", he had remarked in his closing speech \".. I am not of such a stock as to praise fools .. You see how many things you did not well .. I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come\" [110]\n\n\nSpanish match\nAnother potential source of income was the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain [115] The policy of the Spanish match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war [116] Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade [117]\n\n\nKing and Church\nAfter the Gunpowder Plot, James sanctioned harsh measures to control English Catholics In May 1606, Parliament passed the Popish Recusants Act, which could require any subject to take an Oath of Allegiance denying the pope's authority over the king [133] James was conciliatory towards Catholics who took the Oath of Allegiance, [134] and tolerated crypto-Catholicism even at court [i] Henry Howard, for example, was a crypto-Catholic, received back into the Catholic Church in his final months [135] On ascending the English throne, James suspected that he might need the support of Catholics in England, so he assured Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, a prominent sympathiser of the old religion, that he would not persecute \"any that will be quiet and give but an outward obedience to the law\" [136]\n\n\nPersonal relationships\nThroughout his life James had close relationships with male courtiers, which has caused debate among historians about their exact nature [146] In Scotland Anne Murray was known as the king's mistress [147] After his accession in England, his peaceful and scholarly attitude contrasted strikingly with the bellicose and flirtatious behaviour of Elizabeth, [146] as indicated by the contemporary epigram Rex fuit Elizabeth, nunc est regina Iacobus (Elizabeth was King, now James is Queen) [148]\n\n\nHealth and death\nIn his later years, James suffered increasingly from arthritis, gout and kidney stones [53] [172] He also lost his teeth and drank heavily [53] [173] The king was often seriously ill during the last year of his life, leaving him an increasingly peripheral figure, rarely able to visit London, while Buckingham consolidated his control of Charles to ensure his own future [p] One theory is that James suffered from porphyria, a disease of which his descendant George III exhibited some symptoms James described his urine to physician Théodore de Mayerne as being the \"dark red colour of Alicante wine\" [176] The theory is dismissed by some experts, particularly in James's case, because he had kidney stones which can lead to blood in the urine, colouring it red [177]\n\n\nLegacy\nJames was widely mourned For all his flaws, he had largely retained the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era \"As he lived in peace\", remarked the Earl of Kellie, \"so did he die in peace, and I pray God our king  [Charles I] may follow him\" [182] The Earl prayed in vain: once in power, King Charles I and the Duke of Buckingham sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure [183] James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; his later dependence on favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by Elizabeth I [184]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\nIn Scotland, James was \"James the sixth, King of Scotland\", until 1604 He was proclaimed \"James the first, King of England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith\" in London on 24 March 1603 [193] On 20 October 1604, James issued a proclamation at Westminster changing his style to \"King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c.\" [194] The style was not used on English statutes, but was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, treaties, and in Scotland [195] James styled himself \"King of France\", in line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1801, although he did not actually rule France.\n\n\nTitles and styles\nIn Scotland, James was \"James the sixth, King of Scotland\", until 1604 He was proclaimed \"James the first, King of England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith\" in London on 24 March 1603 [193] On 20 October 1604, James issued a proclamation at Westminster changing his style to \"King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c.\" [194] The style was not used on English statutes, but was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, treaties, and in Scotland [195] James styled himself \"King of France\", in line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1801, although he did not actually rule France.\n\n\nArms\nAs King of Scotland, James bore the ancient royal arms of Scotland: Or, a lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory counter-flory Gules The arms were supported by two unicorns Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a coronet Or composed of crosses patée and fleurs de lys a chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or The crest was a lion sejant affrontée Gules, imperially crowned Or, holding in the dexter paw a sword and in the sinister paw a sceptre both erect and Proper [196]\n\n\nIssue\nJames's queen, Anne of Denmark, gave birth to seven children who survived beyond birth, of whom three reached adulthood: [199]\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nList of writings\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**James VI and I**\n\nJames VI and I was the King of Scotland as James VI from 1567 to 1625 and King of England and Ireland as James I from 1603 to 1625. He ruled in all three countries, but had different reigns in each.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nJames was the only son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. Mary and Darnley were great-grandchildren of Henry VII of England through Margaret Tudor, the older sister of Henry VIII. Mary's rule over Scotland was insecure, and she and her husband, being Roman Catholics, faced a rebellion by Protestant noblemen. During Mary's and Darnley's difficult marriage, Darnley secretly allied himself with the rebels and conspired in the murder of the queen's private secretary, David Rizzio, just three months before James's birth.\n\n**Birth**\n\nJames was the only son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley.

James was anointed King of Scotland at the age of thirteen months at the Church of the Holy Rude in Stirling, by Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney, on 29 July 1567. The sermon at the coronation was preached by John Knox. In accordance with the religious beliefs of most of the Scottish ruling class, James was brought up as a member of the Protestant Church of Scotland, the Kirk. The Privy Council selected George Buchanan, Peter Young, Adam Erskine (lay abbot of Cambuskenneth), and David Erskine (lay abbot of Dryburgh) as James's preceptors or tutors. As the young king's senior tutor, Buchanan subjected James to regular beatings but also instilled in him a lifelong passion for literature and learning. Buchanan sought to turn James into a God-fearing, Protestant king who accepted the limitations of monarchy, as outlined in his treatise De Jure Regni apud Scotos.\n\n**Rule in Scotland**\n\nLennox was a Protestant convert, but he was distrusted by Scottish Calvinists who noticed the physical displays of affection between him and the king and alleged that Lennox \"went about to draw the King to carnal lust\". In August 1582, in what became known as the Ruthven Raid, the Protestant earls William Ruthven, Earl of Gowrie and Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus lured James into Ruthven Castle, imprisoned him, and forced Lennox to leave Scotland. On 19 September 1582, during James's imprisonment, John Craig, whom the king had personally appointed royal chaplain in 1579, rebuked him so sharply from the pulpit for having issued a proclamation so offensive to the clergy \"that the king wept\".\n\n**Marriage**\n\nThroughout his youth, James was praised for his chastity, since he showed little interest in women. After the loss of Lennox, he continued to prefer male company. A suitable marriage, however, was necessary to reinforce his rule, and the choice fell on fourteen-year-old Anne of Denmark, younger daughter of the Protestant Danish king Frederick II. Shortly after a proxy marriage in Copenhagen in August 1589, Anne sailed for Scotland but was forced by storms to the coast of Norway. On hearing that the crossing had been abandoned, James sailed from Leith with a 300-strong retinue to fetch Anne personally. The couple were married formally at the Bishop's Palace in Oslo on 23 November 1589. James received a dowry of 75,000 Danish dalers and a gift of 10,000 dalers from his mother-in-law, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. After stays at Elsinore and Copenhagen and a meeting with Tycho Brahe, James and Anne returned to Scotland on 1 May 1590. By all accounts, James was at first infatuated with Anne and, in the early years of their marriage, seems always to have shown her patience and affection. The royal couple produced three children who survived to adulthood: Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who died of typhoid fever in 1612, aged 18; Elizabeth, later queen of Bohemia; and Charles, James's successor.\n\n**Witch hunts**\n\nJames's visit to Denmark, a country familiar with witch-hunts, sparked an interest in the study of witchcraft, which he considered a branch of theology. He attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the Witchcraft Act 1563. Several people were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James's ship, most notably Agnes Sampson.\n\n**Highlands and Islands**\n\nThe forcible dissolution of the Lordship of the Isles by James IV of Scotland in 1493 had led to troubled times for the western seaboard. James IV had subdued the organised military might of the Hebrides, but he and his immediate successors lacked the will or ability to provide an alternative form of governance. As a result, the 16th century became known as linn nan creach, the time of raids. Furthermore, the effects of the Reformation were slow to affect the Gàidhealtachd, driving a religious wedge between this area and centres of political control in the Central Belt.\n\n**Theory of monarchy**\n\nIn 1597–98, James wrote The True Law of Free Monarchies and Basilikon Doron (Royal Gift), in which he argues a theological basis for monarchy. In the True Law, he sets out the divine right of kings, explaining that kings are higher beings than other men for Biblical reasons, though \"the highest bench is the sliddriest to sit upon\". The document proposes an absolutist theory of monarchy, by which a king may impose new laws by royal prerogative but must also pay heed to tradition and to God, who would \"stirre up such scourges as pleaseth him, for punishment of wicked kings\".\n\n**Literary patronage**\n\nIn the 1580s and 1590s, James promoted the literature of his native country. He published his treatise Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody in 1584 at the age of 18. It was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue of Scots, applying Renaissance principles. He also made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, seeing the two in connection. One act of his reign urges the Scottish burghs to reform and support the teaching of music in Sang Sculis.\n\n**Accession in England**\n\nFrom 1601, in the last years of Elizabeth's life, certain English politicians—notably her chief minister Robert Cecil—maintained a secret correspondence with James to prepare in advance for a smooth succession. With the queen clearly dying, Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne in March 1603. Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March, and James was proclaimed king in London later the same day.\n\n**Early reign in England**\n\nJames survived two conspiracies in the first year of his reign, despite the smoothness of the succession and the warmth of his welcome: the Bye Plot and Main Plot, which led to the arrest of Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham and Walter Raleigh, among others. Those hoping for a change in government from James were disappointed at first when he kept Elizabeth's Privy Councillors in office, as secretly planned with Cecil, but James soon added long-time supporter Henry Howard and his nephew Thomas Howard to the Privy Council, as well as five Scottish nobles.\n\n**Gunpowder Plot**\n\nA dissident Catholic, Guy Fawkes, was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings on the night of 4–5 November 1605, the eve of the state opening of the second session of James's first English Parliament. Fawkes was guarding a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which he intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, \"not only .. of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general\". The sensational discovery of the \"Gunpowder Plot\", as it quickly became known, aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons. The Earl of Salisbury exploited this to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than any but one granted to Elizabeth. Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed.\n\n**King and Parliament**\n\nThe co-operation between monarch and Parliament following the Gunpowder Plot was atypical. Instead, it was the previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides for the rest of the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity. On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies \"I will not thank where I feel no thanks due\", he had remarked in his closing speech \".. I am not of such a stock as to praise fools .. You see how many things you did not well .. I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come\".\n\n**Spanish match**\n\nAnother potential source of income was the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.\n\n**King and Church**\n\nAfter the Gunpowder Plot, James sanctioned harsh measures to control English Catholics. In May 1606, Parliament passed the Popish Recusants Act, which could require any subject to take an Oath of Allegiance denying the pope's authority over the king. James was conciliatory towards Catholics who took the Oath of Allegiance, and tolerated crypto-Catholicism even at court. Henry Howard, for example, was a crypto-Catholic, received back into the Catholic Church in his final months. On ascending the English throne, James suspected that he might need the support of Catholics in England, so he assured Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, a prominent sympathiser of the old religion, that he would not persecute \"any that will be quiet and give but an outward obedience to the law\".\n\n**Personal relationships**\n\nThroughout his life James had close relationships with male courtiers, which has caused debate among historians about their exact nature. In Scotland Anne Murray was known as the king's mistress. After his accession in England, his peaceful and scholarly attitude contrasted strikingly with the bellicose and flirtatious behaviour of Elizabeth, as indicated by the contemporary epigram Rex fuit Elizabeth, nunc est regina Iacobus (Elizabeth was King, now James is Queen).\n\n**Health and death**\n\nIn his later years, James suffered increasingly from arthritis, gout and kidney stones. He also lost his teeth and drank heavily. The king was often seriously ill during the last year of his life, leaving him an increasingly peripheral figure, rarely able to visit London, while Buckingham consolidated his control of Charles to ensure his own future. One theory is that James suffered from porphyria, a disease of which his descendant George III exhibited some symptoms. James described his urine to physician Théodore de Mayerne as being the \"dark red colour of Alicante wine\". The theory is dismissed by some experts, particularly in James's case, because he had kidney stones which can lead to blood in the urine, colouring it red.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJames was widely mourned. For all his flaws, he had largely retained the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era. \"As he lived in peace\", remarked the Earl of Kellie, \"so did he die in peace, and I pray God our king [Charles I] may follow him\". The Earl prayed in vain: once in power, King Charles I and the Duke of Buckingham sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure. James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; his later dependence on favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by Elizabeth I.\n\n**Titles, styles, honours, and arms**\n\nIn Scotland, James was \"James the sixth, King of Scotland\", until 1604. He was proclaimed \"James the first, King of England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith\" in London on 24 March 1603. On 20 October 1604, James issued a proclamation at Westminster changing his style to \"King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c.\". The style was not used on English statutes, but was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, treaties, and in Scotland. James styled himself \"King of France\", in line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1801, although he did not actually rule France.\n\n**Arms**\n\nAs King of Scotland, James bore the ancient royal arms of Scotland: Or, a lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory counter-flory Gules. The arms were supported by two unicorns Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a coronet Or composed of crosses patée and fleurs de lys a chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or. The crest was a lion sejant affrontée Gules, imperially crowned Or, holding in the dexter paw a sword and in the sinister paw a sceptre both erect and Proper.\n\n**Issue**\n\nJames's queen, Anne of Denmark, gave birth to seven children who survived beyond birth, of whom three reached adulthood:\n\n* Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who died of typhoid fever in 1612, aged 18;\n* Elizabeth, later

David Erskine (lay abbot of Dryburgh) as James's preceptors or tutors [21] As the young king's senior tutor, Buchanan subjected James to regular beatings but also instilled in him a lifelong passion for literature and learning [22] Buchanan sought to turn James into a God-fearing, Protestant king who accepted the limitations of monarchy, as outlined in his treatise De Jure Regni apud Scotos [23]\n\n\nRule in Scotland\nLennox was a Protestant convert, but he was distrusted by Scottish Calvinists who noticed the physical displays of affection between him and the king and alleged that Lennox \"went about to draw the King to carnal lust\" [28] In August 1582, in what became known as the Ruthven Raid, the Protestant earls William Ruthven, Earl of Gowrie and Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus lured James into Ruthven Castle, imprisoned him, [c] and forced Lennox to leave Scotland On 19 September 1582, during James's imprisonment, John Craig, whom the king had personally appointed royal chaplain in 1579, rebuked him so sharply from the pulpit for having issued a proclamation so offensive to the clergy \"that the king wept\" [35]\n\n\nMarriage\nThroughout his youth, James was praised for his chastity, since he showed little interest in women After the loss of Lennox, he continued to prefer male company [46] A suitable marriage, however, was necessary to reinforce his rule, and the choice fell on fourteen-year-old Anne of Denmark, younger daughter of the Protestant Danish king Frederick II Shortly after a proxy marriage in Copenhagen in August 1589, Anne sailed for Scotland but was forced by storms to the coast of Norway [47] On hearing that the crossing had been abandoned, James sailed from Leith with a 300-strong retinue to fetch Anne personally in what historian David Harris Willson called \"the one romantic episode of his life\" [48] [e] The couple were married formally at the Bishop's Palace in Oslo on 23 November James received a dowry of 75,000 Danish dalers and a gift of 10,000 dalers from his mother-in-law, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow [50] After stays at Elsinore and Copenhagen and a meeting with Tycho Brahe, James and Anne returned to Scotland on 1 May 1590 [51] By all accounts, James was at first infatuated with Anne and, in the early years of their marriage, seems always to have shown her patience and affection [52] The royal couple produced three children who survived to adulthood: Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who died of typhoid fever in 1612, aged 18; Elizabeth, later queen of Bohemia; and Charles, James's successor \n\n\nWitch hunts\nJames's visit to Denmark, a country familiar with witch-hunts, sparked an interest in the study of witchcraft, [54] which he considered a branch of theology [55] He attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the Witchcraft Act 1563 Several people were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James's ship, most notably Agnes Sampson [56]\n\n\nHighlands and Islands\nThe forcible dissolution of the Lordship of the Isles by James IV of Scotland in 1493 had led to troubled times for the western seaboard James IV had subdued the organised military might of the Hebrides, but he and his immediate successors lacked the will or ability to provide an alternative form of governance As a result, the 16th century became known as linn nan creach, the time of raids [61] Furthermore, the effects of the Reformation were slow to affect the Gàidhealtachd, driving a religious wedge between this area and centres of political control in the Central Belt [62]\n\n\nTheory of monarchy\nIn 1597–98, James wrote The True Law of Free Monarchies and Basilikon Doron (Royal Gift), in which he argues a theological basis for monarchy In the True Law, he sets out the divine right of kings, explaining that kings are higher beings than other men for Biblical reasons, though \"the highest bench is the sliddriest to sit upon\" [71] The document proposes an absolutist theory of monarchy, by which a king may impose new laws by royal prerogative but must also pay heed to tradition and to God, who would \"stirre up such scourges as pleaseth him, for punishment of wicked kings\" [72]\n\n\nLiterary patronage\nIn the 1580s and 1590s, James promoted the literature of his native country He published his treatise Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody in 1584 at the age of 18 It was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue of Scots, applying Renaissance principles [77] He also made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, seeing the two in connection One act of his reign urges the Scottish burghs to reform and support the teaching of music in Sang Sculis [78]\n\n\nAccession in England\nFrom 1601, in the last years of Elizabeth's life, certain English politicians—notably her chief minister Robert Cecil [f]—maintained a secret correspondence with James to prepare in advance for a smooth succession [86] With the queen clearly dying, Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne in March 1603 Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March, and James was proclaimed king in London later the same day [87] [88]\n\n\nEarly reign in England\nJames survived two conspiracies in the first year of his reign, despite the smoothness of the succession and the warmth of his welcome: the Bye Plot and Main Plot, which led to the arrest of Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham and Walter Raleigh, among others [96] Those hoping for a change in government from James were disappointed at first when he kept Elizabeth's Privy Councillors in office, as secretly planned with Cecil, [96] but James soon added long-time supporter Henry Howard and his nephew Thomas Howard to the Privy Council, as well as five Scottish nobles [96] [g]\n\n\nGunpowder Plot\nA dissident Catholic, Guy Fawkes, was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings on the night of 4–5 November 1605, the eve of the state opening of the second session of James's first English Parliament Fawkes was guarding a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which he intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, \"not only .. of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general\" [106] The sensational discovery of the \"Gunpowder Plot\", as it quickly became known, aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons The Earl of Salisbury exploited this to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than any but one granted to Elizabeth [107] Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed [108]\n\n\nKing and Parliament\nThe co-operation between monarch and Parliament following the Gunpowder Plot was atypical Instead, it was the previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides for the rest of the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity [109] On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies \"I will not thank where I feel no thanks due\", he had remarked in his closing speech \".. I am not of such a stock as to praise fools .. You see how many things you did not well .. I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come\" [110]\n\n\nSpanish match\nAnother potential source of income was the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain [115] The policy of the Spanish match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war [116] Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade [117]\n\n\nKing and Church\nAfter the Gunpowder Plot, James sanctioned harsh measures to control English Catholics In May 1606, Parliament passed the Popish Recusants Act, which could require any subject to take an Oath of Allegiance denying the pope's authority over the king [133] James was conciliatory towards Catholics who took the Oath of Allegiance, [134] and tolerated crypto-Catholicism even at court [i] Henry Howard, for example, was a crypto-Catholic, received back into the Catholic Church in his final months [135] On ascending the English throne, James suspected that he might need the support of Catholics in England, so he assured Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, a prominent sympathiser of the old religion, that he would not persecute \"any that will be quiet and give but an outward obedience to the law\" [136]\n\n\nPersonal relationships\nThroughout his life James had close relationships with male courtiers, which has caused debate among historians about their exact nature [146] In Scotland Anne Murray was known as the king's mistress [147] After his accession in England, his peaceful and scholarly attitude contrasted strikingly with the bellicose and flirtatious behaviour of Elizabeth, [146] as indicated by the contemporary epigram Rex fuit Elizabeth, nunc est regina Iacobus (Elizabeth was King, now James is Queen) [148]\n\n\nHealth and death\nIn his later years, James suffered increasingly from arthritis, gout and kidney stones [53] [172] He also lost his teeth and drank heavily [53] [173] The king was often seriously ill during the last year of his life, leaving him an increasingly peripheral figure, rarely able to visit London, while Buckingham consolidated his control of Charles to ensure his own future [p] One theory is that James suffered from porphyria, a disease of which his descendant George III exhibited some symptoms James described his urine to physician Théodore de Mayerne as being the \"dark red colour of Alicante wine\" [176] The theory is dismissed by some experts, particularly in James's case, because he had kidney stones which can lead to blood in the urine, colouring it red [177]\n\n\nLegacy\nJames was widely mourned For all his flaws, he had largely retained the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era \"As he lived in peace\", remarked the Earl of Kellie, \"so did he die in peace, and I pray God our king  [Charles I] may follow him\" [182] The Earl prayed in vain: once in power, King Charles I and the Duke of Buckingham sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure [183] James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; his later dependence on favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by Elizabeth I [184]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\nIn Scotland, James was \"James the sixth, King of Scotland\", until 1604 He was proclaimed \"James the first, King of England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith\" in London on 24 March 1603 [193] On 20 October 1604, James issued a proclamation at Westminster changing his style to \"King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c.\" [194] The style was not used on English statutes, but was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, treaties, and in Scotland [195] James styled himself \"King of France\", in line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1801, although he did not actually rule France.\n\n\nTitles and styles\nIn Scotland, James was \"James the sixth, King of Scotland\", until 1604 He was proclaimed \"James the first, King of England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith\" in London on 24 March 1603 [193] On 20 October 1604, James issued a proclamation at Westminster changing his style to \"King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c.\" [194] The style was not used on English statutes, but was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, treaties, and in Scotland [195] James styled himself \"King of France\", in line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1801, although he did not actually rule France.\n\n\nArms\nAs King of Scotland, James bore the ancient royal arms of Scotland: Or, a lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory counter-flory Gules The arms were supported by two unicorns Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a coronet Or composed of crosses patée and fleurs de lys a chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or The crest was a lion sejant affrontée Gules, imperially crowned Or, holding in the dexter paw a sword and in the sinister paw a sceptre both erect and Proper [196]\n\n\nIssue\nJames's queen, Anne of Denmark, gave birth to seven children who survived beyond birth, of whom three reached adulthood: [199]\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nList of writings\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "2021_Pacific_hurricane_season", "content": "\nSeasonal forecasts\nForecasts include weekly and monthly changes in important factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average hurricane season in the Eastern and Central Pacific between 1991 and 2020 contained approximately 15 tropical storms, 8 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes The NOAA generally classifies a season as above average, average, or below average based on the cumulative ACE index, but occasionally the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is also considered Factors they expected to reduce activity were near- or below-average sea surface temperatures across the eastern Pacific and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation remaining in the neutral phase, with the possibility of a La Niña developing [7]\n\n\nSeasonal summary\nThe 2021 Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 in the East Pacific and on June 1 in the Central Pacific [8] Overall activity included 19 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes The total of named storms was above the 1991–2020 average, while the number of hurricanes was average, and the sum of major hurricanes was below average [9] The official start date was preceded by the formation of Tropical Storm Andres, the earliest named storm on record in the East Pacific [10] It was accompanied by Tropical Storm Blanca later in May [11] The following month included the formations of tropical storms Carlos and Dolores, in addition to Hurricane Enrique While Carlos remained away from land, Dolores made landfall on the Mexico coastline and Enrique delivered impacts across southwestern sections of the country while it passed just offshore [12] Above-average seasonal activity continued into July with the development of hurricanes Felicia and Hilda, Tropical Storm Guillermo, and Tropical Depression Nine-E; none of these cyclones impacted land [13] In August, Hurricane Nora made landfall along the west-central coastline of Mexico Its formation was preceded by Hurricane Linda and tropical storms Ignacio, Kevin, and Marty, which did not impact land [14] September marked a stark turn around to the activity of the previous months, as it only featured Olaf, which struck San José del Cabo as a Category 2 hurricane [15] Two hurricanes – Pamela and Rick – moved ashore the Mexico coastline in October [16] An additional two storms, Terry and Sandra, developed in November, the fourth consecutive November with at least one named storm Furthermore, those cyclones existed simultaneously, the first occurrence in the East Pacific during November on record The Accumulated Cyclone Energy index for the 2021 Pacific hurricane season as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the National Hurricane Center was approximately 94 units, [nb 4] [17] about 30 percent below average [9]\n\n\nSystems\nIn early May, the passage of a convectively-coupled kelvin wave (CCKW) enhanced the eastern Pacific monsoon trough, leading to an area of disturbed weather This disturbance interacted with a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event, which led to the formation of an ill-defined low-pressure area  Despite a marginal environment of wind shear and dry air, the system slowly organized and developed into a tropical depression around 06:00 UTC on May 9 Six hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Andres, becoming the earliest tropical storm on record in the East Pacific basin Andres maintained peak winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) as it curved north-northwest, and the compounded effects of colder waters and drier air atop moderate wind shear instead caused the system to begin weakening All associated convective activity dissipated by 06:00 UTC on May 11, when Andres was downgraded to a remnant area of low pressure The low curved west on May 12 and dissipated later that day [10]\n\n\nTropical Storm Andres\nIn early May, the passage of a convectively-coupled kelvin wave (CCKW) enhanced the eastern Pacific monsoon trough, leading to an area of disturbed weather This disturbance interacted with a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event, which led to the formation of an ill-defined low-pressure area  Despite a marginal environment of wind shear and dry air, the system slowly organized and developed into a tropical depression around 06:00 UTC on May 9 Six hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Andres, becoming the earliest tropical storm on record in the East Pacific basin Andres maintained peak winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) as it curved north-northwest, and the compounded effects of colder waters and drier air atop moderate wind shear instead caused the system to begin weakening All associated convective activity dissipated by 06:00 UTC on May 11, when Andres was downgraded to a remnant area of low pressure The low curved west on May 12 and dissipated later that day [10]\n\n\nTropical Storm Blanca\nBlanca originated from a tropical wave that crossed Central America on May 27 Shower and thunderstorm activity increased ahead of the wave axis, followed by the formation of a low-pressure area After further organization, the developed into a tropical depression around 18:00 UTC on May 30 It intensified into Tropical Storm Blanca around 12:00 UTC the next day Favorable environmental conditions allowed the cyclone to intensify, and it attained peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on June 1 when prominent rainbands wrapped into the center Thereafter, an upper-level trough off the southwestern United States increased shear over Blanca and injected dry air into the core, resulting in a weakening trend The storm's low-level circulation became separated from convection, and it degenerated to a remnant low by 00:00 UTC on June 4 The remnants of Blanca, which were previously tracking west-northwest, curved toward the west before dissipating later the next day [24]\n\n\nTropical Storm Carlos\nA trough developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June 1 It moved west across the eastern Pacific for several days but failed to develop into a tropical cyclone on several occasions, either because it lacked a coherent circulation or because it lacked sustained convection A burst of thunderstorms resulted in the formation of a well-defined center on June 12, and the system steadily organized over ensuing hours, finally resulting in the formation of a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC that day Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos to the southwest of Baja California Sur The surrounding environment was initially favorable for development and allowed the system to reach peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) as it curves west-southwest However, increasing dry air around the storm caused Carlos to gradually lose its convection, which ultimately resulted in its degradation to a remnant low by 12:00 UTC on June 16 The remnant system was reabsorbed into the ITCZ the following day [25]\n\n\nTropical Storm Dolores\nA broad cyclonic gyre over Central America, spawned from the interaction of the monsoon trough and a tropical wave, led to the formation of an area of low pressure south of Mexico on June 16 The low gradually organized and became a tropical depression around 18:00 UTC on June 17 while located about 195 mi (315 km) south-southwest of Acapulco The depression became Tropical Storm Dolores within six hours Ridging over Mexico shifted east as Dolores developed, causing the cyclone to curve to the north-northwest A favorable environment facilitated its development, and the storm reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) as it made landfall near San Juan de Alima, Michoacán, around 15:00 UTC on June 19 It harbored a well-defined eyewall at the time, and it is possible that Dolores temporarily surpassed tropical storm intensity Once inland, though, the system quickly weakened over the high terrain of southwestern Mexico, dissipating around 06:00 UTC on June 20 [26]\n\n\nHurricane Enrique\nA tropical wave left Africa on June 14 and crossed Central America a week later The system coalesced as it moved south of Mexico, becoming Tropical Storm Enrique by 12:00 UTC on June 25 since the incipient system was already producing gale-force winds at the time of development Moderate wind shear initially inhibited the cyclone, but these unfavorable winds slackened late on June 25, allowing the cyclone to begin a 24-hour period of rapid intensification Enrique intensified into a hurricane around 12:00 UTC on June 26 and reached peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) the next morning as it was characterized by a cloud-filled eye The storm curved north and then bent back northwest, passing within 45 miles (75 km) of the Mexico coastline Dry air off the mountainous terrain of that country, and later colder waters, soon caused Enrique to lose organization By 18:00 UTC on June 30, the increasingly disheveled circulation was absorbed into a broad trough east of Baja California [27]\n\n\nHurricane Felicia\nA disturbance of unclear origin was identified over Central America and the far eastern Pacific on July 9 The system progressed westward over the open ocean during the following days, developing into a tropical depression around 00:00 UTC on July 14 and becoming Tropical Storm Felicia six hours later Felicia immediately underwent rapid intensification, becoming a hurricane by 06:00 UTC on July 15 and a major hurricane 24 hours later Early on July 17, the system attained peak winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) [33] At that time, Felicia displayed a warm eye encapsulated by a ring of −70 °C (−94 °F) convection and little additional rainbands outside the eyewall, a signature sign of an annular tropical cyclone [34] It was also a very small storm, with hurricane-force winds extending only 15 miles (25 km) from the center After a brief westward turn, Felicia resumed a west-northwestward motion into much more hostile environmental conditions on July 18 The cyclone rapidly weakened and degenerated to a remnant low by 18:00 UTC on July 20 while located well east of Hawaii Low-level wind flow steered the remnant low of Felicia to the west-southwest, and it opened into a trough two days later [33]\n\n\nTropical Storm Guillermo\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 6 and emerged into the eastern Pacific basin a week later, where the background environment already favored cyclonic spin Consequently, a disturbance spawned along the wave axis developed into a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on July 17 and further into Tropical Storm Guillermo within twelve hours A potent ridge pushed the cyclone west-northwest, while a favorable combination of low wind shear and very warm ocean temperatures allowed it to intensify Guillermo reached peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on July 18 despite a slightly less organized satellite appearance Around this time, the storm produced tropical storm-force gusts on Socorro and Clarion islands After its peak, Guillermo encountered cooler waters and higher wind shear, which ultimately caused it to degenerate to a remnant low by 00:00 UTC on July 20 The low moved faster to the west-southwest before it was absorbed by a trough a day later far away from land [35]\n\n\nHurricane Hilda\nOn July 24, a disturbance formed near south of Gulf of Tehuantepec, which was moving parallel offshore of southern Mexico [36] As it moved farther from the coast of Mexico, the disturbance gradually became organized, and on July 28, a low pressure area formed, [37] as satellite imagery showed that the associated shower activity was showing signs of organization [38] The low-pressure area further organized, with a pair of ASCAT passes showing that the low-pressure area had strengthened significantly and was producing tropical storm-force winds, with the circulation looking well-defined on satellite imagery On July 30, it was designated as a tropical storm [39] Hilda intensified to a high-end tropical storm a day later as a central dense overcast developed [40] Later, Hilda further intensified to a hurricane as a short-lived eye appeared in its central dense overcast [41] Hilda held a similar appearance the next day, with its center located north of its central dense overcast [42] Hilda briefly developed a closed mid-level eye the next day, though the low-level and mid-level centers were not stacked due to wind shear [43] However, it became less organized later that day, with a less distinct eye and an incomplete eyewall [44] By the next day, Hilda was downgraded to a high-end tropical storm since the eyewall was no longer well-defined, while convection continued to pulse in the southern semicircle [45] Deep convection continued to wane due to shear, cooler waters, and more stable air [46] By August 5, Hilda weakened into a tropical depression after a rapid weakening of convection near the center However, convection resumed pulsing later [47] On August 6, at 03:00 UTC, Hilda became a post-tropical cyclone, as it became devoid of deep convection due to sub-23 °C (73 °F) sea-surface temperatures [48] [49]\n\n\nTropical Storm Jimena\nOn July 26, the NHC noted a disturbance located about 700 miles (1,125 km) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California The system moved parallel to another disturbance which later became Hurricane Hilda [50] By 21:00 UTC on July 30, the disturbance attained a well-defined center of circulation with sufficient organized convection and was classified as a tropical depression, bearing the designation Nine-E [51] The depression was initially forecast to become a tropical storm, but failed to do so due to dry air and wind shear caused by nearby Hurricane Hilda Early on August 1, the system degenerated into a remnant low [52] Even though Nine-E was a tropical low, the NHC still monitored the system for further development [53] On August 4, it re-intensified into a tropical depression again while maintaining two rainbands in a slightly elongated circulation [54] On the next day, at 09:00 UTC, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, with the NHC naming it as Jimena, as the storm's deep convection had increased near the low-level center and based on satellite imagery, the storm was producing tropical storm force winds [55] The convection later diminished on August 6, as it moved over cooler sea-surface temperatures and encountering high wind shear and dry airmass However, despite all this, Jimena managed its intensity, as it continued to produce tropical storm force winds, based on ASCAT data [56] A deep convective mass also continued to persist over the center of Jimena [57] At 21:00 UTC, the NHC issued its last advisory, downgrading the system to a tropical depression as it entered the CPHC's area of responsibility Its deep convection weakened significantly as it moved over cool sea surface temperatures causing Jimena to weaken [58] The CPHC later issued its only bulletin for Jimena at 03:00 UTC the next day, stating that Jimena had become a post-tropical cyclone as its deep convection had collapsed completely [59]\n\n\nTropical Storm Ignacio\nA parade of tropical waves entered the eastern Pacific in late July By 12:00 UTC on August 1, one wave spawned a disturbance that had gained sufficient organization to be designated a tropical depression Moderately wind shear inhibited the newly formed system, and though it intensified into Tropical Storm Ignacio a day later, the system failed to organize beyond that strength as its low-level circulation became separated from associated convective activity Around this time, the system produced tropical storm-force gusts on Socorro Island Later on August 2, Ignacio began to succumb to increasingly dry air and cooler waters It degenerated to a remnant low around 00:00 UTC on August 4, which moved erratically until it dissipated southwest of Baja California twelve hours later [60]\n\n\nTropical Storm Kevin\nA tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific on August 1, and the resultant disturbance organized into a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC on August 7 The newly formed cyclone swiftly intensified amid very high mid-level moisture and ocean temperatures, becoming Tropical Storm Kevin six hours later and reaching peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) on August 8 Wind shear abruptly increased later that day, confining the storm's convection into the western semicircle Kevin passed near Clarion Island on August 10 as it moved west then west-northwest, producing tropical storm-force gusts there By 12:00 UTC on August 12, all associated convection dissipated, and the system degenerated to a remnant low The low curved northwest and dissipated west of Baja California Sur on August 15 [61]\n\n\nHurricane Linda\nA tropical wave moved into the eastern Pacific on August 6, spawning an area of disturbed weather that subsequently became a tropical depression around 06:00 UTC on August 10 It moved generally westward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Linda six hours later and organizing further beyond that point, but temporarily succumbing to some dry air and wind shear As those factors subsided, Linda strengthened into a hurricane on August 12 and soon began rapidly intensifying over warm ocean waters, a process that culminated in it becoming the season's second and final major hurricane by 18:00 UTC on August 13 The next day, Linda peaked as a Category 4 cyclone with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) Between August 14–15, the storm underwent an eyewall replacement cycle Much like Hurricane Felicia, Linda soon acquired characteristics of an annular hurricane, with a 45 mi (75 km) wide eye surrounded by deep, symmetric convection and little additional banding The hurricane fluctuated in intensity over the next few days as it moved over varying ocean temperatures and through drier air Late on August 18, Linda progressed over ocean waters cooler than 26 °C (79 °F), which led to rapid weakening The system ultimately degenerated to a gale-force remnant low by 18:00 UTC on August 19 It later crossed into the Central Pacific basin [62]\n\n\nTropical Storm Marty\nThe Atlantic's Hurricane Grace struck mainland Mexico as a Category 3 hurricane on August 21 Although that storm's low-level center dissipated over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, its mid-level circulation emerged into the eastern Pacific and soon became encompassed by deep convection That thunderstorm activity spawned a new surface center separate from Grace's previous one, and further organization of the disturbance led to the formation of Tropical Storm Marty by 00:00 UTC on August 23 The newly christened tropical storm reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) early on August 23, but it began to weaken shortly thereafter as wind shear increased Marty moved west as it encountered an increasingly hostile environment of dry air and cooler waters, resulting its degeneration to a remnant low by 06:00 UTC on August 24 Three days later, it dissipated into a trough well to the west-southwest of Baja California Sur [64]\n\n\nHurricane Nora\nOn August 19, an area of disturbed weather formed west of the southern Mexico coast, which was producing disorganized thunder storms [65] A day later, the system became better defined and signs of the organization of showers and thunderclouds were also noted [66] On August 25, at 11:00 UTC the system developed a well-defined circulation as a scatterometer pass showed that it was producing near tropical storm-force winds Thus, the NHC designated the system as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E [67] A day later at 17:00 UTC, Fourteen-E intensified into a tropical storm, with the NHC naming it as Nora as its deep convection had organized significantly along with improved curvature of its bands [68] On August 28, at 11:00 UTC, Nora intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, as its inner core structure became further defined with the formation of a low-level eyewall [69] Nora made landfall on Jalisco, after which it skirted the coasts of Nayarit and Sinaloa as a weakening storm and rapidly dissipated on August 30 as it moved further inland It brought considerable damage to Mexico, killing two people and leaving six missing due to a landslide in Cabo Corrientes [70] [71] It had also caused flooding and mudslides The damage caused by the passage through Nora to the country reached 200 million pesos (US$10 million) [72] Nora's remnants caused heavy rain in Arizona, [73] Colorado, and Utah [74]\n\n\nHurricane Olaf\nA tropical wave moved off Africa on August 22 It fractured twice over subsequent days, with portions of the original wave axis spawning tropical storms Kate and Mindy in the Atlantic The southern piece of the wave continued into the East Pacific on September 2, where it led to the formation of a new tropical depression around 18:00 UTC on September 7 about 230 mi (370 km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima The system drifted toward the northwest in weak steering currents, while favorable environmental parameters allowed it to intensify The depression became Tropical Storm Olaf around 12:00 UTC on September 8, and Olaf became a hurricane 24 hours later The cyclone's eye and overall presentation continued to improve into September 10, and Olaf reached its peak as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) at 02:50 UTC that day It concurrently made landfall near San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur The storm only slowly weakened over land, but this process accelerated as it continued into stable air offshore It curved west and degenerated to a remnant low around 06:00 UTC on September 11 The low continued in that direction for another day before dissipating [75]\n\n\nHurricane Pamela\nA tropical wave emerged into the eastern Pacific on October 8, and it swiftly organized into a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC on October 10 The system moved west-northwest, tracking parallel to the Mexico coastline initially after formation, and intensified into Tropical Storm Pamela six hours later [76] Throughout Pamela's duration, the NHC highlighted the expectation of a potentially major hurricane rapidly intensifying up to the Mexico coastline [77] Despite these projections, the storm suffered first from moderate northerly wind shear and later from dry air intrusions, which caused the storm to fluctuate in intensity over the coming days It became a hurricane around 06:00 UTC on October 12, weakened thereafter, and regained hurricane strength early the next day Pamela maintained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) as it recurved northeast ahead of a broad upper-level trough, and it made landfall at that intensity just north of Mazatlán, Sinaloa, at 12:30 UTC on October 13 Topographical and environmental effects caused Pamela to rapidly dissipate shortly before 00:00 UTC on October 14 over northern Mexico [76]\n\n\nHurricane Rick\nA collection of convection formed over Colombia, Panama, and adjacent waters of the Caribbean and East Pacific on October 16 The disturbance moved west without much change in organization until it developed into a tropical depression early on October 22 The system strengthened into Tropical Storm Rick within six hours of formation and continued to intensify amid very favorable environmental conditions as it moved generally north-northwest Rick became a hurricane early on October 23, around which time the system developed a pinhole eye in microwave imagery After reaching winds of 90 mph (150 km/h), the system abruptly weakened as its inner core structure eroded However, the cyclone soon developed a large eye, and it reached a peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h) early on October 25 Rick maintained these winds as it made landfall in La Unión de Isidoro Montes de Oca, Guerrero, around 11:00 UTC The storm weakened rapidly once inland and dissipated before 00:00 UTC on October 26 [83]\n\n\nTropical Storm Terry\nDuring the morning of November 1, a low pressure system formed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, just north of Panama [84] The wave crossed Costa Rica and emerged into the eastern Pacific on November 3 [85] Convection swiftly organized as the system gradually became better defined that day, and the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E at 15:00 UTC on November 4 [86] [87] However, dry air (some of which came from a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event) entrained into the storm, keeping it weak and disorganized [88] The system remained disorganized while moving westward for the next few days, before organizing into Tropical Storm Terry at 21:00 UTC on November 7 [89] However, Terry weakened to a tropical depression at 15:00 UTC on November 8 as it became less organized [90] Terry's circulation became better defined later that day, though its convection remained poorly organized At 06:00 UTC on November 10, the depression opened up into a trough of low pressure [91]\n\n\nTropical Storm Sandra\nAt 19:00 UTC on November 1, the NHC began monitoring a disturbance that was expected to develop into an area of low pressure several miles south of the southwestern coast of Mexico [95] The system organized further by 01:00 UTC on November 3, [96] and further development prompted the NHC to begin issuing advisories on Tropical Depression Nineteen-E at 15:00 UTC on November 7 [97] [98] At 21:00 UTC on November 7, the depression was upgraded into a tropical storm based on scatterometer data, despite the storm's appearance degrading, and the NHC assigned the storm the name Sandra [99] However, Sandra weakened into a tropical depression 24 hours later, after scatterometer data failed to find tropical storm-force winds [100] At 21:00 UTC on November 9, Sandra degenerated into a remnant low, after the storm's surface circulation was found to have opened up into a trough of low pressure [101]\n\n\nOther system\nThe precursor to Tropical Storm Omais would develop in the Central Pacific Ocean, being first noted by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center on August 6 The storm would later cross into the Western Pacific, in which it would no longer be tracked [102]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Pacific Ocean east of 140°W during 2021 [103] This is the same list used in the 2015 season, with the exception of the name Pamela, which replaced Patricia [104] The name Pamela was used for the first time this year No names were retired following the season, so this list will be used again for the 2027 season.\n\n\nSeason effects\nThis is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2021 Pacific

For the 2021 season, factors that were expected to reduce activity included near- or below-average sea surface temperatures across the eastern Pacific and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation remaining in the neutral phase, with the possibility of a La Niña developing.\n\n**Seasonal summary**\n\nThe 2021 Pacific hurricane season included 19 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. The total of named storms was above the 1991–2020 average, while the number of hurricanes was average, and the sum of major hurricanes was below average. The official start date was preceded by the formation of Tropical Storm Andres, the earliest named storm on record in the East Pacific. It was accompanied by Tropical Storm Blanca later in May. The following month included the formations of tropical storms Carlos and Dolores, in addition to Hurricane Enrique, as well as Hurricane Felicia, Tropical Storm Guillermo, and Tropical Depression Nine-E; none of these cyclones impacted land.\n\n**Tropical Storm Andres**\n\nTropical Storm Andres formed on May 9 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a tropical wave that crossed Central America and enhanced the eastern Pacific monsoon trough. Despite a marginal environment of wind shear and dry air, the system slowly organized and developed into a tropical depression around 06:00 UTC on May 9. Six hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Andres, becoming the earliest tropical storm on record in the East Pacific basin. Andres maintained peak winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) as it curved north-northwest, and the compounded effects of colder waters and drier air atop moderate wind shear instead caused the system to begin weakening. All associated convective activity dissipated by 06:00 UTC on May 11, when Andres was downgraded to a remnant area of low pressure.\n\n**Tropical Storm Blanca**\n\nTropical Storm Blanca formed on May 30 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a tropical wave that crossed Central America and enhanced the eastern Pacific monsoon trough. Shower and thunderstorm activity increased ahead of the wave axis, followed by the formation of a low-pressure area. After further organization, the developed into a tropical depression around 18:00 UTC on May 30. It intensified into Tropical Storm Blanca around 12:00 UTC the next day. Favorable environmental conditions allowed the cyclone to intensify, and it attained peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on June 1 when prominent rainbands wrapped into the center. Thereafter, an upper-level trough off the southwestern United States increased shear over Blanca and injected dry air into the core, resulting in a weakening trend. The storm's low-level circulation became separated from convection, and it degenerated to a remnant low by 00:00 UTC on June 4.\n\n**Tropical Storm Carlos**\n\nTropical Storm Carlos formed on June 12 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a trough within the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June 1. It moved west across the eastern Pacific for several days but failed to develop into a tropical cyclone on several occasions, either because it lacked a coherent circulation or because it lacked sustained convection. A burst of thunderstorms resulted in the formation of a well-defined center on June 12, and the system steadily organized over ensuing hours, finally resulting in the formation of a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC that day. Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos to the southwest of Baja California Sur. The surrounding environment was initially favorable for development and allowed the system to reach peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) as it curved west-southwest. However, increasing dry air around the storm caused Carlos to gradually lose its convection, which ultimately resulted in its degradation to a remnant low by 12:00 UTC on June 16.\n\n**Tropical Storm Dolores**\n\nTropical Storm Dolores formed on June 17 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a broad cyclonic gyre over Central America, spawned from the interaction of the monsoon trough and a tropical wave. The low gradually organized and became a tropical depression around 18:00 UTC on June 17 while located about 195 mi (315 km) south-southwest of Acapulco. The depression became Tropical Storm Dolores within six hours. Ridging over Mexico shifted east as Dolores developed, causing the cyclone to curve to the north-northwest. A favorable environment facilitated its development, and the storm reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) as it made landfall near San Juan de Alima, Michoacán, around 15:00 UTC on June 19. It harbored a well-defined eyewall at the time, and it is possible that Dolores temporarily surpassed tropical storm intensity. Once inland, though, the system quickly weakened over the high terrain of southwestern Mexico, dissipating around 06:00 UTC on June 20.\n\n**Hurricane Enrique**\n\nHurricane Enrique formed on June 25 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a tropical wave that left Africa on June 14 and crossed Central America a week later. The system coalesced as it moved south of Mexico, becoming Tropical Storm Enrique by 12:00 UTC on June 25. Moderate wind shear initially inhibited the cyclone, but these unfavorable winds slackened late on June 25, allowing the cyclone to begin a 24-hour period of rapid intensification. Enrique intensified into a hurricane around 12:00 UTC on June 26 and reached peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) the next morning as it was characterized by a cloud-filled eye. The storm curved north and then bent back northwest, passing within 45 miles (75 km) of the Mexico coastline. Dry air off the mountainous terrain of Mexico, and later colder waters, soon caused Enrique to lose organization. By 18:00 UTC on June 30, the increasingly disheveled circulation was absorbed into a broad trough east of Baja California.\n\n**Hurricane Felicia**\n\nHurricane Felicia formed on July 14 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a disturbance of unclear origin near south of Gulf of Tehuantepec. The system progressed westward over the open ocean during the following days, developing into a tropical depression around 00:00 UTC on July 14 and becoming Tropical Storm Felicia six hours later. Felicia immediately underwent rapid intensification, becoming a hurricane by 06:00 UTC on July 15 and a major hurricane 24 hours later. Early on July 17, the system attained peak winds of 145 mph (235 km/h). At that time, Felicia displayed a warm eye encapsulated by a ring of −70 °C (−94 °F) convection and little additional rainbands outside the eyewall, a signature sign of an annular tropical cyclone. It was also a very small storm, with hurricane-force winds extending only 15 miles (25 km) from the center. After a brief westward turn, Felicia resumed a west-northwestward motion into much more hostile environmental conditions on July 18. The cyclone rapidly weakened and degenerated to a remnant low by 18:00 UTC on July 20 while located well east of Hawaii.\n\n**Tropical Storm Guillermo**\n\nTropical Storm Guillermo formed on July 17 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 6 and emerged into the eastern Pacific a week later. The background environment already favored cyclonic spin, and a disturbance spawned along the wave axis developed into a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on July 17 and further into Tropical Storm Guillermo within twelve hours. A potent ridge pushed the cyclone west-northwest, while a favorable combination of low wind shear and very warm ocean temperatures allowed it to intensify. Guillermo reached peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on July 18 despite a slightly less organized satellite appearance. Around this time, the storm produced tropical storm-force gusts on Socorro and Clarion islands. However, cooler waters and higher wind shear, which ultimately caused Guillermo to degenerate to a remnant low by 00:00 UTC on July 20.\n\n**Hurricane Hilda**\n\nHurricane Hilda formed on July 28 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a disturbance near south of Gulf of Tehuantepec. The system moved parallel offshore of southern Mexico, gradually becoming more organized as it moved farther from the coast. On July 30, the system was designated as a tropical storm, with the NHC noting that the storm's central dense overcast had developed a well-defined eye. Hilda intensified to a high-end tropical storm the next day, and later developed a short-lived eye in its central dense overcast. However, the storm's low-level and mid-level centers were not stacked due to wind shear. Despite this, Hilda briefly developed a closed mid-level eye the next day. However, the storm became less organized later that day, with a less distinct eye and an incomplete eyewall. By the next day, Hilda was downgraded to a high-end tropical storm since the eyewall was no longer well-defined, while convection continued to pulse in the southern semicircle. Deep convection continued to wane due to shear, cooler waters, and more stable air. By August 5, Hilda weakened into a tropical depression after a rapid weakening of convection near the center. However, convection resumed pulsing later. On August 6, at 03:00 UTC, Hilda became a post-tropical cyclone, as it became devoid of deep convection due to sub-23 °C (73 °F) sea-surface temperatures.\n\n**Tropical Storm Jimena**\n\nTropical Storm Jimena formed on August 4 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a disturbance that had gained sufficient organization to be designated a tropical depression. Moderately wind shear inhibited the newly formed system, and though it intensified into Tropical Storm Jimena a day later, the system failed to organize beyond that strength as its low-level circulation became separated from associated convective activity. However, the convection later diminished on August 6, as it moved over cooler sea-surface temperatures and encountered high wind shear and dry air mass. Despite this, Jimena managed its intensity, as it continued to produce tropical storm-force winds, based on ASCAT data. A deep convective mass also continued to persist over the center of Jimena. At 21:00 UTC, the NHC issued its last advisory, downgrading the system to a tropical depression as it entered the CPHC's area of responsibility. The CPHC later issued its only bulletin for Jimena at 03:00 UTC the next day, stating that Jimena had become a post-tropical cyclone as its deep convection had collapsed completely.\n\n**Tropical Storm Ignacio**\n\nTropical Storm Ignacio formed on August 1 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a parade of tropical waves that entered the eastern Pacific in late July. One wave spawned a disturbance that had gained sufficient organization to be designated a tropical depression. Moderately wind shear inhibited the newly formed system, and though it intensified into Tropical Storm Ignacio a day later, the system failed to organize beyond that strength as its low-level circulation became separated from associated convective activity. However, the system produced tropical storm-force gusts on Socorro Island. Later on August 2, Ignacio began to succumb to increasingly dry air and cooler waters. It degenerated to a remnant low around 00:00 UTC on August 4, which moved erratically until it dissipated southwest of Baja California twelve hours later.\n\n**Tropical Storm Kevin**\n\nTropical Storm Kevin formed on August 7 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a tropical wave that entered the eastern Pacific on August 1. The resultant disturbance organized into a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC on August 7 and further into Tropical Storm Kevin six hours later. Kevin swiftly intensified amid very high mid-level moisture and ocean temperatures, reaching peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) on August 8. Wind shear abruptly increased later that day, confining the storm's convection into the western semicircle. Kevin passed near Clarion Island on August 10 as it moved west then west-northwest, producing tropical storm-force gusts there. However, all associated convection dissipated by 12:00 UTC on August 12, and the system degenerated to a remnant low. The low curved northwest and dissipated west of Baja California Sur on August 15.\n\n**Hurricane Linda**\n\nHurricane Linda formed on August 10 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a tropical wave that moved into the eastern Pacific on August 6, spawning an area of disturbed weather. The system moved generally westward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Linda six hours later and organizing further beyond that point. However, the system temporarily succumbed to some dry air and wind shear. As those factors subsided, Linda strengthened into a hurricane on August 12 and soon began rapidly intensifying over warm ocean waters. The storm culminated in it becoming the season's second and final major hurricane by 18:00 UTC on August 13. Linda peaked as a Category 4 cyclone with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) the next day, between August 14-15. The storm underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, and later acquired characteristics of an annular hurricane, with a 45 mi (75 km) wide eye surrounded by deep, symmetric convection and little additional banding. However, the storm fluctuated in intensity over the next few days as it moved over varying ocean temperatures and through drier air. Late on August 18, Linda progressed over ocean waters cooler than 26 °C (79 °F), which led to rapid weakening. The system ultimately degenerated to a gale-force remnant low by 18:00 UTC on August 19, and later crossed into the Central Pacific basin.\n\n**Tropical Storm Marty**\n\nTropical Storm Marty formed on August 23 in the East Pacific. The system developed from the remnants of Hurricane Grace, which struck mainland Mexico as a Category 3 hurricane on August 21. The low-level center dissipated over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, but its mid-level circulation emerged into the eastern Pacific and soon became encompassed by deep convection. The thunderstorm activity spawned a new surface center separate from Grace's previous one, and further organization of the disturbance led to the formation of Tropical Storm Marty by 00:00 UTC on August 23. Marty reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) early on August 23, but it began to weaken shortly thereafter as wind shear increased. The system moved west as it encountered an increasingly hostile environment of dry air and cooler waters, resulting in its degeneration to a remnant low by 06:00 UTC on August 24. Three days later, it dissipated into a trough well to the west-southwest of Baja California Sur.\n\n**Hurricane Nora**\n\nHurricane Nora formed on August 25 in the East Pacific. The system developed from an area of disturbed weather that formed west of the southern Mexico coast on August 19. The system produced disorganized thunderstorms, but became better defined and noted signs of organization on August 20. A day later, the system developed a well-defined circulation, and scatterometer data showed that it was producing near tropical storm-force winds. Thus, the NHC designated the system as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E, later naming it Nora. Nora intensified into a tropical storm on August 27, and further into a hurricane the next day. The system made landfall on Jalisco, and skirted the coasts of Nayarit and Sinaloa as a weakening storm. Nora rapidly dissipated on August 30 as it moved further inland, causing considerable damage to Mexico, killing two people and leaving six missing due to a landslide in Cabo Corrientes. The damage caused by the passage through Nora to the country reached 200 million pesos (US$10 million). Nora's remnants caused heavy rain in Arizona, Colorado, and Utah.\n\n**Hurricane Olaf**\n\nHurricane Olaf formed on September 7 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a tropical wave that moved off Africa on August 22. The wave fractured twice over subsequent days, with portions of the original wave axis spawning tropical storms Kate and Mindy in the Atlantic. The southern piece of the wave continued into the East Pacific, where it led to the formation of a new tropical depression around 18:00 UTC on September 7. The system drifted toward the northwest in weak steering currents, while favorable environmental parameters allowed it to intensify. The depression became Tropical Storm Olaf around 12:00 UTC on September 8, and Olaf became a hurricane 24 hours later. The cyclone's eye and overall presentation continued to improve into September 10, and Olaf reached its peak as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) at 02:50 UTC that day. It concurrently made landfall near San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur. The storm only slowly weakened over land, but this process accelerated as it continued into stable air offshore. Olaf curved west and degenerated to a remnant low around 06:00 UTC on September 11. The low continued in that direction for another day before dissipating.\n\n**Hurricane Pamela**\n\nHurricane Pamela formed on October 10 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a tropical wave that emerged into the eastern Pacific on October 8. The system swiftly organized into a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC on October 10, and further into Tropical Storm Pamela six hours later. Pamela moved west-northwest, tracking parallel to the Mexico coastline initially after formation. The NHC highlighted the expectation of a potentially major hurricane rapidly intensifying up to the Mexico coastline. Despite these projections, the storm suffered first from moderate northerly wind shear and later from dry air intrusions, which caused the storm to fluctuate in intensity over the coming days. Pamela became a hurricane around 06:00 UTC on October 12, weakened thereafter, and regained hurricane strength early the next day. Pamela maintained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) as it recurved northeast ahead of a broad upper-level trough, and it made landfall at that intensity just north of Mazatlán, Sinaloa, at 12:30 UTC on October 13. Topographical and environmental effects caused Pamela to rapidly dissipate shortly before 00:00 UTC on October 14 over northern Mexico.\n\n**Hurricane Rick**\n\nHurricane Rick formed on October 22 in the East Pacific. The system developed from a collection of convection that formed over Colombia, Panama, and adjacent waters of the Caribbean and East Pacific on October 16. The disturbance moved west without much change in organization until", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2021_Pacific_hurricane_season\" following this outline:\n\n\nSeasonal forecasts\nForecasts include weekly and monthly changes in important factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average hurricane season in the Eastern and Central Pacific between 1991 and 2020 contained approximately 15 tropical storms, 8 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes The NOAA generally classifies a season as above average, average, or below average based on the cumulative ACE index, but occasionally the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is also considered Factors they expected to reduce activity were near- or below-average sea surface temperatures across the eastern Pacific and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation remaining in the neutral phase, with the possibility of a La Niña developing [7]\n\n\nSeasonal summary\nThe 2021 Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 in the East Pacific and on June 1 in the Central Pacific [8] Overall activity included 19 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes The total of named storms was above the 1991–2020 average, while the number of hurricanes was average, and the sum of major hurricanes was below average [9] The official start date was preceded by the formation of Tropical Storm Andres, the earliest named storm on record in the East Pacific [10] It was accompanied by Tropical Storm Blanca later in May [11] The following month included the formations of tropical storms Carlos and Dolores, in addition to Hurricane Enrique While Carlos remained away from land, Dolores made landfall on the Mexico coastline and Enrique delivered impacts across southwestern sections of the country while it passed just offshore [12] Above-average seasonal activity continued into July with the development of hurricanes Felicia and Hilda, Tropical Storm Guillermo, and Tropical Depression Nine-E; none of these cyclones impacted land [13] In August, Hurricane Nora made landfall along the west-central coastline of Mexico Its formation was preceded by Hurricane Linda and tropical storms Ignacio, Kevin, and Marty, which did not impact land [14] September marked a stark turn around to the activity of the previous months, as it only featured Olaf, which struck San José del Cabo as a Category 2 hurricane [15] Two hurricanes – Pamela and Rick – moved ashore the Mexico coastline in October [16] An additional two storms, Terry and Sandra, developed in November, the fourth consecutive November with at least one named storm Furthermore, those cyclones existed simultaneously, the first occurrence in the East Pacific during November on record The Accumulated Cyclone Energy index for the 2021 Pacific hurricane season as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the National Hurricane Center was approximately 94 units, [nb 4] [17] about 30 percent below average [9]\n\n\nSystems\nIn early May, the passage of a convectively-coupled kelvin wave (CCKW) enhanced the eastern Pacific monsoon trough, leading to an area of disturbed weather This disturbance interacted with a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event, which led to the formation of an ill-defined low-pressure area  Despite a marginal environment of wind shear and dry air, the system slowly organized and developed into a tropical depression around 06:00 UTC on May 9 Six hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Andres, becoming the earliest tropical storm on record in the East Pacific basin Andres maintained peak winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) as it curved north-northwest, and the compounded effects of colder waters and drier air atop moderate wind shear instead caused the system to begin weakening All associated convective activity dissipated by 06:00 UTC on May 11, when Andres was downgraded to a remnant area of low pressure The low curved west on May 12 and dissipated later that day [10]\n\n\nTropical Storm Andres\nIn early May, the passage of a convectively-coupled kelvin wave (CCKW) enhanced the eastern Pacific monsoon trough, leading to an area of

west on May 12 and dissipated later that day [10]\n\n\nTropical Storm Blanca\nBlanca originated from a tropical wave that crossed Central America on May 27 Shower and thunderstorm activity increased ahead of the wave axis, followed by the formation of a low-pressure area After further organization, the developed into a tropical depression around 18:00 UTC on May 30 It intensified into Tropical Storm Blanca around 12:00 UTC the next day Favorable environmental conditions allowed the cyclone to intensify, and it attained peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on June 1 when prominent rainbands wrapped into the center Thereafter, an upper-level trough off the southwestern United States increased shear over Blanca and injected dry air into the core, resulting in a weakening trend The storm's low-level circulation became separated from convection, and it degenerated to a remnant low by 00:00 UTC on June 4 The remnants of Blanca, which were previously tracking west-northwest, curved toward the west before dissipating later the next day [24]\n\n\nTropical Storm Carlos\nA trough developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June 1 It moved west across the eastern Pacific for several days but failed to develop into a tropical cyclone on several occasions, either because it lacked a coherent circulation or because it lacked sustained convection A burst of thunderstorms resulted in the formation of a well-defined center on June 12, and the system steadily organized over ensuing hours, finally resulting in the formation of a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC that day Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos to the southwest of Baja California Sur The surrounding environment was initially favorable for development and allowed the system to reach peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) as it curves west-southwest However, increasing dry air around the storm caused Carlos to gradually lose its convection, which ultimately resulted in its degradation to a remnant low by 12:00 UTC on June 16 The remnant system was reabsorbed into the ITCZ the following day [25]\n\n\nTropical Storm Dolores\nA broad cyclonic gyre over Central America, spawned from the interaction of the monsoon trough and a tropical wave, led to the formation of an area of low pressure south of Mexico on June 16 The low gradually organized and became a tropical depression around 18:00 UTC on June 17 while located about 195 mi (315 km) south-southwest of Acapulco The depression became Tropical Storm Dolores within six hours Ridging over Mexico shifted east as Dolores developed, causing the cyclone to curve to the north-northwest A favorable environment facilitated its development, and the storm reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) as it made landfall near San Juan de Alima, Michoacán, around 15:00 UTC on June 19 It harbored a well-defined eyewall at the time, and it is possible that Dolores temporarily surpassed tropical storm intensity Once inland, though, the system quickly weakened over the high terrain of southwestern Mexico, dissipating around 06:00 UTC on June 20 [26]\n\n\nHurricane Enrique\nA tropical wave left Africa on June 14 and crossed Central America a week later The system coalesced as it moved south of Mexico, becoming Tropical Storm Enrique by 12:00 UTC on June 25 since the incipient system was already producing gale-force winds at the time of development Moderate wind shear initially inhibited the cyclone, but these unfavorable winds slackened late on June 25, allowing the cyclone to begin a 24-hour period of rapid intensification Enrique intensified into a hurricane around 12:00 UTC on June 26 and reached peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) the next morning as it was characterized by a cloud-filled eye The storm curved north and then bent back northwest, passing within 45 miles (75 km) of the Mexico coastline Dry air off the mountainous terrain of that country, and later colder waters, soon caused Enrique to lose organization By 18:00 UTC on June 30, the increasingly disheveled circulation was absorbed into a broad trough east of Baja California [27]\n\n\nHurricane Felicia\nA disturbance of unclear origin was identified over Central America and the far eastern Pacific on July 9 The system progressed westward over the open ocean during the following days, developing into a tropical depression around 00:00 UTC on July 14 and becoming Tropical Storm Felicia six hours later Felicia immediately underwent rapid intensification, becoming a hurricane by 06:00 UTC on July 15 and a major hurricane 24 hours later Early on July 17, the system attained peak winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) [33] At that time, Felicia displayed a warm eye encapsulated by a ring of −70 °C (−94 °F) convection and little additional rainbands outside the eyewall, a signature sign of an annular tropical cyclone [34] It was also a very small storm, with hurricane-force winds extending only 15 miles (25 km) from the center After a brief westward turn, Felicia resumed a west-northwestward motion into much more hostile environmental conditions on July 18 The cyclone rapidly weakened and degenerated to a remnant low by 18:00 UTC on July 20 while located well east of Hawaii Low-level wind flow steered the remnant low of Felicia to the west-southwest, and it opened into a trough two days later [33]\n\n\nTropical Storm Guillermo\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 6 and emerged into the eastern Pacific basin a week later, where the background environment already favored cyclonic spin Consequently, a disturbance spawned along the wave axis developed into a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on July 17 and further into Tropical Storm Guillermo within twelve hours A potent ridge pushed the cyclone west-northwest, while a favorable combination of low wind shear and very warm ocean temperatures allowed it to intensify Guillermo reached peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on July 18 despite a slightly less organized satellite appearance Around this time, the storm produced tropical storm-force gusts on Socorro and Clarion islands After its peak, Guillermo encountered cooler waters and higher wind shear, which ultimately caused it to degenerate to a remnant low by 00:00 UTC on July 20 The low moved faster to the west-southwest before it was absorbed by a trough a day later far away from land [35]\n\n\nHurricane Hilda\nOn July 24, a disturbance formed near south of Gulf of Tehuantepec, which was moving parallel offshore of southern Mexico [36] As it moved farther from the coast of Mexico, the disturbance gradually became organized, and on July 28, a low pressure area formed, [37] as satellite imagery showed that the associated shower activity was showing signs of organization [38] The low-pressure area further organized, with a pair of ASCAT passes showing that the low-pressure area had strengthened significantly and was producing tropical storm-force winds, with the circulation looking well-defined on satellite imagery On July 30, it was designated as a tropical storm [39] Hilda intensified to a high-end tropical storm a day later as a central dense overcast developed [40] Later, Hilda further intensified to a hurricane as a short-lived eye appeared in its central dense overcast [41] Hilda held a similar appearance the next day, with its center located north of its central dense overcast [42] Hilda briefly developed a closed mid-level eye the next day, though the low-level and mid-level centers were not stacked due to wind shear [43] However, it became less organized later that day, with a less distinct eye and an incomplete eyewall [44] By the next day, Hilda was downgraded to a high-end tropical storm since the eyewall was no longer well-defined, while convection continued to pulse in the southern semicircle [45] Deep convection continued to wane due to shear, cooler waters, and more stable air [46] By August 5, Hilda weakened into a tropical depression after a rapid weakening of convection near the center However, convection resumed pulsing later [47] On August 6, at 03:00 UTC, Hilda became a post-tropical cyclone, as it became devoid of deep convection due to sub-23 °C (73 °F) sea-surface temperatures [48] [49]\n\n\nTropical Storm Jimena\nOn July 26, the NHC noted a disturbance located about 700 miles (1,125 km) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California The system moved parallel to another disturbance which later became Hurricane Hilda [50] By 21:00 UTC on July 30, the disturbance attained a well-defined center of circulation with sufficient organized convection and was classified as a tropical depression, bearing the designation Nine-E [51] The depression was initially forecast to become a tropical storm, but failed to do so due to dry air and wind shear caused by nearby Hurricane Hilda Early on August 1, the system degenerated into a remnant low [52] Even though Nine-E was a tropical low, the NHC still monitored the system for further development [53] On August 4, it re-intensified into a tropical depression again while maintaining two rainbands in a slightly elongated circulation [54] On the next day, at 09:00 UTC, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, with the NHC naming it as Jimena, as the storm's deep convection had increased near the low-level center and based on satellite imagery, the storm was producing tropical storm force winds [55] The convection later diminished on August 6, as it moved over cooler sea-surface temperatures and encountering high wind shear and dry airmass However, despite all this, Jimena managed its intensity, as it continued to produce tropical storm force winds, based on ASCAT data [56] A deep convective mass also continued to persist over the center of Jimena [57] At 21:00 UTC, the NHC issued its last advisory, downgrading the system to a tropical depression as it entered the CPHC's area of responsibility Its deep convection weakened significantly as it moved over cool sea surface temperatures causing Jimena to weaken [58] The CPHC later issued its only bulletin for Jimena at 03:00 UTC the next day, stating that Jimena had become a post-tropical cyclone as its deep convection had collapsed completely [59]\n\n\nTropical Storm Ignacio\nA parade of tropical waves entered the eastern Pacific in late July By 12:00 UTC on August 1, one wave spawned a disturbance that had gained sufficient organization to be designated a tropical depression Moderately wind shear inhibited the newly formed system, and though it intensified into Tropical Storm Ignacio a day later, the system failed to organize beyond that strength as its low-level circulation became separated from associated convective activity Around this time, the system produced tropical storm-force gusts on Socorro Island Later on August 2, Ignacio began to succumb to increasingly dry air and cooler waters It degenerated to a remnant low around 00:00 UTC on August 4, which moved erratically until it dissipated southwest of Baja California twelve hours later [60]\n\n\nTropical Storm Kevin\nA tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific on August 1, and the resultant disturbance organized into a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC on August 7 The newly formed cyclone swiftly intensified amid very high mid-level moisture and ocean temperatures, becoming Tropical Storm Kevin six hours later and reaching peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) on August 8 Wind shear abruptly increased later that day, confining the storm's convection into the western semicircle Kevin passed near Clarion Island on August 10 as it moved west then west-northwest, producing tropical storm-force gusts there By 12:00 UTC on August 12, all associated convection dissipated, and the system degenerated to a remnant low The low curved northwest and dissipated west of Baja California Sur on August 15 [61]\n\n\nHurricane Linda\nA tropical wave moved into the eastern Pacific on August 6, spawning an area of disturbed weather that subsequently became a tropical depression around 06:00 UTC on August 10 It moved generally westward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Linda six hours later and organizing further beyond that point, but temporarily succumbing to some dry air and wind shear As those factors subsided, Linda strengthened into a hurricane on August 12 and soon began rapidly intensifying over warm ocean waters, a process that culminated in it becoming the season's second and final major hurricane by 18:00 UTC on August 13 The next day, Linda peaked as a Category 4 cyclone with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) Between August 14–15, the storm underwent an eyewall replacement cycle Much like Hurricane Felicia, Linda soon acquired characteristics of an annular hurricane, with a 45 mi (75 km) wide eye surrounded by deep, symmetric convection and little additional banding The hurricane fluctuated in intensity over the next few days as it moved over varying ocean temperatures and through drier air Late on August 18, Linda progressed over ocean waters cooler than 26 °C (79 °F), which led to rapid weakening The system ultimately degenerated to a gale-force remnant low by 18:00 UTC on August 19 It later crossed into the Central Pacific basin [62]\n\n\nTropical Storm Marty\nThe Atlantic's Hurricane Grace struck mainland Mexico as a Category 3 hurricane on August 21 Although that storm's low-level center dissipated over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, its mid-level circulation emerged into the eastern Pacific and soon became encompassed by deep convection That thunderstorm activity spawned a new surface center separate from Grace's previous one, and further organization of the disturbance led to the formation of Tropical Storm Marty by 00:00 UTC on August 23 The newly christened tropical storm reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) early on August 23, but it began to weaken shortly thereafter as wind shear increased Marty moved west as it encountered an increasingly hostile environment of dry air and cooler waters, resulting its degeneration to a remnant low by 06:00 UTC on August 24 Three days later, it dissipated into a trough well to the west-southwest of Baja California Sur [64]\n\n\nHurricane Nora\nOn August 19, an area of disturbed weather formed west of the southern Mexico coast, which was producing disorganized thunder storms [65] A day later, the system became better defined and signs of the organization of showers and thunderclouds were also noted [66] On August 25, at 11:00 UTC the system developed a well-defined circulation as a scatterometer pass showed that it was producing near tropical storm-force winds Thus, the NHC designated the system as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E [67] A day later at 17:00 UTC, Fourteen-E intensified into a tropical storm, with the NHC naming it as Nora as its deep convection had organized significantly along with improved curvature of its bands [68] On August 28, at 11:00 UTC, Nora intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, as its inner core structure became further defined with the formation of a low-level eyewall [69] Nora made landfall on Jalisco, after which it skirted the coasts of Nayarit and Sinaloa as a weakening storm and rapidly dissipated on August 30 as it moved further inland It brought considerable damage to Mexico, killing two people and leaving six missing due to a landslide in Cabo Corrientes [70] [71] It had also caused flooding and mudslides The damage caused by the passage through Nora to the country reached 200 million pesos (US$10 million) [72] Nora's remnants caused heavy rain in Arizona, [73] Colorado, and Utah [74]\n\n\nHurricane Olaf\nA tropical wave moved off Africa on August 22 It fractured twice over subsequent days, with portions of the original wave axis spawning tropical storms Kate and Mindy in the Atlantic The southern piece of the wave continued into the East Pacific on September 2, where it led to the formation of a new tropical depression around 18:00 UTC on September 7 about 230 mi (370 km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima The system drifted toward the northwest in weak steering currents, while favorable environmental parameters allowed it to intensify The depression became Tropical Storm Olaf around 12:00 UTC on September 8, and Olaf became a hurricane 24 hours later The cyclone's eye and overall presentation continued to improve into September 10, and Olaf reached its peak as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) at 02:50 UTC that day It concurrently made landfall near San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur The storm only slowly weakened over land, but this process accelerated as it continued into stable air offshore It curved west and degenerated to a remnant low around 06:00 UTC on September 11 The low continued in that direction for another day before dissipating [75]\n\n\nHurricane Pamela\nA tropical wave emerged into the eastern Pacific on October 8, and it swiftly organized into a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC on October 10 The system moved west-northwest, tracking parallel to the Mexico coastline initially after formation, and intensified into Tropical Storm Pamela six hours later [76] Throughout Pamela's duration, the NHC highlighted the expectation of a potentially major hurricane rapidly intensifying up to the Mexico coastline [77] Despite these projections, the storm suffered first from moderate northerly wind shear and later from dry air intrusions, which caused the storm to fluctuate in intensity over the coming days It became a hurricane around 06:00 UTC on October 12, weakened thereafter, and regained hurricane strength early the next day Pamela maintained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) as it recurved northeast ahead of a broad upper-level trough, and it made landfall at that intensity just north of Mazatlán, Sinaloa, at 12:30 UTC on October 13 Topographical and environmental effects caused Pamela to rapidly dissipate shortly before 00:00 UTC on October 14 over northern Mexico [76]\n\n\nHurricane Rick\nA collection of convection formed over Colombia, Panama, and adjacent waters of the Caribbean and East Pacific on October 16 The disturbance moved west without much change in organization until it developed into a tropical depression early on October 22 The system strengthened into Tropical Storm Rick within six hours of formation and continued to intensify amid very favorable environmental conditions as it moved generally north-northwest Rick became a hurricane early on October 23, around which time the system developed a pinhole eye in microwave imagery After reaching winds of 90 mph (150 km/h), the system abruptly weakened as its inner core structure eroded However, the cyclone soon developed a large eye, and it reached a peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h) early on October 25 Rick maintained these winds as it made landfall in La Unión de Isidoro Montes de Oca, Guerrero, around 11:00 UTC The storm weakened rapidly once inland and dissipated before 00:00 UTC on October 26 [83]\n\n\nTropical Storm Terry\nDuring the morning of November 1, a low pressure system formed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, just north of Panama [84] The wave crossed Costa Rica and emerged into the eastern Pacific on November 3 [85] Convection swiftly organized as the system gradually became better defined that day, and the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E at 15:00 UTC on November 4 [86] [87] However, dry air (some of which came from a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event) entrained into the storm, keeping it weak and disorganized [88] The system remained disorganized while moving westward for the next few days, before organizing into Tropical Storm Terry at 21:00 UTC on November 7 [89] However, Terry weakened to a tropical depression at 15:00 UTC on November 8 as it became less organized [90] Terry's circulation became better defined later that day, though its convection remained poorly organized At 06:00 UTC on November 10, the depression opened up into a trough of low pressure [91]\n\n\nTropical Storm Sandra\nAt 19:00 UTC on November 1, the NHC began monitoring a disturbance that was expected to develop into an area of low pressure several miles south of the southwestern coast of Mexico [95] The system organized further by 01:00 UTC on November 3, [96] and further development prompted the NHC to begin issuing advisories on Tropical Depression Nineteen-E at 15:00 UTC on November 7 [97] [98] At 21:00 UTC on November 7, the depression was upgraded into a tropical storm based on scatterometer data, despite the storm's appearance degrading, and the NHC assigned the storm the name Sandra [99] However, Sandra weakened into a tropical depression 24 hours later, after scatterometer data failed to find tropical storm-force winds [100] At 21:00 UTC on November 9, Sandra degenerated into a remnant low, after the storm's surface circulation was found to have opened up into a trough of low pressure [101]\n\n\nOther system\nThe precursor to Tropical Storm Omais would develop in the Central Pacific Ocean, being first noted by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center on August 6 The storm would later cross into the Western Pacific, in which it would no longer be tracked [102]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Pacific Ocean east of 140°W during 2021 [103] This is the same list used in the 2015 season, with the exception of the name Pamela, which replaced Patricia [104] The name Pamela was used for the first time this year No names were retired following the season, so this list will be used again for the 2027 season.\n\n\nSeason effects\nThis is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2021 Pacific hurricane season It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2021 USD.\n\n\nSee

Elizabeth Ratliff's death\nElizabeth Ratliff, a friend of the Petersons, who died in Germany in 1985, had also been found dead at the foot of her staircase with injuries to the head Her death had been investigated by both the German police and U.S military police An autopsy at the time of her death concluded Ratliff died from an intra-cerebral hemorrhage secondary to the blood coagulation disorder Von Willebrand's disease, based on blood in her cerebrospinal fluid and reports that she had been suffering severe, persistent headaches in the weeks leading up to her death [citation needed] The coroner determined that the hemorrhage resulted in immediate death, followed by Ratliff falling down the stairs after collapsing The Petersons had dinner with Ratliff and her daughters, and Peterson had stayed and helped Ratliff put the children to bed before going home The children's nanny, Barbara, discovered the body when she arrived the next morning Peterson was the last known person to see her alive.\n\n\nVerdict\nOn October 10, 2003, after one of the longest trials in North Carolina history, a Durham County jury found Peterson guilty of the murder of Kathleen, and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole [12] Denial of parole requires premeditation Despite the jury accepting the murder as a \"spur-of-the-moment\" crime, they also found it was premeditated As one juror explained it, premeditated meant not only planning hours or days ahead but could also mean planning in the seconds before committing a spur-of-the-moment crime [citation needed] Peterson was housed at the Nash Correctional Institution near Rocky Mount until he was released on December 16, 2011 [13]\n\n\nAppeal\nPeterson's appeal was filed by his defense counsel, with Thomas Maher now serving as his court-appointed attorney, and was argued before the North Carolina Court of Appeals on April 18, 2006 On September 19, the Court of Appeals rejected Peterson's arguments that he did not get a fair trial because of repeated judicial mistakes [14] The Appeals' ruling said the evidence was fairly admitted The judges did find defects in a search warrant, but said they had no ill effect on the defense [15] [16] Because the ruling was not unanimous, under North Carolina law, Peterson had the right to appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court, which accepted the case An oral argument was heard on September 10, 2007 On November 9, 2007, the Court announced that it affirmed the decision of the appeals Absent a reconsideration of the ruling or the raising of a federal issue, Peterson had exhausted his appeals of the verdict.\n\n\nOwl theory\nIn late 2003, a new theory of Kathleen's death was raised: that she had been attacked by a barred owl outside, had fallen after rushing inside, and had been knocked unconscious after hitting her head on the first tread of the stairs [17] The owl theory was raised by Durham attorney T Lawrence Pollard, a neighbor of the Petersons who was not involved in the case but had been following the public details He approached the police suggesting an owl might have been responsible after viewing the autopsy photographs of Kathleen's head wounds [18]  Later, when reading the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) evidence list, he found a feather listed as found in Kathleen's hair (despite having previously been informed by the District Attorney's office that no feathers had been found during the investigation) [19]  The SBI crime lab report listed a microscopic feather and a wooden sliver from a tree limb entangled in a clump of hair that had been pulled out by the roots found clutched in Kathleen's left hand [20] [21] A re-examination of the hair in September 2008 had found another microscopic feather [22]\n\n\nRetrial hearing\nIn August 2010, following a series of newspaper articles critical of the SBI, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper led an investigation that resulted in the suspension of SBI analyst Duane Deaver, one of the principal witnesses against Peterson, after the report found his work among the worst done on scores of flawed criminal cases Pollard subsequently filed affidavits [a] to support a motion that Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson order the state Medical Examiner's Office to turn over all documentation related to Kathleen's autopsy to Peterson's attorneys However, Judge Hudson barred Pollard from filing further motions on behalf of Peterson because he did not represent him A new motion was filed in August 2010 by David Rudolf, one of Peterson's original attorneys, who acted pro bono in proceedings challenging the SBI testimony [21] [28] [29]\n\n\nAlford plea\nOn February 24, 2017, Peterson entered an Alford plea to the voluntary manslaughter of Kathleen, asserting his innocence but agreeing there was enough evidence to likely result in a guilty verdict [38] The judge sentenced him to a maximum of 86 months in prison, with credit for time previously served Because Peterson had already served more time than the sentence (98.5 months), he did not face additional prison time.\n\n\nMedia\nThe court case generated widespread interest, in part because of a televised documentary series variously named Soupçons (Suspicions), Death on the Staircase, and The Staircase, which detailed Peterson's legal and personal troubles Eight 45-minute episodes of the documentary were assembled from more than 600 hours of footage It was directed by French filmmaker Jean-Xavier de Lestrade and released by Maha Productions in October 2004 The documentary offers an intimate depiction of defense preparations for the trial It also examines the role and behavior of the press as it covered aspects of the case The

With a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.9 billion, Avatar is often proclaimed to be the highest-grossing film. However, such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. This article will examine the complexities of determining the highest-grossing film, including the impact of inflation, home video revenue, and television broadcast rights.\n\n## Highest-grossing films\n\nWith a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.9 billion, Avatar is often considered the highest-grossing film. However, it is essential to consider the impact of home video and television revenue on a film's overall earnings. In the case of Titanic, the film earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals, in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters. Considering home video income, both Avatar and Titanic have earned over $3 billion each. Television broadcast rights also substantially add to a film's earnings, with a film often earning the equivalent of 20-25% of its theatrical box office for two television runs, on top of pay-per-view revenues.\n\n## Highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation\n\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, the list of highest-grossing films unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation. However, not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars.\n\n## High-grossing films by year\n\nBox-office figures are reported in either gross revenue or distributor rentals, the latter being especially true of older films. Historically, the rental price averaged at 30-40% when the distributors owned the theater chains, equating to just over a third of the gross being paid to the distributor of the film. In the modern marketplace, rental fees can vary greatly, although the films from the major studios average out at 43%.\n\n## Timeline of highest-grossing films\n\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since The Birth of a Nation assumed the top spot in 1915. Both The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic. When it took over the top spot in 2019, Avengers: Endgame became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before Avatar reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n## Highest-grossing franchises and film series\n\nPrior to 2000, only seven film series had grossed over $1 billion at the box office: James Bond, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Rocky, Batman, Jurassic Park, and Star Trek. Since the turn of the century, that number has increased to over a hundred. This is partly due to inflation and market growth, but it is also due to Hollywood's adoption of the franchise model: films that have built-in brand recognition such as being based on a well-known literary source or an established character. The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDetermining the highest-grossing film is a complex task that requires considering various factors, including home video revenue, television broadcast rights, and inflation. While Avatar is often considered the highest-grossing film, the inclusion of home video income and television revenue paints a more comprehensive picture of a film's earnings. The adoption of the franchise model has led to an increase in the number of film series grossing over $1 billion at the box office, making it essential to consider the impact of this trend on the film industry as a whole.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"List_of_highest-grossing_films\" following this outline:\n\n\nHighest-grossing films\nWith a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.9 billion, Avatar is proclaimed to be the \"highest-grossing\" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals, [1] in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters While complete sales data are not available for Avatar, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America, [2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide [3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each Television broadcast rights also substantially add to a film's earnings and, as of 2010, a film often earned the equivalent of as much as 20–25% of its theatrical box office for two television runs, on top of pay-per-view revenues;

Hall in Princeton, New Jersey, and Trenton, New Jersey [3] In September 1774, the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia, followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\n\n\n18th century\nPrior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors met at

by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\n\n\n19th century\nThe Senate (north) wing was completed in 1800 The Senate and House shared quarters in the north wing until a temporary wooden pavilion was erected on the future site of the House wing which served for a few years for the Representatives to meet in, until the House of Representatives (south) wing was finally completed in 1811, with a covered wooden temporary walkway connecting the two wings with the Congressional chambers where the future center section with rotunda and dome would eventually be However, the House of Representatives moved early into their House wing in 1807 Though the Senate wing building was incomplete, the Capitol held its first session of the U.S Congress with both chambers in session on November 17, 1800 The National Legislature was moved to Washington prematurely, at the urging of President John Adams, in hopes of securing enough Southern votes in the Electoral College to be re-elected for a second term as president [31]\n\n\nCapitol dome\nThe 1850 expansion more than doubled the length of the United States Capitol; it dwarfed the original, timber-framed, copper-sheeted, low dome of 1818, designed by Charles Bulfinch which was no longer in proportion with the increased size of the building In 1855, the decision was made to tear it down and replace it with the \"wedding-cake style\" cast-iron dome that stands today Also designed by Thomas U Walter, the new dome would stand three times the height of the original dome and 100 feet (30 m) in diameter, yet had to be supported on the existing masonry piers.\n\n\n20th century\nIn 1904, the East Front of the Capitol building was rebuilt, following a design of the architects Carrère and Hastings, who designed the Russell Senate and Cannon House office buildings earlier that year [43]\n\n\n21st century\nOn June 20, 2000, ground was broken for the Capitol Visitor Center, which opened on December 2, 2008 [54] From 2001 through 2008, the East Front of the Capitol (site of most presidential inaugurations until Ronald Reagan began a new tradition in 1981) was the site of construction for this massive underground complex, designed to facilitate a more orderly entrance for visitors to the Capitol Prior to the center being built, visitors to the Capitol had to line up in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building or the Russell Senate Office Building The new underground facility provides a grand entrance hall, a visitors theater, room for exhibits, and dining and restroom facilities, in addition to space for building necessities such as a service tunnel [55]\n\n\nInterior\nThe Capitol building is marked by its central dome above a rotunda in the central section of the structure (which also includes the older original smaller center flanked by the two original (designed 1793, occupied 1800) smaller two wings (inner north and inner south) containing the two original smaller meeting chambers for the Senate and the House of Representatives (between 1800 and late 1850s) and then flanked by two further extended (newer) wings, one also for each chamber of the larger, more populous Congress: the new north wing is the Senate chamber and the new south wing is the House of Representatives chamber Above these newer chambers are galleries where visitors can watch the Senate and House of Representatives It is an example of neoclassical architecture.\n\n\nArt\nSince 1856, the Capitol has featured some the most prominent art in the United States, including Italian and Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi, whose murals are located in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol The murals, known as the Brumidi Corridors, [62] reflect great moments and people in United States history Among the original works are those depicting Benjamin Franklin, John Fitch, Robert Fulton, and events such as the Cession of Louisiana Also decorating the walls are animals, insects and natural flora indigenous to the United States Brumidi's design left many spaces open so future events in United States history could be added Among those added are the Spirit of St Louis, the Moon landing, and the Space Shuttle Challenger crew.\n\n\nCrypt\nOn the ground floor is an area known as the Crypt It was intended to be the burial place of George Washington, with a ringed balustrade at the center of the Rotunda above looking down to his tomb However, under the stipulations of his last will, Washington was buried at Mount Vernon The Crypt houses exhibits on the history of the Capitol A compass star inlaid in the floor marks the point at which Washington, D.C is divided into its four quadrants and is the basis for how addresses in Washington, D.C., are designated (NE, NW, SE, or SW).\n\n\nFeatures\nA statue of John C Calhoun is located at one end of the room near the Old Supreme Court Chamber On the right leg of the statue, a mark from a bullet fired during the 1998 shooting incident is clearly visible The bullet also left a mark on the cape, located on the back right side of the statue.\n\n\nHeight\nContrary to a popular myth, building height laws have never referred to the height of the Capitol building, which rises to 289 feet (88 m) [69] Indeed, the Capitol is only the fourth-tallest structure in Washington.\n\n\nHouse Chamber\nThe House of Representatives Chamber has 448 permanent seats Unlike senators, representatives do not have assigned seats [70] The chamber is large enough to accommodate members of all three branches of the federal government and invited guests for joint sessions of Congress such as the State of the Union speech and other events.\n\n\nSenate Chamber\nThe current Senate Chamber opened in 1859 [72] and is adorned with white marble busts of the former Presidents of the Senate (Vice Presidents) [73]\n\n\nOld Chambers\nThe National Statuary Hall is a chamber in the United States Capitol devoted to sculptures of prominent Americans The hall, also known as the Old Hall of the House, is a large, two-story, semicircular room with a second story gallery along the curved perimeter It is located immediately south of the Rotunda It was the meeting place of the U.S House of Representatives for nearly 50 years (1807–1857) After a few years of disuse, in 1864, it was repurposed as a statuary hall.\n\n\nStatuary Hall\nThe National Statuary Hall is a chamber in the United States Capitol devoted to sculptures of prominent Americans The hall, also known as the Old

legislative branch of the federal government. The building is a prominent example of neoclassical architecture and is one of the most iconic landmarks in the United States.\n\nHistory\n\nPrior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors met at Independence Hall and Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Federal Hall in New York City, and five additional locations: York, Pennsylvania, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland, and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey, and Trenton, New Jersey.\n\nIn September 1774, the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia, followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\n\n18th century\n\nPrior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors met at Independence Hall and Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Federal Hall in New York City, and five additional locations: York, Pennsylvania, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland, and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey, and Trenton, New Jersey.\n\nIn September 1774, the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia, followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\n\n19th century\n\nThe Senate (north) wing was completed in 1800. The Senate and House shared quarters in the north wing until a temporary wooden pavilion was erected on the future site of the House wing, which served for a few years for the Representatives to meet in, until the House of Representatives (south) wing was finally completed in 1811, with a covered wooden temporary walkway connecting the two wings with the Congressional chambers where the future center section with rotunda and dome would eventually be. However, the House of Representatives moved early into their House wing in 1807.\n\nThough the Senate wing building was incomplete, the Capitol held its first session of the U.S Congress with both chambers in session on November 17, 1800. The National Legislature was moved to Washington prematurely, at the urging of President John Adams, in hopes of securing enough Southern votes in the Electoral College to be re-elected for a second term as president.\n\nCapitol dome\n\nThe 1850 expansion more than doubled the length of the United States Capitol; it dwarfed the original, timber-framed, copper-sheeted, low dome of 1818, designed by Charles Bulfinch, which was no longer in proportion with the increased size of the building. In 1855, the decision was made to tear it down and replace it with the \"wedding-cake style\" cast-iron dome that stands today. Also designed by Thomas U Walter, the new dome would stand three times the height of the original dome and 100 feet (30 m) in diameter, yet had to be supported on the existing masonry piers.\n\n20th century\n\nIn 1904, the East Front of the Capitol building was rebuilt, following a design of the architects Carrère and Hastings, who designed the Russell Senate and Cannon House office buildings earlier that year.\n\n21st century\n\nOn June 20, 2000, ground was broken for the Capitol Visitor Center, which opened on December 2, 2008. From 2001 through 2008, the East Front of the Capitol (site of most presidential inaugurations until Ronald Reagan began a new tradition in 1981) was the site of construction for this massive underground complex, designed to facilitate a more orderly entrance for visitors to the Capitol. Prior to the center being built, visitors to the Capitol had to line up in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building or the Russell Senate Office Building. The new underground facility provides a grand entrance hall, a visitors theater, room for exhibits, and dining and restroom facilities, in addition to space for building necessities such as a service tunnel.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Capitol building is marked by its central dome above a rotunda in the central section of the structure (which also includes the older original smaller center flanked by the two original (designed 1793, occupied 1800) smaller two wings (inner north and inner south) containing the two original smaller meeting chambers for the Senate and the House of Representatives (between 1800 and late 1850s) and then flanked by two further extended (newer) wings, one also for each chamber of the larger, more populous Congress: the new north wing is the Senate chamber and the new south wing is the House of Representatives chamber. Above these newer chambers are galleries where visitors can watch the Senate and House of Representatives. It is an example of neoclassical architecture.\n\nArt\n\nSince 1856, the Capitol has featured some the most prominent art in the United States, including Italian and Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi, whose murals are located in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol. The murals, known as the Brumidi Corridors, reflect great moments and people in United States history. Among the original works are those depicting Benjamin Franklin, John Fitch, Robert Fulton, and events such as the Cession of Louisiana. Also decorating the walls are animals, insects, and natural flora indigenous to the United States. Brumidi's design left many spaces open so future events in United States history could be added. Among those added are the Spirit of St Louis, the Moon landing, and the Space Shuttle Challenger crew.\n\nCrypt\n\nOn the ground floor is an area known as the Crypt. It was intended to be the burial place of George Washington, with a ringed balustrade at the center of the Rotunda above looking down to his tomb. However, under the stipulations of his last will, Washington was buried at Mount Vernon. The Crypt houses exhibits on the history of the Capitol. A compass star inlaid in the floor marks the point at which Washington, D.C is divided into its four quadrants and is the basis for how addresses in Washington, D.C., are designated (NE, NW, SE, or SW).\n\nFeatures\n\nA statue of John C Calhoun is located at one end of the room near the Old Supreme Court Chamber. On the right leg of the statue, a mark from a bullet fired during the 1998 shooting incident is clearly visible. The bullet also left a mark on the cape, located on the back right side of the statue.\n\nHeight\n\nContrary to a popular myth, building height laws have never referred to the height of the Capitol building, which rises to 289 feet (88 m). Indeed, the Capitol is only the fourth-tallest structure in Washington.\n\nHouse Chamber\n\nThe House of Representatives Chamber has 448 permanent seats. Unlike senators, representatives do not have assigned seats. The chamber is large enough to accommodate members of all three branches of the federal government and invited guests for joint sessions of Congress such as the State of the Union speech and other events.\n\nSenate Chamber\n\nThe current Senate Chamber opened in 1859 and is adorned with white marble busts of the former Presidents of the Senate (Vice Presidents).\n\nOld Chambers\n\nThe National Statuary Hall is a chamber in the United States Capitol devoted to sculptures of prominent Americans. The hall, also known as the Old Hall of the House, is a large, two-story, semicircular room with a second story gallery along the curved perimeter. It is located immediately south of the Rotunda. It was the meeting place of the U.S House of Representatives for nearly 50 years (1807-1857). After a few years of disuse, in 1864, it was repurposed as a statuary hall.\n\nStatuary Hall\n\nThe National Statuary Hall is a chamber in the United States Capitol devoted to sculptures of prominent Americans.

area now known as Argentina are dated from the Paleolithic period, with further traces in the Mesolithic and Neolithic [14] Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations, [34] which can be divided into three main groups [35]\n\n\nPre-Columbian era\nThe earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina are dated from the Paleolithic period, with further traces in the Mesolithic and Neolithic [14] Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations, [34] which can be divided into three main groups [35]\n\n\nColonial era\nEuropeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of Amerigo Vespucci The Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Sebastian Cabot visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively [15] In 1536 Pedro de Mendoza founded the small settlement of Buenos Aires, which was abandoned in 1541 [37]\n\n\nIndependence and civil wars\nBeginning a process from which Argentina was to emerge as successor state to the Viceroyalty, [16] the 1810 May Revolution replaced the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros with the First Junta, a new government in Buenos Aires made up from locals [44] In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a royalist counter-revolution in Córdoba, [46] but failed to overcome those of the Banda Oriental, Upper Peru and Paraguay, which later became independent states [47] The French-Argentine Hippolyte Bouchard then brought his fleet to wage war against Spain overseas and attacked Spanish California, Spanish Peru and Spanish Philippines He secured the allegiance of escaped Filipinos in San Blas who defected from the Spanish to join the Argentine navy, due to common Argentine and Philippine grievances against Spanish colonization [48] [49] Jose de San Martin's brother, Juan Fermín de San Martín, was already in the Philippines and drumming up revolutionary fervor prior to this [50] At a later date, the Argentine sign of Inca origin, the Sun of May was adopted as a symbol by the Filipinos in the Philippine Revolution against Spain He also secured the diplomatic recognition of Argentina from King Kamehameha I of the Kingdom of Hawaii Historian Pacho O'Donnell affirms that Hawaii was the first state that recognized Argentina's independence [51]He was finally arrested in 1819 by Chilean patriots.\n\n\nRise of the modern nation\nOverpowering Urquiza in the 1861 Battle of Pavón, Bartolomé Mitre secured Buenos Aires' predominance and was elected as the first president of the reunified country He was followed by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Nicolás Avellaneda; these three presidencies set up the basis of the modern Argentine State [65]\n\n\nPeronist years\nThe Labour Party (later renamed Justicialist Party), the most powerful and influential party in Argentine history, came into power with the rise of Juan Perón to the presidency in 1946 He nationalized strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full external debt and claimed he achieved nearly full employment He pushed Congress to enact women's suffrage in 1947, [85] and developed a system of social assistance for the most vulnerable sectors of society [86] The economy began to decline in 1950 due in part to government expenditures and the protectionist economic policies [87]\n\n\nRevolución Libertadora\nThe new head of State, Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, proscribed Peronism and banned the party from any future elections Arturo Frondizi from the UCR won the 1958 general election [91] He encouraged investment to achieve energetic and industrial self-sufficiency, reversed a chronic trade deficit and lifted the ban on Peronism; yet his efforts to stay on good terms with both the Peronists and the military earned him the rejection of both and a new coup forced him out [92] Amidst the political turmoil, Senate leader José María Guido reacted swiftly and applied anti-power vacuum legislation, ascending to the presidency himself; elections were repealed and Peronism was prohibited once again Arturo Illia was elected in 1963 and led an increase in prosperity across the board; however he was overthrown in 1966 by another military coup d'état led by General Juan Carlos Onganía in the self-proclaimed Argentine Revolution, creating a new military government that sought to rule indefinitely [93]\n\n\nPerón's return and death\nFollowing several years of military rule, Alejandro Agustín Lanusse was appointed president by the military junta in 1971 Under increasing political pressure for the return of democracy, Lanusse called for elections in 1973 Perón was banned from running but the Peronist party was allowed to participate The presidential elections were won by Perón's surrogate candidate, Hector Cámpora, a left-wing Peronist, who took office on 25 May 1973 A month later, in June, Perón returned from Spain One of Cámpora's first presidential actions was to grant amnesty to members of organizations that had carried out political assassinations and terrorist attacks, and to those who had been tried and sentenced to prison by judges Cámpora's months-long tenure in government was beset by political and social unrest Over 600 social conflicts, strikes, and factory occupations took place within a single month [94] Even though far-left terrorist organisations had suspended their armed struggle, their joining with the participatory democracy process was interpreted as a direct threat by the Peronist right-wing faction [95]\n\n\nNational Reorganization Process\nThe \"Dirty War\" (Spanish: Guerra Sucia) was part of Operation Condor, which included the participation of other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone The Dirty War involved state terrorism in Argentina and elsewhere in the Southern Cone against political dissidents, with military and security forces employing urban and rural violence against left-wing guerrillas, political dissidents, and anyone believed to be associated with socialism or somehow contrary to the neoliberal economic policies of the regime [98] [99] [100] Victims of the violence in Argentina alone included an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 left-wing activists and militants, including trade unionists, students, journalists, Marxists, Peronist guerrillas, [101] and alleged sympathizers Most of the victims were casualties of state terrorism The opposing guerrillas' victims numbered nearly 500–540 military and police officials [102] and up to 230 civilians [103] Argentina received technical support and military aid from the United States government during the Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan administrations.\n\n\nReturn to democracy\nRaúl Alfonsín won the 1983 elections campaigning for the prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations during the Proceso: the Trial of the Juntas and other martial courts sentenced all the coup's leaders but, under military pressure, he also enacted the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws, [118] [119] which halted prosecutions further down the chain of command The worsening economic crisis and hyperinflation reduced his popular support and the Peronist Carlos Menem won the 1989 election Soon after, riots forced Alfonsín to an early resignation [120]\n\n\nGeography\nWith a mainland surface area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,518 sq mi), [B] Argentina is located in southern South America, sharing land borders with Chile across the Andes to the west; [153] Bolivia and Paraguay to the north; Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east; [154] and the Drake Passage to the south; [155] for an overall land border length of 9,376 km (5,826 mi) Its coastal border over the Río de la Plata and South Atlantic Ocean is 5,117 km (3,180 mi) long [154]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nArgentina is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world [163] hosting one of the greatest ecosystem varieties in the world: 15 continental zones, 2 marine zones, and the Antarctic region are all represented in its territory [163] This huge ecosystem variety has led to a biological diversity that is among the world's largest: [163] [164] 9,372 cataloged vascular plant species (ranked 24th); [H] 1,038 cataloged bird species (ranked 14th); [I] 375 cataloged mammal species (ranked 12th); [J] 338 cataloged reptilian species (ranked 16th); and 162 cataloged amphibian species (ranked 19th).\n\n\nClimate\nIn general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm humid subtropical, moderate humid subtropical, arid and cold                        all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features [173] [174] Although the most populated areas are generally temperate, Argentina has an exceptional amount of climate diversity, [175] ranging from subtropical in the north to polar in the far south [176] Consequently, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including Subtropical rainforests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south [177] The average annual precipitation ranges from 150 millimetres (6 in) in the driest parts of Patagonia to over 2,000 millimetres (79 in) in the westernmost parts of Patagonia and the northeastern parts of the country [175] Mean annual temperatures range from 5 °C (41 °F) in the far south to 25 °C (77 °F) in the north [175]\n\n\nPolitics\nIn the 20th century, Argentina experienced significant political turmoil and democratic reversals [181] [182] Between 1930 and 1976, the armed forces overthrew six governments in Argentina; [182] and the country alternated periods of democracy (1912–1930, 1946–1955, and 1973–1976) with periods of restricted democracy and military rule [181] Following a transition that began in 1983, [183] full-scale democracy in Argentina was reestablished [181] [182] Argentina's democracy endured through the 2001–02 crisis and to the present day; it is regarded as more robust than both its pre-1983 predecessors and other democracies in Latin America [182] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices, Argentina in 2023 was the second most electoral democratic country in Latin America [184]\n\n\nGovernment\nArgentina is a federal constitutional republic and representative democracy [186] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the Constitution of Argentina, the country's supreme legal document The seat of government is the city of Buenos Aires, as designated by Congress [187] Suffrage is universal, equal, secret and mandatory [188] [K]\n\n\nProvinces\nArgentina is a federation of twenty-three provinces and one autonomous city, Buenos Aires Provinces are divided for administration purposes into departments and municipalities, except for Buenos Aires Province, which is divided into partidos The City of Buenos Aires is divided into communes.\n\n\nForeign relations\nForeign policy is handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship, which answers to the President The country is one of the G-15 and G-20 major economies of the world, and a founding member of the UN, WBG, WTO and OAS.\nIn 2012 Argentina was elected again to a two-year non-permanent position on the United Nations Security Council and is participating in major peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Cyprus, Western Sahara and the Middle East [205] Argentina is described as a middle power [21] [206]\n\n\nArmed forces\nThe president holds the title of commander-in-chief of the Argentine Armed Forces, as part of a legal framework that imposes a strict separation between national defense and internal security systems: [213] [214] The National Defense System, an exclusive responsibility of the federal government, [215] coordinated by the Ministry of Defense, and comprising the Army, the Navy and the Air Force [216] Ruled and monitored by Congress [217] through the Houses' Defense Committees, [218] it is organized on the essential principle of legitimate self-defense: the repelling of any external military aggression in order to guarantee freedom of the people, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity [218] Its secondary missions include committing to multinational operations within the framework of the United Nations, participating in internal support missions, assisting friendly countries, and establishing a sub-regional defense system [218]\n\n\nEconomy\nBenefiting from rich natural resources, a highly literate population, a diversified industrial base, and an export-oriented agricultural sector, the economy of Argentina is Latin America's third-largest, [225] and the second-largest in South America [226] Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world, on the 20th century in 1913 it was one of the wealthiest countries in the world by GDP per capita [227] It has a \"very high\" rating on the Human Development Index [13] and ranks 66th by nominal GDP per capita, [228] with a considerable internal market size and a growing share of the high-tech sector As a middle emerging economy and one of the world's top developing nations, it is a member of the G-20 major economies [229] [M]\n\n\nTourism\nThe country had 5.57 million visitors in 2013, ranking in terms of international tourist arrivals as the top destination in South America, and second in Latin America after Mexico [256] Revenues from international tourists reached US$4.41 billion in 2013, down from US$4.89 billion in 2012 [256] The country's capital city, Buenos Aires, is the most visited city in South America [257] There are 30 National Parks of Argentina including many World Heritage Sites.\n\n\nTransport\nBy 2004 [update] Buenos Aires, all provincial capitals except Ushuaia, and all medium-sized towns were interconnected by 69,412 km (43,131 mi) of paved roads, out of a total road network of 231,374 km (143,769 mi) [258] In 2021, the country had about 2,800 km (1,740 mi) of duplicated highways, most leaving the capital Buenos Aires, linking it with cities such as Rosario and Córdoba, Santa Fe, Mar del Plata and Paso de los Libres (in border with Brazil), there are also duplicated highways leaving from Mendoza towards the capital, and between Córdoba and Santa Fé, among other locations [259] Nevertheless, this road infrastructure is still inadequate and cannot handle the sharply growing demand caused by deterioration of the railway system [260]\n\n\nEnergy\nIn 2020, more than 60% of Argentina's electricity came from non-renewable sources such as natural gas, oil and coal 27% came from hydropower, 7.3% from wind and solar energy and 4.4% from nuclear energy [272] At the end of 2021 Argentina was the 21st country in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW), the 26th country in the world in terms of installed wind energy (3.2 GW) and the 43rd country in the world in terms of installed solar energy (1.0 GW) [273]\n\n\nScience and technology\nArgentines have received three Nobel Prizes in the Sciences Bernardo Houssay, the first Latin American recipient, discovered the role of pituitary hormones in regulating glucose in animals, and shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 Luis Leloir discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into glycogen and the compounds which are fundamental in metabolizing carbohydrates, receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1970 César Milstein did extensive research in antibodies, sharing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 Argentine research has led to treatments for heart diseases and several forms of cancer Domingo Liotta designed and developed the first artificial heart that was successfully implanted in a human being in 1969 René Favaloro developed the techniques and performed the world's first coronary bypass surgery.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2010 census counted 40,117,096 inhabitants, up from 36,260,130 in 2001 [286] [287] Argentina ranks third in South America in total population, fourth in Latin America and 33rd globally Its population density of 15 persons per square kilometer of land area is well below the world average of 50 persons The population growth rate in 2010 was an estimated 1.03% annually, with a birth rate of 17.7 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants Since 2010, the crude net migration rate has ranged from below zero to up to four immigrants per 1,000 inhabitants per year [288]\n\n\nEthnography\nArgentina is considered a country of immigrants [296] [297] [298] Argentines usually refer to the country as a crisol de razas (crucible of races, or melting pot) A 2010 study conducted on 218 individuals by the Argentine geneticist Daniel Corach established that the average genetic ancestry of Argentines is 79% European (mainly Italian and Spanish), 18% indigenous and 4.3% African; 63.6% of the tested group had at least one ancestor who was Indigenous [299] [300] The majority of Argentines descend from multiple European ethnic groups, primarily of Italian and Spanish descent, with over 25 million Argentines (almost 60% of the population) having some partial Italian origins [301]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe de facto [N] official language is Spanish, spoken by almost all Argentines [311]\nThe country is the largest Spanish-speaking society that universally employs voseo, the use of the pronoun vos instead of tú (\"you\"), which imposes the use of alternative verb forms as well.\nOwing to the extensive Argentine geography, Spanish has a strong variation among regions, although the prevalent dialect is Rioplatense, primarily spoken in the Pampean and Patagonian regions and accented similarly to the Neapolitan language [312] Italian and other European immigrants influenced Lunfardo—the regional slang—permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other Latin American countries as well.\n\n\nReligion\nChristianity is the largest religion in Argentina The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion [315] Although it enforces neither an official nor a state faith, [316] it gives Roman Catholicism a preferential status [317] [Q]\n\n\nHealth\nHealth care is provided through a combination of employer and labour union-sponsored plans (Obras Sociales), government insurance plans, public hospitals and clinics and through private health insurance plans Health care cooperatives number over 300 (of which 200 are related to labour unions) and provide health care for half the population; the national INSSJP (popularly known as PAMI) covers nearly all of the five million senior citizens [325]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Argentine education system consists of four levels [330] An initial level for children between 45 days to 5 years old, with the last two years [331] being compulsory An elementary or lower school mandatory level lasting 6 or 7 years [R] In 2010 [update] the literacy rate was 98.07% [332] A secondary or high school mandatory level lasting 5 or 6 years [R] In 2010 [update] 38.5% of people over age 20 had completed secondary school [333] A higher level, divided in tertiary, university and post-graduate sub-levels in 2013 [update] there were 47 national public universities across the country, as well as 46 private ones [334]\n\n\nUrbanization\nArgentina is highly urbanized, with 92% of its population living in cities: [335] the ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population.\nAbout 3 million people live in the city of Buenos Aires, and including the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area it totals around 13 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world [336] The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each [336] Mendoza, San Miguel de Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe have at least half a million people each [336]\n\n\nCulture\nArgentina is a multicultural country with significant European influences Modern Argentine culture has been largely influenced by Italian, Spanish and other European immigration from France, Russia, United Kingdom, among others Its cities are largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of American and European styles in fashion, architecture and design [339] Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all the large urban centres, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars, or bars offering live music of a variety of genres although there are lesser elements of Amerindian and African influences, particularly in the fields of music and art [340] The other big influence is the gauchos and their traditional country lifestyle of self-reliance [341] Finally, indigenous American traditions have been absorbed into the general cultural milieu.\nArgentine writer Ernesto Sabato has reflected on the nature of the culture of Argentina as follows:\n\n\nLiterature\nAlthough Argentina's rich literary history began around 1550, [343] it reached full independence with Esteban Echeverría's El Matadero, a romantic landmark that played a significant role in the development of 19th century's Argentine narrative, [344] split by the ideological divide between the popular, federalist epic of José Hernández' Martín Fierro and the elitist and cultured discourse of Sarmiento's masterpiece, Facundo [345]\n\n\nMusic\nTango, a Rioplatense musical genre with European and African influences, [353] is one of Argentina's international cultural symbols [354]\nThe golden age of tango (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of jazz and swing in the United States, featuring large orchestras such as those of Osvaldo Pugliese, Aníbal Troilo, Francisco Canaro, Julio de Caro and Juan d'Arienzo [355]\nAfter 1955, virtuoso Astor Piazzolla popularized Nuevo tango, a subtler and more intellectual trend for the genre [355]\nTango enjoys worldwide popularity nowadays with groups such as Gotan Project, Bajofondo and Tanghetto.\n\n\nTheatre and cinema\nBuenos Aires is one of the great theatre capitals of the world, [359] with a scene of international caliber centered on Corrientes Avenue, \"the street that never sleeps\", sometimes referred to as an intellectual Broadway in Buenos Aires [360] Teatro Colón is a global landmark for opera and classical performances; its acoustics are considered among the world's top five [361] [T]\n\n\nVisual arts and architecture\nSome of the best-known Argentine painters are Cándido López and Florencio Molina Campos (Naïve style); Ernesto de la Cárcova and Eduardo Sívori (Realism); Fernando Fader (Impressionism); Pío Collivadino, Atilio Malinverno and Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós (Postimpressionism); Emilio Pettoruti (Cubism); Julio Barragán (Concretism and Cubism) Antonio Berni (Neofigurativism); Roberto Aizenberg and Xul Solar (Surrealism); Gyula Košice (Constructivism); Eduardo Mac Entyre (Generative art); Luis Seoane, Carlos Torrallardona, Luis Aquino, Alfredo Gramajo Gutiérrez (Modernism); Lucio Fontana (Spatialism); Tomás Maldonado, Guillermo Kuitca (Abstract art); León Ferrari, Marta Minujín (Conceptual art); Gustavo Cabral (Fantasy art), and Fabián Pérez (Neoemotionalism) [vague]\n\n\nMass media\nThe print media industry is highly developed in Argentina, with more than two hundred newspapers The major national ones include Clarín (centrist, Latin America's best-seller and the second most widely circulated in the Spanish-speaking world), La Nación (centre-right, published since 1870), Página/12 (leftist, founded in 1987), La Voz del Interior (centre, founded in 1904), [370] and the Argentinisches Tageblatt (German weekly, liberal, published since 1878) [371]\n\n\nCuisine\nBesides many of the pasta, sausage and dessert dishes common to continental Europe, Argentines enjoy a wide variety of Indigenous and Criollo creations, including empanadas (a small stuffed pastry), locro (a mixture of corn, beans, meat, bacon, onion, and gourd), humita and mate [377] In various localities of Argentina, this dish is consumed as a beefmelt.\n\n\nSport\nPato is the national sport, [383] an ancient horseback game locally originated in the early 1600s and predecessor of horseball [384] [385]\n\n\nSee also\n World portal\n\n\nNotes\n World portal\n\n\nReferences\n World portal\n\n\nBibliography\n World portal\n\n\nLegal documents\n World portal\n\n\nArticles\n World

Republic, is a country located in the southern part of South America. It is the second-largest country in the region by both area and population, and the third-largest country in Latin America. The country is known for its rich cultural heritage, diverse geography, and vibrant cities.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe description of the region by the word Argentina has been found on a Venetian map in 1536.\n\n**History**\n\nThe earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina are dated from the Paleolithic period, with further traces in the Mesolithic and Neolithic. Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations, which can be divided into three main groups.\n\n**Pre-Columbian Era**\n\nThe earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina are dated from the Paleolithic period, with further traces in the Mesolithic and Neolithic. Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations, which can be divided into three main groups.\n\n**Colonial Era**\n\nEuropeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of Amerigo Vespucci. The Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Sebastian Cabot visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively. In 1536, Pedro de Mendoza founded the small settlement of Buenos Aires, which was abandoned in 1541.\n\n**Independence and Civil Wars**\n\nBeginning a process from which Argentina was to emerge as successor state to the Viceroyalty, the 1810 May Revolution replaced the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros with the First Junta, a new government in Buenos Aires made up from locals. In the first clashes of the Independence War, the Junta crushed a royalist counter-revolution in Córdoba, but failed to overcome those of the Banda Oriental, Upper Peru, and Paraguay, which later became independent states.\n\n**Rise of the Modern Nation**\n\nOverpowering Urquiza in the 1861 Battle of Pavón, Bartolomé Mitre secured Buenos Aires' predominance and was elected as the first president of the reunified country. He was followed by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Nicolás Avellaneda; these three presidencies set up the basis of the modern Argentine State.\n\n**Peronist Years**\n\nThe Labour Party (later renamed Justicialist Party), the most powerful and influential party in Argentine history, came into power with the rise of Juan Perón to the presidency in 1946. He nationalized strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full external debt, and claimed he achieved nearly full employment. He pushed Congress to enact women's suffrage in 1947 and developed a system of social assistance for the most vulnerable sectors of society.\n\n**Revolución Libertadora**\n\nThe new head of State, Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, proscribed Peronism and banned the party from any future elections. Arturo Frondizi from the UCR won the 1958 general election. He encouraged investment to achieve energetic and industrial self-sufficiency, reversed a chronic trade deficit, and lifted the ban on Peronism; yet his efforts to stay on good terms with both the Peronists and the military earned him the rejection of both and a new coup forced him out.\n\n**Perón's Return and Death**\n\nFollowing several years of military rule, Alejandro Agustín Lanusse was appointed president by the military junta in 1971. Under increasing political pressure for the return of democracy, Lanusse called for elections in 1973. Perón was banned from running, but the Peronist party was allowed to participate. The presidential elections were won by Perón's surrogate candidate, Hector Cámpora, a left-wing Peronist, who took office on 25 May 1973.

Its coastal border over the Río de la Plata and South Atlantic Ocean is 5,117 km long. Argentina has a mainland surface area of 2,780,400 km2 and is the second-largest country in the region by both area and population.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nArgentina is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, hosting one of the greatest ecosystem varieties in the world. This huge ecosystem variety has led to a biological diversity that is among the world's largest. The country has 9,372 cataloged vascular plant species, 1,038 cataloged bird species, 375 cataloged mammal species, 338 cataloged reptilian species, and 162 cataloged amphibian species.\n\n**Climate**\n\nArgentina has four main climate types: warm humid subtropical, moderate humid subtropical, arid, and cold.

The National Defense System, an exclusive responsibility of the federal government, is coordinated by the Ministry of Defense and comprises the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.\n\n**Economy**\n\nThe economy of Argentina is Latin America's third-largest and the second-largest in South America. Argentina was one of the wealthiest countries in the world in the 20th century, and it has a \"very high\" rating on the Human Development Index. The country has a considerable internal market size and a growing share of the high-tech sector, and it is a member of the G-20 major economies.\n\n**Tourism**\n\nThe country had 5.57 million visitors in 2013, ranking in terms of international tourist arrivals as the top destination in South America and second in Latin America after Mexico. Revenues from international tourists reached US$4.41 billion in 2013, down from US$4.89 billion in 2012. The country's capital city, Buenos Aires, is the most visited city in South America.\n\n**Transport**\n\nBy 2004, Buenos Aires, all provincial capitals except Ushuaia, and all medium-sized towns were interconnected by 69,412 km of paved roads, out of a total road network of 231,374 km. In 2021, the country had about 2,800 km of duplicated highways, most leaving the capital Buenos Aires, linking it with cities such as Rosario and Córdoba, Santa Fe, Mar del Plata, and Paso de los Libres (in border with Brazil).\n\n**Energy**\n\nIn 2020, more than 60% of Argentina's electricity came from non-renewable sources such as natural gas, oil, and coal. 27% came from hydropower, 7.3% from wind and solar energy, and 4.4% from nuclear energy. At the end of 2021, Argentina was the 21st country in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power, the 26th country in the world in terms of installed wind energy, and the 43rd country in the world in terms of installed solar energy.\n\n**Science and Technology**\n\nArgentines have received three Nobel Prizes in the Sciences: Bernardo Houssay, the first Latin American recipient, discovered the role of pituitary hormones in regulating glucose in animals, and shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947; Luis Leloir discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into glycogen and the compounds which are fundamental in metabolizing carbohydrates, receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1970; and César Milstein did extensive research in antibodies, sharing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe 2010 census counted 40,117,096 inhabitants, up from 36,260,130 in 2001. Argentina ranks third in South America in total population, fourth in Latin America, and 33rd globally. The population density of Argentina is 15 persons per square kilometer of land area, well below the world average of 50 persons. The population growth rate in 2010 was an estimated 1.03% annually, with a birth rate of 17.7 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants.\n\n**Ethnography**\n\nArgentina is considered a country of immigrants, and Argentines usually refer to the country as a crisol de razas (crucible of races or melting pot). A 2010 study conducted on 218 individuals by the Argentine geneticist Daniel Corach established that the average genetic ancestry of Argentines is 79% European (mainly Italian and Spanish), 18% indigenous, and 4.3% African, with 63.6% of the tested group having at least one ancestor who was indigenous.\n\n**Languages**\n\nThe de facto official language is Spanish, spoken by almost all Argentines. The country is the largest Spanish-speaking society that universally employs voseo, the use of the pronoun vos instead of tú (\"you\"), which imposes the use of alternative verb forms as well. Owing to the extensive Argentine geography, Spanish has a strong variation among regions, although the prevalent dialect is Rioplatense, primarily spoken in the Pampean and Patagonian regions and accented similarly to the Neapolitan language.\n\n**Religion**\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in Argentina, and the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Although it enforces neither an official nor a state faith, it gives Roman Catholicism a preferential status. Health care is provided through a combination of employer and labor union-sponsored plans, government insurance plans, public hospitals and clinics, and through private health insurance plans.\n\n**Education**\n\nThe Argentine education system consists of four levels: an initial level for children between 45 days to 5 years old, with the last two years being compulsory; an elementary or lower school mandatory level lasting 6 or 7 years; a secondary or high school mandatory level lasting 5 or 6 years; and a higher level, divided into tertiary, university, and post-graduate sub-levels.\n\n**Urbanization**\n\nArgentina is highly urbanized, with 92% of its population living in cities. The ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population. About 3 million people live in the city of Buenos Aires, and including the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area, it totals around 13 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world. The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each.\n\n**Culture**\n\nArgentina is a multicultural country with significant European influences, and modern Argentine culture has been largely influenced by Italian, Spanish, and other European immigration from France, Russia, the United Kingdom, among others. Its cities are largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent and of conscious imitation of American and European styles in fashion, architecture, and design. Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all the large urban centers, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars or bars offering live music of a variety of genres.\n\n**Literature**\n\nAlthough Argentina's rich literary history began around 1550, it reached full independence with Esteban Echeverría's El Matadero, a romantic landmark that played a significant role in the development of 19th-century Argentine narrative, split by the ideological divide between the popular, federalist epic of José Hernández' Martín Fierro and the elitist and cultured discourse of Sarmiento's masterpiece, Facundo.\n\n**Music**\n\nTango is a Rioplatense musical genre with European and African influences, and it is one of Argentina's international cultural symbols. The golden age of tango (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of jazz and swing in the United States, featuring large orchestras such as those of Osvaldo Pugliese, Aníbal Troilo, Francisco Canaro, Julio de Caro, and Juan d'Arienzo. After 1955, virtuoso Astor Piazzolla popularized Nuevo tango, a subtler and more intellectual trend for the genre.\n\n**Theatre and Cinema**\n\nBuenos Aires is one of the great theatre capitals of the world, with a scene of international caliber centered on Corrientes Avenue, \"the street that never sleeps\", sometimes referred to as an intellectual Broadway in Buenos Aires. Teatro Colón is a global landmark for opera and classical performances; its acoustics are considered among the world's top five.\n\n**Visual Arts and Architecture**\n\nSome of the best-known Argentine painters are Cándido López and Florencio Molina Campos (Naïve style); Ernesto de la Cárcova and Eduardo Sívori (Realism); Fernando Fader (Impressionism); Pío Collivadino, Atilio Malinverno, and Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós (Postimpressionism); Emilio Pettoruti (Cubism); Julio Barragán (Concretism and Cubism); Antonio Berni (Neofigurativism); Roberto Aizenberg and Xul Solar (Surrealism); Gyula Košice (Constructivism); Eduardo Mac Entyre (Generative art); Luis Seoane, Carlos Torrallardona, Luis Aquino, Alfredo Gramajo Gutiérrez (Modernism); Lucio Fontana (Spatialism); Tomás Maldonado, Guillermo Kuitca (Abstract art); León Ferrari, Marta Minujín (Conceptual art); Gustavo Cabral (Fantasy art), and Fabián Pérez (Neoemotionalism).\n\n**Mass Media**\n\nThe print media industry is highly developed in Argentina, with more than two hundred newspapers. The major national ones include Clarín (centrist, Latin America's best-seller and the second most widely circulated in the Spanish-speaking world), La Nación (centre-right, published since 1870), Página/12 (leftist, founded in 1987), La Voz del Interior (centre, founded in 1904), and the Argentinisches Tageblatt (German weekly, liberal, published since 1878).\n\n**Cuisine**\n\nBesides many of the pasta, sausage, and dessert dishes common to continental Europe, Argentines enjoy a wide variety of indigenous and criollo creations, including empanadas (a small stuffed pastry), locro (a mixture of corn, beans, meat, bacon, onion, and gourd), humita, and mate. In various localities of Argentina, this dish is consumed as a beefmelt.\n\n**Sport**\n\nPato is the national sport, an ancient horseback game locally originated in the early 1600s and predecessor of horseball.\n\n**See also**\n\n* World portal\n\n**References**\n\n* World portal\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* World portal\n\n**Legal documents**\n\n* World portal\n\n**Articles**\n\n* World

\"Argentina\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe description of the region by the word Argentina has been found on a Venetian map in 1536 [26]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina are dated from the Paleolithic period, with further traces in the Mesolithic and Neolithic [14] Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations, [34] which can be divided into three main groups [35]\n\n\nPre-Columbian era\nThe earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina are dated from the Paleolithic period, with further traces in the Mesolithic and Neolithic [14] Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations, [34] which can be divided into three main groups [35]\n\n\nColonial era\nEuropeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of Amerigo Vespucci The Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Sebastian Cabot visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively [15] In 1536 Pedro de Mendoza founded the small settlement of Buenos Aires, which was abandoned in 1541 [37]\n\n\nIndependence and civil wars\nBeginning a process from which Argentina was to emerge as successor state to the Viceroyalty, [16] the 1810 May Revolution replaced the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros with the First Junta, a new government in Buenos Aires made up from locals [44] In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a royalist counter-revolution in Córdoba, [46] but failed to overcome those of the Banda Oriental, Upper Peru and Paraguay, which later became independent states [47] The French-Argentine Hippolyte Bouchard then brought his fleet to wage war against Spain overseas and attacked Spanish California, Spanish Peru and Spanish Philippines He secured the allegiance of escaped Filipinos in San Blas who defected from the Spanish to join the Argentine navy, due to common Argentine and Philippine grievances against Spanish colonization [48] [49] Jose de San Martin's brother, Juan Fermín de San Martín, was already in the Philippines and drumming up revolutionary fervor prior to this [50] At a later date, the Argentine sign of Inca origin, the Sun of May was adopted as a symbol by the Filipinos in the Philippine Revolution against Spain He also secured the diplomatic recognition of Argentina from King Kamehameha I of the Kingdom of Hawaii Historian Pacho O'Donnell affirms that Hawaii was the first state that recognized Argentina's independence [51]He was finally arrested in 1819 by Chilean patriots.\n\n\nRise of the modern nation\nOverpowering Urquiza in the 1861 Battle of Pavón, Bartolomé Mitre secured Buenos Aires' predominance and was elected as the first president of the reunified country He was followed by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Nicolás Avellaneda; these three presidencies set up the basis of the modern Argentine State [65]\n\n\nPeronist years\nThe Labour Party (later renamed Justicialist Party), the most powerful and influential party in Argentine history, came into power with the rise of Juan Perón to the presidency in 1946 He nationalized strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full external debt and claimed he achieved nearly full employment He pushed Congress to enact women's suffrage in 1947, [85] and developed a system of social assistance for the most vulnerable sectors of society [86] The economy began to decline in 1950 due in part to government expenditures and the protectionist economic policies [87]\n\n\nRevolución Libertadora\nThe new head of State, Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, proscribed Peronism and banned the party from any future elections Arturo Frondizi from the UCR won the 1958 general election [91] He encouraged investment to achieve energetic and industrial self-sufficiency, reversed a chronic trade deficit and lifted the ban on Peronism; yet his efforts to stay on good terms with both the Peronists and the military earned him the rejection of both and a new coup forced him out [92] Amidst the political turmoil, Senate leader José María Guido reacted swiftly and applied anti-power vacuum legislation, ascending to the presidency himself; elections were repealed and Peronism was prohibited once again Arturo Illia was elected in 1963 and led an increase in prosperity across the board; however he was overthrown in 1966 by another military coup d'état led by General Juan Carlos Onganía in the self-proclaimed Argentine Revolution, creating a new military government that sought to rule indefinitely [93]\n\n\nPerón's return and death\nFollowing several years of military rule, Alejandro Agustín Lanusse was appointed president by the military junta in 1971 Under increasing political pressure for the return of democracy, Lanusse called for elections in 1973 Perón was banned from running but the Peronist party was allowed to participate The presidential elections were won by Perón's surrogate candidate, Hector Cámpora, a left-wing Peronist, who took office on 25 May 1973 A month later, in June, Perón returned from Spain One of Cámpora's first presidential actions was to grant amnesty to members of organizations that had carried out political assassinations and terrorist attacks, and to those who had been tried and sentenced to prison by judges Cámpora's months-long tenure in government was beset by political and social unrest Over 600 social conflicts, strikes, and factory occupations took place within a single month [94] Even though far-left terrorist organisations had suspended their armed struggle, their joining with the participatory democracy process was interpreted as a direct threat by the Peronist right-wing faction [95]\n\n\nNational Reorganization Process\nThe \"Dirty War\" (Spanish: Guerra Sucia) was part of Operation Condor, which included the participation of other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone The Dirty War involved state terrorism in Argentina and elsewhere in the Southern Cone against political dissidents, with military and security forces employing urban and rural violence against left-wing guerrillas, political dissidents, and anyone believed to be associated with socialism or somehow contrary to the neoliberal economic policies of the regime [98] [99] [100] Victims of the violence in Argentina alone included an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 left-wing activists and militants, including trade unionists, students, journalists, Marxists, Peronist guerrillas, [101] and alleged sympathizers Most of the victims were casualties of state terrorism The opposing guerrillas' victims numbered nearly 500–540 military and police officials [102] and up to 230 civilians [103] Argentina received technical support and military aid from the United States government during the Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan administrations.\n\n\nReturn to democracy\nRaúl Alfonsín won the 1983 elections campaigning for the prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations during the Proceso: the Trial of the Juntas and other martial courts sentenced all the coup's leaders but, under military pressure, he also enacted the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws, [118] [119] which halted prosecutions further down the chain of command The worsening economic crisis and hyperinflation reduced his popular support and the Peronist Carlos Menem won the 1989 election Soon after, riots forced Alfonsín to an early resignation [120]\n\n\nGeography\nWith a mainland surface area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,518 sq mi), [B] Argentina is located in southern South America, sharing land borders with Chile across the Andes to the west; [153] Bolivia and Paraguay to the north; Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east; [154] and the Drake Passage to the south; [155] for an overall land border length of 9,376 km (5,826 mi) Its coastal border over the Río de la Plata and South Atlantic Ocean is 5,117 km (3,180 mi) long [154]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nArgentina is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world [163] hosting one of the greatest ecosystem varieties in the world: 15 continental zones, 2 marine zones, and the Antarctic region are all represented in its territory [163] This huge ecosystem variety has led to a biological diversity that is among the world's largest: [163] [164] 9,372 cataloged vascular plant species (ranked 24th); [H] 1,038 cataloged bird species (ranked 14th); [I] 375 cataloged mammal species (ranked 12th); [J] 338 cataloged reptilian species (ranked 16th); and 162 cataloged amphibian species (ranked 19th).\n\n\nClimate\nIn general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm humid subtropical, moderate humid subtropical, arid and cold                        all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features [173] [174] Although the most populated areas are generally temperate, Argentina has an exceptional amount of climate diversity, [175] ranging from subtropical in the north to polar in the far south [176] Consequently, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including Subtropical rainforests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south [177] The average annual precipitation ranges from 150 millimetres (6 in) in the driest parts of Patagonia to over 2,000 millimetres (79 in) in the westernmost parts of Patagonia and the northeastern parts of the country [175] Mean annual temperatures range from 5 °C (41 °F) in the far south to 25 °C (77 °F) in the north [175]\n\n\nPolitics\nIn the 20th century, Argentina experienced significant political turmoil and democratic reversals [181] [182] Between 1930 and 1976, the armed forces overthrew six governments in Argentina; [182] and the country alternated periods of democracy (1912–1930, 1946–1955, and 1973–1976) with periods of restricted democracy and military rule [181] Following a transition that began in 1983, [183] full-scale democracy in Argentina was reestablished [181] [182] Argentina's democracy endured through the 2001–02 crisis and to the present day; it is regarded as more robust than both its pre-1983 predecessors and other democracies in Latin America [182] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices, Argentina in 2023 was the second most electoral democratic country in Latin America [184]\n\n\nGovernment\nArgentina is a federal constitutional republic and representative democracy [186] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the Constitution of Argentina, the country's supreme legal document The seat of government is the city of Buenos Aires, as designated by Congress [187] Suffrage is universal, equal, secret and mandatory [188] [K]\n\n\nProvinces\nArgentina is a federation of twenty-three provinces and one autonomous city, Buenos Aires Provinces are divided for administration purposes into departments and municipalities, except for Buenos Aires Province, which is divided into partidos The City of Buenos Aires is divided into communes.\n\n\nForeign relations\nForeign policy is handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship, which answers to the President The country is one of the G-15 and G-20 major economies of the world, and a founding member of the UN, WBG, WTO and OAS.\nIn 2012 Argentina was elected again to a two-year non-permanent position on the United Nations Security Council and is participating in major peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Cyprus, Western Sahara and the Middle East [205] Argentina is described as a middle power [21] [206]\n\n\nArmed forces\nThe president holds the title of commander-in-chief of the Argentine Armed Forces, as part of a legal framework that imposes a strict separation between national defense and internal security systems: [213] [214] The National Defense System, an exclusive responsibility of the federal government, [215] coordinated by the Ministry of Defense, and comprising the Army, the Navy and the Air Force [216] Ruled and monitored by Congress [217] through the Houses' Defense Committees, [218] it is organized on the essential principle of legitimate self-defense: the repelling of any external military aggression in order to guarantee freedom of the people, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity [218] Its secondary missions include committing to multinational operations within the framework of the United Nations, participating in internal support missions, assisting friendly countries, and establishing a sub-regional defense system [218]\n\n\nEconomy\nBenefiting from rich natural resources, a highly literate population, a diversified industrial base, and an export-oriented agricultural sector, the economy of Argentina is Latin America's third-largest, [225] and the second-largest in South America [226] Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world, on the 20th century in 1913 it was one of the wealthiest countries in the world by GDP per capita [227] It has a \"very high\" rating on the Human Development Index [13] and ranks 66th by nominal GDP per capita, [228] with a considerable internal market size and a growing share of the high-tech sector As a middle emerging economy and one of the world's top developing nations, it is a member of the G-20 major economies [229] [M]\n\n\nTourism\nThe country had 5.57 million visitors in 2013, ranking in terms of international tourist arrivals as the top destination in South America, and second in Latin America after Mexico [256] Revenues from international tourists reached US$4.41 billion in 2013, down from US$4.89 billion in 2012 [256] The country's capital city, Buenos Aires, is the most visited city in South America [257] There are 30 National Parks of Argentina including many World Heritage Sites.\n\n\nTransport\nBy 2004 [update] Buenos Aires, all provincial capitals except Ushuaia, and all medium-sized towns were interconnected by 69,412 km (43,131 mi) of paved roads, out of a total road network of 231,374 km (143,769 mi) [258] In 2021, the country had about 2,800 km (1,740 mi) of duplicated highways, most leaving the capital Buenos Aires, linking it with cities such as Rosario and Córdoba, Santa Fe, Mar del Plata and Paso de los Libres (in border with Brazil), there are also duplicated highways leaving from Mendoza towards the capital, and between Córdoba and Santa Fé, among other locations [259] Nevertheless, this road infrastructure is still inadequate and cannot handle the sharply growing demand caused by deterioration of the railway system [260]\n\n\nEnergy\nIn 2020, more than 60% of Argentina's electricity came from non-renewable sources such as natural gas, oil and coal 27% came from hydropower, 7.3% from wind and solar energy and 4.4% from nuclear energy [272] At the end of 2021 Argentina was the 21st country in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW), the 26th country in the world in terms of installed wind energy (3.2 GW) and the 43rd country in the world in terms of installed solar energy (1.0 GW) [273]\n\n\nScience and technology\nArgentines have received three Nobel Prizes in the Sciences Bernardo Houssay, the first Latin American recipient, discovered the role of pituitary hormones in regulating glucose in animals, and shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 Luis Leloir discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into glycogen and the compounds which are fundamental in metabolizing carbohydrates, receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1970 César Milstein did extensive research in antibodies, sharing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 Argentine research has led to treatments for heart diseases and several forms of cancer Domingo Liotta designed and developed the first artificial heart that was successfully implanted in a human being in 1969 René Favaloro developed the techniques and performed the world's first coronary bypass surgery.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2010 census counted 40,117,096 inhabitants, up from 36,260,130 in 2001 [286] [287] Argentina ranks third in South America in total population, fourth in Latin America and 33rd globally Its population density of 15 persons per square kilometer of land area is well below the world average of 50 persons The population growth rate in 2010 was an estimated 1.03% annually, with a birth rate of 17.7 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants Since 2010, the crude net migration rate has ranged from below zero to up to four immigrants per 1,000 inhabitants per year [288]\n\n\nEthnography\nArgentina is considered a country of immigrants [296] [297] [298] Argentines usually refer to the country as a crisol de razas (crucible of races, or melting pot) A 2010 study conducted on 218 individuals by the Argentine geneticist Daniel Corach established that the average genetic ancestry of Argentines is 79% European (mainly Italian and Spanish), 18% indigenous and 4.3% African; 63.6% of the tested group had at least one ancestor who was Indigenous [299] [300] The majority of Argentines descend from multiple European ethnic groups, primarily of Italian and Spanish descent, with over 25 million Argentines (almost 60% of the population) having some partial Italian origins [301]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe de facto [N] official language is Spanish, spoken by almost all Argentines [311]\nThe country is the largest Spanish-speaking society that universally employs voseo, the use of the pronoun vos instead of tú (\"you\"), which imposes the use of alternative verb forms as well.\nOwing to the extensive Argentine geography, Spanish has a strong variation among regions, although the prevalent dialect is Rioplatense, primarily spoken in the Pampean and Patagonian regions and accented similarly to the Neapolitan language [312] Italian and other European immigrants influenced Lunfardo—the regional slang—permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other Latin American countries as well.\n\n\nReligion\nChristianity is the largest religion in Argentina The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion [315] Although it enforces neither an official nor a state faith, [316] it gives Roman Catholicism a preferential status [317] [Q]\n\n\nHealth\nHealth care is provided through a combination of employer and labour union-sponsored plans (Obras Sociales), government insurance plans, public hospitals and clinics and through private health insurance plans Health care cooperatives number over 300 (of which 200 are related to labour unions) and provide health care for half the population; the national INSSJP (popularly known as PAMI) covers nearly all of the five million senior citizens [325]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Argentine education system consists of four levels [330] An initial level for children between 45 days to 5 years old, with the last two years [331] being compulsory An elementary or lower school mandatory level lasting 6 or 7 years [R] In 2010 [update] the literacy rate was 98.07% [332] A secondary or high school mandatory level lasting 5 or 6 years [R] In 2010 [update] 38.5% of people over age 20 had completed secondary school [333] A higher level, divided in tertiary, university and post-graduate sub-levels in 2013 [update] there were 47 national public universities across the country, as well as 46 private ones [334]\n\n\nUrbanization\nArgentina is highly urbanized, with 92% of its population living in cities: [335] the ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population.\nAbout 3 million people live in the city of Buenos Aires, and including the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area it totals around 13 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world [336] The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each [336] Mendoza, San Miguel de Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe have at least half a million people each [336]\n\n\nCulture\nArgentina is a multicultural country with significant European influences Modern Argentine culture has been largely influenced by Italian, Spanish and other European immigration from France, Russia, United Kingdom, among others Its cities are largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of American and European styles in fashion, architecture and design [339] Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all the large urban centres, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars, or bars offering live music of a variety of genres although there are lesser elements of Amerindian and African influences, particularly in the fields of music and art [340] The other big influence is the gauchos and their traditional country lifestyle of self-reliance [341] Finally, indigenous American traditions have been absorbed into the general cultural milieu.\nArgentine writer Ernesto Sabato has reflected on the nature of the culture of Argentina as follows:\n\n\nLiterature\nAlthough Argentina's rich literary history began around 1550, [343] it reached full independence with Esteban Echeverría's El Matadero, a romantic landmark that played a significant role in the development of 19th century's Argentine narrative, [344] split by the ideological divide between the popular,

Founded in 2010 by Yiftach Swery, YIFY Torrents quickly gained popularity for its high-quality movie releases. In this article, we will explore the history of YIFY, its legacy, and its impact on popular culture.\n\n**History**\n\nYIFY Torrents was founded by Yiftach Swery in 2010 while he was studying computer science at the University of Waikato. Initially, the group operated as a release group, providing high-quality movie releases to the BitTorrent community. In August 2011, the YIFY brand was gaining enough traffic to warrant the launch of an official YIFY Torrents website. However, the website was eventually blocked by United Kingdom authorities due to copyright infringement concerns.\n\nA backup website, yify-torrents.im, was launched for users to bypass this ban. This move allowed YIFY to continue operating, albeit in a limited capacity. The group continued to release high-quality movies, but faced ongoing challenges from copyright holders and law enforcement agencies.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nSince the shutdown of the official YIFY website in 2015, many websites have begun to use the YIFY name unofficially. Some websites claim to be the \"new\" YIFY, while others simply use the name for unrelated purposes such as streaming sites and subtitle download repositories. This has led to confusion among users, with some assuming that these websites are affiliated with the original YIFY group.\n\nThe use of the YIFY name has also been met with criticism from copyright holders and law enforcement agencies. Many have expressed concerns that these websites are simply trying to capitalize on the YIFY brand, without providing any legitimate services. Despite these concerns, the YIFY name remains a popular choice for many file sharers and torrent enthusiasts.\n\n**Unofficial Clones**\n\nThe proliferation of unofficial YIFY websites has led to a number of concerns regarding the legitimacy and safety of these sites. Many of these websites are simply trying to capitalize on the YIFY brand, without providing any legitimate services. This has led to a number of issues, including:\n\n* **Copyright infringement**: Many of these websites are providing pirated copies of copyrighted materials, which is a violation of copyright law.\n* **Malware and viruses**: Some of these websites may be infected with malware or viruses, which can compromise the security of users' devices.\n* **Scams and phishing**: Some of these websites may be scams or phishing sites, which can steal users' personal and financial information.\n\nIt is essential for users to exercise caution when using these websites, and to ensure that they are using legitimate and safe services.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThe YIFY name has made a number of appearances in popular culture, including:\n\n* **Mr. Robot**: In an episode of the second season of the television series Mr. Robot, the lead character Elliot is seen using the μTorrent client, and his Plex folder, filled with films from release groups such as RARBG and YIFY. When approached by TorrentFreak, Yiftach stated that he appreciated the \"badass\" mention.\n* **Music and art**: The YIFY name has been referenced in a number of music and art projects, including songs, albums, and artwork.\n\nThe YIFY name has become a cultural phenomenon, symbolizing the democratization of information and the power of file sharing. While the group has faced numerous challenges and controversies, its impact on popular culture remains significant.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nYIFY is a name that has become synonymous with BitTorrent and file sharing. Founded in 2010 by Yiftach Swery, YIFY Torrents quickly gained popularity for its high-quality movie releases. Despite the shutdown of the official YIFY website in 2015, the YIFY name remains a popular choice for many file sharers and torrent enthusiasts.

Pennsylvania Alongside his new producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry, Phil travels to Punxsutawney for his annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festivities He makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there, asserting that he will soon be leaving his station for a new job.\n\n\nCast\nAs well as the main cast, Groundhog Day features Ken Hudson Campbell as the man in the hotel hallway, David Pasquesi as Phil's psychiatrist, and Richard Henzel and Rob Riley as the radio hosts waking Phil every morning Hynden Walch and Michael Shannon portray the newly married couple Debbie and Fred Les Podewell plays the homeless old man and Rod Sell appears as a Groundhog Day official Director Harold Ramis cameos as a neurologist Punxsutawney Phil is portrayed by a groundhog known as Scooter [1] [2]\n\n\nProduction\nThe original idea for Groundhog Day came to writer Danny Rubin in 1990 He had moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter While waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading Anne Rice's book The Vampire Lestat (1985) [3] [4] [5] Rubin began musing about vampiric immortality and what one would do with their

waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading Anne Rice's book The Vampire Lestat (1985) [3] [4] [5] Rubin began musing about vampiric immortality and what one would do with their time if it was limitless He reasoned that vampires were like normal people who did not need to adhere to ordinary rules or moral boundaries [4] [5] He questioned if and when immortality would become boring or pointless, and how a person would change over time, especially if they were incapable of substantial change [4] He singled out men he deemed to be in arrested development, who could not outlive their adolescence [4] [5]\n\n\nDevelopment\nRubin's agent used the script to arrange meetings with producers; although it did not sell, the meetings generated other work for him [4] [5] In 1991, after his agent left the industry, Rubin distributed the Groundhog Day script in an effort to secure a new representative It came to the attention of Richard Lovett at Creative Arts Agency [5] [11] Lovett said that he could not represent Rubin, but passed the script to his own client, Harold Ramis [5]\n\n\nWriting\nRubin admitted to becoming defensive about the studio's changes He was concerned that they would remove what he saw as innovative plot points and turn it into a generic comedy film [4] Ramis supervised the rewrite, [12] tasked with balancing Rubin's desire for originality and the studio's demand for a broad comedy [3] The pair loosely used the Kübler-Ross model of the five stages of grief—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—as an outline [15] [12] Ramis imagined himself in Phil's situation and the things he would do and feel if in the same cycle of entrapment [12] The pair spent weeks revising the script [6] Ramis suggested that Rubin's original ending, with Rita trapped in her own loop, be removed He felt that audiences would dislike this as it offered no catharsis [11] [16] Similarly, he felt it was important to retain the story's darker elements, such as Phil's suicides, as these compensated for the necessary sentimental moments [12]\n\n\nCasting\nFor the role of Phil Connors, Chevy Chase, Tom Hanks, and Michael Keaton were also considered [34] [35] [36] Hanks was Ramis's first choice, but he rejected the offer, rationalizing that he was typecast portraying nice people, and the audience would be expecting his inevitable redemption, whereas Murray was \"such a miserable  [son of a bitch] on- and off-screen\" that the outcome would be less predictable Keaton said that the role of a \"wry, sardonic, glib\" character was a typical role for him, but that he simply did not understand the film He later confessed regret in passing on the role [35] [36] Phil was written as a younger man, but this was changed when it was determined that the appropriate comic actors were all older [37]\n\n\nPreproduction\nThe production wanted to use a \"quintessential American town\" for location shooting, a place that did not look as if it was specific to any particular time period [7] The Pennsylvania Film Commission provided location scouting tapes of Punxsutawney, but it became obvious that attempting to film in Punxsutawney would present difficulties, as the town had few ideal filming locations for the scripted scenes [7] [27] Punxsutawney was also too isolated from the necessary amenities The rural town was nearly 80 miles (130 km) from Pittsburgh, the nearest large city and did not offer sufficient accommodation for the entire cast and crew [27] [44]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on March 16, 1992, and concluded on June 10, after 86 days [47] The budget was reported to be between $14.6 million and $30 million [1] [27] [48] Filming took place mainly in Woodstock, as well as on sets in Cary, Illinois, and Hollywood [27] [49]\n\n\nRelease\n1993 was considered the year of the family film [58] This was seen as a response to criticism of Hollywood for overusing violence and sex in films, as well as a need for feel-good entertainment in a time of recession [59] [60] As production costs rose, films pitched at both adults and children offered a greater chance being profitable both at the theater and in the ensuing home video rentals By 1993, the three all-time highest-grossing films in North America were family-oriented: E.T the Extra-Terrestrial, Star Wars, and Home Alone Family films encouraged repeat business and offered more opportunities to sell merchandise [59] [60] Columbia Pictures chairman Mark Canton said that PG-rated films were much more likely to make over $100 million, compared to adult-oriented fare Groundhog Day was rated PG, allowing children access with parental permission The film was seen as a potential sleeper success [61] [62]\n\n\nContext\n1993 was considered the

1993, across 1,640 theaters The film earned $12.5 million—an average of $7,632 per theater The film benefited from a four-day weekend due to the President's Day holiday Monday This increased its weekend total to $14.6 million—enhancing the theater average to $8,934 This made it the second-biggest opening for a film released in winter, behind Wayne's World ($18 million) released the year before Groundhog Day finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of romantic drama Sommersby ($9.9 million), and adventure comedy Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey ($8.1 million), both in their second week of release [71] [72] [73] Screenings of the film were approximately 80% sold out 65% of audiences polled said they would \"definitely recommend\" it [74]\n\n\nReception\nGroundhog

Film Critics Circle Awards, the screenplay came runner-up for Best Screenplay, tying with Schindler's List [96] The same year, it won Best Comedy Film at the British Comedy Awards [97] In a then-unprecedented move, in late 1993, Columbia Pictures sent over 4,500 members of the Academy Awards voting committee a custom box containing videotapes of nine of their eligible films The campaign was estimated to have cost between $400,000 and $650,000 Groundhog Day was included among these nine films, [98] [99] but received no nominations at the 66th Academy Awards [100]\n\n\nPost-release\nDespite its relative success, a sequel was ruled out by November 1993 [105] Groundhog Day was one of the films credited with helping to reverse Columbia's failures at the box office, alongside the 1992 films Bram Stoker's Dracula, A Few Good Men and A League of Their Own [106] Shortly after its release, author Richard A Lupoff threatened legal action against the filmmakers, alleging the film copied his short story \"12:01 P.M.\" and its associated 1990 short film adaptation about a man stuck in a time loop The case was never formally filed as the film's production company refused to support legal action [6] [107] Similarly, author Leon Arden attempted legal action, claiming the film plagiarized his novel One Fine Day, which he had unsuccessfully pitched as a script to Columbia Pictures, about a man repeating April 15 The judge ruled against Arden [107] [108]\n\n\nAftermath\nDespite its relative success, a sequel was ruled out by November 1993

Falling Down [111] [112] [113] It remained the number 1 rental until mid-October when it was knocked off the top spot by Point of No Return at number 2 and Aladdin at number 1 [114] [115] It was considered the most successful comedy release of late 1993 [116]\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe duration of Phil's real-time entrapment in the time loop has been the subject of much discussion [35] [127] Ramis once said that he believed the film took place over ten years [35] When a blogger estimated the actual length to be approximately nine years, Ramis disputed that estimate and his own He replied that it takes at least 10 years to become good at an activity (such as Phil learning ice sculpting and to speak French) and \"allotting for the down-time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years.\" [128] A similar estimate suggests that it takes at least 10,000 hours of study (just over a year's worth of time) to become an expert in a field, and given the number of loops seen or mentioned on screen, and how long Phil could spend per day studying, that Phil spent approximately 12,400 days, or nearly 34 years, trapped in the loop [127] In Rubin's original concept draft, Phil himself estimates that he has been trapped for between 70 and 80 years, having used books to track the passage of time [3]\n\n\nTime loop duration\nThe duration of Phil's real-time entrapment in

[3]\n\n\nThematic analysis\nThe film has been interpreted in many ways by different groups [6] [11] Rubin has said that he did not set out to write the film as a spiritual allegory He simply wanted to tell a story about human life and periods when a person becomes trapped in a cycle that they cannot escape [132] He said it was not \"just about a man repeating the same day but a story about how to live Whose life isn't a series of days? Who doesn't feel stuck from time to time?\" [4] In the bowling alley scene, Phil asks two Punxsutawney residents if they understand what it is like to be stuck in a place where nothing they do matters He is referring to his own situation, but the two men, trapped in their own small-town lives, know exactly what he means [85]\n\n\nLegacy\nGroundhog Day is considered one of the most beloved comedy films ever made, an all-time classic, and a pop culture touchstone [7] [145] [146] In 2020, Paste described it as having a \"mythic, permanent pop cultural status reserved for few films.\" [80] The film's success made Ramis a credible comedy director, opening up more creative opportunities for him [147] [148] Over the rest of the 1990s, he would direct 1996's Multiplicity (also starring MacDowell), 1999's Analyze This, and 2000's Bedazzled [11] [148] Groundhog Day also showcased Murray's capabilities as an actor, changing perceptions of him as a comedian to a broad-ranged actor and credible romantic lead His performance is seen as a transitioning point to later roles in serious films like Rushmore (1998), his Academy Award-nominated performance in Lost in Translation, and Moonrise Kingdom (2012) [30] Rubin started a blog in 2007 that featured fictional conversations between himself and Phil Connors, who had since retired to live on a mountainside near Taos, New Mexico Rubin taught screenwriting at Harvard University for several years [6]\n\n\nCritical reassessment\nGroundhog Day is considered one of the greatest films ever made [67] [130] [152] [153] [154] Rotten Tomatoes assesses a 94% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 140 critics, with an average rating of 7.9/10 The consensus reads, \"Smart, sweet, and inventive, Groundhog Day highlights Murray's dramatic gifts while still leaving plenty of room for laughs.\" [155] The film has a score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" [156]\n\n\nCultural impact\nWilliam Goldman in 1993 said \"I think Groundhog Day is the one that will be—of all of the movies that came out this year, it's the one that will be remembered in 10 years.\" [5] The same year, Desson Thomson opined \"Groundhog will never be designated a national film treasure by the Library of Congress.\" [92] In 2006, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" [185]\n\n\nAdaptations\nA sequel was ruled out shortly after the film's release in 1993 [105] Rubin also holds a story credit on the 2004 Italian remake of Groundhog Day, called È già ieri (translated as It's Already Yesterday), and commonly known as Stork Day [6] [40] When asked about a sequel in 2018, MacDowell said it would never happen because \"I know  [Murray] He's not going to do it.\" [208] Despite this, Murray, Tobolowsky, and Doyle-Murray reprised their roles in a commercial for the Jeep Gladiator played during Super Bowl LIV on February 2, 2020 Filmed in Woodstock, the commercial recreates scenes from the film, and features Murray again trapped in a time loop He uses the Jeep Gladiator to explore Punxsutawney alongside Punxsutawney Phil [209] [210] Murray called it his first and last commercial [211] In April 2020, Jeep released a series of modified versions of the advert to promote social distancing during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic Murray provided creative input on the edit [193] [212]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis, written by Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell.

Groundhog Day was included among these nine films, but received no nominations at the 66th Academy Awards.\n\n**Post-Release**\n\nDespite its relative success, a sequel was ruled out by November 1993. Groundhog Day was one of the films credited with helping to reverse Columbia's failures at the box office, alongside the 1992 films Bram Stoker's Dracula, A Few Good Men, and A League of Their Own. Shortly after its release, author Richard A. Lupoff threatened legal action against the filmmakers, alleging the film copied his short story \"12:01 P.M.\" and its associated 1990 short film adaptation about a man stuck in a time loop. The case was never formally filed as the film's production company refused to support legal action.\n\n**Home Media and Rereleases**\n\nGroundhog Day was released on VHS in early September 1993. It debuted at number 11 on the VHS rental chart, rising to number 1 by the end of September, replacing Falling Down. It remained the number 1 rental until mid-October when it was knocked off the top spot by Point of No Return at number 2 and Aladdin at number 1.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe duration of Phil's real-time entrapment in the time loop has been the subject of much discussion. Ramis once said that he believed the film took place over ten years. When a blogger estimated the actual length to be approximately nine years, Ramis disputed that estimate and his own. He replied that it takes at least ten years to become good at an activity (such as Phil learning ice sculpting and to speak French) and \"allotting for the down-time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years.\"\n\nA similar estimate suggests that it takes at least 10,000 hours of study (just over a year's worth of time) to become an expert in a field, and given the number of loops seen or mentioned on screen, and how long Phil could spend per day studying, that Phil spent approximately 12,400 days, or nearly 34 years, trapped in the loop.\n\n**Thematic Analysis**\n\nThe film has been interpreted in many ways by different groups. Rubin has said that he did not set out to write the film as a spiritual allegory. He simply wanted to tell a story about human life and periods when a person becomes trapped in a cycle that they cannot escape. He said it was not \"just about a man repeating the same day but a story about how to live. Whose life isn't a series of days? Who doesn't feel stuck from time to time?\"\n\n**Legacy**\n\nGroundhog Day is considered one of the most beloved comedy films ever made, an all-time classic, and a pop culture touchstone. In 2020, Paste described it as having a \"mythic, permanent pop cultural status reserved for few films.\" The film's success made Ramis a credible comedy director, opening up more creative opportunities for him. Over the rest of the 1990s, he would direct 1996's Multiplicity (also starring MacDowell), 1999's Analyze This, and 2000's Bedazzled.\n\nGroundhog Day also showcased Murray's capabilities as an actor, changing perceptions of him as a comedian to a broad-ranged actor and credible romantic lead. His performance is seen as a transitioning point to later roles in serious films like Rushmore (1998), his Academy Award-nominated performance in Lost in Translation, and Moonrise Kingdom (2012).\n\n**Critical Reassessment**\n\nGroundhog Day is considered one of the greatest films ever made. Rotten Tomatoes assesses a 94% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 140 critics, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The consensus reads, \"Smart, sweet, and inventive, Groundhog Day highlights Murray's dramatic gifts while still leaving plenty of room for laughs.\" The film has a score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\n**Cultural Impact**\n\nWilliam Goldman in 1993 said \"I think Groundhog Day is the one that will be—of all of the movies that came out this year, it's the one that will be remembered in 10 years.\" The same year, Desson Thomson opined \"Groundhog will never be designated a national film treasure by the Library of Congress.\" In 2006, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nA sequel was ruled out shortly after the film's release in 1993. Rubin also holds a story credit on the 2004 Italian remake of Groundhog Day, called È già ieri (translated as It's Already Yesterday), and commonly known as Stork Day. When asked about a sequel in 2018, MacDowell said it would never happen because \"I know [Murray]. He's not going to do it.\" Despite this, Murray, Tobolowsky, and Doyle-Murray reprised their roles in a commercial for the Jeep Gladiator played during Super Bowl LIV on February 2, 2020.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Groundhog_Day_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nOn February 1, cynical television weatherman Phil Connors reassures his Pittsburgh viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss Western Pennsylvania Alongside his new producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry, Phil travels to Punxsutawney for his annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festivities He makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there, asserting that he will soon be leaving his station for a new job.\n\n\nCast\nAs well as the main cast, Groundhog Day features Ken Hudson Campbell as the man in the hotel hallway, David Pasquesi as Phil's psychiatrist, and Richard Henzel and Rob Riley as the radio hosts waking Phil every morning Hynden Walch and Michael Shannon portray the newly married couple Debbie and Fred Les Podewell plays the homeless old man and Rod Sell appears as a Groundhog Day official Director Harold Ramis cameos as a neurologist Punxsutawney Phil is portrayed by a groundhog known as Scooter [1] [2]\n\n\nProduction\nThe original idea for Groundhog Day came to writer Danny Rubin in 1990 He had moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter While waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading Anne Rice's book The Vampire Lestat (1985) [3] [4] [5] Rubin began musing about vampiric immortality and what one would do with their time if it was limitless He reasoned that vampires were like normal people who did not need to adhere to ordinary rules or moral boundaries [4] [5] He questioned if and when immortality would become boring or pointless, and how a person would change over time, especially if they were incapable of substantial change [4] He singled out men he deemed to be in arrested development, who could not outlive their adolescence [4] [5]\n\n\nConcept and original draft\nThe original idea for Groundhog Day came to writer Danny Rubin in 1990 He had moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter While waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading Anne Rice's book The Vampire Lestat (1985) [3] [4] [5] Rubin began musing about vampiric immortality and what one would do with their time if it was limitless He reasoned that vampires were like normal people who did not need to adhere to ordinary rules or moral boundaries [4] [5] He questioned if and when immortality would become boring or pointless, and how a person would change over time, especially if they were incapable of substantial change [4] He singled out men he deemed to be in arrested development, who could not outlive their adolescence [4] [5]\n\n\nDevelopment\nRubin's agent used the script to arrange meetings with producers; although it did not sell, the meetings generated other work for him [4] [5] In 1991, after his agent left the industry, Rubin distributed the Groundhog Day script in an effort to secure a new representative It came to the attention of Richard Lovett at Creative Arts Agency [5] [11] Lovett said that he could not represent Rubin, but passed the script to his own client, Harold Ramis [5]\n\n\nWriting\nRubin admitted to becoming defensive about the studio's changes He was concerned that they would remove what he saw as innovative plot points and turn it into a generic comedy film [4] Ramis supervised the rewrite, [12] tasked with balancing Rubin's desire for originality and the studio's demand for a broad comedy [3] The pair loosely used the Kübler-Ross model of the five stages of grief—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—as an outline [15] [12] Ramis imagined himself in Phil's situation and the things he would do and feel if in the same cycle of entrapment [12] The pair spent weeks revising the script [6] Ramis suggested that Rubin's original ending, with Rita trapped in her own loop, be removed He felt that audiences would dislike this as it offered no catharsis [11] [16] Similarly, he felt it was important to retain the story's darker elements, such as Phil's suicides, as these compensated for the necessary sentimental moments [12]\n\n\nCasting\nFor the role of Phil Connors, Chevy Chase, Tom Hanks, and Michael Keaton were also considered [34] [35] [36] Hanks was Ramis's first choice, but he rejected the offer, rationalizing that he was typecast portraying nice people, and the audience would be expecting his inevitable redemption, whereas Murray was \"such a miserable  [son of a bitch] on- and off-screen\" that the outcome would be less predictable Keaton said that the role of a \"wry, sardonic, glib\" character was a typical role for him, but that he simply did not understand the film He later confessed regret in passing on the role [35] [36] Phil was written as a younger man, but this was changed when it was determined that the appropriate comic actors were all older [37]\n\n\nPreproduction\nThe production wanted to use a \"quintessential American town\" for location shooting, a place that did not look as if it was specific to any particular time period [7] The Pennsylvania Film Commission provided location scouting tapes of Punxsutawney, but it became obvious that attempting to film in Punxsutawney would present difficulties, as the town had few ideal filming locations for the scripted scenes [7] [27] Punxsutawney was also too isolated from the necessary amenities The rural town was nearly 80 miles (130 km) from Pittsburgh, the nearest large city and did not offer sufficient accommodation for the entire cast and crew [27] [44]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on March 16, 1992, and concluded on June 10, after 86 days [47] The budget was reported to be between $14.6 million and $30 million [1] [27] [48] Filming took place mainly in Woodstock, as well as on sets in Cary, Illinois, and Hollywood [27] [49]\n\n\nRelease\n1993 was considered the year of the family film [58] This was seen as a response to criticism of Hollywood for overusing violence and sex in films, as well as a need for feel-good entertainment in a time of recession [59] [60] As production costs rose, films pitched at both adults and children offered a greater chance being profitable both at the theater and in the ensuing home video rentals By 1993, the three all-time highest-grossing films in North America were family-oriented: E.T the Extra-Terrestrial, Star Wars, and Home Alone Family films encouraged repeat business and offered more opportunities to sell merchandise [59] [60] Columbia Pictures chairman Mark Canton said that PG-rated films were much more likely to make over $100 million, compared to adult-oriented fare Groundhog Day was rated PG, allowing children access with parental permission The film was seen as a potential sleeper success [61] [62]\n\n\nContext\n1993 was considered the year of the family film [58] This was seen as a response to criticism of Hollywood for overusing violence

benefited from a four-day weekend due to the President's Day holiday Monday This increased its weekend total to $14.6 million—enhancing the theater average to $8,934 This made it the second-biggest opening for a film released in winter, behind Wayne's World ($18 million) released the year before Groundhog Day finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of romantic drama Sommersby ($9.9 million), and adventure comedy Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey ($8.1 million), both in their second week of release [71] [72] [73] Screenings of the film were approximately 80% sold out 65% of audiences polled said they would \"definitely recommend\" it [74]\n\n\nReception\nGroundhog Day received generally positive reviews from critics [86] CinemaScore polls reported that moviegoers

has Sheldon (usually in bow tie, checked shirt, shorts and cowboy boots) walking out, standing triumphantly, noticing a cow, and backing away from it before resuming his triumphant look as the logo appears and tilts to the sky Occasionally, a tumbleweed appears, instead of the cow The title sequence was changed from Season 3 onwards to include the entire Cooper family, as well as showing Sheldon

{"title": "United_States_House_of_Representatives", "content": "\nHistory\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the Congress of the Confederation was a unicameral body with equal representation for each state, any of which could veto most actions After eight years of a more limited confederal government under the Articles, numerous political leaders such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton initiated the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which received the Confederation Congress's sanction to \"amend the Articles of Confederation\" All states except Rhode Island agreed to send delegates.\n\n\nMembership, qualifications, and apportionment\nUnder Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states by population, as determined by the census conducted every ten years Each state is entitled to at least one representative, however small its population.\n\n\nApportionments\nUnder Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states by population, as determined by the census conducted every ten years Each state is entitled to at least one representative, however small its population.\n\n\nRedistricting\nStates entitled to more than one representative are divided into single-member districts This has been a federal statutory requirement since 1967 pursuant to the act titled An Act For the relief of Doctor Ricardo Vallejo Samala and to provide for congressional redistricting [18] Before that law, general ticket representation was used by some states.\n\n\nQualifications\nArticle I, Section 2 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for representatives Each representative must: (1) be at least twenty-five (25) years old; (2) have been a citizen of the United States for the past seven years; and (3) be (at the time of the election) an inhabitant of the state they represent Members are not required to live in the districts they represent, but they traditionally do [24] The age and citizenship qualifications for representatives are less than those for senators The constitutional requirements of Article I, Section 2 for election to Congress are the maximum requirements that can be imposed on a candidate [25] Therefore, Article I, Section 5, which permits each House to be the judge of the qualifications of its own members does not permit either House to establish additional qualifications Likewise a State could not establish additional qualifications William C C Claiborne served in the House below the minimum age of 25 [26]\n\n\nElections\nElections for representatives are held in every even-numbered year, on Election Day the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November Pursuant to the Uniform Congressional District Act, representatives must be elected from single-member districts After a census is taken (in a year ending in 0), the year ending in 2 is the first year in which elections for U.S House districts are based on that census (with the Congress based on those districts starting its term on the following January 3) As there is no legislation at the federal level mandating one particular system for elections to the House, systems are set at the state level As of 2022, first-past-the-post or plurality voting is used in 46 states, electing 412 representatives, ranked-choice or instant-runoff voting in two states (Alaska and Maine), electing 3 representatives, and two-round system in two states (Georgia and Louisiana), electing 20 representatives Elected representatives serve a two-year term, with no term limit.\n\n\nNon-voting delegates\nHistorically, many territories have sent non-voting delegates to the House While their role has fluctuated over the years, today they have many of the same privileges as voting members, have a voice in committees, and can introduce bills on the floor, but cannot vote on the ultimate passage of bills Presently, the District of Columbia and the five inhabited U.S territories each elect a delegate A seventh delegate, representing the Cherokee Nation, has been formally proposed but has not yet been seated [30] An eighth delegate, representing the Choctaw Nation is guaranteed by treaty but has not yet been proposed Additionally, some territories may choose to also elect shadow representatives, though these are not official members of the House and are separate individuals from their official delegates.\n\n\nTerms\nRepresentatives and delegates serve for two-year terms, while a resident commissioner (a kind of delegate) serves for four years A term starts on January 3 following the election in November The U.S Constitution requires that vacancies in the House be filled with a special election The term of the replacement member expires on the date that the original member's would have expired.\n\n\nComparison to the Senate\nAs a check on the regional, popular, and rapidly changing politics of the House, the Senate has several distinct powers For example, the \"advice and consent\" powers (such as the power to approve treaties and confirm members of the Cabinet) are a sole Senate privilege [34] The House, however, has the exclusive power to initiate bills for raising revenue, to impeach officials, and to choose the president if a presidential candidate fails to get a majority of the Electoral College votes [35] Both House and Senate confirmation is now required to fill a vacancy if the vice presidency is vacant, according to the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment [36] [37] The Senate and House are further differentiated by term lengths and the number of districts represented: the Senate has longer terms of six years, fewer members (currently one hundred, two for each state), and (in all but seven delegations) larger constituencies per member The Senate is referred to as the \"upper\" house, and the House of Representatives as the \"lower\" house.\n\n\nSalary and benefits\nSince December 2014, the annual salary of each representative is $174,000, [38] [39] the same as it is for each member of the Senate [40] The speaker of the House and the majority and minority leaders earn more: $223,500 for the speaker and $193,400 for their party leaders (the same as Senate leaders) [39] A cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) increase takes effect annually unless Congress votes not to accept it Congress sets members' salaries; however, the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a change in salary (but not COLA [41]) from taking effect until after the next election of the whole House Representatives are eligible for retirement benefits after serving for five years [42] Outside pay is limited to 15% of congressional pay, and certain types of income involving a fiduciary responsibility or personal endorsement are prohibited Salaries are not for life, only during active term [39]\n\n\nSalaries\nSince December 2014, the annual salary of each representative is $174,000, [38] [39] the same as it is for each member of the Senate [40] The speaker of the House and the majority and minority leaders earn more: $223,500 for the speaker and $193,400 for their party leaders (the same as Senate leaders) [39] A cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) increase takes effect annually unless Congress votes not to accept it Congress sets members' salaries; however, the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a change in salary (but not COLA [41]) from taking effect until after the next election of the whole House Representatives are eligible for retirement benefits after serving for five years [42] Outside pay is limited to 15% of congressional pay, and certain types of income involving a fiduciary responsibility or personal endorsement are prohibited Salaries are not for life, only during active term [39]\n\n\nTitles\nRepresentatives use the prefix \"The Honorable\" before their names A member of the House is referred to as a representative, congressman, or congresswoman.\n\n\nPension\nAll members of Congress are automatically enrolled in the Federal Employees Retirement System, a pension system also used for federal civil servants, except the formula for calculating Congress members' pension results in a 70% higher pension than other federal employees based on the first 20 years of service [44] They become eligible to receive benefits after five years of service (two and one-half terms in the House) The FERS is composed of three elements:\n\n\nTax deductions\nMembers of Congress are permitted to deduct up to $3,000 of living expenses per year incurred while living away from their district or home state [46]\n\n\nHealth benefits\nBefore 2014, members of Congress and their staff had access to essentially the same health benefits as federal civil servants; they could voluntarily enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), an employer-sponsored health insurance program, and were eligible to participate in other programs, such as the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS) [47]\n\n\nPersonnel, mail and office expenses\nHouse members are eligible for a Member's Representational Allowance (MRA) to support them in their official and representational duties to their district [48] The MRA is calculated based on three components: one for personnel, one for official office expenses and one for official or franked mail The personnel allowance is the same for all members; the office and mail allowances vary based on the members' district's distance from Washington, D.C., the cost of office space in the member's district, and the number of non-business addresses in their district These three components are used to calculate a single MRA that can fund any expense—even though each component is calculated individually, the franking allowance can be used to pay for personnel expenses if the member so chooses In 2011 this allowance averaged $1.4 million per member, and ranged from $1.35 to $1.67 million [49]\n\n\nTravel allowance\nBefore being sworn into office each member-elect and one staffer can be paid for one round trip between their home in their congressional district and Washington, D.C for organization caucuses [49] Members are allowed \"a sum for travel based on the following formula: 64 times the rate per mile .. multiplied by the mileage between Washington, DC, and the furthest point in a Member's district, plus 10%.\" [49] As of January 2012 [update] the rate ranges from $0.41 to $1.32 per mile ($0.25 to $0.82/km) based on distance ranges between D.C and the member's district [49]\n\n\nOfficers\nThe party with a majority of seats in the House is known as the majority party The next-largest party is the minority party The speaker, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party; they have counterparts (for instance, the \"ranking members\" of committees) in the minority party.\n\n\nMember officials\nThe party with a majority of seats in the House is known as the majority party The next-largest party is the minority party The speaker, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party;

It is the lower house of the federal legislature, with 435 voting members elected by the people of the 50 states. The House is often referred to as the \"House of Representatives\" or simply \"the House.\"\n\n**History**\n\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the Congress of the Confederation was a unicameral body with equal representation for each state, any of which could veto most actions. After eight years of a more limited confederal government under the Articles, numerous political leaders such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton initiated the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which received the Confederation Congress's sanction to \"amend the Articles of Confederation.\" All states except Rhode Island agreed to send delegates.\n\n**Membership, Qualifications, and Apportionment**\n\nUnder Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states by population, as determined by the census conducted every ten years. Each state is entitled to at least one representative, however small its population. Representatives must meet certain qualifications, including being at least 25 years old, a citizen of the United States for at least seven years, and a resident of the state they represent.\n\n**Elections**\n\nElections for representatives are held in every even-numbered year, on Election Day, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Representatives must be elected from single-member districts. After a census is taken (in a year ending in 0), the year ending in 2 is the first year in which elections for U.S House districts are based on that census. As there is no legislation at the federal level mandating one particular system for elections to the House, systems are set at the state level.\n\n**Non-Voting Delegates**\n\nHistorically, many territories have sent non-voting delegates to the House. While their role has fluctuated over the years, today they have many of the same privileges as voting members, have a voice in committees, and can introduce bills on the floor, but cannot vote on the ultimate passage of bills. Presently, the District of Columbia and the five inhabited U.S territories each elect a delegate.\n\n**Terms**\n\nRepresentatives and delegates serve for two-year terms, while a resident commissioner (a kind of delegate) serves for four years. A term starts on January 3 following the election in November.\n\n**Comparison to the Senate**\n\nAs a check on the regional, popular, and rapidly changing politics of the House, the Senate has several distinct powers. For example, the \"advice and consent\" powers (such as the power to approve treaties and confirm members of the Cabinet) are a sole Senate privilege. The House, however, has the exclusive power to initiate bills for raising revenue, to impeach officials, and to choose the president if a presidential candidate fails to get a majority of the Electoral College votes.\n\n**Salary and Benefits**\n\nSince December 2014, the annual salary of each representative is $174,000. The speaker of the House and the majority and minority leaders earn more: $223,500 for the speaker and $193,400 for their party leaders. A cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) increase takes effect annually unless Congress votes not to accept it. Representatives are eligible for retirement benefits after serving for five years.\n\n**Titles**\n\nRepresentatives use the prefix \"The Honorable\" before their names. A member of the House is referred to as a representative, congressman, or congresswoman.\n\n**Pension**\n\nAll members of Congress are automatically enrolled in the Federal Employees Retirement System, a pension system also used for federal civil servants. They become eligible to receive benefits after five years of service (two and one-half terms in the House).\n\n**Personnel, Mail and Office Expenses**\n\nHouse members are eligible for a Member's Representational Allowance (MRA) to support them in their official and representational duties to their district. The MRA is calculated based on three components: one for personnel, one for official office expenses, and one for official or franked mail.\n\n**Travel Allowance**\n\nMembers are allowed \"a sum for travel based on the following formula: 64 times the rate per mile .. multiplied by the mileage between Washington, DC, and the furthest point in a Member's district, plus 10%.\"\n\n**Officers**\n\nThe party with a majority of seats in the House is known as the majority party. The next-largest party is the minority party. The speaker, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party; they have counterparts (for instance, the \"ranking members\" of committees) in the minority party.\n\n**Procedure**\n\nLike the Senate, the House of Representatives meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. At one end of the chamber of the House is a rostrum from which the speaker, Speaker pro tempore, or (when in Committee of the Whole House) the chair presides. Members' seats are arranged in the chamber in a semicircular pattern facing the rostrum and are divided by a wide central aisle.\n\n**Committees and Caucuses**\n\nThe House uses committees and their subcommittees for a variety of purposes, including the review of bills and the oversight of the executive branch. The appointment of committee members is formally made by the whole House, but the choice of members is actually made by the political parties.\n\n**Legislative Functions**\n\nMost bills may be introduced in either House of Congress. However, the Constitution states, \"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\" Because of the Origination Clause, the Senate cannot initiate bills imposing taxes.\n\n**Checks and Balances**\n\nThe Constitution provides that the Senate's \"advice and consent\" is necessary for the president to make appointments and to ratify treaties. Thus, with its potential to frustrate presidential appointments, the Senate is more powerful than the House.\n\n**Latest Election Results and Party Standings**\n\nAs of July 10, 2024, the latest election results and party standings are as follows:\n\n**See Also**\n\n* United States Congress\n* Senate\n* Presidency of the United States\n* House of Representatives of the United States\n\n**References**\n\n* \n\n**Sources and Further Reading**\n\n* \n\n**Surveys**\n\n* \n\n**External Links**\n\n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"United_States_House_of_Representatives\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the Congress of the Confederation was a unicameral body with equal representation for each state, any of which could veto most actions After eight years of a more limited confederal government under the Articles, numerous political leaders such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton initiated the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which received the Confederation Congress's sanction to \"amend the Articles of Confederation\" All states except Rhode Island agreed to send delegates.\n\n\nMembership, qualifications, and apportionment\nUnder Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states by population, as determined by the census conducted every ten years Each state is entitled to at least one representative, however small its population.\n\n\nApportionments\nUnder Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states by population, as determined by the census conducted every ten years Each state is entitled to at least one representative, however small its population.\n\n\nRedistricting\nStates entitled to more than one representative are divided into single-member districts This has been a federal statutory requirement since 1967 pursuant to the act titled An Act For the relief of Doctor Ricardo Vallejo Samala and to provide for congressional redistricting [18] Before that law, general ticket representation was used by some states.\n\n\nQualifications\nArticle I, Section 2 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for representatives Each representative must: (1) be at least twenty-five (25) years old; (2) have been a citizen of the United States for the past seven years; and (3) be (at the time of the election) an inhabitant of the state they represent Members are not required to live in the districts they represent, but they traditionally do [24] The age and citizenship qualifications for representatives are less than those for senators The constitutional requirements of Article I, Section 2 for election to Congress are the maximum requirements that can be imposed on a candidate [25] Therefore, Article I, Section 5, which permits each House to be the judge of the qualifications of its own members does not permit either House to establish additional qualifications Likewise a State could not establish additional qualifications William C C Claiborne served in the House below the minimum age of 25 [26]\n\n\nElections\nElections for representatives are held in every even-numbered year, on Election Day the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November Pursuant to the Uniform Congressional District Act, representatives must be elected from single-member districts After a census is taken (in a year ending in 0), the year ending in 2 is the first year in which elections for U.S House districts are based on that census (with the Congress based on those districts starting its term on the following January 3) As there is no legislation at the federal level mandating one particular system for elections to the House, systems are set at the state level As of 2022, first-past-the-post or plurality voting is used in 46 states, electing 412 representatives, ranked-choice or instant-runoff voting in two states (Alaska and Maine), electing 3 representatives, and two-round system in two states (Georgia and Louisiana), electing 20 representatives Elected representatives serve a two-year term, with no term limit.\n\n\nNon-voting delegates\nHistorically, many territories have sent non-voting delegates to the House While their role has fluctuated over the years, today they have many of the same privileges as voting members, have a voice in committees, and can introduce bills on the floor, but cannot vote on the ultimate passage of bills Presently, the District of Columbia and the five inhabited U.S territories each elect a delegate A seventh delegate, representing the Cherokee Nation, has been formally proposed but has not yet been seated [30] An eighth delegate, representing the Choctaw Nation is guaranteed by treaty but has not yet been proposed Additionally, some territories may choose to also elect shadow representatives, though these are not official members of the House and are separate individuals from their official delegates.\n\n\nTerms\nRepresentatives and delegates serve for two-year terms, while a resident commissioner (a kind of delegate) serves for four years A term starts on January 3 following the election in November The U.S Constitution requires that vacancies in the House be filled with a special election The term of the replacement member expires on the date that the original member's would have expired.\n\n\nComparison to the Senate\nAs a check on the regional, popular, and rapidly changing politics of the House, the Senate has several distinct powers For example, the \"advice and consent\" powers (such as the power to approve treaties and confirm members of the Cabinet) are a sole Senate privilege [34] The House, however, has the exclusive power to initiate bills for raising revenue, to impeach officials, and to choose the president if a presidential candidate fails to get a majority of the Electoral College votes [35] Both House and Senate confirmation is now required to fill a vacancy if the vice presidency is vacant, according to the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment [36] [37] The Senate and House are further differentiated by term lengths and the number of districts represented: the Senate has longer terms of six years, fewer members (currently one hundred, two for each state), and (in all but seven delegations) larger constituencies per member The Senate is referred to as the \"upper\" house, and the House of Representatives as the \"lower\" house.\n\n\nSalary and benefits\nSince December 2014, the annual salary of each representative is $174,000, [38] [39] the same as it is for each member of the Senate [40] The speaker of the House and the majority and minority leaders earn more: $223,500 for the speaker and $193,400 for their party leaders (the same as Senate leaders) [39] A cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) increase takes effect annually unless Congress votes not to accept it Congress sets members' salaries; however, the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a change in salary (but not COLA [41]) from taking effect until after the next election of the whole House Representatives are eligible for retirement benefits after serving for five years [42] Outside pay is limited to 15% of congressional pay, and certain types of income involving a fiduciary responsibility or personal endorsement are prohibited Salaries are not for life, only during active term [39]\n\n\nSalaries\nSince December 2014, the annual salary of each representative is $174,000, [38] [39] the same as it is for each member of the Senate [40] The speaker of the House and the majority and minority leaders earn more: $223,500 for the speaker and $193,400 for their party leaders (the same as Senate leaders) [39] A cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) increase takes effect annually unless Congress votes not to accept it Congress sets members' salaries;

they could voluntarily enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), an employer-sponsored health insurance program, and were eligible to participate in other programs, such as the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS) [47]\n\n\nPersonnel, mail and office expenses\nHouse members are eligible for a Member's Representational Allowance (MRA) to support them in their official and representational duties to their district [48] The MRA is calculated based on three components: one for personnel, one for official office expenses and one for official or franked mail The personnel allowance is the same for all members; the office and mail allowances vary based on the members' district's distance from Washington, D.C., the cost of office space in the member's district, and the number of non-business addresses in their district These three components are used to calculate a single MRA that can fund any expense—even though each component is calculated individually, the franking allowance can be used to pay for personnel expenses if the member so chooses In 2011 this allowance averaged $1.4 million per member, and ranged from $1.35 to $1.67 million [49]\n\n\nTravel allowance\nBefore being sworn into office each member-elect and one staffer can be paid for one round trip between their home in their congressional district and Washington, D.C for organization caucuses [49] Members are allowed \"a sum for travel based on the following formula: 64 times the rate per mile .. multiplied by the mileage between Washington, DC, and the furthest point in a Member's district, plus 10%.\" [49] As of January 2012 [update] the rate ranges from $0.41 to $1.32 per mile ($0.25 to $0.82/km) based on distance ranges between D.C and the member's district [49]\n\n\nOfficers\nThe party with a majority of seats in the House is known as the majority party The next-largest party is the minority party The speaker, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party;

Her tireless efforts, which spanned over two decades, were marked by her unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth and ensuring that those responsible for the tragedy were held accountable.\n\n**Hillsborough**\n\nThe Hillsborough disaster occurred on April 15, 1989, during a football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, England. The tragedy resulted in the deaths of 96 people, with over 750 injured. One of the victims was 15-year-old Kevin Williams, Anne's son. The incident was one of the most devastating in British sporting history, and it would go on to have a profound impact on Anne's life.\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, Anne was determined to uncover the truth about the events that led to her son's death. She began to question the official narrative of the disaster, which had been presented by the authorities. She was particularly concerned about the role of the police and the stadium's safety measures, which she believed had contributed to the tragedy. Anne's efforts to seek justice for her son were met with resistance from the authorities, but she remained undeterred.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nAnne Williams was born on February 6, 1951, in Formby, Merseyside. She grew up in a close-knit family and was educated at Our Lady of Lourdes school in Birkdale. After completing her education, Anne married her first husband and had two sons, including Kevin. The family lived in Formby, where Anne worked part-time in a newsagents.\n\nIn 1989, Anne's life was forever changed when her son Kevin died in the Hillsborough disaster. The tragedy had a profound impact on Anne, and she became consumed by her desire for justice. She divorced her first husband and married Steve Williams, with whom she had a daughter. However, the relationship broke down in the years following Hillsborough, and Anne was left to care for her children on her own.\n\n**Forming the Hillsborough Justice Campaign**\n\nIn 1991, Anne formed a pressure group called \"Hope for Hillsborough,\" which aimed to raise awareness about the Hillsborough disaster and push for a new inquiry into the tragedy. The group was later merged with the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which became a leading voice in the campaign for justice for the victims and their families. Anne became the chair of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, and her leadership played a crucial role in galvanizing the movement.\n\nThroughout her life, Anne faced numerous challenges and setbacks, including intimidation, harassment, and even physical violence. However, she remained steadfast in her commitment to seeking justice for her son and the other victims of Hillsborough. Her tireless efforts helped to raise awareness about the tragedy and push for a new inquiry, which was finally established in 1998.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nAnne Williams' legacy extends far beyond her own personal struggles and achievements. Her tireless efforts to seek justice for her son and the other victims of Hillsborough have inspired countless people across the country. Her determination and resilience in the face of adversity have made her a beacon of hope for those fighting for justice and truth.\n\nIn recognition of her outstanding contributions, Anne was posthumously awarded the Helen Rollason Award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards in 2013. The award, which honors individuals who have overcome adversity to achieve their goals, was a testament to Anne's unwavering commitment to seeking justice.\n\n**In media**\n\nAnne Williams' story has captivated audiences and inspired a new generation of activists and advocates. Her life and struggles were portrayed in the ITV drama \"Anne,\" which aired in January 2022. The drama, which starred Maxine Peake as Anne, was widely praised for its poignant and powerful portrayal of a mother's love and determination.\n\nWriting in The Guardian, Jack Seale described the performance as \"Almost unwatchably intense.\" The drama highlighted the human cost of the Hillsborough disaster and the tireless efforts of Anne and the Hillsborough Justice Campaign to uncover the truth. The film served as a powerful reminder of the importance of seeking justice and truth, even in the face of adversity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAnne Williams' legacy is a testament to the power of determination and resilience in the face of adversity. Her tireless efforts to seek justice for her son and the other victims of Hillsborough have inspired countless people across the country. Her story serves as a reminder of the importance of seeking truth and accountability, even in the most difficult and challenging circumstances. As a mother, a friend, and a champion of justice, Anne Williams will always be remembered as a true hero of the Hillsborough disaster.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anne_Williams_(activist)\" following this outline:\n\n\nHillsborough\nWilliams fought hard for a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, her actions being prompted by the death of her own son Kevin at  Hillsborough, who had been crushed to death in the disaster, aged 15 She levelled several legal attacks at the first Hillsborough inquest, questioning the credibility of its findings [1] She formed a pressure group \"Hope For Hillsborough\", subsequently merging it into the \"Hillsborough Justice Campaign\", eventually becoming chair of the latter [2]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWilliams was born at Formby on 6 February 1951 [2] After education at Our Lady of Lourdes school, Birkdale, she became a mother of three, living in Formby and working part-time in a newsagents She had two sons by her first husband, the younger of whom was Kevin After a divorce, she married Steve Williams, with whom she had a daughter [2] That relationship broke down in the years after Hillsborough [2]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn December 2013, in honour of Williams' long campaign for justice for her son Kevin and all the victims of Hillsborough, she was posthumously awarded the Helen Rollason Award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards [4] Alan Hansen, who had been playing for Liverpool on the day of the tragedy, presented the award to Anne's brother Danny, her son Michael and daughter Sara She received a standing ovation from the audience [5]\n\n\nIn media\nWilliams was portrayed by Maxine Peake in the eponymous ITV drama Anne, which aired in January 2022 [6] Writing in The Guardian, Jack Seale described the performance as \"Almost unwatchably intense\" [6]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

and J R R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy [5] [6] Some of the first graphical computer RPGs (CRPGs) after pedit5 and dnd included orthanc (1978), [7] which was named after Saruman's tower in Lord of the Rings, [8] avathar (1979), [3] later renamed avatar, oubliette (1977), [9] named after the French word for \"dungeon\", [8] moria (1975), [3] dungeons of degorath, baradur, emprise, bnd, sorcery, and dndworld [Note 3] All of these were developed and became popular on the PLATO system during the late 1970s, in large part due to PLATO's speed, fast graphics, and large number of players with access to its nationwide network of terminals PLATO was a mainframe system that supported multiple users and allowed them to play simultaneously, a feature not commonly available to owners of home personal computer systems at the time [10] These were followed by games on other platforms, such as Temple of Apshai, written in 1979 for the TRS-80 and followed by two add-ons; Akalabeth: World of Doom (1980), which gave rise to the well-known Ultima series; [11] Wizardry (1981), and Sword of Fargoal (1982) Games of this era were also influenced by text adventures such as Colossal Cave Adventure (1976) and Zork (1976); early MUDs, tabletop wargames such as Chainmail (1971), and sports games such as Strat-O-Matic [12] [Note 4]\n\n\nMainframe computers (mid-1970s–early 1980s)\nThe

[12] [Note 4]\n\n\nUltima and Wizardry (early–mid-1980s)\nAlthough simplified for use with the console gamepad, many innovations of the early Ultimas—in particular Ultima III: Exodus (1983) by developer Richard Garriott—became standard among later RPGs in both the personal computer and console markets These ideas included the use of tiled graphics and party-based combat, a mix of fantasy and science-fiction elements, and time travel [6] [19] [Note 6] The game's written narrative was an innovative feature that allowed it to convey a larger story than was found in the minimal plots common at the time Most games, including Garriott's own Akalabeth, focused primarily on basic gameplay mechanics like combat, and paid little attention to story and narrative [21]\n\n\nGolden Age (late 1980s–early 1990s)\nThe Might and Magic series, highly popular in the 1980s and onward, began with the 1986 release of Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum for the Apple II It encompasses a total of ten games, the most recent of which was released in 2014, as well as the popular turn-based strategy series Heroes of Might and Magic The series featured a mix of complex statistics, large numbers of weapons and spells, and enormous worlds in which to play [33] It was among the longest-lived CRPG series, alongside Ultima and Wizardry, [34] It is also notable for making race and gender an important aspect of gameplay [6] [33]\n\n\nDecline (mid-1990s)\nProbably one of the saddest sights over the last couple of years has been the rapid decline in computer role-playing games  [...] The emphasis  [among newer CRPGs, such as Ultima VIII: Pagan] is on bigger on-screen characters with more realistic animation in a smaller game world  [...] This seems to be a part of a design philosophy which says that computer gamers don't want to play the big games any longer.\n\n\nNorth American computer RPGs (late 1990s)\nThe dark fantasy-themed RPG Diablo was released by Blizzard Entertainment on December 31, 1996, in the midst of a stagnant PC RPG market [6] [64] Diablo is set in the fictional kingdom of Khanduras, in the world of Sanctuary, and has the player take control of a lone hero who battles to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror Its development was influenced by Moria and Angband, [14] [64] and Diablo resembles a roguelike due to its focus on dungeon crawling, and its procedurally generated levels Major differences include the commercial quality of the game's graphics, its simplified character development, and its fast, real-time action [64] [65] A factor in Diablo's success was its support for online, collaborative play over a local area network or through its Battle.net online service This greatly extended its replay value, though cheating was a problem [6] [64] [65] While not the first RPG to feature real-time combat, [Note 9] Diablo's effect on the market was significant, a reflection of the changes that took place in other genres following the release of the action titles, Doom and Dune II [64] It had many imitators, and its formula of simple, fast combat and replayability were used by what were later referred to as \"Diablo clones\", and more broadly \"action RPGs\" [67]\n\n\nDiablo and action RPGs\nThe dark fantasy-themed RPG Diablo was released by Blizzard Entertainment on December 31, 1996, in the midst of a

[67]\n\n\nInterplay, BioWare and Black Isle Studios\nInterplay, now known as Interplay Entertainment and a publisher in its own right, produced several late 1990s RPG titles through two new developers, Black Isle Studios and BioWare Black Isle released the groundbreaking Fallout (1997) which, reminiscent of Interplay's earlier Wasteland, was set in an alternate history future America following a nuclear holocaust [85] [86] One of the few successful late-1990 video game RPGs not set in a swords-and-sorcery environment, Fallout was notable for its open-ended and largely nonlinear gameplay and quest system, tongue-in-cheek humor, and pervasive sense of style [6] [85] Players were afforded numerous moral choices to shape the game world based on how NPCs might react to the player, much like the original Ultimas [6] Fallout was nearly as influential on post-crash RPGs as Ultima was on Golden Age RPGs, and is considered by some to be the first \"modern\" CRPG [87] Black Isle produced a sequel, Fallout 2, co-designed by Chris Avellone in 1998 Third-party developer Micro Forté created Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, a tactical RPG based on the franchise, which was published in 2001 under Interplay's strategy division 14 Degrees East.\n\n\nMainstream success (2000s–present)\nThe new century saw an increasing number of multi-platform releases The move to 3D game engines, along with constant improvements in graphic quality, led to progressively more detailed and realistic game worlds [97] [98] [99]\n\n\nBethesda\nBethesda Softworks has developed RPGs since 1994, in its epic fantasy The Elder Scrolls series Daggerfall (1996) is notable as an early 3D first-person RPG with an expansive world The series drew attention to sandbox gameplay, which gives the player wide choices of free-roaming activities unrelated to the game's main storyline [6] [114] The Elder Scrolls series was seen as an alternative to the \"highly linear, story-based games\" that dominated the computer RPG genre at the time, [114] and the series' freedom of play inspired comparisons to Grand Theft Auto III [115] [116] According to Todd Howard, \"I think  [Daggerfall is] one of those games that people can 'project' themselves on It does so many things and allows  [for] so many play styles that people can easily imagine what type of person they'd like to be in-game.\" [6]\n\n\nVideo game consoles and accessibility\nMulti-platform releases were common in the early days of RPGs, but there was a period during the 1990s when this was not generally the case [99] [130] The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume this practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles [99] The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of development tools [99] [131] Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of a game's development budget today than in the past, are also easily transferable between multiple platforms [99]\n\n\nIndie and European game studios\nThe technical sophistication required to make modern video games and the high expectations of players (at least, in terms of the number and quality of voice-overs and increasing graphical fidelity) make it difficult for independent developers to impress audiences to the same degree that large game makers with extensive budgets and development teams are able to [97] [150] [Note 15] But innovation and quality need not necessarily be stymied Like the movie industry, the \"indie\" (short for \"independent\") video game scene plays a crucial role in formulating new ideas and concepts that mainstream publishers and marketing departments, stuck in their rigid antiquated ways, might deem too unworkable or radical, but later adopt [97] There are many examples of movies that never gained approval within a corporate framework that ended up being financially successful and/or iconic among filmgoers [97] Likewise, \"indie\" video game developers are able to be successful by putting development time and effort into aspects of a game larger corporate enterprises might ignore [97] Lastly, independent developers can be successful by focusing on smaller niche markets [97] European countries, and Germany in particular, remain more receptive to PC-exclusives and, to older, more \"hardcore\" design decisions, in general [64] [97]\n\n\nCD Projekt Red\nCD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series (2007-2015) and Cyberpunk 2077 (2020), was formed in 2002 in Warsaw by Polish video game retailers Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński The company began by translating major video-game releases into Polish, collaborating with Interplay Entertainment on two Baldur's Gate titles [177] [178] When Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance was cancelled, the company decided to reuse the code for their own video game, The Witcher, based on the works of Andrzej Sapkowski [177] [178] After the release of The Witcher, CD Projekt worked on a console port called The Witcher: White Wolf; but development issues and increasing costs led the company to the brink of bankruptcy [179] CD Projekt later released The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015, with the latter winning various Game of the Year awards [180] In 2020, the company released Cyberpunk 2077, open-world role-playing game based on the Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop game system, for which it opened a new division in Wrocław [181]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**History of Western Role-Playing Video Games**\n\nThe history of Western role-playing video games (RPGs) spans several decades, from the early days of text-based games to the current era of 3D open-world experiences. This article will explore the evolution of RPGs in the Western world, highlighting key milestones, innovations, and influential titles.\n\n**Early American Computer RPGs (mid-1970s–mid-1980s)**\n\nThe earliest role-playing video games were created in the mid-to-late 1970s, as offshoots of early university mainframe text-based RPGs played on PDP-10, PLATO, and Unix-based systems. These included m199h (1974), Dungeon (1975 or 1976), pedit5 (1975), and dnd (1975). These early games were inspired by pen-and-paper role-playing games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons, which was first published in 1974, and J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nSome of the first graphical computer RPGs (CRPGs) after pedit5 and dnd included orthanc (1978), avathar (1979), oubliette (1977), moria (1975), dungeons of degorath, baradur, emprise, bnd, sorcery, and dndworld. All of these were developed and became popular on the PLATO system during the late 1970s, in large part due to PLATO's speed, fast graphics, and large number of players with access to its nationwide network of terminals.\n\nThese were followed by games on other platforms, such as Temple of Apshai (1979), written for the TRS-80, and Akalabeth: World of Doom (1980), which gave rise to the well-known Ultima series. Wizardry (1981) and Sword of Fargoal (1982) were also influential games of this era. Games of this era were also influenced by text adventures such as Colossal Cave Adventure (1976) and Zork (1976); early MUDs, tabletop wargames such as Chainmail (1971), and sports games such as Strat-O-Matic.\n\n**Mainframe Computers (mid-1970s–early 1980s)**\n\nThe early days of computer RPGs were characterized by text-based games played on mainframe computers. These games were often created by university students and were played on systems such as PDP-10, PLATO, and Unix-based systems. The first graphical computer RPGs emerged during this period, including orthanc, avathar, and oubliette, which were developed on the PLATO system.\n\nThese early graphical RPGs were influenced by pen-and-paper role-playing games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons, and were often created by enthusiasts of the game. The development of these early games laid the foundation for the modern computer RPG industry, which would go on to produce some of the most iconic and influential games of all time.\n\n**Ultima and Wizardry (early–mid-1980s)**\n\nThe Ultima series, developed by Richard Garriott, revolutionized the computer RPG genre with its innovative gameplay mechanics, including the use of tiled graphics and party-based combat, a mix of fantasy and science-fiction elements, and time travel. The game's written narrative was an innovative feature that allowed it to convey a larger story than was found in the minimal plots common at the time.\n\nThe Might and Magic series, which began with the 1986 release of Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum, also made significant contributions to the genre, featuring complex statistics, large numbers of weapons and spells, and enormous worlds in which to play. The series was notable for making race and gender an important aspect of gameplay.\n\n**Golden Age (late 1980s–early 1990s)**\n\nThe Golden Age of computer RPGs was marked by the release of several influential titles, including the Ultima series, the Might and Magic series, and the Wizardry series. These games were characterized by their innovative gameplay mechanics, complex storylines, and immersive game worlds.\n\nDuring this period, the computer RPG genre began to gain mainstream popularity, with titles such as Ultima III: Exodus and Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom becoming household names. The genre's popularity was further boosted by the release of action RPGs, such as the Diablo series, which combined the elements of traditional RPGs with the fast-paced action of hack-and-slash games.\n\n**Decline (mid-1990s)**\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a decline in the popularity of computer RPGs, with many titles failing to meet expectations and the genre as a whole struggling to stay relevant. The emphasis on bigger on-screen characters with more realistic animation in a smaller game world was a part of a design philosophy that said computer gamers didn't want to play the big games any longer.\n\nHowever, the decline of the computer RPG genre was short-lived, as the release of the Diablo series and other action RPGs helped to revitalize the genre and pave the way for the next generation of RPGs.\n\n**North American Computer RPGs (late 1990s)**\n\nThe late 1990s saw the rise of the action RPG genre, with titles such as Diablo and Diablo II becoming incredibly popular. These games combined the elements of traditional RPGs with the fast-paced action of hack-and-slash games, creating a new and exciting genre that captivated gamers worldwide.\n\nThe Diablo series was particularly influential, with its dark fantasy setting, engaging storyline, and addictive gameplay mechanics. The game's support for online, collaborative play over a local area network or through its Battle.net online service greatly extended its replay value, though cheating was a problem.\n\n**Interplay, BioWare, and Black Isle Studios**\n\nInterplay, now known as Interplay Entertainment and a publisher in its own right, produced several late 1990s RPG titles through two new developers, Black Isle Studios and BioWare.

Players were afforded numerous moral choices to shape the game world based on how NPCs might react to the player, much like the original Ultimas.\n\n**Mainstream Success (2000s–present)**\n\nThe new century saw an increasing number of multi-platform releases, with the move to 3D game engines, along with constant improvements in graphic quality, leading to progressively more detailed and realistic game worlds.\n\nBethesda Softworks has developed RPGs since 1994, in its epic fantasy The Elder Scrolls series, which drew attention to sandbox gameplay, which gives the player wide choices of free-roaming activities unrelated to the game's main storyline. The Elder Scrolls series was seen as an alternative to the \"highly linear, story-based games\" that dominated the computer RPG genre at the time.\n\n**Video Game Consoles and Accessibility**\n\nThe combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of development tools. Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of a game's development budget today than in the past, are also easily transferable between multiple platforms.\n\n**Indie and European Game Studios**\n\nThe technical sophistication required to make modern video games and the high expectations of players (at least, in terms of the number and quality of voice-overs and increasing graphical fidelity) make it difficult for independent developers to impress audiences to the same degree that large game makers with extensive budgets and development teams are able to.\n\nHowever, innovation and quality need not necessarily be stymied. Like the movie industry, the \"indie\" (short for \"independent\") video game scene plays a crucial role in formulating new ideas and concepts that mainstream publishers and marketing departments, stuck in their rigid antiquated ways, might deem too unworkable or radical, but later adopt.\n\n**CD Projekt Red**\n\nCD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series (2007-2015) and Cyberpunk 2077 (2020), was formed in 2002 in Warsaw by Polish video game retailers Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński. The company began by translating major video-game releases into Polish, collaborating with Interplay Entertainment on two Baldur's Gate titles.\n\nAfter the release of The Witcher, CD Projekt worked on a console port called The Witcher: White Wolf, but development issues and increasing costs led the company to the brink of bankruptcy. CD Projekt later released The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015, with the latter winning various Game of the Year awards.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"History_of_Western_role-playing_video_games\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly American computer RPGs (mid-1970s–mid-1980s)\nThe earliest role-playing video games were created in the mid-to-late 1970s, as offshoots of early university mainframe text-based RPGs that were played on PDP-10, PLATO and Unix-based systems These included m199h, created in 1974, [Note 1] Dungeon, written in 1975 or 1976, pedit5, created in 1975, [Note 2] and dnd, also from 1975 [4] These early games were inspired by pen-and-paper role-playing games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons, which was first published in 1974, and J R R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy [5] [6] Some of the first graphical computer RPGs (CRPGs) after pedit5 and dnd included orthanc (1978), [7] which was named after Saruman's tower in Lord of the Rings, [8] avathar (1979), [3] later renamed avatar, oubliette (1977), [9] named after the French word for \"dungeon\", [8] moria (1975), [3] dungeons of degorath, baradur, emprise, bnd, sorcery, and dndworld [Note 3] All of these were developed and became popular on the PLATO system during the late 1970s, in large part due to PLATO's speed, fast graphics, and large number of players with access to its nationwide network of terminals PLATO was a mainframe system that supported multiple users and allowed them to play simultaneously, a feature not commonly available to owners of home personal computer systems at the time [10] These were followed by games on other platforms, such as Temple of Apshai, written in 1979 for the TRS-80 and followed by two add-ons; Akalabeth: World of Doom (1980), which gave rise to the well-known Ultima series; [11] Wizardry (1981), and Sword of Fargoal (1982) Games of this era were also influenced by text adventures such as Colossal Cave Adventure (1976) and Zork (1976); early MUDs, tabletop wargames such as Chainmail (1971), and sports games such as Strat-O-Matic [12] [Note 4]\n\n\nMainframe computers (mid-1970s–early 1980s)\nThe earliest role-playing video games were created in the mid-to-late 1970s, as offshoots of early university mainframe text-based RPGs that were played on PDP-10, PLATO and Unix-based systems These included m199h, created in 1974, [Note 1] Dungeon, written in 1975 or 1976, pedit5, created in 1975, [Note 2] and dnd, also from 1975 [4] These

wargames such as Chainmail (1971), and sports games such as Strat-O-Matic [12] [Note 4]\n\n\nUltima and Wizardry (early–mid-1980s)\nAlthough simplified for use with the console gamepad, many innovations of the early Ultimas—in particular Ultima III: Exodus (1983) by developer Richard Garriott—became standard among later RPGs in both the personal computer and console markets These ideas included the use of tiled graphics and party-based combat, a mix of fantasy and science-fiction elements, and time travel [6] [19] [Note 6] The game's written narrative was an innovative feature that allowed it to convey a larger story than was found in the minimal plots common at the time Most games, including Garriott's own Akalabeth, focused primarily on basic gameplay mechanics like combat, and paid little attention to story and narrative [21]\n\n\nGolden Age (late 1980s–early 1990s)\nThe Might and Magic series, highly popular in the 1980s and onward, began with the 1986 release of Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum for the Apple II It encompasses a total of ten games, the most recent of which was released in 2014, as well as the popular turn-based strategy series Heroes of Might and Magic The series featured a mix of complex statistics, large numbers of weapons and spells, and enormous worlds in which to play [33] It was among the longest-lived CRPG series, alongside Ultima and Wizardry, [34] It is also notable for making race and gender an important aspect of gameplay [6] [33]\n\n\nDecline (mid-1990s)\nProbably one of the saddest sights over the last couple of years has been the rapid decline in computer role-playing games  [...] The emphasis  [among newer CRPGs, such as Ultima VIII: Pagan] is on bigger on-screen characters with more realistic animation in a smaller game world  [...] This seems to be a part of a design philosophy which says that computer gamers don't want to play the big games any longer.\n\n\nNorth American computer RPGs (late 1990s)\nThe dark fantasy-themed RPG Diablo was released by Blizzard Entertainment on December 31, 1996, in the midst of a stagnant PC RPG market [6] [64] Diablo is set in the fictional kingdom of Khanduras, in the world of Sanctuary, and has the player take control of a lone hero who battles to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror Its development was influenced by Moria and Angband, [14] [64] and Diablo resembles a roguelike due to its focus on dungeon crawling, and its procedurally generated levels Major differences include the commercial quality of the game's graphics, its simplified character development, and its fast, real-time action [64] [65] A factor in Diablo's success was its support for online, collaborative play over a local area network or through its Battle.net online service This greatly extended its replay value, though cheating was a problem [6] [64] [65] While not the first RPG to feature real-time combat, [Note 9] Diablo's effect on the market was significant, a reflection of the changes that took place in other genres following the release of the action titles, Doom and Dune II [64] It had many imitators, and its formula of simple, fast combat and replayability were used by what were later referred to as \"Diablo clones\", and more broadly \"action RPGs\" [67]\n\n\nDiablo and action RPGs\nThe dark fantasy-themed RPG

what were later referred to as \"Diablo clones\", and more broadly \"action RPGs\" [67]\n\n\nInterplay, BioWare and Black Isle Studios\nInterplay, now known as Interplay Entertainment and a publisher in its own right, produced several late 1990s RPG titles through two new developers, Black Isle Studios and BioWare Black Isle released the groundbreaking Fallout (1997) which, reminiscent of Interplay's earlier Wasteland, was set in an alternate history future America following a nuclear holocaust [85] [86] One of the few successful late-1990 video game RPGs not set in a swords-and-sorcery environment, Fallout was notable for its open-ended and largely nonlinear gameplay and quest system, tongue-in-cheek humor, and pervasive sense of style [6] [85] Players were afforded numerous moral choices to shape the game world based on how NPCs might react to the player, much like the original Ultimas [6] Fallout was nearly as influential on post-crash RPGs as Ultima was on Golden Age RPGs, and is considered by some to be the first \"modern\" CRPG [87] Black Isle produced a sequel, Fallout 2, co-designed by Chris Avellone in 1998 Third-party developer Micro Forté created Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, a tactical RPG based on the franchise, which was published in 2001 under Interplay's strategy division 14 Degrees East.\n\n\nMainstream success (2000s–present)\nThe new century saw an increasing number of multi-platform releases The move to 3D game engines, along with constant improvements in graphic quality, led to progressively more detailed and realistic game worlds [97] [98] [99]\n\n\nBethesda\nBethesda Softworks has developed RPGs since 1994, in its epic fantasy The Elder Scrolls series Daggerfall (1996) is notable as an early 3D first-person RPG with an expansive world The series drew attention to sandbox gameplay, which gives the player wide choices of free-roaming activities unrelated to the game's main storyline [6] [114] The Elder Scrolls series was seen as an alternative to the \"highly linear, story-based games\" that dominated the computer RPG genre at the time, [114] and the series' freedom of play inspired comparisons to Grand Theft Auto III [115] [116] According to Todd Howard, \"I think  [Daggerfall is] one of those games that people can 'project' themselves on It does so many things and allows  [for] so many play styles that people can easily imagine what type of person they'd like to be in-game.\" [6]\n\n\nVideo game consoles and accessibility\nMulti-platform releases were common in the early days of RPGs, but there was a period during the 1990s when this was not generally the case [99] [130] The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume this practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles [99] The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of development tools [99] [131] Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of a game's development budget today than in the past, are also easily transferable between multiple platforms [99]\n\n\nIndie and European game studios\nThe technical sophistication required to make modern video games and the high expectations of players (at least, in terms of the number and quality of voice-overs and increasing graphical fidelity) make it difficult for independent developers to impress audiences to the same degree that large game makers with extensive budgets and development teams are able to [97] [150] [Note 15] But innovation and quality need not necessarily be stymied Like the movie industry, the \"indie\" (short for \"independent\") video game scene plays a crucial role in formulating new ideas and concepts that mainstream publishers and marketing departments, stuck in their rigid antiquated ways, might deem too unworkable or radical, but later adopt [97] There are many examples of movies that never gained approval within a corporate framework that ended up being financially successful and/or iconic among filmgoers [97] Likewise, \"indie\" video game developers are able to be successful by putting development time and effort into aspects of a game larger corporate enterprises might ignore [97] Lastly, independent developers can be successful by focusing on smaller niche markets [97] European countries, and Germany in particular, remain more receptive to PC-exclusives and, to older, more \"hardcore\" design decisions, in general [64] [97]\n\n\nCD Projekt Red\nCD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series (2007-2015) and Cyberpunk 2077 (2020), was formed in 2002 in Warsaw by Polish video game retailers Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński The company began by translating major video-game releases into Polish, collaborating with Interplay Entertainment on two Baldur's Gate titles [177] [178] When Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance was cancelled, the company decided to reuse the code for their own video game, The Witcher, based on the works of Andrzej Sapkowski [177] [178] After the release of The Witcher, CD Projekt worked on a console port called The Witcher: White Wolf; but development issues and increasing costs led the company to the brink of bankruptcy [179] CD Projekt later released The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015, with the latter winning various Game of the Year awards [180] In 2020, the company released Cyberpunk 2077, open-world role-playing game based on the Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop game system, for which it opened a new division in Wrocław [181]\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Zodiac_Killer", "content": "\nMurders and correspondence\nInvestigators agree on four confirmed attacks by the Zodiac Killer in California Five victims were killed during Zodiac attacks, and two survived: [1]\n\n\nLake Herman Road murders\nThe first murders retroactively attributed to the Zodiac were the shootings of high school students Betty Lou Jensen (16) and David Arthur Faraday (17) on December 20, 1968 Jensen was a student at Hogan High School At 8:30 p.m on the 20th, Faraday, a student at Vallejo High School, picked up Jensen They visited one of Jensen's friends Sometime after 9 p.m., they drove to the outskirts of Vallejo and parked at a lover's lane on Lake Herman Road, just inside Benicia city limits Between 10:15–30 p.m., a passing motorist noticed the couple parked on a gravel runoff near the gate to a water pumping station They were spotted again at 11 p.m [5] [6]: 30–1 \n\n\nBlue Rock Springs murder\nDarlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau were shot shortly after midnight on July 4, 1969 Ferrin was killed Mageau survived Ferrin (22) was popular in Vallejo due to her job at a local restaurant She met Michael Mageau (19) there On July 4, they went on a date, despite the fact that Darlene was married to Dean Ferrin After 11:30 p.m., Darlene received a phone call at her house She left and arrived at Mageau's house around 11:50 p.m [6]: 32–5 \n\n\nFerrin—Zodiac prior relationship theory\nMany have speculated that Darlene Ferrin knew her killer Kelleher and Nuys credit the origin of the theory to Robert Graysmith's 1986 book Zodiac He argued extensively for a connection, based on interviews with Ferrin's friends [10]: 39ff  A definitive connection has not been proven.\n\n\nFirst letters from the Zodiac\nSee: Zodiac Letters\n\n\nLake Berryessa murder\nAt 4:00 p.m on September 27, 1969, Pacific Union College students Bryan Hartnell (20) and Cecelia Shepard (22) were picnicking at Lake Berryessa on a small island connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge Sometime later, Shepard noticed a man watching them When he emerged from behind a tree, he put on a black executioner's hood with clip-on sunglasses [20] He wore a bib with a white 3x3\"  symbol on it He brandished a gun, which Hartnell believed was a .45 The Zodiac said he escaped from jail after killing a guard and needed their car and money to travel to Mexico [21] [22]: 20 \n\n\nPresidio Heights murder\n The last confirmed Zodiac murder took place two weeks later Around 9:40 p.m on October 11 in downtown San Francisco, the killer hailed a cab which was driven by a doctoral student named Paul Stine The Zodiac gave a destination in Presidio Heights When the taxi arrived at Washington and Maple streets, the passenger asked to be driven another block At Washington and Cherry around 9:55 p.m., the Zodiac shot Stine in the head with a handgun and took his wallet and car keys [15]\n\n\nA.M. San Francisco interview\nOn October 22, 1969, mental patient Eric Weill duped attorney Melvin Belli into a conversation on KGO-TV's A.M San Francisco Investigators concluded Weill was not the Zodiac He called the Oakland Police Department and demanded to speak to Belli or F Lee Bailey on TV During the show, Weill told Belli he would not reveal his identity for fear of being executed He arranged a rendezvous with Belli on Mission Street in Daly City and did not show [35] [22]: 32 \n\n\nNovember & December 1969 correspondence\nOn November 8, the Zodiac mailed a card with a 340-character cryptogram (Z340) to the San Francisco Chronicle He asked for his code to printed on the front page It remained unsolved for 51 years One cryptologist ranked Zodiac's unsolved ciphers second only to the Voynich manuscript [36] Zodiac ciphers were crowdsourced through a variety of websites which led to gradual breakthroughs [37] [38]\n\n\nApril 1970 letter and card\nFor the remainder of 1970, the Zodiac continued to communicate with authorities and the media by mail In a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle postmarked April 20, he wrote, \"My name is—\" It was followed by a 13-character cipher (Z13) which has not been definitively solved [46]\n\n\nJune 1970 letter and map\nIn a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle postmarked June 26, 1970, the killer was upset no one was wearing Zodiac buttons He claimed, \"...I punished them in another way I shot a man sitting in a parked car with a .38.\" This may have been a reference to the murder of SFPD Sergeant Richard Radetich He was shot through the window of his squad car by an unidentified gunman during a routine traffic stop [49] Radetich's murder is unsolved, but the SFPD denies that Zodiac is a suspect in the case [47]\n\n\nJuly 1970 letters\nIn a letter postmarked July 24, 1970 to the San Francisco Chronicle, the Zodiac again complained about no one wearing buttons He claimed to have \"a little list\" which included the woman and her baby he drove around for several hours The details match Kathleen Johns' description of her abduction on March 22, four months earlier.\n\n\nOctober 1970 cards\nOn October 7, 1970, the San Francisco Chronicle received a three-by-five-inch card (nicknamed the \"13 Hole Punch Card\") signed by Zodiac with the  symbol and a small cross reportedly drawn in blood [52] Thirteen holes were punched across the card, and its message was formed by pasting type from the Chronicle Bill Armstrong and Dave Toschi agreed it was \"highly probable\" that Zodiac sent the card [53]\n\n\nMarch 1971 letter\nIn a March 13, 1971 letter to the Los Angeles Times, the Zodiac taunted police and claimed 17 victims Zodiac expert Tom Voigt theorized that the letter's postmark was a joke about an unpleasant letter coming from a town called \"Pleasanton\" [4]\n\n\nJanuary 1974 letter\nZodiac remained silent for nearly three years The Chronicle received a letter from the Zodiac, postmarked January 29, 1974 from San Mateo County It complained that columnist Count Marco needed to \"feel superior to everyone\" and praised The Exorcist (1973) as \"the best saterical comidy that I have ever seen.\" The letter included part of a verse from \"Tit-willow Song\" in The Mikado and an unusual symbol at the bottom that has remained unexplained Zodiac concluded the letter with a new score, \"Me = 37, SFPD = 0.\" [15] [57]\n\n\nLetters of suspicious authorship\nMany more unconfirmed Zodiac letters were sent to the media On August 1, 1973, a letter was mailed to the Albany Times Union in New York The return address was the symbol The writer promised to kill again on August 10 A 3-line code in the letter was supposed to reveal the name and location of the victim FBI cryptanalysts deciphered the code as \" [redacted by the FBI] Albany Medical Center This is only the beginning.\" No murder matched the details in the letter, and the handwriting was not a definitive match for Zodiac's [1]\n\n\nSuspected victims\nThere is no consensus regarding the number of victims the Zodiac Killer actually killed or the length of his criminal spree In 1976, SFPD detective Dave Toschi said, \"We know for sure he killed at least six\", and the Zodiac had \"a personal boxscore of 37\" [32] Robert Graysmith estimated forty-nine Zodiac victims [10]: 308–11  Many high-profile murders and attacks in the 60s and 70s were seen as possible Zodiac crimes, but none have been confirmed \n\n\nRaymond Davis\nOn April 9, 1962, a man called the police in Oceanside, California and said, \"I am going to pull something here in Oceanside and you'll never be able to figure it out.\" At 11:10 p.m on April 10, cab driver Raymond Davis (29) told his dispatcher he was taking a fare to South Oceanside The next day, his body was found near the mayor's house in St Malo, a gated community in Oceanside [64] [65] Days later, the suspected killer called the police again, “Do you remember me calling you last week and telling you that I was going to pull a real baffling crime? I killed the cab driver and I am going to get me a bus driver next.” The police placed armed guards on buses [66]\n\n\nRobert Domingos and Linda Edwards\nOn June 2, 1963, a sniper fired two shots at a group of teenagers at Tajiguas None of them were hit, and the weapon was identified as .22 caliber [69]\n\n\nJohnny Ray Swindle and Joyce Ann Swindle\nOn February 5, 1964, Johnny Ray Swindle and Joyce Ann Swindle (both 19), a newlywed couple from Alabama on their honeymoon, were shot while walking along Ocean Beach in San Diego A sniper with a .22 caliber long rifle shot them five times from a nearby cliff The killer then shot each of them once in the head at close range Similar to the Zodiac murders, Johnny was shot behind the ear Despite multiple bullet wounds, he remained alive for hours and died at the hospital Joyce died almost instantly from shots to her back, left arm, and head The killer took Joyce's necklace as well as Johnny's wallet and Timex [7] The same brand watch was found at the Cheri Jo Bates crime scene and assumed to be the killer's [67]\n\n\nCheri Jo Bates\nOn October 30, 1966, Cheri Jo Bates, an 18-year-old student at Riverside City College (RCC), spent the evening at the campus library annex until it closed at 9:00 p.m Neighbors reported hearing a scream around 10:30 Her father reported her missing, and she was found dead the next morning at 6:30 a.m [7] She was found a short distance from the library, between two abandoned houses slated to be demolished for campus renovations She had been brutally beaten and stabbed to death The wires in her Volkswagen's distributor cap had been pulled out A man's paint-spattered Timex watch with a torn wristband was found nearby The watch stopped at 12:24, but police believe that the attack had occurred much earlier [79] [10]: 165–6 \n\n\nEnedine Molina and Fermin Rodriguez\nOn June 8, 1967, Enedine Molina, 35, and Fermin Rodriguez, 36, were parked on Vallecitos Road in Alameda County A stranger approached and told them to get out of the car Rodriguez was fatally shot and Molina abducted The killer stopped near Sunol Regional Wilderness Molina tried to escape and was killed Rape and robbery were ruled out as motives The murders occurred near Pleasanton The March 1971 Zodiac letter to the Los Angeles Times was postmarked in Pleasanton [81]\n\n\nJohn Franklin Hood and Sandra Garcia\nOn February 21, 1970, John Franklin Hood, 24, and his fiancée Sandra Garcia, 20, visited East Beach in Santa Barbara They left their Santa Barbara home at 6 p.m Early the following day, their fully-clothed bodies were discovered under their blanket Hood was stabbed eleven times, mainly in the face and back Garcia received the brunt of the vicious attack, leaving her almost unrecognizable The bone-handled 4\" fish knife used in their murder was partially buried in the sand beneath the blanket There appeared to be no sexual interference and robbery was ruled out The double-murder was similar to the 1963 killing of Domingos and Edwards, thirty miles west It also paralleled the 1969 Lake Berryessa attack [70] [82]\n\n\nKathleen Johns\nOn the night of March 22, 1970, Kathleen Johns (22) was driving to Petaluma with her 10-month-old daughter Johns was also seven months pregnant [83] She left San Bernardino at 4:30 p.m At 11:30 p.m on Highway 132 near Patterson, a vehicle behind her blinked its lights A man pulled alongside and convinced her to pull over because her left rear wheel was loose He fixed it, but when she pulled away it immediately fell off Johns told Paul Avery that the man offered to drive her to a gas station that was in sight just up the road [84] [85] [86]\n\n\nRichard Radetich\nAround 5:25 a.m on June 19, 1970, SFPD sergeant Richard Phillip \"Rich\" Radetich (25) was shot three times by a .38 caliber revolver He was serving a parking ticket in Haight Ashbury when he was shot through the driver's window of his squad car The SFPD started assigning two officers to every patrol car A week later, the Zodiac claimed to have shot a man \"in a parked car with a .38\" Police never found direct evidence that Zodiac killed Radetich In 2004, the SFPD reopened the Radetich investigation [47] [89]\n\n\nDonna Lass\nRegistered nurse Donna Lass (25) was last seen on September 6, 1970 in Stateline, Nevada She worked at the Sahara Tahoe until 2:00 a.m that morning Her boss and landlord both received phone calls from an anonymous man who claimed Lass had an illness in her family and would not be returning [10]: 178  Her car was parked near her

an unidentified serial killer who was active in Northern California from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. The killer's identity remains unknown, and the case continues to be one of the most infamous unsolved serial killer cases in American history.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Zodiac Killer's crimes were marked by a series of brutal and seemingly random attacks on unsuspecting victims, often with a focus on young couples and families. The killer's modus operandi (MO) involved shooting or stabbing his victims, often with a focus on the head or neck area. The killer's motives are still unknown, but it is believed that he may have been motivated by a desire for notoriety and a need to assert his power over his victims.\n\n**Murders and Correspondence**\n\nThe Zodiac Killer's confirmed attacks include five victims, with two surviving:\n\n### **Lake Herman Road Murders**\n\nThe first murders retroactively attributed to the Zodiac were the shootings of high school students Betty Lou Jensen (16) and David Arthur Faraday (17) on December 20, 1968. Jensen was a student at Hogan High School, and Faraday was a student at Vallejo High School. At 8:30 p.m. on the 20th, Faraday picked up Jensen, and they visited one of Jensen's friends. Sometime after 9 p.m., they drove to the outskirts of Vallejo and parked at a lover's lane on Lake Herman Road, just inside Benicia city limits. Between 10:15–30 p.m., a passing motorist noticed the couple parked on a gravel runoff near the gate to a water pumping station. They were spotted again at 11 p.m.\n\n### **Blue Rock Springs Murder**\n\nDarlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau were shot shortly after midnight on July 4, 1969. Ferrin was killed, and Mageau survived. Ferrin was popular in Vallejo due to her job at a local restaurant, and she met Michael Mageau there. On July 4, they went on a date, despite the fact that Darlene was married to Dean Ferrin.\n\n### **Ferrin-Zodiac Prior Relationship Theory**\n\nMany have speculated that Darlene Ferrin knew her killer. Robert Graysmith, in his 1986 book Zodiac, argued extensively for a connection, based on interviews with Ferrin's friends. A definitive connection has not been proven.\n\n### **Lake Berryessa Murder**\n\nAt 4:00 p.m. on September 27, 1969, Pacific Union College students Bryan Hartnell (20) and Cecelia Shepard (22) were picnicking at Lake Berryessa on a small island connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge. Sometime later, Shepard noticed a man watching them. When he emerged from behind a tree, he put on a black executioner's hood with clip-on sunglasses. He wore a bib with a white 3x3\" symbol on it. He brandished a gun, which Hartnell believed was a .45. The Zodiac said he escaped from jail after killing a guard and needed their car and money to travel to Mexico.\n\n### **Presidio Heights Murder**\n\nThe last confirmed Zodiac murder took place two weeks later. Around 9:40 p.m. on October 11 in downtown San Francisco, the killer hailed a cab, which was driven by a doctoral student named Paul Stine. The Zodiac gave a destination in Presidio Heights. When the taxi arrived at Washington and Maple streets, the passenger asked to be driven another block. At Washington and Cherry around 9:55 p.m., the Zodiac shot Stine in the head with a handgun and took his wallet and car keys.\n\n### **A.M. San Francisco Interview**\n\nOn October 22, 1969, mental patient Eric Weill duped attorney Melvin Belli into a conversation on KGO-TV's A.M San Francisco. Weill was not the Zodiac, but he called the Oakland Police Department and demanded to speak to Belli or F Lee Bailey on TV. During the show, Weill told Belli he would not reveal his identity for fear of being executed. He arranged a rendezvous with Belli on Mission Street in Daly City and did not show.\n\n### **November & December 1969 Correspondence**\n\nOn November 8, the Zodiac mailed a card with a 340-character cryptogram (Z340) to the San Francisco Chronicle. He asked for his code to be printed on the front page. It remained unsolved for 51 years. Zodiac ciphers were crowdsourced through a variety of websites, which led to gradual breakthroughs.\n\n### **April 1970 Letter and Card**\n\nFor the remainder of 1970, the Zodiac continued to communicate with authorities and the media by mail. In a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle postmarked April 20, he wrote, \"My name is—\" It was followed by a 13-character cipher (Z13) which has not been definitively solved.\n\n### **June 1970 Letter and Map**\n\nIn a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle postmarked June 26, 1970, the killer was upset no one was wearing Zodiac buttons. He claimed, \"...I punished them in another way. I shot a man sitting in a parked car with a .38.\" This may have been a reference to the murder of SFPD Sergeant Richard Radetich.\n\n### **July 1970 Letters**\n\nIn a letter postmarked July 24, 1970, to the San Francisco Chronicle, the Zodiac again complained about no one wearing buttons. He claimed to have \"a little list\" which included the woman and her baby he drove around for several hours. The details match Kathleen Johns' description of her abduction on March 22, four months earlier.\n\n### **October 1970 Cards**\n\nOn October 7, 1970, the San Francisco Chronicle received a three-by-five-inch card (nicknamed the \"13 Hole Punch Card\") signed by Zodiac with the symbol and a small cross reportedly drawn in blood. Thirteen holes were punched across the card, and its message was formed by pasting type from the Chronicle.\n\n### **March 1971 Letter**\n\nIn a March 13, 1971 letter to the Los Angeles Times, the Zodiac taunted police and claimed 17 victims. Zodiac expert Tom Voigt theorized that the letter's postmark was a joke about an unpleasant letter coming from a town called \"Pleasanton.\"\n\n### **January 1974 Letter**\n\nThe Zodiac remained silent for nearly three years. The Chronicle received a letter from the Zodiac, postmarked January 29, 1974 from San Mateo County. He complained that columnist Count Marco needed to \"feel superior to everyone\" and praised The Exorcist (1973) as \"the best saterical comidy that I have ever seen.\" The letter included part of a verse from \"Tit-willow Song\" in The Mikado and an unusual symbol at the bottom that has remained unexplained. He concluded the letter with a new score, \"Me = 37, SFPD = 0.\"\n\n### **Letters of Suspicious Authorship**\n\nMany more unconfirmed Zodiac letters were sent to the media. On August 1, 1973, a letter was mailed to the Albany Times Union in New York. The return address was the symbol. The writer promised to kill again on August 10. A 3-line code in the letter was supposed to reveal the name and location of the victim. FBI cryptanalysts deciphered the code as \"[redacted by the FBI] Albany Medical Center. This is only the beginning.\" No murder matched the details in the letter, and the handwriting was not a definitive match for Zodiac's.\n\n**Suspected Victims**\n\nThere is no consensus regarding the number of victims the Zodiac Killer actually killed or the length of his criminal spree. In 1976, SFPD detective Dave Toschi said, \"We know for sure he killed at least six\", and the Zodiac had \"a personal boxscore of 37.\" Robert Graysmith estimated forty-nine Zodiac victims. Many high-profile murders and attacks in the 60s and 70s were seen as possible Zodiac crimes, but none have been confirmed.\n\n### **Raymond Davis**\n\nOn April 9, 1962, a man called the police in Oceanside, California and said, \"I am going to pull something here in Oceanside and you'll never be able to figure it out.\" At 11:10 p.m on April 10, cab driver Raymond Davis (29) told his dispatcher he was taki", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zodiac_Killer\" following this outline:\n\n\nMurders and correspondence\nInvestigators agree on four confirmed attacks by the Zodiac Killer in California Five victims were killed during Zodiac attacks, and two survived: [1]\n\n\nLake Herman Road murders\nThe first murders retroactively attributed to the Zodiac were the shootings of high school students Betty Lou Jensen (16) and David Arthur Faraday (17) on December 20, 1968 Jensen was a student at Hogan High School At 8:30 p.m on the 20th, Faraday, a student at Vallejo High School, picked up Jensen They visited one of Jensen's friends Sometime after 9 p.m., they drove to the outskirts of Vallejo and parked at a lover's lane on Lake Herman Road, just inside Benicia city limits Between 10:15–30 p.m., a passing motorist noticed the couple parked on a gravel runoff near the gate to a water pumping station They were spotted again at 11 p.m [5] [6]: 30–1 \n\n\nBlue Rock Springs murder\nDarlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau were shot shortly after midnight on July 4, 1969 Ferrin was killed Mageau survived Ferrin (22) was popular in Vallejo due to her job at a local restaurant She met Michael Mageau (19) there On July 4, they went on a date, despite the fact that Darlene was married to Dean Ferrin After 11:30 p.m., Darlene received a phone call at her house She left and arrived at Mageau's house around 11:50 p.m [6]: 32–5 \n\n\nFerrin—Zodiac prior relationship theory\nMany have speculated that Darlene Ferrin knew her killer Kelleher and Nuys credit the origin of the theory to Robert Graysmith's 1986 book Zodiac He argued extensively for a connection, based on interviews with Ferrin's friends [10]: 39ff  A definitive connection has not been proven.\n\n\nFirst letters from the Zodiac\nSee: Zodiac Letters\n\n\nLake Berryessa murder\nAt 4:00 p.m on September 27, 1969, Pacific Union College students Bryan Hartnell (20) and Cecelia Shepard (22) were picnicking at Lake Berryessa on a small island connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge Sometime later, Shepard noticed a man watching them When he emerged from behind a tree, he put on a black executioner's hood with clip-on sunglasses [20] He wore a bib with a white 3x3\"  symbol on it He brandished a gun, which Hartnell believed was a .45 The Zodiac said he escaped from jail after killing a guard and needed their car and money to travel to Mexico [21] [22]: 20 \n\n\nPresidio Heights murder\n The last confirmed Zodiac murder took place two weeks later Around 9:40 p.m on October 11 in downtown San Francisco, the killer hailed a cab which was driven by a doctoral student named Paul Stine The Zodiac gave a destination in Presidio Heights When the taxi arrived at Washington and Maple streets, the passenger asked to be driven another block At Washington and Cherry around 9:55 p.m., the Zodiac shot Stine in the head with a handgun and took his wallet and car keys [15]\n\n\nA.M.

He was born on February 7, 1965, in Andrews, South Carolina, and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Rock is known for his sharp wit, incisive commentary on social issues, and his ability to tackle topics that are often considered taboo.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nRock's early life was marked by a strict upbringing in a traditional African American family. His parents, Julius and Rosalie Rock, were concerned about the quality of education in the local school system and arranged for Rock to be bused to a nearly all-white high school in Bensonhurst. This experience would later influence Rock's comedy style and provide material for his stand-up routines.\n\n**Career**\n\nRock began his career as a stand-up comedian in the 1980s, performing at comedy clubs in New York City. He quickly gained a reputation for his raw, uncensored humor and his ability to tackle topics that were often considered off-limits.

including conviction on impeachment (two-thirds of senators present), [6] agreeing to a resolution of advice and consent to ratification of a treaty (two-thirds of senators present), [7] expelling a member of Congress (two-thirds of members voting in the house in question), [8] overriding presidential vetoes (two-thirds of members voting of both houses), [9] and proposing constitutional amendments (two-thirds of members voting of both houses) [10] Through negative textual implication, the Constitution also gives a simple majority the power to set procedural rules [2]: 1217 \n\n\nConstitutional design\nOnly a small number of supermajority requirements were explicitly included in the original United States Constitution, including conviction on impeachment (two-thirds of senators present), [6] agreeing to a resolution of advice and consent to ratification of a treaty (two-thirds of senators present), [7] expelling a member of Congress (two-thirds of members voting in the house in question), [8] overriding presidential vetoes (two-thirds of members voting of both houses), [9] and proposing constitutional amendments (two-thirds of members voting of both houses) [10] Through negative textual implication, the Constitution also gives a simple majority the power to set procedural rules [2]: 1217 \n\n\nEarly use of the filibuster\nOriginally, the Senate's rules did not provide for a procedure for the Senate to vote to end debate on a question so that it could be voted on, [12] which opened the door to filibusters Indeed, a filibuster took place at the very first session of the Senate On September 22, 1789, Senator William Maclay wrote in his diary that the \"design of the Virginians  [...] was to talk away the time, so that we could not get the bill passed.\" [13]\n\n\nThe emergence of cloture (1917–1969)\nIn 1917, during World War I, at the urging of President Woodrow Wilson, [21] the Senate adopted a rule by a vote of 76–3 to allow cloture to be used to limit debate on a measure [22] This took place after a group of twelve anti-war senators managed to kill a bill that would have allowed Wilson to arm merchant vessels in the face of unrestricted German submarine warfare [23]\n\n\nThe two-track system, 60-vote rule and rise of the routine filibuster (1970 onward)\nAfter a series of filibusters in the 1960s over civil-rights legislation, the Senate began to use a two-track system introduced in 1972 under the leadership of Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Majority Whip Robert Byrd Before this system was introduced, a filibuster would stop the Senate from moving on to any other legislative activity Tracking allows the Senate, by unanimous consent, to set aside the measure being filibustered and consider other business If no senator objects, the Senate can have two or more pieces of legislation or nominations pending on the floor simultaneously by designating specific periods during the day when each one will be considered [31] [32] The notable side effect of this change was that by no longer bringing Senate business to a complete halt, filibusters became politically easier for the minority to sustain [33] [34] [35] As a result, the number of filibusters began increasing rapidly, eventually leading to the modern era in which an effective supermajority requirement exists to pass legislation, with no practical requirement that the minority party actually hold the floor or extend debate.\n\n\nSimple-majority cloture for nominations: since 2005\nIn 2005, a group of Republican senators, led by Majority Leader Bill Frist, proposed having the presiding officer rule that a filibuster on judicial nominees was unconstitutional, as it was inconsistent with the president's power to appoint judges with the advice and consent of a simple majority of senators [43] [44] Senator Trent Lott, the former Republican leader, used the word \"nuclear\" to describe the plan, and so it became known as the \"nuclear option\" The term thereafter came to refer to the general process of changing the rules by setting a precedent that conflicted with the plain text of the rules [45] However, a group of 14 senators—seven Democrats and seven Republicans, collectively dubbed the \"Gang of 14\"—reached an agreement to temporarily defuse the conflict [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nProcedure for invoking cloture\nThe current procedure for invoking cloture is as follows: [3]: 15–17 \n\n\nInstitutional effects\nThe modern-era filibuster—and the resulting 60-vote supermajority requirement—has had significant policy and political effects on all three branches of the federal government.\n\n\nFrequency of filibusters\nAs the filibuster has evolved from a rare practice that required holding the floor for extended periods into a routine 60-vote supermajority requirement, Senate leaders have increasingly used cloture motions as a regular tool to manage the flow of business, often even in the absence of a threatened filibuster Thus, the presence or absence of cloture attempts is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the presence or absence of a threatened filibuster Because filibustering does not depend on the use of any specific rules, whether a filibuster is present is always a matter of judgment [64]\n\n\nCongress\nThe supermajority rule has made it very difficult, often impossible, for Congress to pass controversial legislation in recent decades The number of bills passed by the Senate has cratered: in the 85th Congress, over 25% of all bills introduced in the Senate were eventually enacted; by 2005, that number had fallen to 12.5%; and by 2010, only 2.8% of introduced bills became law—a 90% decline from 50 years prior [65]\n\n\nPresidency\nPresidents of both parties have increasingly filled the policymaking vacuum with expanded use of executive power, including executive orders in areas that had traditionally been handled through legislation For example, Barack Obama effected major changes in immigration policy by issuing work permits to some undocumented workers, [67] while Donald Trump issued several significant executive orders after taking office in 2017, along with undoing many of Obama's initiatives [68] As a result, policy in these areas is increasingly determined by executive preference, and is more easily changed after elections, rather than through more permanent legislative policy.\n\n\nJudiciary\nThe Supreme Court's caseload has declined significantly, with various commenters suggesting that the decline in major legislation has been a major cause [69] Meanwhile, more policy issues are resolved judicially without action by Congress—despite the existence of potential simple majority support in the Senate—on topics such as the legalization of same-sex marriage [70]\n\n\nImpact on major policy initiatives\nThe implied threat of a filibuster—and the resulting 60-vote requirement in the modern era—has had major impacts on the ability of recent majorities to enact their top legislative priorities into law The effects of the 60-vote requirement are most apparent in periods where the president and both houses of Congress are controlled by the same political party.\n\n\nBill Clinton\nIn the 103rd Congress, President Bill Clinton enjoyed Democratic majorities in both chambers of Congress However, the Clinton health care plan of 1993, formulated by a task force led by First Lady Hillary Clinton, was unable to pass, in part due to the filibuster and the limitations of budget reconciliation As early as April 1993, a memo to the task force noted, \"While the substance is obviously controversial, there is apparently great disquiet in the Capitol over whether we understand the interactivity between reconciliation and health, procedurally, and in terms of timing and counting votes for both measures.\" [71]\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush\nIn 2001, President George W Bush was unable to obtain sufficient Democratic support for his tax cut proposals As a result, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 were each passed using reconciliation, which required that the tax cuts expire within the 10-year budget window to avoid violating the Byrd rule in the Senate The status of the tax cuts would remain unresolved until the late 2012 \"fiscal cliff,\" with a portion of the cuts being made permanent by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\n\n\nBarack Obama\nIn the 111th Congress, President Barack Obama briefly enjoyed an effective 60-vote Democratic majority (including independents caucusing with the Democrats) in the Senate During that time period, the Senate passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as \"Obamacare\", on December 24, 2009 by a vote of 60–39 (after invoking cloture by the same margin) However, Obama's proposal to create a public health insurance option was removed from the health care legislation because it could not command 60-vote support.\n\n\nDonald Trump\nIn 2017, President Donald Trump and the 115th Congress pursued a strategy to use a reconciliation bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, followed by another reconciliation bill in the next fiscal year to pass tax reform A budget reconciliation strategy was pursued since nearly all Democrats were expected to oppose these policies, making a filibuster threat insurmountable due to the 60-vote requirement.\n\n\nJoe Biden\nIn January 2021, following a shift to a 50–50 Democratic majority supported by Vice President Harris' tie-breaking vote, the legislative filibuster became a sticking point for the adoption of a new organizing resolution when Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, threatened to filibuster the resolution unless it included language committing to a 60-vote threshold to invoke cloture [84] As a result of this delay, committee memberships were held over from the 116th Congress, leaving some committees without a chair, some committees chaired by Republicans, and new senators without committee assignments After a stalemate that lasted a week, McConnell received assurances from two Democratic senators that they would continue to support the 60-vote threshold Because of those assurances, on January 25, 2021, McConnell abandoned his threat of a filibuster [85] [86]\n\n\nProposals for reform\nIn addition to reducing the cloture threshold to a simple majority (either wholly or for certain matters), several procedural alternatives have been proposed to modify or reform the filibuster rule.\n\n\nTalking filibuster\nSome reformers argue that the filibuster should be returned to its origins, in which senators were required to hold the floor and speak at length to delay a bill Since obstruction would be more visible, the reform might benefit major bills that the minority \"is willing to block covertly but not overtly\" [91] For example, a 2012 proposal by Senator Jeff Merkley would require that if between 51 and 59 senators support a cloture motion, debate would continue only until there is no opposing senator speaking At that point, another cloture vote would be triggered with only a simple majority required [92] Currently, senators can prevent the chair from putting the question even if no senator is on the floor by suggesting the absence of a quorum after their speeches even though a quorum call is not in order if no business has intervened since a quorum was last established.\n\n\nGradually lowering the 60-vote threshold\nIn 2013, Sen Tom Harkin (D-IA) advocated for steadily reducing the cloture threshold each time a cloture vote fails The number of votes required would be reduced by three on each vote (e.g., from 60 to 57, 54, 51) until a simple majority was required Harkin envisioned that this rule would still allow the minority to bring visibility to and slow down a bill, and since the whole process would take eight days the majority would have incentive to compromise with the minority The Senate defeated the idea by voice vote in 2013 [93]\n\n\nMinority bill of rights\nAs an alternative to blocking the majority's agenda, some proposals have focused instead on granting the minority the right to have its own agenda considered on the floor For example, in 2004 then–House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) proposed a \"minority bill of rights\" for the House of Representatives that would have guaranteed the minority the right to offer its own alternatives to bills under consideration [94] The House Republican majority did not endorse her proposal, and Pelosi in turn did not grant those rights when Democrats took control of the House in 2007 [95]\n\n\nProcess for limiting or eliminating the filibuster\nSenate rules can be changed by a simple majority vote Nevertheless, under current Senate rules, an amendment to the rules could itself be filibustered, with a vote of two-thirds of the senators present and voting needed to invoke cloture on a measure amending the Standing Rules Several methods of overcoming this supermajority requirement have been devised.\n\n\nRules changes at the beginning of a Congress\nAt times, senators have argued that, under Article I, Section 5, of the Constitution, the Senate has a constitutional right to change its rules by a simple majority at the beginning of each Congress.\n\n\nStanding orders\nThe Senate can also set aside a provision of its Standing Rules by agreeing to a resolution to that effect 60 votes are required to invoke cloture on such a resolution, so this is a more realistic alternative to an amendment to the rules.\n\n\nRulemaking statutes\nA number of laws limit the time for debate on certain bills, eliminating the need for cloture and effectively exempting those bills from the 60-vote requirement, [97] allowing the Senate to pass such bills by a simple majority As a result, many major legislative actions in recent decades have been taken through one of these methods, especially reconciliation These laws generally provide that after a certain period of time, the committee of jurisdiction shall be discharged (either automatically or by privileged motion) from further consideration of the measure; that a motion to proceed shall be privileged and nondebatable; and that debate on the measure be limited to a certain period of time.\n\n\nBudget reconciliation\nBudget reconciliation is a procedure created by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as part of a reform of the congressional budget process In brief, the annual budget process begins with adoption of a budget resolution, a concurrent resolution that recommends overall funding levels for the government Congress may then consider a budget reconciliation bill, subject to expedited procedures in the Senate, that reconciles funding amounts in any annual appropriations bills with the amounts specified in the budget resolution.\n\n\nCongressional Review Act\nThe Congressional Review Act, enacted in 1995, allows Congress to review and repeal certain administrative regulations adopted by the executive branch This procedure will most typically be used successfully shortly after a party change in the presidency It was first used in 2001 to repeal an ergonomics rule promulgated under Bill Clinton, and was then used 14 times in 2017 to repeal various regulations adopted in the final year of the Barack Obama presidency.\n\n\nDistrict of Columbia Home Rule Act\nThe District of Columbia Home Rule Act, enacted in 1973, allows Congress to repeal laws passed by the Council of the District of Columbia In the Senate, if a joint resolution of disapproval is introduced within 60 days in the case of a law amending the Criminal Code, or within 30 days in the case of any other law, then if it has not been reported by the committee of jurisdiction after 20 calendar days, a motion to discharge is privileged and debatable for one hour If that motion is agreed to, a nondebatable motion to proceed is in order The joint resolution is then debatable for ten hours, equally divided [99]\n\n\nNational Emergencies Act\nThe National Emergencies Act, enacted in 1976, formalizes the emergency powers of the president In the Senate, if a joint resolution terminating a national emergency has not been reported by the committee of jurisdiction within 15 calendar days, then the committee is automatically discharged and the joint resolution immediately becomes the pending business, thus preventing a filibuster on the motion to proceed Consideration of the joint resolution is then time-limited to three days (whether the Senate is actively debating the joint resolution or not), after which the Senate must vote on passage of the joint resolution [100]: 13–14 \n\n\nWar Powers Resolution\nThe War Powers Resolution, enacted in 1973 over Richard Nixon's veto, generally requires the President to withdraw troops committed overseas within 60 days, which the President may extend once for 30 additional days, unless Congress has declared war, otherwise authorized the use of force, or is unable to meet as a result of an armed attack upon the United States [101] In the Senate, if a concurrent resolution authorizing forces, or requiring that forces be removed, has not been reported by the committee of jurisdiction within 15 calendar days, then the committee is discharged and the concurrent resolution immediately becomes the pending business, thus preventing a filibuster on the motion to proceed Consideration of the concurrent resolution is then time-limited to three days (whether the Senate is actively debating the resolution or not), after which the Senate must vote on agreeing to the concurrent resolution [102]: 16–17 \n\n\nTrade promotion authority\nBeginning in 1975 with the Trade Act of 1974, and later through the Trade Act of 2002 and the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, Congress has from time to time provided so-called \"fast track\" authority for the President to negotiate international trade agreements After the president submits a bill implementing a trade agreement, Congress can approve or deny the agreement, but cannot amend the bill In both the House and the Senate, if the bill is not reported by the committee of jurisdiction within 45 session days, the committee is automatically discharged A motion to proceed to the bill is then privileged and nondebatable Debate on the bill is then limited to 20 hours, equally divided [103]\n\n\nDebt limit\nIn December 2021, the Senate passed S. 610 by a vote of 59–35 (after first invoking cloture by a vote of 64–36), which would allow the Senate to consider, under expedited procedures, one joint resolution in a specified form raising the debt limit After the majority leader introduced such a joint resolution, the joint resolution would be placed on the Calendar, and a motion to proceed would be nondebatable The joint resolution would be debatable for ten hours, equally divided After S.610 was signed into law, the Senate considered and passed S.J.Res. 33 under these expedited procedures This structure allowed Republican senators to vote against the debt limit increase without blocking its passage [104]\n\n\nNuclear option\nDespite the supermajority requirements described above, any senator may attempt to nullify a Senate rule by raising a point of order that is contrary to the existing rules and precedents An appeal in connection with a nondebatable question (such as cloture procedure) is itself nondebatable, so there is no need for a supermajority cloture vote.\n\n\nProcedure to invoke the nuclear option\nThe nuclear option was used in 2013, when Majority Leader Harry Reid raised a point of order that \"the vote on cloture under rule XXII for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United States is by majority vote\" The presiding officer overruled the point of order, and Reid appealed the ruling Minority Leader Mitch McConnell raised a parliamentary inquiry on how many votes were required to appeal the chair's ruling in that instance The presiding officer replied, \"A majority of those Senators voting, a quorum being present, is required.\" Reid's appeal was sustained by a 48–52 vote, and the Senate thus established a precedent that cloture on nominations other than those for the Supreme Court requires only a simple majority [105] [106]\n\n\nOther forms of filibuster\nWhile extended debate is the traditional form of a filibuster in the Senate, other means of delaying and killing legislation are available Because the Senate routinely conducts business by unanimous consent, one member can create at least some delay, and in many cases effectively kill a measure, by objecting to the request In many cases, an objection to a request for unanimous consent will compel a vote of one kind or another (perhaps requiring cloture) While forcing a single vote may not be an effective delaying tool, the cumulative effect of several votes, which take at least 15 minutes apiece (in practice, most take 45 minutes), can be substantial If a senator announces to their leadership that they intend to object to a request (known as a hold), the majority leader will not attempt to make that request even if the senator does not come to the floor to object to it; a single senator's objection is therefore enough to force a lengthy cloture process [110]\n\n\nMotions to go to conference\nThe Senate was previously particularly vulnerable to serial filibusters when it and the House had passed different versions of the same bill and want to go to conference (i.e., appoint a conference committee of both chambers to merge the bills) Normally, the majority would ask for unanimous consent to:\n\n\nLongest solo filibusters\nBelow is a table of the ten longest single-person filibusters to take place in the United States Senate since 1900.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Filibuster in the United States Senate**\n\nThe filibuster is a parliamentary procedure used in the United States Senate to delay or block the consideration of a bill or other measures. It has been a part of the Senate's rules and traditions since its inception. In this article, we will explore the history, constitutional design, and modern use of the filibuster in the United States Senate.\n\n**History**\n\nThe filibuster has its roots in the early days of the United States Senate. During the first session of the Senate in 1789, a filibuster took place when Senator William Maclay wrote in his diary that the \"design of the Virginians  [...] was to talk away the time, so that we could not get the bill passed.\" This was a rare occurrence at the time, but it set the stage for the development of the filibuster as a tool for delaying or blocking legislation.\n\n**Constitutional Design**\n\nThe United States Constitution does not explicitly mention the filibuster as a parliamentary procedure. However, it does provide for certain supermajority requirements, such as a two-thirds majority for conviction on impeachment, agreement on a treaty, expelling a member of Congress, overriding presidential vetoes, and proposing constitutional amendments. Through negative textual implication, the Constitution also gives a simple majority the power to set procedural rules.\n\n**Early Use of the Filibuster**\n\nIn the early days of the Senate, the rules did not provide for a procedure for the Senate to vote to end debate on a question so that it could be voted on. This opened the door to filibusters. In fact, a filibuster took place at the very first session of the Senate. Senator William Maclay's diary entry mentioned earlier is a testament to the early use of the filibuster.\n\n**The Emergence of Cloture (1917-1969)**\n\nIn 1917, during World War I, at the urging of President Woodrow Wilson, the Senate adopted a rule by a vote of 76-3 to allow cloture to be used to limit debate on a measure. This took place after a group of twelve anti-war senators managed to kill a bill that would have allowed Wilson to arm merchant vessels in the face of unrestricted German submarine warfare. The two-track system, which allows the Senate to set aside a measure being filibustered and consider other business, was introduced in 1972 under the leadership of Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Majority Whip Robert Byrd.\n\n**The Two-Track System, 60-Vote Rule, and Rise of the Routine Filibuster (1970 Onward)**\n\nAfter a series of filibusters in the 1960s over civil-rights legislation, the Senate began to use the two-track system. This allowed the Senate to have two or more pieces of legislation or nominations pending on the floor simultaneously. By designating specific periods during the day when each one will be considered, the Senate can have multiple pieces of business considered at the same time. The notable side effect of this change was that by no longer bringing Senate business to a complete halt, filibusters became politically easier for the minority to sustain.\n\n**Simple-Majority Cloture for Nominations: Since 2005**\n\nIn 2005, a group of Republican senators, led by Majority Leader Bill Frist, proposed having the presiding officer rule that a filibuster on judicial nominees was unconstitutional. This was met with resistance from Democrats, but eventually, a group of 14 senators - seven Democrats and seven Republicans - reached an agreement to temporarily defuse the conflict. This agreement allowed for the use of cloture on nominations with a simple majority.\n\n**Procedure for Invoking Cloture**\n\nThe current procedure for invoking cloture is as follows: A cloture motion is made on the measure in question. If a majority of the senators present and voting vote in favor of the motion, cloture is invoked, and debate on the measure is limited to a specified period of time.\n\n**Institutional Effects**\n\nThe modern-era filibuster and the resulting 60-vote supermajority requirement have had significant policy and political effects on all three branches of the federal government. The supermajority rule has made it very difficult, often impossible, for Congress to pass controversial legislation in recent decades. The number of bills passed by the Senate has cratered, with only 2.8% of introduced bills becoming law in 2010, a 90% decline from 50 years prior.\n\n**Congress**\n\nPresidents of both parties have increasingly filled the policymaking vacuum with expanded use of executive power, including executive orders in areas that had traditionally been handled through legislation. For example, Barack Obama effected major changes in immigration policy by issuing work permits to some undocumented workers, while Donald Trump issued several significant executive orders after taking office in 2017.\n\n**Presidency**\n\nThe Supreme Court's caseload has declined significantly, with various commenters suggesting that the decline in major legislation has been a major cause. Meanwhile, more policy issues are resolved judicially without action by Congress - despite the existence of potential simple majority support in the Senate - on topics such as the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\n**Judiciary**\n\nThe impact of the filibuster on major policy initiatives is most apparent in periods where the president and both houses of Congress are controlled by the same political party. In the 103rd Congress, President Bill Clinton enjoyed Democratic majorities in both chambers of Congress, but the Clinton health care plan of 1993 was unable to pass, in part due to the filibuster and the limitations of budget reconciliation.\n\n**Reform Proposals**\n\nSeveral procedural alternatives have been proposed to modify or reform the filibuster rule. Some reformers argue that the filibuster should be returned to its origins, in which senators were required to hold the floor and speak at length to delay a bill. Others propose gradually lowering the 60-vote threshold, allowing the minority to have its own agenda considered on the floor.\n\n**Process for Limiting or Eliminating the Filibuster**\n\nSenate rules can be changed by a simple majority vote. However, under current Senate rules, an amendment to the rules could itself be filibustered, with a vote of two-thirds of the senators present and voting needed to invoke cloture on a measure amending the Standing Rules. Several methods of overcoming this supermajority requirement have been devised, including rules changes at the beginning of a Congress, standing orders, and rulemaking statutes.\n\n**Nuclear Option**\n\nThe nuclear option was used in 2013, when Majority Leader Harry Reid raised a point of order that \"the vote on cloture under rule XXII for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United States is by majority vote.\" This marked a significant shift in the use of cloture and the filibuster.\n\n**Other Forms of Filibuster**\n\nWhile extended debate is the traditional form of a filibuster in the Senate, other means of delaying and killing legislation are available. These include motions to go to conference, which can be used to block legislation by forcing the Senate to agree on a conference committee to merge the bills. The Senate was previously particularly vulnerable to serial filibusters when it and the House had passed different versions of the same bill and wanted to go to conference.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe filibuster has been a part of the United States Senate's rules and traditions since its inception. While it has evolved over time, its purpose remains the same: to delay or block the consideration of a bill or other measures. The modern-era filibuster and the resulting 60-vote supermajority requirement have had significant policy and political effects on all three branches of the federal government. As the Senate continues to navigate the complexities of the filibuster, it is essential to understand its history, constitutional design, and modern use.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style

Senate's rules did not provide for a procedure for the Senate to vote to end debate on a question so that it could be voted on, [12] which opened the door to filibusters Indeed, a filibuster took place at the very first session of the Senate On September 22, 1789, Senator William Maclay wrote in his diary that the \"design of the Virginians  [...] was to talk away the time, so that we could not get the bill passed.\" [13]\n\n\nThe emergence of cloture (1917–1969)\nIn 1917, during World War I, at the urging of President Woodrow Wilson, [21] the Senate adopted a rule by a vote of 76–3 to allow cloture to be used to limit debate on a measure [22] This took place after a group of twelve anti-war senators managed to kill a bill that would have allowed Wilson to arm merchant vessels in the face of unrestricted German submarine warfare [23]\n\n\nThe two-track system, 60-vote rule and rise of the routine filibuster (1970 onward)\nAfter a series of filibusters in the 1960s over civil-rights legislation, the Senate began to use a two-track system introduced in 1972 under the leadership of Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Majority Whip Robert Byrd Before this system was introduced, a filibuster would stop the Senate from moving on to any other legislative activity Tracking allows the Senate, by unanimous consent, to set aside the measure being filibustered and consider other business If no senator objects, the Senate can have two or more pieces of legislation or nominations pending on the floor simultaneously by designating specific periods during the day when each one will be considered [31] [32] The notable side effect of this change was that by no longer bringing Senate business to a complete halt, filibusters became politically easier for the minority to sustain [33] [34] [35] As a result, the number of filibusters began increasing rapidly, eventually leading to the modern era in which an effective supermajority requirement exists to pass legislation, with no practical requirement that the minority party actually hold the floor or extend debate.\n\n\nSimple-majority cloture for nominations: since 2005\nIn 2005, a group of Republican senators, led by Majority Leader Bill Frist, proposed having the presiding officer rule that a filibuster on judicial nominees was unconstitutional, as it was inconsistent with the president's power to appoint judges with the advice and consent of a simple majority of senators [43] [44] Senator Trent Lott, the former Republican leader, used the word \"nuclear\" to describe the plan, and so it became known as the \"nuclear option\" The term thereafter came to refer to the general process of changing the rules by setting a precedent that conflicted with the plain text of the rules [45] However, a group of 14 senators—seven Democrats and seven Republicans, collectively dubbed the \"Gang of 14\"—reached an agreement to temporarily defuse the conflict [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nProcedure for invoking cloture\nThe current procedure for invoking cloture is as follows: [3]: 15–17 \n\n\nInstitutional effects\nThe modern-era filibuster—and the resulting 60-vote supermajority requirement—has had significant policy and political effects on all three branches of the federal government.\n\n\nFrequency of filibusters\nAs the filibuster has evolved from a rare practice that required holding the floor for extended periods into a routine 60-vote supermajority requirement, Senate leaders have increasingly used cloture motions as a regular tool to manage the flow of business, often even in the absence of a threatened filibuster Thus, the presence or absence of cloture attempts is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the presence or absence of a threatened filibuster Because filibustering does not depend on the use of any specific rules, whether a filibuster is present is always a matter of judgment [64]\n\n\nCongress\nThe supermajority rule has made it very difficult, often impossible, for Congress to pass controversial legislation in recent decades The number of bills passed by the Senate has cratered: in the 85th Congress, over 25% of all bills introduced in the Senate were eventually enacted; by 2005, that number had fallen to 12.5%; and by 2010, only 2.8% of introduced bills became law—a 90% decline from 50 years prior [65]\n\n\nPresidency\nPresidents of both parties have increasingly filled the policymaking vacuum with expanded use of executive power, including executive orders in areas that had traditionally been handled through legislation For example, Barack Obama effected major changes in immigration policy by issuing work permits to some undocumented workers, [67] while Donald Trump issued several significant executive orders after taking office in 2017, along with undoing many of Obama's initiatives [68] As a result, policy in these areas is increasingly determined by executive preference, and is more easily changed after elections, rather than through more permanent legislative policy.\n\n\nJudiciary\nThe Supreme Court's caseload has declined significantly, with various commenters suggesting that the decline in major legislation has been a major cause [69] Meanwhile, more policy issues are resolved judicially without action by Congress—despite the existence of potential simple majority support in the Senate—on topics such as the legalization of same-sex marriage [70]\n\n\nImpact on major policy initiatives\nThe implied threat of a filibuster—and the resulting 60-vote requirement in the modern era—has had major impacts on the ability of recent majorities to enact their top legislative priorities into law The effects of the 60-vote requirement are most apparent in periods where the president and both houses of Congress are controlled by the same political party.\n\n\nBill Clinton\nIn the 103rd Congress, President Bill Clinton enjoyed Democratic majorities in both chambers of Congress However, the Clinton health care plan of 1993, formulated by a task force led by First Lady Hillary Clinton, was unable to pass, in part due to the filibuster and the limitations of budget reconciliation As early as April 1993, a memo to the task force noted, \"While the substance is obviously controversial, there is apparently great disquiet in the Capitol over whether we understand the interactivity between reconciliation and health, procedurally, and in terms of timing and counting votes for both measures.\" [71]\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush\nIn 2001, President George W Bush was unable to obtain sufficient Democratic support for his tax cut proposals As a result, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 were each passed using reconciliation, which required that the tax cuts expire within the 10-year budget window to avoid violating the Byrd rule in the Senate The status of the tax cuts would remain unresolved until the late 2012 \"fiscal cliff,\" with a portion of the cuts being made permanent by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\n\n\nBarack Obama\nIn the 111th Congress, President Barack Obama briefly enjoyed an effective 60-vote Democratic majority (including independents caucusing with the Democrats) in the Senate During that time period, the Senate passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as \"Obamacare\", on December 24, 2009 by a vote of 60–39 (after invoking cloture by the same margin) However, Obama's proposal to create a public health insurance option was removed from the health care legislation because it could not command 60-vote support.\n\n\nDonald Trump\nIn 2017, President Donald Trump and the 115th Congress pursued a strategy to use a reconciliation bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, followed by another reconciliation bill in the next fiscal year to pass tax reform A budget reconciliation strategy was pursued since nearly all Democrats were expected to oppose these policies, making a filibuster threat insurmountable due to the 60-vote requirement.\n\n\nJoe Biden\nIn January 2021, following a shift to a 50–50 Democratic majority supported by Vice President Harris' tie-breaking vote, the legislative filibuster became a sticking point for the adoption of a new organizing resolution when Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, threatened to filibuster the resolution unless it included language committing to a 60-vote threshold to invoke cloture [84] As a result of this delay, committee memberships were held over from the 116th Congress, leaving some committees without a chair, some committees chaired by Republicans, and new senators without committee assignments After a stalemate that lasted a week, McConnell received assurances from two Democratic senators that they would continue to support the 60-vote threshold Because of those assurances, on January 25, 2021, McConnell abandoned his threat of a filibuster [85] [86]\n\n\nProposals for reform\nIn addition to reducing the cloture threshold to a simple majority (either wholly or for certain matters), several procedural alternatives have been proposed to modify or reform the filibuster rule.\n\n\nTalking filibuster\nSome reformers argue that the filibuster should be returned to its origins, in which senators were required to hold the floor and speak at length to delay a bill Since obstruction would be more visible, the reform might benefit major bills that the minority \"is willing to block covertly but not overtly\" [91] For example, a 2012 proposal by Senator Jeff Merkley would require that if between 51 and 59 senators support a cloture motion, debate would continue only until there is no opposing senator speaking At that point, another cloture vote would be triggered with only a simple majority required [92] Currently, senators can prevent the chair from putting the question even if no senator is on the floor by suggesting the absence of a quorum after their speeches even though a quorum call is not in order if no business has intervened since a quorum was last established.\n\n\nGradually lowering the 60-vote threshold\nIn 2013, Sen Tom Harkin (D-IA) advocated for steadily reducing the cloture threshold each time a cloture vote fails The number of votes required would be reduced by three on each vote (e.g., from 60 to 57, 54, 51) until a simple majority was required Harkin envisioned that this rule would still allow the minority to bring visibility to and slow down a bill, and since the whole process would take eight days the majority would have incentive to compromise with the minority The Senate defeated the idea by voice vote in 2013 [93]\n\n\nMinority bill of rights\nAs an alternative to blocking the majority's agenda, some proposals have focused instead on granting the minority the right to have its own agenda considered on the floor For example, in 2004 then–House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) proposed a \"minority bill of rights\" for the House of Representatives that would have guaranteed the minority the right to offer its own alternatives to bills under consideration [94] The House Republican majority did not endorse her proposal, and Pelosi in turn did not grant those rights when Democrats took control of the House in 2007 [95]\n\n\nProcess for limiting or eliminating the filibuster\nSenate rules can be changed by a simple majority vote Nevertheless, under current Senate rules, an amendment to the rules could itself be filibustered, with a vote of two-thirds of the senators present and voting needed to invoke cloture on a measure amending the Standing Rules Several methods of overcoming this supermajority requirement have been devised.\n\n\nRules changes at the beginning of a Congress\nAt times, senators have argued that, under Article I, Section 5, of the Constitution, the Senate has a constitutional right to change its rules by a simple majority at the beginning of each Congress.\n\n\nStanding orders\nThe Senate can also set aside a provision of its Standing Rules by agreeing to a resolution to that effect 60 votes are required to invoke cloture on such a resolution, so this is a more realistic alternative to an amendment to the rules.\n\n\nRulemaking statutes\nA number of laws limit the time for debate on certain bills, eliminating the need for cloture and effectively exempting those bills from the 60-vote requirement, [97] allowing the Senate to pass such bills by a simple majority As a result, many major legislative actions in recent decades have been taken through one of these methods, especially reconciliation These laws generally provide that after a certain period of time, the committee of jurisdiction shall be discharged (either automatically or by privileged motion) from further consideration of the measure; that a motion to proceed shall be privileged and nondebatable; and that debate on the measure be limited to a certain period of time.\n\n\nBudget reconciliation\nBudget reconciliation is a procedure created by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as part of a reform of the congressional budget process In brief, the annual budget process begins with adoption of a budget resolution, a concurrent resolution that recommends overall funding levels for the government Congress may then consider a budget reconciliation bill, subject to expedited procedures in the Senate, that reconciles funding amounts in any annual appropriations bills with the amounts specified in the budget resolution.\n\n\nCongressional Review Act\nThe Congressional Review Act, enacted in 1995, allows Congress to review and repeal certain administrative regulations adopted by the executive branch This procedure will most typically be used successfully shortly after a party change in the presidency It was first used in 2001 to repeal an ergonomics rule promulgated under Bill Clinton, and was then used 14 times in 2017 to repeal various regulations adopted in the final year of the Barack Obama presidency.\n\n\nDistrict of Columbia Home Rule Act\nThe District of Columbia Home Rule Act, enacted in 1973, allows Congress to repeal laws passed by the Council of the District of Columbia In the Senate, if a joint resolution of disapproval is introduced within 60 days in the case of a law amending the Criminal Code, or within 30 days in the case of any other law, then if it has not been reported by the committee of jurisdiction after 20 calendar days, a motion to discharge is privileged and debatable for one hour If that motion is agreed to, a nondebatable motion to proceed is in order The joint resolution is then debatable for ten hours, equally divided [99]\n\n\nNational Emergencies Act\nThe National Emergencies Act, enacted in 1976, formalizes the emergency powers of the president In the Senate, if a joint resolution terminating a national emergency has not been reported by the committee of jurisdiction within 15 calendar days, then the committee is automatically discharged and the joint resolution immediately becomes the pending business, thus preventing a filibuster on the motion to proceed Consideration of the joint resolution is then time-limited to three days (whether the Senate is actively debating the joint resolution or not), after which the Senate must vote on passage of the joint resolution [100]: 13–14 \n\n\nWar Powers Resolution\nThe War Powers Resolution, enacted in 1973 over Richard Nixon's veto, generally requires the President to withdraw troops committed overseas within 60 days, which the President may extend once for 30 additional days, unless Congress has declared war, otherwise authorized the use of force, or is unable to meet as a result of an armed attack upon the United States [101] In the Senate, if a concurrent resolution authorizing forces, or requiring that forces be removed, has not been reported by the committee of jurisdiction within 15 calendar days, then the committee is discharged and the concurrent resolution immediately becomes the pending business, thus preventing a filibuster on the motion to proceed Consideration of the concurrent resolution is then time-limited to three days (whether the Senate is actively debating the resolution or not), after which the Senate must vote on agreeing to the concurrent resolution [102]: 16–17 \n\n\nTrade promotion authority\nBeginning in 1975 with the Trade Act of 1974, and later through the Trade Act of 2002 and the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, Congress has from time to time provided so-called \"fast track\" authority for the President to negotiate international trade agreements After the president submits a bill implementing a trade agreement, Congress can approve or deny the agreement, but cannot amend the bill In both the House and the Senate, if the bill is not reported by the committee of jurisdiction within 45 session days, the committee is automatically discharged A motion to proceed to the bill is then privileged and nondebatable Debate on the bill is then limited to 20 hours, equally divided [103]\n\n\nDebt limit\nIn December 2021, the Senate passed S. 610 by a vote of 59–35 (after first invoking cloture by a vote of 64–36), which would allow the Senate to consider, under expedited procedures, one joint resolution in a specified form raising the debt limit After the majority leader introduced such a joint resolution, the joint resolution would be placed on the Calendar, and a motion to proceed would be nondebatable The joint resolution would be debatable for ten hours, equally divided After S.610 was signed into law, the Senate considered and passed S.J.Res. 33 under these expedited procedures This structure allowed Republican senators to vote against the debt limit increase without blocking its passage [104]\n\n\nNuclear option\nDespite the supermajority requirements described above, any senator may attempt to nullify a Senate rule by raising a point of order that is contrary to the existing rules and precedents An appeal in connection with a nondebatable question (such as cloture procedure) is itself nondebatable, so there is no need for a supermajority cloture vote.\n\n\nProcedure to invoke the nuclear option\nThe nuclear option was used in 2013, when Majority Leader Harry Reid raised a point of order that \"the vote on cloture under rule XXII for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United States is by majority vote\" The presiding officer overruled the point of order, and Reid appealed the ruling Minority Leader Mitch McConnell raised a parliamentary inquiry on how many votes were required to appeal the chair's ruling in that instance The presiding officer replied, \"A majority of those Senators voting, a quorum being present, is required.\" Reid's appeal was sustained by a 48–52 vote, and the Senate thus established a precedent that cloture on nominations other than those for the Supreme Court requires only a simple majority [105] [106]\n\n\nOther forms of filibuster\nWhile extended debate is the traditional form of a filibuster in the Senate, other means of delaying and killing legislation are available Because the Senate routinely conducts business by unanimous consent, one member can create at least some delay, and in many cases effectively kill a measure, by objecting to the request In many cases, an objection to a request for unanimous consent will compel a vote of one kind or another (perhaps requiring cloture) While forcing a single vote may not be an effective delaying tool, the cumulative effect of several votes, which take at least 15 minutes apiece (in practice, most take 45 minutes), can be substantial If a senator announces to their leadership that they intend to object to a request (known as a hold), the majority leader will not attempt to make that request even if the senator does not come to the floor to object to it; a single senator's objection is therefore enough to force a lengthy cloture process [110]\n\n\nMotions to go to conference\nThe Senate was previously particularly vulnerable to serial filibusters when it and the House had passed different versions of the same bill and want to go to conference (i.e., appoint a conference committee of both chambers to merge the bills) Normally, the majority would ask for unanimous consent to:\n\n\nLongest solo filibusters\nBelow is a table of the ten longest single-person filibusters to take place in the United States Senate since

[Galadriel] lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark.. Then she let her hand fall, and the light faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad 'I pass the test', she said 'I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel'.\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe Dúnedain said that her height was two rangar, or \"man-high\" – some 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm) [T 14] However, Galadriel's most striking feature was her beautiful long silver-golden hair The Elves of Tirion said it captured the radiance of the Two Trees Laurelin and Telperion themselves [T 15]\n\n\nRelationships\nThe critic Tom Shippey notes that in creating Galadriel, Tolkien was attempting to reconstruct the kind of elf hinted at by elf references in Old English (Anglo-Saxon) words The hints are, he observes, paradoxical: while ælfscyne, \"elf-beautiful\", suggests a powerful allure, ælfsogoða, \"lunacy\", implies that getting too close to elves is dangerous In Shippey's view, Tolkien is telling the literal truth that \"beauty is itself dangerous\", as Chaucer did in The Wife of Bath's Tale where both elves and friars are sexually rapacious So when Faramir says to Sam Gamgee in Ithilien that Galadriel must be \"perilously fair\", Shippey comments that this is a \"highly accurate remark\"; Sam replies that \"folk takes their peril with them into Lorien..

Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. She is a powerful and wise Elf-lady, who plays a significant role in The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings.\n\n**Fictional Biography**\n\nGaladriel was born in Valinor, the only daughter and youngest child of Finarfin, prince of the Noldor, and Eärwen, daughter of Olwë and cousin to Lúthien. Her elder brothers were Finrod Felagund, Angrod, and Aegnor. Galadriel's birth was a moment of great joy in the Vanyar and Noldorin courts, as she was the first Elf-woman to be born in the Undying Lands. She was born with the ability to peer into the minds of others, a gift that allowed her to judge people fairly.\n\nGaladriel was often called the fairest of all Elves, whether in Aman or Middle-earth. She was a member of the royal House of Finwë, and her beauty and wisdom made her a beloved and respected figure among the Elves.\n\n**Second Age**\n\nDuring the Second Age, Galadriel and her husband, Celeborn, traveled to Lindon, where they ruled over a group of Elves. They were themselves ruled by Gil-galad, the High King of the Noldor. After some time, they removed to the shores of Lake Nenuial and were accounted the Lord and Lady of all the Elves of Eriador. Later, they moved eastward and established the realm of Eregion, also known as Hollin. They made contact with a Nandorin settlement in the valley of the River Anduin, which became Lothlórien.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel left Eregion and settled in Lothlórien, where they became the rulers of the realm. According to some accounts, they became rulers of Lothlórien for a time during the Second Age, but in all accounts, they returned to Lothlórien to take up its rule after Amroth was lost in the middle of the Third Age.\n\n**Third Age**\n\nIn the Third Age, Galadriel played a significant role in the events of The Lord of the Rings. She was the Lady of Lothlórien, and her realm was a haven for those seeking refuge from the darkness of Mordor. When Frodo and his companions passed through Lothlórien, Galadriel tested them and revealed to them the true nature of the One Ring. She was the only Elf-lady who could see the true nature of the Ring, and she knew that it was not a simple treasure, but a tool of darkness and destruction.\n\nGaladriel's test of Frodo was a significant moment in the story. She presented him with a choice: to take the Ring for himself and use its power to gain control over Middle-earth, or to destroy it and risk being rejected and cast out. Frodo chose to destroy the Ring, and Galadriel revealed to him the secret of the Ring's destruction: that it could only be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom.\n\nGaladriel's role in the story was not limited to the test of Frodo. She also played a significant role in the events that followed. She sent her servants, the Galadhrim, to assist Frodo and his companions on their quest, and she provided them with the Phial of Galadriel, a powerful artifact that contained the light of Eärendil's star.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nGaladriel's height was two rangar, or \"man-high,\" which is equivalent to about 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm). However, her most striking feature was her beautiful long silver-golden hair, which captured the radiance of the Two Trees Laurelin and Telperion themselves.\n\n**Relationships**\n\nGaladriel's relationships with other characters in the story are significant. She was married to Celeborn, who was the Lord of Lothlórien. She was also the sister of Finrod Felagund, who was the King of Nargothrond. Her relationship with Frodo was significant, as she tested him and revealed to him the true nature of the One Ring.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe character of Galadriel has been analyzed by many scholars and critics. Some have seen her as a symbol of feminine power and wisdom, while others have seen her as a representation of the ideal of beauty and goodness. Her role in the story is significant, as she provides guidance and support to Frodo and his companions on their quest.\n\n**Legacy in Music**\n\nGaladriel's legacy in music is significant. Tolkien wrote a poem, \"Namárië,\" that Galadriel sings in farewell to the departing Fellowship, and to Frodo in particular. The poem was set to music by Donald Swann, and it has been recorded and performed by many artists.\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nGaladriel has been adapted in many different forms of media. She was voiced by Annette Crosbie in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film of The Lord of the Rings, and by Marian Diamond in BBC Radio's 1981 serialisation.\n\n**References**\n\nTolkien, J.R.R. (1977).

The film stars John David Washington and Zendaya in the lead roles. It was released on Netflix in February 2021, after a limited theatrical release in January 2021.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe film follows the story of Malcolm (John David Washington) and Marie (Zendaya), a couple who return home from a film premiere. Malcolm is a film director, and the premiere is for his latest film. As they settle in for a quiet night at home, Malcolm eagerly anticipates the critical reviews of his film, while Marie seems preoccupied and upset. As the night wears on, their conversation turns to their relationship, and the issues that have been simmering beneath the surface.\n\nThroughout the film, Malcolm and Marie engage in a series of intense and often confrontational conversations, as they grapple with their feelings for each other and their own insecurities. The film's title, Malcolm & Marie, suggests a symbiotic relationship between the two characters, with each one influencing and affecting the other.\n\n## Production\n\nThe idea for Malcolm & Marie was born out of a conversation between Sam Levinson and Zendaya, who were both working on the HBO series Euphoria in 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, production on Euphoria had come to a halt, and Levinson turned his attention to a feature film project. He pitched the idea to Zendaya, who was drawn to the project's focus on a single, real-time scene.\n\nLevinson began working on the script, inspired by the idea of a relationship piece that plays out in real time. He wanted to explore the complexities of a romantic relationship, and the ways in which two people can be both deeply connected and deeply flawed.\n\n## Release\n\nMalcolm & Marie was released on Netflix in February 2021, following a limited theatrical release in January 2021. The film was acquired by Netflix for $30 million, outbidding several major studios and streaming services.\n\n## Reception\n\nMalcolm & Marie received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the chemistry between Washington and Zendaya, while others found the film's pacing and tone to be uneven. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 56% approval rating, based on 250 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n## Critical Response\n\nMany critics praised the chemistry between Washington and Zendaya, who deliver nuanced and emotionally charged performances. However, some critics found the film's pacing and tone to be uneven, with some scenes feeling overly long or meandering.\n\n## Accolades\n\nMalcolm & Marie has not received any major awards or nominations.\n\n## External Links\n\n* Malcolm & Marie on Netflix\n* Malcolm & Marie on IMDb\n* Malcolm & Marie on Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Malcolm_&_Marie\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nWriter-director Malcolm Elliott (John David Washington) returns home from his film premiere with his girlfriend Marie Jones (Zendaya) Malcolm eagerly anticipates the critical reviews following the emotional audience response from the screening When he notices Marie looking displeased, he urges her to tell him what is bothering her Initially reluctant to start a fight in the middle of the night, she tells him that she is upset that she was not thanked or acknowledged in his speech at the premiere.\n\n\nProduction\nIn 2020, Sam Levinson and Zendaya were both involved in the HBO show Euphoria, which had stopped production due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the two discussed the possibility and idea of making a feature film project during the pandemic Levinson pitched several possibilities to Zendaya, including a psychological thriller they would film at her home He then began to come up with \"a relationship piece that plays out in real time.\" [1]\n\n\nRelease\nIn September 2020, Netflix acquired distribution rights to the film for $30 million, outbidding HBO, Amazon Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Apple TV+, A24 and Focus Features [8] It was released theatrically in select theaters on January 29, 2021, and then was streamed on Netflix beginning February 5, 2021 [10] [11] Deadline Hollywood reported the film \"made hardly any money\" during its theatrical run (due to the COVID-19 lockdowns) [12] The film was the most-watched title on the platform in its debut weekend, but dropped out of the top 10 by its second [13] [14]\n\n\nReception\nAccording to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 56% of 250 critic reviews were positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"Malcolm & Marie's ambitions aren't always satisfactorily fulfilled, but its flaws are often offset by the strong chemistry between the film's stars.\" [15] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [16]\n\n\nCritical response\nAccording to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 56% of 250 critic reviews were positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"Malcolm & Marie's ambitions aren't always satisfactorily fulfilled, but its flaws are often offset by the strong chemistry between the film's stars.\" [15] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [16]\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The bridge was opened in 2018 and has since become a vital transportation link between Crimea and Russia.\n\n**History**\n\nProposals to build a bridge across the Kerch Strait have been considered since the early 20th century. The idea of an international bridge linking Ukraine and Russia survived the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, but the two countries failed to finalize the project. After the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia declared it would unilaterally build the Kerch Strait bridge to connect the Russian mainland with the annexed Ukrainian peninsula.\n\n**Pre-annexation Proposals and Attempts**\n\nProposals to build a bridge across the Kerch Strait had been considered since the early 20th century. In 1949, the Soviet government ordered the construction of a 5.969-kilometre (3 mi 1,248 yd) two-tier combined road-rail bridge (two road lanes on the upper tier and two rail tracks on the lower tier) with 40 m clearance below, connecting Yeni-Kale with Chushka Spit. However, construction was halted in 1950, and a ferry line was set up instead.\n\n**Soviet Proposals**\n\nThe Soviet government also considered building a tunnel under the Kerch Strait, but this project was ultimately abandoned. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were several proposals to build a bridge or tunnel, but none of these projects were realized.\n\n**Negotiations Between the Ukrainian and Russian Governments**\n\nAlthough the idea of an international bridge linking Ukraine and Russia survived the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, the two countries failed to finalize the project. Former Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov was a vocal advocate for a highway bridge across the strait, expressing hope that it would bring the Crimean people closer to Russia, both economically and symbolically.\n\n**After 2014 Annexation and Start of Construction**\n\nFollowing the Russian annexation of Crimea in March 2014, Russia declared it would unilaterally build the Kerch Strait bridge to connect the Russian mainland with the annexed Ukrainian peninsula.

Vladimir Konstantinov, Chairman of the State Council of Crimea, attributed the explosion to a Ukrainian attack. Limited traffic resumed on the remaining lines shortly afterwards. Russian authorities ordered repairs to be complete by July 2023.\n\n**July 2023 Explosion**\n\nIn the early morning of 17 July 2023, two explosions hit the Crimean Bridge. At least one section of the road bridge collapsed entirely, and rail services were stopped. Two people, a couple who were in a car on the bridge, were killed, and their child injured. The bridge was struck twice before 03:00, according to reports on social media. Ukrainian and Russian sources indicated that the explosion was caused by a Ukrainian attack with unmanned surface vessels (aquatic drones). The bridge was fully reopened on 14 October.\n\n**August 2023 Attack**\n\nOn 12 August, Russia's Defence Ministry said that Ukraine tried to strike the bridge with three S-200 missiles but were unsuccessful due to interception by air defences. Footage released online appeared to show the bridge covered in smoke. The bridge was temporarily closed, then both road and rail traffic resumed at a limited level.\n\n**Design**\n\nAfter the annexation, Russian officials looked at various options for connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland, including a tunnel, but eventually settled on a bridge. The bridge has a main span of 1,360 meters and a height of 65 meters above the water level.\n\n**Construction**\n\nPreliminary work on the bridge began in May 2015. More than 200 bombs and a few aeroplanes from the World War II era were found in the area during pre-construction clearance. Three temporary bridges were built to facilitate access (independent of weather and currents) for main construction. By October 2015, the first of the temporary bridges had been constructed, connecting Tuzla Island and Taman Peninsula.\n\n**Operation and Impact**\n\nThe road bridge, opened in 2018, quickly overtook the Kerch Strait ferry as a preferred route of communication between Crimea and Russia. In its first 12 hours of operation, the bridge broke the traffic record of the ferry, which had been established in August 2017. After the bridge was opened for trucks in October 2018, truck transportation via the ferry virtually ceased. After the first full year of operation (May 2018 – May 2019), the road bridge had served three times more traffic than the Kerch Strait ferry had served in the whole of 2017.\n\n**On Crimea and Russia**\n\nThe road bridge, opened in 2018, quickly overtook the Kerch Strait ferry as a preferred route of communication between Crimea and Russia.

Following completion of the bridge, various restrictions were imposed on Ukrainian shipping, which affect their operating costs. Ukraine and others alleged that this was part of a creeping hybrid blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Azov Sea.\n\n**Archaeology**\n\nPart of a large Greek terracotta statue was found at the Crimean Bridge construction site during underwater digging near the Ak-Burun Cape.

[72] [73] Ukrainian and Russian sources indicated that the explosion was caused by a Ukrainian attack with unmanned surface vessels (aquatic drones) [61] The bridge was fully reopened on 14 October [74]\n\n\nAugust 2023 attack\nOn 12 August, Russia's Defence Ministry said that Ukraine tried to strike the bridge with three S-200 missiles but were unsuccessful due to interception by air defences Footage released online appeared to show the bridge covered in smoke [75] [76] The bridge was temporarily closed, then both road and rail traffic resumed at a limited level [76] [77]\n\n\nDesign\nAfter the annexation, Russian officials looked at various options for connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland, including a tunnel, but eventually settled on a bridge [42]\n\n\nConstruction\nPreliminary work on the bridge began in May 2015 More than 200 bombs [88] and a few aeroplanes (including an Ilyushin Il-2 [89] and a Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk) [90] from the World War II era were found in the area during pre-construction clearance Three temporary bridges were built to facilitate access (independent of weather and currents) for main construction [91] By October 2015, the first of the temporary bridges had been constructed, connecting Tuzla Island and Taman Peninsula [92]\n\n\nOperation and impact\nThe road bridge, opened in 2018, quickly overtook the Kerch Strait ferry as a preferred route of communication between Crimea and Russia In its first 12 hours of operation the bridge broke the traffic record of the ferry, which had been established in August 2017 [119] After the bridge was opened for trucks in October 2018, truck transportation via the ferry virtually ceased [120] After the first full year of operation (May 2018 – May 2019) the road bridge had served three times more traffic than the Kerch Strait ferry had served in the whole of 2017 [121]\n\n\nOn Crimea and Russia\nThe road bridge, opened in 2018, quickly overtook the Kerch Strait ferry as a preferred route of communication between Crimea and Russia In its first 12 hours of operation the bridge broke the traffic record of the ferry, which had been established in August 2017 [119] After the bridge was opened for trucks in October 2018, truck transportation via the ferry virtually ceased [120] After the first full year of operation (May 2018 – May 2019) the road bridge had served three times more traffic than the Kerch Strait ferry had served in the whole of 2017 [121]\n\n\nOn Ukraine\nThe Russian bridge crossed the sole access point for ships travelling to and from Ukraine's eastern port cities, including Mariupol and Berdiansk through which Ukraine exported steel and agricultural products [129] Following completion of the bridge various restrictions were imposed on Ukrainian shipping which affect their operating costs, which Ukraine and others alleged was part of a creeping hybrid blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Azov Sea [130] [131] [132]\n\n\nArchaeology\nPart of a large Greek terracotta statue was found at the Crimean Bridge construction site, during underwater digging near the Ak-Burun Cape According to archaeologists, this is a unique finding, since it is the first of its kind found in the northern Black Sea area [136]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Kyiv", "content": "\nName\nThe traditional etymology, stemming from the Primary Chronicle, is that the name is a derivation of Kyi (Ukrainian: Кий, Russian: Кий, [c] rom.: Ky or Kiy), the legendary eponymous founder of the city According to Oleg Trubachyov's etymological dictionary from the Old East Slavic name *Kyjevŭ gordŭ (literally, \"Kyi's castle\", \"Kyi's gord\"), from Proto-Slavic *kyjevъ, [18] This etymology has been questioned, for instance by Mykhailo Hrushevsky who called it an \"etymological myth\", and meant that the names of the legendary founders are in turn based on place names According to the Canadian Ukrainian linguist Jaroslav Rudnyckyj, the name can be connected to the Proto-Slavic root *kyjь, but should be interpreted as meaning 'stick, pole' as in its modern Ukrainian equivalent Кий The name should in that case be interpreted as 'palisaded settlement' [19]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first known humans in the region of Kyiv lived there in the late paleolithic period (Stone Age) [26] The population around Kyiv during the Bronze Age formed part of the so-called Trypillian culture, as evidenced by artifacts from that culture found in the area [27] During the early Iron Age certain tribes settled around Kyiv that practiced land cultivation, husbandry and trading with the Scythians and ancient states of the northern Black Sea coast [26] Findings of Roman coins of the 2nd to the 4th centuries suggest trade relations with the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire [26] Notable archaeologists of the area around Kyiv include Vikentiy Khvoyka.\n\n\nFounding\nScholars continue to debate when the city was founded: The traditional founding date is 482 CE, so the city celebrated its 1,500th anniversary in 1982 Archaeological data indicates a founding in the sixth or seventh centuries, [28] [29] with some researchers dating the founding as late as the late 9th century [30]\n\n\nRussian suzerainty\nOccupied by Russian troops since the 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav, Kyiv became a part of the Tsardom of Russia from 1667 on the Truce of Andrusovo and enjoyed a degree of autonomy None of the Polish-Russian treaties concerning Kyiv have ever been ratified [50] In the Russian Empire, Kyiv was a primary Christian centre, attracting pilgrims, and the cradle of many of the empire's most important religious figures, but until the 19th century, the city's commercial importance remained marginal.\n\n\nSoviet era\nIn the turbulent period following the 1917 Russian Revolution, Kyiv became the capital of several successive Ukrainian states and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: World War I, during which German soldiers occupied it from 2 March 1918 to November 1918, the Russian Civil War of 1917 to 1922, and the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921 During the last three months of 1919, Kyiv was intermittently controlled by the White Army Kyiv changed hands sixteen times from the end of 1918 to August 1920 [51]\n\n\nIndependence\nIn the course of the collapse of the Soviet Union the Ukrainian parliament proclaimed the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine in the city on 24 August 1991 In 2004–2005, the city played host to the largest post-Soviet public demonstrations up to that time, in support of the Orange Revolution From November 2013 until February 2014, central Kyiv became the primary location of Euromaidan During the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian forces attempted to seize Kyiv but were repelled by Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of the city; Kyiv itself escaped major damage Following the Russian retreat from the region in April 2022, Kyiv has been subject to frequent air strikes.\n\n\nEnvironment\nGeographically, Kyiv is on the border of the Polesia woodland ecological zone, a part of the European mixed woods area, and the East European forest steppe biome However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region Kyiv is completely surrounded by Kyiv Oblast.\n\n\nGeography\nGeographically, Kyiv is on the border of the Polesia woodland ecological zone, a part of the European mixed woods area, and the East European forest steppe biome However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region Kyiv is completely surrounded by Kyiv Oblast.\n\n\nClimate\nKyiv has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) [62] The warmest months are June, July, and August, with mean temperatures of 13.8 to 24.8 °C (56.8 to 76.6 °F) The coldest are December, January, and February, with mean temperatures of −4.6 to −1.1 °C (23.7 to 30.0 °F) The highest ever temperature recorded in the city was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F) on 30 July 1936 [63] [64]\n\n\nLegal status, local government and politics\nThe municipality of the city of Kyiv has a special legal status within Ukraine compared to the other administrative subdivisions of the country The most significant difference is that the city is considered as a region of Ukraine (see Regions of Ukraine) It is the only city that has double jurisdiction The Head of City State Administration – the city's governor – is appointed by the president of Ukraine, while the Head of the City Council – the mayor of Kyiv – is elected by local popular vote.\n\n\nLegal status and local government\nThe municipality of the city of Kyiv has a

western right bank of the river, the city expanded into the left bank only in the 20th century Most of Kyiv's attractions as well as the majority of business and governmental institutions are on the right bank The eastern \"Left Bank\" is predominantly residential There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.\n\n\nTraditional subdivision\nThe Dnieper River

attractions as well as the majority of business and governmental institutions are on the right bank The eastern \"Left Bank\" is predominantly residential There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.\n\n\nFormal subdivision\nThe first known formal subdivision of Kyiv dates to 1810 when the city was subdivided into 4 parts: Pechersk, Starokyiv, and the first and the second parts of Podil In 1833–1834 according to Tsar Nicholas I's decree, Kyiv was subdivided into 6 police raions (districts); later being increased to 10 In 1917, there were 8 Raion Councils (Duma), which were reorganised by bolsheviks into 6 Party-Territory Raions.\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the official registration statistics, there were 2,847,200 residents within the city limits of Kyiv in July 2013 [79]\n\n\nHistorical population\nAccording to the All-Ukrainian Census, the population of Kyiv in 2001 was 2,611,327 [83] The historic changes in population are shown in the side table According to the census, some 1,393,000 (53.3%) were female and 1,219,000 (46.7%) were male Comparing the results with the previous census (1989) shows the trend of population ageing which, while prevalent throughout the country, is partly offset in Kyiv by the inflow of working age migrants Some 1,069,700 people had higher or completed secondary education, a significant increase of 21.7% since 1989.\n\n\nEthnic composition\nKyiv's ethnic composition has shifted greatly over the last centuries According to the census of March 2, 1874  [uk], conducted by the local branch of the Russian Geographical Society, there were 127,205 people living in Kyiv Of these, 80% spoke \"Russian,\" 11% spoke \"Jewish,\" 6% spoke Polish and 2% spoke German Of the \"Russian\" speakers, 39% were recorded as speaking Little Russian (Ukrainian), which meant that Ukrainian speakers accounted for 30% of the city as a whole Of the remaining \"Russian\" speakers, however, there were only 10% who spoke Greater Russian (Russian) and 2% who spoke Belarusian The remaining 49% spoke in \"generally Russian speech.\" [85] According to the official census of 1897, the number of Great Russian speakers rose to 54%; speakers of Little Russian accounted for 22% Jewish speakers accounted for 12%, Polish 6.7% [86]\n\n\nLanguage statistics\nBoth Ukrainian and Russian are commonly spoken in the city; approximately 75% of Kyiv's population responded \"Ukrainian\" to the 2001 census question on their native language, roughly 25% responded \"Russian\" [91] According to a 2006 survey, Ukrainian is used at home by 23% of Kyivans, 52% use Russian, and 24% switch between both [92] In the 2003 sociological survey, when the question \"What language do you use in everyday life?\" was asked, 52% said \"mostly Russian\", 32% \"both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure\", 14% \"mostly Ukrainian\", and 4.3% \"exclusively Ukrainian\" [93]\n\n\nJews\nThe Jews of Kyiv are first mentioned in a 10th-century letter The Jewish population remained relatively small until the nineteenth century [95] A series of pogroms was carried out in 1882, and another in 1905 On the eve of World War I, the city's Jewish population was over 81,000 [96] In 1939 there were approximately 224,000 Jews in Kyiv, [95] some of whom fled the city ahead of the German invasion of the Soviet Union that began in June 1941 On 29 and 30 September 1941, nearly 34,000 Kyivan Jews were massacred at Babi Yar by the Wehrmacht, SS, Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, and local collaborators [97] [98]\n\n\nCityscape\nModern Kyiv is a mix of the old (Kyiv preserved about 70 percent of more than 1,000 buildings built during 1907–1914) [101] and the new, seen in everything from the architecture to the stores and to the people themselves When the capital of the Ukrainian SSR was moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv many new buildings were commissioned to give the city \"the gloss and polish of a capital\" [101] In the discussions that centered on how to create a showcase city center, the current city center of Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) were not the obvious choices [101] Some of the early, ultimately not materialised, ideas included a part of Pechersk, Lypky, European Square, and Mykhailivska Square [101]\n\n\nCulture\nKyiv was the historic cultural centre of the East Slavic civilization and a major cradle for the Christianization of Kievan Rus Kyiv retained through centuries its cultural importance and even at times of relative decay, it remained the centre of primary importance of Eastern Orthodox Christianity Its sacred sites of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (the Monastery of the Caves) and the Saint Sophia Cathedral are attracting pilgrims for centuries and recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, remaining the primary religious centres as well as major tourist attractions The above-mentioned sites are also part of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine collection.\n\n\nAttractions\nIt is said that one can walk from one end of Kyiv to the other in the summertime without leaving the shade of its many trees Most characteristic are the horse-chestnuts (каштани, kashtany).\n\n\nMuseums and galleries\nKyiv is home to some 40 different museums [112] In 2009 they recorded a total of 4.3 million visits [112]\n\n\nSports\nKyiv has many professional and amateur football clubs, including Dynamo Kyiv, Arsenal Kyiv and FC Obolon Kyiv but only Dynamo Kyiv play in the Ukrainian Premier League Of these three, Dynamo Kyiv has had the most success over the course of its history For example, up until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the club won 13 USSR Championships, 9 USSR Cups, and 3 USSR Super Cups, thus making Dynamo the most successful club in the history of the Soviet Top League [113]\n\n\nTourism\nSince introducing a visa-free regime for EU-member states and Switzerland in 2005, Ukraine has seen a steady increase in the number of foreign tourists visiting the country [115] Before the 2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis, the average annual growth in the number of foreign visits in Kyiv was 23% over a three-year period [116] In 2009, a total of 1.6 million tourists stayed in Kyiv hotels, of whom almost 259,000 (c 16%) were foreigners [116]\n\n\nCity anthem\nIn 2014, the Kyiv city's council established the city's anthem [118] It became a 1962 song, \"Yak tebe ne liubyty, Kyieve mii!\" [118] (Як тебе не любити, Києве мій!, roughly \"How can I not love you, Kyiv of mine!\").\n\n\nCity symbols\nThe horse chestnut tree is one of the symbols of Kyiv [119] It was heavily present on the city's coat of arms used from 1969 to 1995 [119]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs with most capital cities, Kyiv is a major administrative, cultural, and scientific centre of the country It is the largest city in Ukraine in terms of both population and area and enjoys the highest levels of business activity On 1 January 2010, there were around 238,000 business entities registered in Kyiv [120]\n\n\nIndustry\nPrimary industries in Kyiv include utilities – i.e., electricity, gas and water supply (26% of total industrial output), manufacture of food, beverages and tobacco products (22%), chemical (17%), mechanical engineering (13%) and manufacture of paper and paper products, including publishing, printing and reproduction of recorded media (11%) [138] The Institute of Oil Transportation is headquartered here.\n\n\nManufacture\nScientific research is conducted in many institutes of higher education and, additionally, in many research

University, [140] the National Technical University \"Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\", [141] Kyiv-Mohyla Academy [142] and the Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics Of these, the Mohyla Academy is the oldest, founded as a theological school in 1632, but Shevchenko University, founded in 1834, is the oldest in continuous operation The total number of institutions of higher education in Kyiv approaches 200, [143] allowing young people to pursue almost any line of study While education traditionally remains largely in the hands of the state there are several accredited private institutions in the city.\n\n\nSecondary education\nThere are about 530 general secondary schools and about 680 nursery schools and kindergartens in Kyiv [144] Additionally, there are evening schools for adults, specialist technical schools, and the Evangel Theological Seminary.\n\n\nPublic libraries\nThere are many libraries in the city, with the Vernadsky National Library, which is Ukraine's main academic library and scientific information centre, as well as one of the world's largest national libraries, being the largest and most important one [145] The National Library is affiliated with the Academy of Sciences in so far as it is a deposit library and thus serves as the academy's archives' store The national library is the world's foremost repository of Jewish folk music recorded on Edison wax cylinders Their Collection of Jewish Musical Folklore (1912–1947) was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2005 [146]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nLocal public transportation in Kyiv includes

The eastern \"Left Bank\" is predominantly residential. There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAccording to the official registration statistics, there were 2,847,200 residents within the city limits of Kyiv in July 2013. The population of Kyiv in 2001 was 2,611,327, with 1,393,000 (53.3%) females and 1,219,000 (46.7%) males. Comparing the results with the previous census (1989) shows the trend of population ageing, which is partly offset in Kyiv by the inflow of working-age migrants.\n\n**Ethnic Composition**\n\nKyiv's ethnic composition has shifted greatly over the last centuries. According to the census of March 2, 1874, conducted by the local branch of the Russian Geographical Society, there were 127,205 people living in Kyiv. Of these, 80% spoke \"Russian,\" 11% spoke \"Jewish,\" 6% spoke Polish, and 2% spoke German. Of the \"Russian\" speakers, 39% were recorded as speaking Little Russian (Ukrainian), which meant that Ukrainian speakers accounted for 30% of the city as a whole.\n\n**Language Statistics**\n\nBoth Ukrainian and Russian are commonly spoken in the city. Approximately 75% of Kyiv's population responded \"Ukrainian\" to the 2001 census question on their native language, roughly 25% responded \"Russian.\" According to a 2006 survey, Ukrainian is used at home by 23% of Kyivans, 52% use Russian, and 24% switch between both. In the 2003 sociological survey, when the question \"What language do you use in everyday life?\" was asked, 52% said \"mostly Russian,\" 32% \"both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure,\" 14% \"mostly Ukrainian,\" and 4.3% \"exclusively Ukrainian.\"\n\n**Jews**\n\nThe Jews of Kyiv are first mentioned in a 10th-century letter. The Jewish population remained relatively small until the 19th century. A series of pogroms was carried out in 1882, and another in 1905. On the eve of World War I, the city's Jewish population was over 81,000. In 1939, there were appr", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kyiv\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\nThe traditional etymology, stemming from the Primary Chronicle, is that the name is a derivation of Kyi (Ukrainian: Кий, Russian: Кий, [c] rom.: Ky or Kiy), the legendary eponymous founder of the city According to Oleg Trubachyov's etymological dictionary from the Old East Slavic name *Kyjevŭ gordŭ (literally, \"Kyi's castle\", \"Kyi's gord\"), from Proto-Slavic *kyjevъ, [18] This etymology has been questioned, for instance by Mykhailo Hrushevsky who called it an \"etymological myth\", and meant that the names of the legendary founders are in turn based on place names According to the Canadian Ukrainian linguist Jaroslav Rudnyckyj, the name can be connected to the Proto-Slavic root *kyjь, but should be interpreted as meaning 'stick, pole' as in its modern Ukrainian equivalent Кий The name should in that case be interpreted as 'palisaded settlement' [19]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first known humans in the region of Kyiv lived there in the late paleolithic period (Stone Age) [26] The population around Kyiv during the Bronze Age formed part of the so-called Trypillian culture, as evidenced by artifacts from that culture found in the area [27] During the early Iron Age certain tribes settled around Kyiv that practiced land cultivation, husbandry and trading with the Scythians and ancient states of the northern Black Sea coast [26] Findings of Roman coins of the 2nd to the 4th centuries suggest trade relations with the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire [26] Notable archaeologists of the area around Kyiv include Vikentiy Khvoyka.\n\n\nFounding\nScholars continue to debate when the city was founded: The traditional founding date is 482 CE, so the city celebrated its 1,500th anniversary in 1982 Archaeological data indicates a founding in the sixth or seventh centuries, [28] [29] with some researchers dating the founding as late as the late 9th century [30]\n\n\nRussian suzerainty\nOccupied by Russian troops since the 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav, Kyiv became a part of the Tsardom of Russia from 1667 on the Truce of Andrusovo and enjoyed a degree of autonomy None of the Polish-Russian treaties concerning Kyiv have ever been ratified [50] In the Russian Empire, Kyiv was a primary Christian centre, attracting pilgrims, and the cradle of many of the empire's most important religious figures, but until the 19th century, the city's commercial importance remained marginal.\n\n\nSoviet era\nIn the turbulent period following the 1917 Russian Revolution, Kyiv became the capital of several successive Ukrainian states and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: World War I, during which German soldiers occupied it from 2 March 1918 to November 1918, the Russian Civil War of 1917 to 1922, and the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921 During the last three months of 1919, Kyiv was intermittently controlled by the White Army Kyiv changed hands sixteen times from the end of 1918 to August 1920 [51]\n\n\nIndependence\nIn the course of the collapse of the Soviet Union the Ukrainian parliament proclaimed the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine in the city on 24 August 1991 In 2004–2005, the city played host to the largest post-Soviet public demonstrations up to that time, in support of the Orange Revolution From November 2013 until February 2014, central Kyiv became the primary location of Euromaidan During the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian forces attempted to seize Kyiv but were repelled by Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of the city; Kyiv itself escaped major damage Following the Russian retreat from the region in April 2022, Kyiv has been subject to frequent air strikes.\n\n\nEnvironment\nGeographically, Kyiv is on the border of the Polesia woodland ecological zone, a part of the European mixed woods area, and the East European forest steppe biome However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region Kyiv is completely surrounded by Kyiv Oblast.\n\n\nGeography\nGeographically, Kyiv is on

recorded in the city was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F) on 30 July 1936 [63] [64]\n\n\nLegal status, local government and politics\nThe municipality of the city of Kyiv has a special legal status within Ukraine compared to the other administrative subdivisions of the country The most significant difference is that the city is considered as a region of Ukraine (see Regions of Ukraine) It is the only city that has double jurisdiction The Head of City State Administration – the city's governor – is appointed by the president of Ukraine, while the Head of the City Council – the mayor of Kyiv – is elected by local popular vote.\n\n\nLegal status and local government\nThe municipality of the city of Kyiv has a special legal status within Ukraine compared to the other administrative subdivisions of the

the left bank only in the 20th century Most of Kyiv's attractions as well as the majority of business and governmental institutions are on the right bank The eastern \"Left Bank\" is predominantly residential There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.\n\n\nTraditional subdivision\nThe Dnieper River naturally divides Kyiv into the Right Bank and the Left

subdivision\nThe first known formal subdivision of Kyiv dates to 1810 when the city was subdivided into 4 parts: Pechersk, Starokyiv, and the first and the second parts of Podil In 1833–1834 according to Tsar Nicholas I's decree, Kyiv was subdivided into 6 police raions (districts); later being increased to 10 In 1917, there were 8 Raion Councils (Duma), which were reorganised by bolsheviks into 6 Party-Territory Raions.\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the official registration statistics, there were 2,847,200 residents within the city limits of Kyiv in July 2013 [79]\n\n\nHistorical population\nAccording to the All-Ukrainian Census, the population of Kyiv in 2001 was 2,611,327 [83] The historic changes in population are shown in the side table According to the census, some 1,393,000 (53.3%) were female and 1,219,000 (46.7%) were male Comparing the results with the previous census (1989) shows the trend of population ageing which, while prevalent throughout the country, is partly offset in Kyiv by the inflow of working age migrants Some 1,069,700 people had higher or completed secondary education, a significant increase of 21.7% since 1989.\n\n\nEthnic composition\nKyiv's ethnic composition has shifted greatly over the last centuries According to the census of March 2, 1874  [uk], conducted by the local branch of the Russian Geographical Society, there were 127,205 people living in Kyiv Of these, 80% spoke \"Russian,\" 11% spoke \"Jewish,\" 6% spoke Polish and 2% spoke German Of the \"Russian\" speakers, 39% were recorded as speaking Little Russian (Ukrainian), which meant that Ukrainian speakers accounted for 30% of the city as a whole Of the remaining \"Russian\" speakers, however, there were only 10% who spoke Greater Russian (Russian) and 2% who spoke Belarusian The remaining 49% spoke in \"generally Russian speech.\" [85] According to the official census of 1897, the number of Great Russian speakers rose to 54%; speakers of Little Russian accounted for 22% Jewish speakers accounted for 12%, Polish 6.7% [86]\n\n\nLanguage statistics\nBoth Ukrainian and Russian are commonly spoken in the city; approximately 75% of Kyiv's population responded \"Ukrainian\" to the 2001 census question on their native language, roughly 25% responded \"Russian\" [91] According to a 2006 survey, Ukrainian is used at home by 23% of

population remained relatively small until the nineteenth century [95] A series of pogroms was carried out in 1882, and another in 1905 On the eve of World War I, the city's Jewish population was over 81,000 [96] In 1939 there were approximately 224,000 Jews in Kyiv, [95] some of whom fled the city ahead of the German invasion of the Soviet Union that began in June 1941 On 29 and 30 September 1941, nearly 34,000 Kyivan Jews were massacred at Babi Yar by the Wehrmacht, SS, Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, and local collaborators [97] [98]\n\n\nCityscape\nModern Kyiv is a mix of the old (Kyiv preserved about 70 percent of more than 1,000 buildings built during 1907–1914) [101] and the new, seen in everything from the architecture to the stores and to the people themselves When the capital of the Ukrainian SSR was moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv many new buildings were commissioned to give the city \"the gloss and polish of a capital\" [101] In the discussions that centered on how to create a showcase city center, the current city center of Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) were not the obvious choices [101] Some of the early, ultimately not materialised, ideas included a part of Pechersk, Lypky, European Square, and Mykhailivska Square [101]\n\n\nCulture\nKyiv was the historic cultural centre of the East Slavic civilization and a major cradle for the Christianization of Kievan Rus Kyiv retained through centuries its cultural importance and even at times of relative decay, it remained the centre of primary importance of Eastern Orthodox Christianity Its sacred sites of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (the Monastery of the Caves) and the Saint Sophia Cathedral are attracting pilgrims for centuries and recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, remaining the primary religious centres as well as major tourist attractions The above-mentioned sites are also part of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine collection.\n\n\nAttractions\nIt is said that one can walk from one end of Kyiv to the other in the summertime without leaving the shade of its many trees Most characteristic are the horse-chestnuts (каштани, kashtany).\n\n\nMuseums and galleries\nKyiv is home to some 40 different museums [112] In 2009 they recorded a total of 4.3 million visits [112]\n\n\nSports\nKyiv has many professional and amateur football clubs, including Dynamo Kyiv, Arsenal Kyiv and FC Obolon Kyiv but only Dynamo Kyiv play in the Ukrainian Premier League Of these three, Dynamo Kyiv has had the most success over the course of its history For example, up until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the club won 13 USSR Championships, 9 USSR Cups, and 3 USSR Super Cups, thus making Dynamo the most successful club in the history of the Soviet Top League [113]\n\n\nTourism\nSince introducing a visa-free regime for EU-member states and Switzerland in 2005, Ukraine has seen a steady increase in the number of foreign tourists visiting the country [115] Before the 2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis, the average annual growth in the number of foreign visits in Kyiv was 23% over a three-year period [116] In 2009, a total of 1.6 million tourists stayed in Kyiv hotels, of whom almost 259,000 (c 16%) were foreigners [116]\n\n\nCity anthem\nIn 2014, the Kyiv city's council established the city's anthem [118] It became a 1962 song, \"Yak tebe ne liubyty, Kyieve mii!\" [118] (Як тебе не любити, Києве мій!, roughly \"How can I not love you, Kyiv of mine!\").\n\n\nCity symbols\nThe horse chestnut tree is one of the symbols of Kyiv [119] It was heavily present on the city's coat of arms used from 1969 to 1995 [119]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs with most capital cities, Kyiv is a major administrative, cultural, and scientific centre of the country It is the largest city in Ukraine in terms of both population and area and enjoys the highest levels of business activity On 1 January 2010, there were around 238,000 business entities registered in Kyiv [120]\n\n\nIndustry\nPrimary industries in Kyiv include utilities – i.e., electricity, gas and water supply (26% of total industrial output), manufacture of food, beverages and tobacco products (22%), chemical (17%), mechanical engineering (13%) and manufacture of paper and paper products, including publishing, printing and reproduction of recorded media (11%) [138] The Institute of Oil Transportation is headquartered here.\n\n\nManufacture\nScientific research is conducted in many institutes of higher education and, additionally, in many research institutes affiliated with the

National Technical University \"Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\", [141] Kyiv-Mohyla Academy [142] and the Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics Of these, the Mohyla Academy is the oldest, founded as a theological school in 1632, but Shevchenko University, founded in 1834, is the oldest in continuous operation The total number of institutions of higher education in Kyiv approaches 200, [143] allowing young people to pursue almost any line of study While education traditionally remains largely in the hands of the state there are several accredited private institutions in the city.\n\n\nSecondary education\nThere are about 530 general secondary schools and about 680 nursery schools and kindergartens in Kyiv [144] Additionally, there are evening schools for adults, specialist technical schools, and the Evangel Theological Seminary.\n\n\nPublic libraries\nThere are many libraries in the city, with the Vernadsky National Library, which is Ukraine's main academic library and scientific information centre, as well as one of the world's largest national libraries, being the largest and most important one [145] The National Library is affiliated with the Academy of Sciences in so far as it is a deposit library and thus serves as the academy's archives' store The national library is the world's foremost repository of Jewish folk music recorded on Edison wax cylinders Their Collection of Jewish Musical Folklore (1912–1947) was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2005 [146]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nLocal public transportation in Kyiv includes

{"title": "Killing_of_Caylee_Anthony", "content": "\nDisappearance\nOn June 16, 2008, Casey Anthony departed from her parents' home in Orlando, Florida, where she and Caylee resided [25] Her father, George Anthony, later testified that he saw his granddaughter Caylee leaving with Casey [26] Casey told her mother, Cindy, that she was taking Caylee to her nanny, whom Casey identified as Zenaida \"Zanny\" Fernandez-Gonzalez, and, the next day, she further informed Cindy that the three were headed to Tampa on a work trip [27]\n\n\nInvestigation\nCasey told investigators that she had left Caylee at the apartment of her nanny, Fernandez-Gonzalez, [26] and that Fernandez-Gonzalez had kidnapped the toddler [27] [32] But when police investigated the apartment, they found it had been abandoned for more than 140 days [26] Casey also told police that she was working at Universal Studios [33] However, when investigators took her to Universal Studios on July 16 and asked her to show them her office, Casey led detectives into the building before admitting that she no longer worked there; [34] as it turned out, she had not worked there since she had taken maternity leave almost three years earlier [35] Casey was subsequently arrested [36] On July 29, Casey was offered a limited-immunity deal—in exchange for help finding Caylee, prosecutors said they would not use Casey's statements to police against her [37] The offer expired September 2, 2008 [37]\n\n\nCriminal action\nFollowing her arrest at Universal Studios, [36] Casey was charged with giving false statements to law enforcement, child neglect and obstruction of a criminal investigation The judge denied bail, saying Casey had shown \"woeful disregard for the welfare of her child\" [47] On July 22, 2008, after a bond hearing, the judge set bail at $500,000 [48] A month later, Casey was released from the Orange County jail after her $500,000 bond was posted by Tony Padilla, the nephew of California bail bondsman Leonard Padilla [49] [50] Leonard said he hoped he and his nephew could help Anthony find her missing daughter [51] However, when an angry crowd began to gather around the Anthony residence, where Casey stayed while on bond, Tony decided to revoke her bond and returned her to jail [51] Leonard further added that Casey had not wanted to communicate with him [51]\n\n\nArrest\nFollowing her

added that Casey had not wanted to communicate with him [51]\n\n\nIndictment\nOn October 14, 2008, Casey was indicted by a grand jury on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and four counts of providing false information to police She was later arrested, [55] [56] and Judge John Jordan ordered that she be held without bond [57] A week later, the state dropped the child-neglect charges because \"the neglect charges were premised on the theory that  [Anthony]    was still alive\" [58] On October 28, Casey was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to all charges [59] On April 13, 2009, prosecutors announced that they planned to seek the death penalty in the case [60]\n\n\nTrial\nThe lead prosecutor in the case was Assistant State Attorney Linda Drane Burdick Assistant State Attorneys Frank George and Jeff Ashton completed the prosecution team [61] Lead counsel for the defense was Jose Baez, a Florida criminal defense attorney Attorneys J Cheney Mason, Dorothy Clay Sims and Ann Finnell served as co-counsel [62] During the trial, attorney Mark Lippman represented George and Cindy [63]\n\n\nAttorneys and jury\nThe lead

Baez, a Florida criminal defense attorney Attorneys J Cheney Mason, Dorothy Clay Sims and Ann Finnell served as co-counsel [62] During the trial, attorney Mark Lippman represented George and Cindy [63]\n\n\nOpening statements\nThe trial began on May 24, 2011, at the Orange County Courthouse, with Judge Belvin Perry presiding In the opening statements, lead prosecutor Burdick described the story of Caylee's disappearance day-by-day [67] Prosecutors stated that Casey used chloroform to incapacitate Caylee before suffocating her with duct tape, leaving the body in the trunk of her car before disposing of it [7]: 1588  The defense, led by Baez, said Anthony had likely accidentally drowned in the family's pool on June 16, 2008, and that George had, with Casey's knowledge, covered up the drowning in order to spare his daughter a potential child-neglect charge [67] The defense further said that Casey's seemingly unaffected behavior after Caylee's death was attributable to child abuse she had allegedly suffered [67] at the hands of her father and brother [7]: 1588  [67] Finally, the defense stated that the police investigation had been compromised by the media frenzy [68]\n\n\nEvidence\nIn the trial's second week, the prosecution called various members of Casey's family to the stand [7]: 1588–89  George was their first witness, and, in a response to their questioning, he denied having sexually abused his daughter [69] Both George and Casey's then-boyfriend testified they did not smell anything resembling human decomposition in Casey's car when she visited them while Caylee was missing, [70] but George said he did smell something similar to human decomposition when he went to pick up the car on July 15 [71] Cindy testified that her comment to 9-1-1 that Casey's car smelled \"like someone died\" was just a figure of speech, [72] further noting that she had made \"exaggerated\" claims on the phone in an effort to get the police to respond quickly [73]\n\n\nClosing arguments\nClosing arguments were heard July 3 and July 4 [91] Ashton, for the prosecution, reiterated the state's belief that Casey had killed Caylee to free herself of parental duties, saying, \"When you have a child, that child becomes your life This case is about the clash between that responsibility, and the expectations that go with it, and the life that Casey Anthony wanted to have.\" [92] He emphasized Casey's false claims (including her claims regarding Fernandez-Gonzalez), the smell in the car and the items found with Caylee's remains [9] Ashton called the defense's theory of an accidental drowning \"absurd\" because, he said, no one would make an accident look like a murder [93]\n\n\nVerdict and sentence\nThe jury began deliberations on July 4 [98] On July 5, prosecutors stated that, during deliberations, they were about to give the jury the corrected information with regard to Bradley's software discrepancy; however, the jury reached a verdict before they could do so One legal analyst stated that if the jury had found Casey guilty before receiving the exculpatory evidence, the prosecution's failure to fully disclose it could have been grounds for a mistrial [99]\n\n\nAppeal\nCasey appealed her convictions, arguing that the false statements she provided to officers constituted one offense [107] and that the statements were inadmissible because she had not been given a Miranda warning [18] The prosecution said that each statement constituted a separate offense and that Casey was not detained at the time she made any of the statements [18]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe case attracted significant media attention The trial was commonly compared to the O J Simpson murder case, both for its widespread press coverage and initial shock at the not-guilty verdict [21] [109] [110] The New York Post described the trial as going \"from being a newsworthy case to one of the biggest ratings draws in recent memory\", [111] and Time magazine dubbed it \"the social media trial of the century\" [21]\n\n\nReactions\nBaez reacted to the verdict by saying, \"While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case,\" though he noted that \"our system of justice has not dishonored  [Anthony's] memory by a false conviction.\" [120] State's Attorney Lawson Lamar said that the prosecution's case was \"very, very difficult to prove,\" adding, \"The delay in recovering little Caylee's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage.\" [120] Lamar said that the state had \"put in absolutely every piece of evidence that

family received death threats after the not-guilty verdict was rendered [137] In response to the verdict, a statement was released by Lippman on behalf of the Anthony family:\n\n\nPublic response\nWhen the not-guilty verdict was rendered, many in the crowd of 500 outside the courthouse reacted with anger, chanting their disapproval and waving protest signs [120] People took to Facebook and Twitter, as well as other social media outlets, to express their outrage Traffic to news sites surged from about two million page views a minute to 3.3 million, with most of the visits

general public's investment in the trial and outrage towards the verdict Safon argued the Anthonys having been a regular and \"unremarkable\" family with complex relationships made them intriguing to watch [111] In a special piece for CNN, psychologist Frank Farley described the circumstantial evidence as \"all over the map\" and that combined with \"the apparent lying, significant contradictions and flip-flops of testimony, and questionable or bizarre theories of human behavior, it is little wonder that this nation  [was] glued to the tube\" He said it was a trial that was both a psychologist's dream and nightmare, and believes that much of the public's fascination had to do with the uncertainty of a motive for the crime [146] UCLA forensic psychiatrist Dr Carole Lieberman, said, \"The main reason that people are reacting so strongly is that the media convicted Casey before the jury decided on the verdict The public has been whipped up into this frenzy wanting revenge for this poor little adorable child And because of the desire for revenge, they've been whipped up into a lynch mob.\" She added, \"Nobody likes a liar, and Anthony was a habitual liar And nobody liked the fact that she was partying after Caylee's death Casey obviously has a lot of psychological problems Whether she murdered her daughter or not is another thing.\" [110]\n\n\nLegal commentary\nJohn Cloud of Time magazine said the jury had \"made the right call\" because \"the state of Florida did not make a good case that Anthony murdered her daughter\": \"Because the prosecutors had so little physical evidence, they built their case on  [Casey's] (nearly imperceptible) moral character The prosecutors seemed to think that if jurors saw what a fantastic liar Anthony was, they would understand that she could also be a murderer.\" [147] A number of media commentators reasoned that the prosecution overcharged the case by tagging on the death penalty, concluding that people in good conscience could not sentence Casey to death based on the circumstantial evidence presented [148] [149]\n\n\nAftermath\nCasey left Florida for an undisclosed location not long after the verdict However, on August 12, she was ordered to return to serve a year's supervised probation for an unrelated check-fraud conviction [151] Casey returned on August 25 and served out her probation in an undisclosed location Due to numerous threats against her life, the Florida Department of Corrections did not enter her information into the state parolee database [152] In August 2011, George and Cindy issued a statement that Casey would not be living at their home when she returned to Florida to serve her probation [153] According to Huffington Post, she was reportedly working with her probation officer to take online college classes in an unspecified field, while protected by her security, at an undisclosed educational institution [154]\n\n\nCasey Anthony\nCasey left Florida for an

[154]\n\n\nCivil actions\nIn September 2008, Fernandez-Gonzalez sued Casey for defamation [159] In July 2011, Texas EquuSearch (TES), a non-profit group which assisted in the search for Caylee, sued Casey for fraud and unjust enrichment, estimating it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead [160] And, in January 2013, Kronk served Casey with a defamation lawsuit of his own In response to Kronk's claim, [161] on January 27, 2013, Casey filed for bankruptcy with the Middle District of Florida Bankruptcy Court Her estimated liabilities were between $500,000 and $1 million [162]\n\n\n\"Caylee's Law\"\nSince the end of the trial, various movements have arisen for the creation of a new law, called \"Caylee's Law\", that would impose stricter requirements on parents to notify law enforcement of the death or disappearance of a child [174] One such petition, circulated via Change.org, has gained nearly 1.3 million electronic signatures [175] In response to this and other petitions, lawmakers in four states—Florida, Oklahoma, New York and West Virginia—have begun drafting versions of Caylee's Law [when?] The law in Oklahoma would require a child's parent or guardian to notify police of a missing child within 24 hours, and would also stipulate a time frame for notification of the disappearance of a young child under the age of 12 [174] [176] The Florida law would make it a felony if a parent or legal guardian fails to report a missing child in timely manner if they could have known the child would be in danger [177] The call for mandatory reporting laws has been criticized as being \"reactive, overly indiscriminating and even counterproductive\" [178] One critic noted the law could lead to overcompliance and false reports by parents wary of becoming suspects, wasting police resources and leading to legitimate abductions going uninvestigated during the critical first few hours Additionally, innocent people could get snared in the law for searching for a child instead of immediately calling police [179]\n\n\nMemorials and tribute songs\nAnthony's grandparents held a memorial for their granddaughter, which Casey watched for the first time for a documentary released in 2022 [158] In the footage, George bemoaned that strangers would not get to \"smell  [Caylee's] hair, smell the sweet sweat when she came in from outside\", adding that \"a hug from a small child .. gives me energy like you couldn't imagine\" [158]\n\n\nLater information\nIn November 2012, Orlando station WKMG-TV reported that police never investigated Firefox browser evidence on Casey's computer the day of Caylee's death; they only looked at Internet Explorer evidence The browser history showed that someone at the Anthony household, using a password-protected account Casey used, used Firefox to do a Google search for \"foolproof suffocation\" at 2:51 p.m., and then clicked on an article criticizing pro-suicide websites promoting \"foolproof\" ways to die, including the idea of committing suicide by taking poison and putting a plastic bag over one's head The browser then recorded activity on MySpace, a site used by Casey but not George The station learned about this information from Baez, who mentioned it in his book on the case, speculating that George had contemplated suicide after Caylee's death He conceded to reporters that the records are open to interpretation; however, he speculated that the state may have chosen not to introduce the search at trial because, according to Baez, the computer records tend to refute the timeline stated by George, which was that Casey left at 12:50 p.m An analysis by John Goetz, a retired engineer and computer expert in Connecticut, revealed that Casey's password-protected computer account shows activity on the home computer at 1:39 p.m., with activity on her AIM account, as well as MySpace and Facebook [182]\n\n\nSee

Anthony was a highly publicized and sensationalized case in the United States. Caylee, the two-year-old daughter of Casey Anthony, went missing on June 16, 2008, and her remains were later found in a wooded area near her grandparents' home. The trial of Casey Anthony, which began on May 24, 2011, was one of the most closely watched and controversial trials in recent American history.\n\n**Disappearance**\n\nOn June 16, 2008, Casey Anthony departed from her parents' home in Orlando, Florida, where she and Caylee resided. Her father, George Anthony, later testified that he saw his granddaughter Caylee leaving with Casey. Casey told her mother, Cindy, that she was taking Caylee to her nanny, whom Casey identified as Zenaida \"Zanny\" Fernandez-Gonzalez, and the next day she further informed Cindy that the three were headed to Tampa on a work trip. However, when police investigated the apartment of Fernandez-Gonzalez, they found it had been abandoned for more than 140 days.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nCasey told investigators that she had left Caylee at the apartment of her nanny, Fernandez-Gonzalez, and that Fernandez-Gonzalez had kidnapped the toddler. However, when police investigated the apartment, they found it had been abandoned for more than 140 days. Casey also told police that she was working at Universal Studios, but when investigators took her to Universal Studios on July 16 and asked her to show them her office, Casey led detectives into the building before admitting that she no longer worked there. It turned out that she had not worked there since she had taken maternity leave almost three years earlier.\n\n**Criminal Action**\n\nFollowing her arrest at Universal Studios, Casey was charged with giving false statements to law enforcement, child neglect, and obstruction of a criminal investigation. The judge denied bail, saying that Casey had shown \"woeful disregard for the welfare of her child.\" A month later, Casey was released from the Orange County jail after her $500,000 bond was posted by Tony Padilla, the nephew of California bail bondsman Leonard Padilla.\n\n**Arrest**\n\nCasey's arrest was a significant development in the case, and it marked the beginning of her long and complex trial. The prosecution's case against Casey was built on the theory that she had murdered her daughter, Caylee, and then hid the body in a wooded area near her grandparents' home. The defense team, led by Jose Baez, argued that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's pool on June 16, 2008, and that George had, with Casey's knowledge, covered up the drowning in order to spare his daughter a potential child-neglect charge.\n\n**Indictment**\n\nOn October 14, 2008, Casey was indicted by a grand jury on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and four counts of providing false information to police. She was later arrested and ordered to be held without bond. A week later, the state dropped the child-neglect charges because \"the neglect charges were premised on the theory that the child was still alive.\"\n\n**Trial**\n\nThe trial of Casey Anthony began on May 24, 2011, at the Orange County Courthouse, with Judge Belvin Perry presiding. The prosecution team, led by Assistant State Attorney Linda Drane Burdick, presented a case against Casey that was built on the theory that she had murdered her daughter, Caylee, and then hidden the body in a wooded area near her grandparents' home. The defense team, led by Jose Baez, argued that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's pool on June 16, 2008, and that George had, with Casey's knowledge, covered up the drowning in order to

statements\nThe trial began on May 24, 2011, at the Orange County Courthouse, with Judge Belvin Perry presiding In the opening statements, lead prosecutor Burdick described the story of Caylee's disappearance day-by-day [67] Prosecutors stated that Casey used chloroform to incapacitate Caylee before suffocating her with duct tape, leaving the body in the trunk of her car before disposing of it [7]: 1588  The defense, led by Baez, said Anthony had likely accidentally drowned in the family's pool on June 16, 2008, and that George had, with Casey's knowledge, covered up the drowning in order to spare his daughter a potential child-neglect charge [67] The defense further said that Casey's seemingly unaffected behavior after Caylee's death was attributable to child abuse she had allegedly suffered [67] at the hands of her father and brother [7]: 1588  [67] Finally, the defense stated that the police investigation had been compromised by the media frenzy [68]\n\n\nEvidence\nIn the trial's second week, the prosecution called various members of Casey's family to the stand [7]: 1588–89  George was their first witness, and, in a response to their questioning, he denied having sexually abused his daughter [69] Both George and Casey's then-boyfriend testified they did not smell anything resembling human decomposition in Casey's car when she visited them while Caylee was missing, [70] but George said he did smell something similar to human decomposition when he went to pick up the car on July 15 [71] Cindy testified that her comment to 9-1-1 that Casey's car smelled \"like someone died\" was just a figure of speech, [72] further noting that she had made \"exaggerated\" claims on the phone in an effort to get the police to respond quickly [73]\n\n\nClosing arguments\nClosing arguments were heard July 3 and July 4 [91] Ashton, for the prosecution, reiterated the state's belief that Casey had killed Caylee to free herself of parental duties, saying, \"When you have a child, that child becomes your life This case is about the clash between that responsibility, and the expectations that go with it, and the life that Casey Anthony wanted to have.\" [92] He emphasized Casey's false claims (including her claims regarding Fernandez-Gonzalez), the smell in the car and the items found with Caylee's remains [9] Ashton called the defense's theory of an accidental drowning \"absurd\" because, he said, no one would make an accident look like a murder [93]\n\n\nVerdict and sentence\nThe jury began deliberations on July 4 [98] On July 5, prosecutors stated that, during deliberations, they were about to give the jury the corrected information with regard to Bradley's software discrepancy; however, the jury reached a verdict before they could do so One legal analyst stated that if the jury had found Casey guilty before receiving the exculpatory evidence, the prosecution's failure to fully disclose it could have been grounds for a mistrial [99]\n\n\nAppeal\nCasey appealed her convictions, arguing that the false statements she provided to officers constituted one offense [107] and that the statements were inadmissible because she had not been given a Miranda warning [18] The prosecution said that each statement constituted a separate offense and that Casey was not detained at the time she made any of the statements [18]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe case attracted significant media attention The trial was commonly compared to the O J Simpson murder case, both for its widespread press coverage and initial shock at the not-guilty verdict [21] [109] [110] The New York Post described the trial as going \"from being a newsworthy case to one of the biggest ratings draws in recent memory\", [111] and Time magazine dubbed it \"the social media trial of the century\" [21]\n\n\nReactions\nBaez reacted to the verdict by saying, \"While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case,\" though he noted that \"our system of justice has not dishonored  [Anthony's] memory by a false conviction.\" [120] State's Attorney Lawson Lamar said that the prosecution's case was \"very, very difficult to prove,\" adding, \"The delay in recovering little Caylee's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage.\" [120] Lamar said that the state had \"put in absolutely every piece of evidence that existed\" [120] On July 6, 2011, Ashton gave his first interview about the case on ABC's The View, stating, \"Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted But from the perspective of what we do, this was a fantastic case.\" He said the state was right to have charged first-degree murder, and explained, \"I think it all came down to the evidence I think ultimately it came down to the cause of death.\" Ashton stated that if the jury did not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with the duct tape, \"then so be it\" [121] [122] Ashton suggested that the state could pursue perjury charges against Cindy for her claims regarding the chloroform searches [123] The state attorney's office later said she would not be charged [124]\n\n\nDefense, prosecution, and jury\nBaez reacted to the

her probation officer to take online college classes in an unspecified field, while protected by her security, at an undisclosed educational institution [154]\n\n\nCivil actions\nIn September 2008, Fernandez-Gonzalez sued Casey for defamation [159] In July 2011, Texas EquuSearch (TES), a non-profit group which assisted in the search for Caylee, sued Casey for fraud and unjust enrichment, estimating it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead [160] And, in January 2013, Kronk served Casey with a defamation lawsuit of his own In response to Kronk's claim, [161] on January 27, 2013, Casey filed for bankruptcy with the Middle District of Florida Bankruptcy Court Her estimated liabilities were between $500,000 and $1 million [162]\n\n\n\"Caylee's Law\"\nSince the end of the trial, various movements have arisen for the creation of a new law, called \"Caylee's Law\", that would impose stricter requirements on parents to notify law enforcement of the death or disappearance of a child [174] One such petition, circulated via Change.org, has gained nearly 1.3 million electronic signatures [175] In response to this and other petitions, lawmakers in four states—Florida, Oklahoma, New York and West Virginia—have begun drafting versions of Caylee's Law [when?] The law in Oklahoma would require a child's parent or guardian to notify police of a missing child within 24 hours, and would also stipulate a time frame for notification of the disappearance of a young child under the age of 12 [174] [176] The Florida law would make it a felony if a parent or legal guardian fails to report a missing child in timely manner if they could have known the child would be in danger [177] The call for mandatory reporting laws has been criticized as being \"reactive, overly indiscriminating and even counterproductive\" [178] One critic noted the law could lead to overcompliance and false reports by parents wary of becoming suspects, wasting police resources and leading to legitimate abductions going uninvestigated during the critical first few hours Additionally, innocent people could get snared in the law for searching for a child instead of immediately calling police [179]\n\n\nMemorials and tribute songs\nAnthony's grandparents held a memorial for their granddaughter, which Casey watched for the first time for a documentary released in 2022 [158] In the footage, George bemoaned that strangers would not get to \"smell  [Caylee's] hair, smell the sweet sweat when she came in from outside\", adding that \"a hug from a small child .. gives me energy like you couldn't imagine\" [158]\n\n\nLater information\nIn November 2012, Orlando station WKMG-TV reported that police never investigated Firefox browser evidence on Casey's computer the day of Caylee's death; they only looked at Internet Explorer evidence The browser history showed that someone at the Anthony household, using a password-protected account Casey used, used Firefox to do a Google search for \"foolproof suffocation\" at 2:51 p.m., and then clicked on an article criticizing pro-suicide websites promoting \"foolproof\" ways to die, including the idea of committing suicide by taking poison and putting a plastic bag over one's head The browser then recorded activity on MySpace, a site used by Casey but not George The station learned about this information from Baez, who mentioned it in his book on the case, speculating that George had contemplated suicide after Caylee's death He conceded to reporters that the records are open to interpretation; however, he speculated that the state may have chosen not to introduce the search at trial because, according to Baez, the computer records tend to refute the timeline stated by George, which was that Casey left at 12:50 p.m An analysis by John Goetz, a retired engineer and computer expert in Connecticut, revealed that Casey's password-protected computer account shows activity on the home computer at 1:39 p.m., with activity on her AIM account, as well as MySpace and Facebook [182]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

15th round of the match by Ali, with few expecting him to last as long as he did Despite the match motivating Stallone to begin work on Rocky, [7] he has denied Wepner provided any inspiration for the

Winkler were enthusiastic about the script and the idea of Stallone playing the lead character, they were hesitant about having an unknown headline the film The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story, with Apollo Creed and Adrian cast unusually late by the production standards [citation needed] Real-life boxer Ken Norton was initially sought for the role of Apollo Creed, but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to Carl Weathers [21] Norton, upon whom Creed was loosely based, fought Muhammad Ali three times According to The Rocky Scrapbook, Carrie Snodgress was originally chosen to play Adrian, but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere Susan Sarandon and Cher auditioned for the role but Sarandon was deemed too pretty for the character and Cher too expensive After Talia Shire's ensuing audition, Chartoff and Winkler, and director John Avildsen, [4] insisted that she play the part [citation

in E Tusculum St 1818 in Philadelphia [26] Inventor Garrett Brown's new Steadicam was used to accomplish smooth photography while running alongside Rocky during the film's Philadelphia street training sequences and the run up the Art Museum's flight of stairs, now colloquially known as the Rocky Steps [27] It was also used for some shots in the fight scenes and can be seen at the ringside during some wide shots of the final fight Rocky is often erroneously cited as the first film to use the Steadicam, although it was actually the third, after Bound for Glory and Marathon Man [28]\n\n\nMusic\nBill Conti composed the musical score for Rocky He had composed a score for director John G Avildsen's W.W and the Dixie Dancekings (1975) that the studio ultimately rejected [34] David Shire (then-husband of Talia Shire) was the first to be offered the chance to compose the music for Rocky but had to turn it down because of prior commitments [35] Avildsen reached out to Conti without any studio help because of the film's relatively low budget Avildsen said, \"The budget for the music was 25 grand And that was for everything: The composer's fee, that was to pay the musicians, that was to rent the studio, that was to buy the tape that it was going to be recorded on.\" [36]\n\n\nSoundtrack\nBill Conti composed the musical score for Rocky He had composed a score

"**Rocky**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nRocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and written by Sylvester Stallone. The film follows the story of Rocky Balboa, a small-time boxer from Philadelphia who gets a chance to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world against the reigning champion, Apollo Creed. The film was a critical and commercial success, and it has since become a cultural phenomenon.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn 1975, heavyweight boxing world champion Apollo Creed plans to hold a title bout in Philadelphia during the upcoming United States Bicentennial. However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand, and that all other potential replacements are either booked up or unable to get into shape in time. Having already invested heavily into the fight, Creed decides to give a local contender a chance to challenge him.\n\nSylvester Stallone, an unknown actor at the time, wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner that took place at Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio, on March 24, 1975. Wepner was TKO'd in the 15th round of the match by Ali, with few expecting him to last as long as he did.\n\nDespite the match motivating Stallone to begin work on Rocky, he has denied Wepner provided any inspiration for the script. Other inspiration for the film may have included characteristics of real-life boxers Rocky Marciano and Joe Frazier, as well as Rocky Graziano's autobiography Somebody Up There Likes Me and the movie of the same name.\n\nWepner sued Stallone, and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe cast of Rocky includes Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, Talia Shire as Adrian Balboa, and Burgess Meredith as Mickey Goldmill. The film also features Burt Young as Paulie Pennino, a friend of Rocky's who runs a pet store.\n\nAlthough Chartoff and Irwin Winkler were enthusiastic about the script and the idea of Stallone playing the lead character, they were hesitant about having an unknown headline the film. The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story, with Apollo Creed and Adrian cast unusually late by the production standards.\n\nReal-life boxer Ken Norton was initially sought for the role of Apollo Creed, but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to Carl Weathers. Norton, upon whom Creed was loosely based, fought Muhammad Ali three times.\n\n**Production**\n\nPrincipal photography for Rocky began on January 9, 1976. Filming took place primarily throughout Philadelphia, with a few scenes being shot in Los Angeles. Rocky's house was in E Tusculum St 1818 in Philadelphia.\n\nInventor Garrett Brown's new Steadicam was used to accomplish smooth photography while running alongside Rocky during the film's Philadelphia street training sequences and the run up the Art Museum's flight of stairs, now colloquially known as the Rocky Steps. It was also used for some shots in the fight scenes and can be seen at the ringside during some wide shots of the final fight.\n\nRocky is often erroneously cited as the first film to use the Steadicam, although it was actually the third, after Bound for Glory and Marathon Man.\n\n**Music**\n\nBill Conti composed the musical score for Rocky. He had composed a score for director John G Avildsen's W.W and the Dixie Dancekings (1975) that the studio ultimately rejected. David Shire (then-husband of Talia Shire) was the first to be offered the chance to compose the music for Rocky but had to turn it down because of prior commitments.\n\nAvildsen reached out to Conti without any studio help because of the film's relatively low budget. Avildsen said, \"The budget for the music was 25 grand And that was for everything: The composer's fee, that was to pay the musicians, that was to rent the studio, that was to buy the tape that it was going to be recorded on.\"\n\n**Soundtrack**\n\nThe soundtrack for Rocky was released in 1976 and features the iconic theme song \"Gonna Fly Now\" by Bill Conti. The soundtrack was a commercial success and won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe movie began with two premieres in New York, starting with the world premiere for Rocky, which would take place at Paramount Theatre in New York City on Saturday, November 20, 1976, by United Artists and the other on the day after Sunday, November 21, 1976, by United Artists at Cinema II in New York City.\n\nThe Los Angeles premiere took place at the Plaza in Westwood Village on December 1, 1976. This was then followed by a full official release on December 3, 1976, all throughout North America in the United States and Canada.\n\n**Box Office**\n\nRocky grossed $5,488 on its opening day at Cinema II, a house record. When it was released nationally, it grossed $5 million during its first wide weekend and consistently performed well for eight months and eventually reached $117 million at the North American box office.\n\nAdjusted for inflation in 2018, the film earned over $500 million in North America alone. Overseas, Rocky grossed $107 million, for a worldwide box office total of $225 million.\n\nWith its production budget of just under $1 million, Rocky is notable for its worldwide percentage return of over 11,000 percent. It was the highest-grossing film released in 1976 in the United States and Canada and the second highest-grossing film of 1977, behind Star Wars.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nRocky received positive reviews at the time of its release. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said that Stallone reminded him of \"the young Marlon Brando.\"\n\nBox Office Magazine claimed audiences would be \"touting Sylvester 'Sly' Stallone as a new star.\" Frank Rich liked the film, calling it \"almost 100 per cent schmaltz,\" but favoring it over the cynicism that was prevalent in movies at that time, although he referred to the plot as \"gimmicky\" and the script \"heavy-handed.\"\n\nSeveral reviews, including Richard Eder's (as well as Canby's negative review), compared the work to that of Frank Capra.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe Directors Guild of America awarded Rocky its annual award for best film of the year in 1976. Additionally, the Directors Guild voted Rocky as the 65th best-directed film of all time, and in 2006, Sylvester Stallone's original screenplay for the film was selected by the Writers Guild of America as the 78th best screenplay of all time.\n\nIn a 2012 survey of members of the Motion Picture Editors Guild, Rocky was voted as one of the 75 best-edited films in all of cinema.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nRocky has become a cultural phenomenon and has inspired numerous sequels, remakes, and spin-offs. The film's success led to eight sequels, beginning with Rocky II in 1979, followed by Rocky III in 1982, Rocky IV in 1985, Rocky V in 1990, Rocky Balboa in 2006, Creed in 2015, and Creed II in 2018.\n\nAnother sequel, titled Creed III, was released in 2023; however, Stallone did not appear in the film.\n\n**Possible Prequel**\n\nIn July 2019, Stallone said in an interview that there have been ongoing discussions about a prequel to the original film based on the life of a young Rocky Balboa.\n\n**Rocky Steps**\n\nThe famous scene of Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art has become a cultural icon, with the steps acquiring the vernacular title of \"Rocky Steps.\" In 1982, a statue of Rocky, commissioned by Stallone for Rocky III, was placed at the top of the Rocky Steps.\n\nCity Commerce Director Dick Doran claimed that Stallone and Rocky had done more for the city's image than \"anyone since Ben Franklin.\"\n\n**Novelization**\n\nUpon the film's release, a paperback novelization of the screenplay written by Rosalyn Drexler under the pseudonym Julia Sorel and published by Ballantine Books was released.\n\n**Video Games**\n\nSeveral video games have been produced based on the film.

He was born on 20 May 1964 in London, England, and has held the title of Earl Spencer since 1992. As the youngest of five children of John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer, and Frances Roche, Charles Spencer has grown up with a deep connection to the British royal family.

Due to his maternal family's close personal connection to the royal family, he was baptized in Westminster Abbey, with Queen Elizabeth II acting as one of his godmothers. He grew up with his three elder sisters, Sarah, Jane, and Diana, the last-named of whom he was very close with. His infant brother, John, was born four years before him, but died ten hours after his birth, thus leaving Charles as the eventual heir to the earldom.\n\nSpencer was three years old when his parents' troubled marriage ended in divorce due to his mother's affair with Peter Shand Kydd. In 1975, Spencer became styled as Viscount Althorp when his father became Earl Spencer following the death of his paternal grandfather. He began his formal education at Silfield Private School in King's Lynn, Norfolk. From the age of eight, he was sent to the elite boy's private boarding school Maidwell Hall in Northamptonshire.

first Italian Football Championship match on 11 March 1900 in a 1–0 defeat against Torinese [31]\n\n\nLeague dominance (1923–1980)\nIn 1922, a new stadium was inaugurated and, a year later, FIAT vice president Edoardo Agnelli was elected club's president [30] These two events helped the club to its second league championship in the 1925–26 Prima Divisione, after beating Alba Roma in a two-legged final with an aggregate score of 12–1 [32] The club established itself as a major force in Italian football in the 1930s, becoming the country's first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base [36] This led Juventus to win a record of five consecutive Italian football championships and form the core of the Italy national football team during the Vittorio Pozzo era, including the 1934 FIFA World Cup winning squad, with star players like Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari, and Luis Monti, among others [37] [38]\n\n\nEuropean stage (1980–1993)\n\n\n\nRenewed international success (1994–2004)\n\n\n\nCalciopoli scandal (2004–2007)\nFabio Capello was appointed as Juventus's coach in 2004 and led the club to two more consecutive Serie A first places In May 2006, Juventus emerged as one of the five clubs linked to the Calciopoli scandal In July, Juventus was placed at the bottom of the league table and relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history The club was also stripped of the 2004–05 Serie A title, while the 2005–06 Serie A winner, after a period sub judice, was declared to be third-placed Inter Milan [60] This remains a much debated and controversial issue, [61] [62] [63] particularly due to Inter Milan's later revealed involvement, the 2004 championship (the sole being investigated) deemed regular and not fixed, [64] [65] [66] Juventus being absolved as club in the ordinary justice proceedings, [67] [68] their renounce to the Italian civil courts appeal, which could have cleared the club's name and avoid relegation, after FIFA threatened to suspend the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and barring all Italian clubs from international play, [69] [70] [71] and the motivations, [72] such as sentimento popolare (people's feelings), [73] and the newly created ad-hoc rule used to relegate the club [74] [75] [76]\n\n\nReturn to Serie A (2007–2011)\nAfter making their comeback for the 2007–08 Serie A, Juventus appointed Claudio Ranieri as manager [95] They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight and qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League's third qualifying round in the preliminary stages Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the last two games of the 2008–09 Serie A, [96] before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 2009–10 Serie A [97]\n\n\nNine consecutive scudetti (2011–2020)\nWith Conte as manager, Juventus were unbeaten for the entire 2011–12 Serie A season Towards the second half of the season, the team was mostly competing with northern rivals Milan for first place in a tight contest Juventus won the title on the 37th matchday after beating Cagliari 2–0 and Milan losing to Inter 4–2 After a 3–1 win in the final matchday against Atalanta, Juventus became the first team to go the season unbeaten in the current 38-game format [101] In 2013–14 Serie A, Juventus won a third consecutive scudetto with a record 102 points and 33 wins [102] [103] The title was the 30th official league championship in the club's history [104] They also achieved the semi-finals of 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated at home against ten-man Benfica's catenaccio, missing the 2014 UEFA Europa League final at the Juventus Stadium [105] [106]\n\n\nRecent history (2020–present)\nOn 8 August 2020, Sarri was sacked from his managerial position, one day after Juventus were eliminated from the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League by Lyon [126] On the same day, former player Andrea Pirlo was announced as the new coach, signing a two-year contract [127] In the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana, which was held in January 2021, Juventus won their ninth title after a 2–0 victory against Napoli [128] With Inter Milan's win of the 2020–21 Serie A, Juventus's run of nine consecutive titles came to an end; [129] the club managed to secure a fourth-place finish on the final day of the league, granting Juventus qualification to the following season's Champions League [130] In the 2021 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 14th title [131] On 28 May, Juventus sacked Pirlo from his managerial position, [132] [133] and announced Allegri's return to the club as manager after two years away from management on a four-year contract [134] During the three seasons that

and colours\nJuventus have played in black and white striped shirts, with white shorts, sometimes black shorts since 1903 Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them [162] Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin [162] Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful [162]\n\n\nStadiums\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the scudetto) and in 1906, years in which they played at the Corso Re Umberto.\n\n\nSupporters\nJuventus is the most-supported football club in Italy, with over 12 million fans or tifosi, which

football clubs in the world, with over 300 million supporters (41 million in Europe alone), [23] particularly in the Mediterranean countries to which a large number of Italian diaspora have emigrated [184] The Torinese side has fan clubs branches across the globe [185]\n\n\nClub rivalries\nJuventus have significant rivalries with two main clubs.\n\n\nYouth programme\nThe Juventus youth set-up has been recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents [194] While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful careers in the Italian top flight Under long-time coach Vincenzo Chiarenza, the Primavera (under-19) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006 Like Dutch club Ajax and many Premier League clubs, Juventus operates several satellite clubs and football schools outside of the country (i.e United States, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Switzerland) and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent scouting [195] On 3 August 2018, Juventus founded their professional reserve team, called Juventus U23 (renamed to Juventus Next Gen in August 2022), [196] playing in Serie C, [197] who won the Coppa Italia Serie C in 2020 [198] In the 2021–22 UEFA Youth League, the U19 squad reached the semi-finals, equalling the best-ever placing in the competition for a Serie A team [199]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nFirst-team squad\nNote: Flags indicate

replace them [162] Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin [162] Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful [162]\n\n\nStadiums\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were

Throughout his career, Manning won numerous accolades, including five NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, seven first-team All-Pro selections, and two Super Bowl championships.\n\nEarly Life\nManning was born on March 24, 1976, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is the second son of Olivia (née Williams) and former NFL quarterback Archie Manning. His younger brother is two-time Super Bowl Champion Eli Manning. Some have described the Mannings as football's \"royal family.\"\n\nManning's early life was marked by a strong interest in football. He was a standout player at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, where he led the Greenies football team to a 34–5 record during his three seasons as the starter. He was named Gatorade Circle of Champions National Player-of-the-Year and Columbus (Ohio) Touchdown Club National Offensive Player-of-the-Year in 1993.\n\nCollege Career\nManning chose to play college football for the University of Tennessee Volunteers under head coach Phillip Fulmer.

He became Tennessee's all-time leading passer with 11,201 yards and 89 touchdowns and won 39 of 45 games as a starter, breaking the Southeastern Conference (SEC) record for career wins.\n\n## 1994 season\nAs a freshman, Manning began the season as the third-string quarterback.

Football Consultant [76] Arians was succeeded by Buccaneers defensive coordinator Todd Bowles [77]\n\n\nCoaching philosophy\nArians' coaching philosophy can be summed up with one phrase: \"No risk it, no biscuit You can't live scared.\" His former quarterback in Arizona, Carson Palmer, says, \"You play for him, you see he just has guts He will let it rip, let it fly no matter what.\" [28] \nArians first developed this philosophy when the old-timers at the bar he worked at in college told him, \"In life you must take risks.\" During games, Arians always gave the quarterback at least two options based on how the defense lines up Arians stated: \"One option will give us a chance to make a first down and the other option will give us a chance to score a touchdown.\" All his quarterbacks must believe, \"If I have the right match up and the opportunity is there to take a shot at the deep ball, take it I don't care if it's a third-and-three; if our best receiver is in single coverage and he's running a deep post route, throw him the goddamn ball.\" [78]\n\n\nBroadcasting career\nOn May 3, 2018, Arians joined CBS Sports as a game analyst for the NFL on CBS, working with Greg Gumbel and

1, 2012, Arians was named the interim head coach of the Colts following coach Chuck Pagano's leukemia diagnosis [31]  Arians led the Colts to a 9–3 record, part of one of the biggest one-season

as head coach on December 24, 2012, with Arians returning to his role as offensive coordinator [33] Arians missed the Colts' Wild Card Round loss against the Baltimore Ravens due to being hospitalized

him the first interim head coach to win the award [35]\n\n\nArizona Cardinals\nOn January 17, 2013, the Arizona Cardinals and Arians agreed on a 4-year deal that would make Arians their 40th head

possession prior to the draft [37] Arians was the first Cardinals head coach since Norm Barry in 1925 to record at least nine wins in his first season, with a record of 10–6 in 2013 [38] Despite the improvement, the Cardinals failed to reach the postseason, finishing third in the NFC West [39] [40]\n\n\n2014 season\nThe Cardinals finished the 2014 season with an 11–5 record and were the #5 seed in the NFC [41] [42] The 11 wins tied a Cardinals franchise record for most wins in a season [43] Arians led the Cardinals to a 9–1 start, best in the NFL, but injuries to starting quarterback Carson Palmer (who was 6–0 as the starter) and backup Drew Stanton, (who was 5–3 as starter) led to the eventual NFC champion Seattle Seahawks claiming the divisional title with a 12–4 record [42] Roughly half the team was put on injured reserve between Week 8 and Week 17 [44] The injury plagued Cardinals were eliminated by the Carolina Panthers in the Wild Card Round, 27–16 [45] Following the season,

Cardinals and surpassed Ken Whisenhunt as the franchise's winningest head coach [55] Arians finished his tenure in Arizona with a 50–32–1 record [56] [57]\n\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nOn January 8, 2019, Arians agreed to terms on a four-year contract to come out of retirement and became the 12th head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers [58]\n\n\n2019 season\nArians stated in the offseason for the Buccaneers that he could win with the team he had Arians also put his faith in Jameis Winston, saying: \"I think with (quarterbacks coach) Clyde Christensen and (offensive coordinator) Byron Leftwich, he's in great hands.\" [59]\n\n\n2020 season\nIn Arians' second season with the team, the Buccaneers signed longtime New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to a two-year contract on March 20, 2020 They traded for Brady's former teammate and former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski on April 21, 2020, and he came out of retirement to play for the Buccaneers with Brady [64] [65] [66] In 2020, Arians led the Buccaneers to a 11–5 record, earning a Wild Card spot - their first playoff berth since 2007 [67] After winning three straight road games against the Washington Football Team, New Orleans Saints, and Green Bay Packers, the Buccaneers reached their second Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl LV [68] The playoff victories were the Buccaneers' first since the 2002 season when they won Super Bowl XXXVII, and Arians was the first head coach to lead an NFL team to play and win a Super Bowl in their home stadium when they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31–9 in the Super Bowl [69] [70] [71]\n\n\n2021 season\nIn Arians' third season with the team, the Buccaneers finished atop the NFC South with a 13–4 record [72] They defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card Round, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl LVI champion Los Angeles Rams during the Divisional Round in what would be Arians' final game as an NFL head coach [73] [74] Arians finished his tenure in Tampa Bay with a 31–18 record and a 5–1 record in the postseason [75]\n\n\n2022 season\nOn March 30, 2022, Arians informed his staff that he would be stepping down from the head coach position and would take on a new role for the team as a Senior Football Consultant [76] Arians was succeeded by Buccaneers defensive coordinator Todd Bowles [77]\n\n\nCoaching philosophy\nArians' coaching philosophy can be summed up with one phrase: \"No risk it, no biscuit You can't live scared.\" His former quarterback in Arizona, Carson Palmer, says, \"You play for him, you see he just has guts He will let it rip, let it fly no matter what.\" [28] \nArians first developed this philosophy when the old-timers at the bar he worked at in college told him, \"In life you must take risks.\" During games, Arians always gave the quarterback at least two options based on how the defense lines up Arians stated: \"One option will give us a chance to make a first down and the other option will give us a chance to score a touchdown.\" All his quarterbacks must believe, \"If I have the right match up and the opportunity is there to take a shot at the deep ball, take it I don't care if it's a third-and-three; if our best receiver is in single coverage and he's running a deep post route, throw him the goddamn ball.\" [78]\n\n\nBroadcasting career\nOn May 3, 2018, Arians joined CBS Sports as a game analyst for the NFL on CBS, working with Greg Gumbel and Trent Green [80]\n\n\nPersonal life\nArians and his wife, Christine, run a charity called The Arians Family Foundation, which supports and develops programs to prevent and remedy the abuse and neglect of children [81] The Arians Family Foundation supports the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program [82]\n\n\nHead coaching record\n* 1986 team was 6–5

heralded a new kind of acting: for the first time, she was willing to alienate viewers, rather than try to win them over Fonda's ability to continue to develop her talent is what sets her apart from many other performers of her generation [31]\n\n\n1980–1991: Established star and hiatus\nIn 1980, Fonda starred in 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton The film was a huge critical and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year [51] Fonda had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship [43] She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her [52] The father-daughter rift depicted on screen closely paralleled the real-life relationship between the two Fondas; they eventually became the first father-daughter duo to earn Oscar nominations (Jane earned her first Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination) for their roles in the same film On Golden Pond, which also starred four-time Oscar winner Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home He died five months later [43] Both films grossed over $100 million domestically [53] [54]\n\n\n2005–2014: Return to acting and Broadway\nIn 2005, she returned to the screen with the box office success Monster-in-Law, starring opposite Jennifer Lopez [43] Two years later, Fonda starred in the Garry Marshall-directed drama Georgia Rule alongside Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan Georgia Rule was panned by critics, but A O Scott of The New York Times felt the film belonged to Fonda and co-star Lohan, before writing, \"Ms Fonda's straight back and piercing eyes, the righteous jaw line she inherited from her father and a reputation for humorlessness all serve her well here, but it is her warmth and comic timing that make Georgia more than a provincial scold.\" [61] In 2009, Fonda returned to Broadway for the first time since 1963, playing Katherine Brandt in Moisés Kaufman's 33 Variations [62] [63] In a mixed review, Ben Brantley of The New York Times praised Fonda's \"layered crispness\" and her \"aura of beleaguered briskness that flirts poignantly with the ghost of her spiky, confrontational screen presence as a young woman For those who grew up enthralled with Ms Fonda's screen image, it's hard not to respond to her performance here, on some level, as a personal memento mori.\" [64] The role earned her a Tony nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play [65]\n\n\n2015–present: Grace and Frankie and other roles\nFonda appeared as the co-lead in the Netflix series Grace and Frankie She and Lily Tomlin played aging women whose husbands reveal they are in love with one another Filming on the first season was completed in November 2014, [75] and the show premiered online on May 8, 2015 The series concluded in 2022 after running for 7 seasons [76]\n\n\nPolitical activism\nDuring the 1960s, Fonda engaged in political activism in support of the Civil Rights Movement, and in opposition to the Vietnam War [43] Fonda's visits to France brought her into contact with leftist French intellectuals who were opposed to war, an experience that she later characterized as \"small-c communism\" [83] Along with other celebrities, she supported the Alcatraz Island occupation by Indigenous Americans in 1969, which was intended to call attention to the failures of the government with regard to treaty rights and the movement for greater Indigenous sovereignty [84]\n\n\nOpposition to the Vietnam War\nOn May 4, 1970, Fonda appeared before an assembly at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, to speak on G.I rights and issues The end of her presentation was met with a discomfiting silence until Beat poet Gregory Corso staggered onto the stage, drunk He challenged Fonda, using a four-letter expletive: why hadn't she addressed the shooting of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard, which had just taken place? In her autobiography, Fonda revisited the incident: \"I was shocked by the news and felt like a fool.\" On the same day, she joined a protest march on the home of university president Ferrel Heady The protesters called themselves \"They Shoot Students, Don't They?\" – a reference to Fonda's recently released film, They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, which had just been screened in Albuquerque [20]\n\n\nVisit to Hanoi\nBetween 1965 and 1972, almost 300 Americans – mostly civil rights activists, teachers, and pastors – traveled to North Vietnam to see firsthand the war situation with the Vietnamese, believing that the news media in the United States predominantly provided a U.S viewpoint American travelers to North Vietnam were routinely harassed upon their return home [93] Fonda also visited Vietnam, traveling to Hanoi in July 1972 to witness firsthand the bombing damage to the dikes After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam, she said the United States had been intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River Sweden's ambassador to Vietnam, however, observed the bomb damage to the dikes and described it as \"methodic\" Other journalists reported that the attacks were \"aimed at the whole system of dikes\" [93] Columnist Joseph Kraft, who was also touring North Vietnam, said he believed the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that, if the U.S Air Force were \"truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way\" [94] Due to the publicity surrounding Fondas visit, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assessed arial photography of the North Vietnamese dyke system leading to two conclusions: First that the North Vietnamese dyke system was incredibly robust, meaning it would be costly to attack and easy to repair They note that \"A crew of less than 50 men with wheelbarrows and hand tools probably could repair in one day the largest crater observed.\" [95] Second that \"all the damaged sections of dikes are close to valid military-related targets\", [95] and not in areas that would cause the most damage to the dyke system Thus the CIA argue that \"A study of available photography shows conclusively that there has been no concerted and intentional bombing of North Vietnam's vital duke system.\"\n\n\nRegrets\nIn a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions, stating:\n\n\nSubject of government surveillance\nIn 2013, it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1,600 Americans whose communications between 1967 and 1973 were monitored by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as part of Project MINARET, a program that some NSA officials have described as \"disreputable if not downright illegal\" [113] [114] Fonda's communications, as well as those of her husband, Tom Hayden, were intercepted by Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) Under the UKUSA Agreement, intercepted data on Americans were sent to the U.S government [115] [116]\n\n\n1970 arrest\nOn November 2, 1970, Fonda was arrested by authorities at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on suspicion of drug trafficking [117] Her luggage was searched when she re-entered the United States after participating in an anti-war college speaking tour in Canada, and several small baggies containing pills were seized [118] Although Fonda protested that the pills were harmless vitamins, she was booked by police and then released on bond Fonda alleged that the arresting officer told her he was acting on direct orders from the Nixon White House [119] As she wrote in 2009, \"I told them what  [the vitamins] were but they said they were getting orders from the White House I think they hoped this 'scandal' would cause the college speeches to be canceled and ruin my respectability.\" [117] After lab tests confirmed the pills were vitamins, the charges were dropped with little media attention.\n\n\nFeminist causes\nIn a 2017 interview with Brie Larson, published by People magazine, Fonda stated, \"One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault We were violated and it's not right.\" She said, \"I've been raped, I've been sexually abused as a child and I've been fired because I wouldn't sleep with my boss.\" She said, \"I always thought it was my fault; that I didn't do or say the right thing I know young girls who've been raped and didn't even know it was rape They think, 'It must have been because I said 'no' the wrong way.'\"\n\n\nWomen's Media Center\nIn 2005, along with Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem, she cofounded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content [131] Fonda serves on the board of the organization [132] [133] Based in Los Angeles, she has lived all over the world, including six years in France and 20 in Atlanta.\n\n\nLGBTQ+ support\nFonda has publicly shown her support of the LGBTQ+ community many times throughout her career In August 2021, Fonda, the cast of Grace and Frankie, and other advocates joined to support a fundraiser hosted by the Los Angeles LGBT Center to help members of the LGBTQ+ community during the COVID-19 pandemic [134]\n\n\nNative Americans\nFonda went to Seattle in 1970 to support a group of Native Americans who were led by Bernie Whitebear The group had occupied part of the grounds of Fort Lawton, which was in the process of being surplussed by the United States Army and turned into a park The group was attempting to secure a land base where they could establish services for the sizable local urban Indian population, protesting that \"Indians had a right to part of the land that was originally all theirs.\" [137] The endeavor succeeded and the Daybreak Star Cultural Center was constructed in the city's Discovery Park [138]\n\n\nIsraeli–Palestinian conflict\nIn December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp [140]\n\n\nOpposition to the Iraq War\nFonda argued that the Iraq War would turn people all over the world against America, and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War [149] She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism [150]\n\n\nFonda and Kerry\nIn the 2004 presidential election, her name was used as a disparaging epithet against John Kerry, a former VVAW leader, who was then the Democratic Party presidential candidate Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie called Kerry a \"Jane Fonda Democrat\" Kerry's opponents also circulated a photograph showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti-war rally, though they sat several rows apart A faked composite photograph, which gave a false impression that the two had shared a speaker's platform, was also circulated [154]\n\n\nEnvironmentalism\nIn 2015, Fonda expressed disapproval of President Barack Obama's permitting of Arctic drilling (Petroleum exploration in the Arctic) at the Sundance Film Festival In July, she marched in a Toronto protest called the \"March for Jobs, Justice, and Climate\", which was organized by dozens of nonprofits, labor unions, and environmental activists, including Canadian author Naomi Klein The march aimed to show businesses and politicians alike that climate change is inherently linked to issues that may seem unrelated [155]\n\n\nArtificial intelligence\nIn September 2024, Fonda joined over 125 actors, directors, and musicians in signing an open letter urging Governor Gavin Newsom to sign SB 1047, a Californian AI safety bill that would, amongst other things, hold companies training the largest AI models liable if their models cause mass casualties or over $500 million in damages The letter, also signed by figures such as Alec Baldwin, Pedro Pascal and Kelly Rowland, said that the \"Grave threats from AI used to be the stuff of science fiction, but not anymore,\" and that AI companies should implement \"reasonable safeguards\" against those risks [168] [169] [170]\n\n\nOther activities\nOn April 5, 2005, Random House published Fonda's autobiography My Life So Far The book describes her life as a series of three acts, each thirty years long, and declares that her third \"act\" will be her most significant, partly because of her commitment to Christianity, and that it will determine the things for which she will be remembered [128]\n\n\nWriting\nOn April 5, 2005, Random House published Fonda's autobiography My Life So Far The book describes her life as a series of three acts, each thirty years long, and declares that her third \"act\" will be her most significant, partly because of her commitment to Christianity, and that it will determine the things for which she will be remembered [128]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nFonda's charitable works have focused on youth and education, adolescent reproductive health, environment, human services, and the arts Fonda marketed her highly successful line of exercise videos and books in order to fund the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a California lobbying organization she founded with her second husband Tom Hayden in 1978 [119] Fonda has established the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential (GCAPP) in the mid-1990s and the Fonda

chair, director, and secretary; Fonda contributes 10 hours each week on its behalf [175] [176] [177] [178] In 2017, she began selling merchandise featuring her 1970 arrest mugshot on her website, the

a more feminist slant and views God as something that \"lives within each of us as Spirit (or soul)\" [222] Fonda once refused to say \"Jesus Christ\" in Grace and Frankie and the script was changed

activist, and fitness instructor. She was born on December 21, 1937, in New York City, to Canadian-born socialite Frances Ford Seymour and American actor Henry Fonda. Fonda's family has a rich history, with her surname originating from an Italian ancestor who immigrated to the Netherlands in the 1500s.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nFonda was named after the third wife of Henry VIII, Jane Seymour, to whom she is distantly related on her mother's side. Her brother, Peter Fonda, was also an actor, and her maternal half-sister is Frances de Villers Brokaw (also known as \"Pan\"), whose daughter is Pilar Corrias, the owner of the Pilar Corrias Gallery in London.

Her performances, starting with They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, heralded a new kind of acting, in which she was willing to alienate viewers rather than try to win them over.

However, she has continued to be an outspoken advocate for social justice and human rights.\n\n**Regrets**\n\nIn a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions. She acknowledged that she had made mistakes and had grown and learned from her experiences.\n\n**Subject of Government Surveillance**\n\nIn 2013, it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1,600 Americans whose communications were monitored by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as part of Project MINARET. Fonda's communications, as well as those of her husband, were intercepted by Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).\n\n**1970 Arrest**\n\nIn 1970, Fonda was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Although she was released on bond, the incident was widely publicized and led to further controversy.\n\n**Feminist Causes**\n\nFonda has been an advocate for feminist causes throughout her career. In a 2017 interview with Brie Larson, she stated, \"One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realize that (rape and abuse is) not our fault. We were violated, and it's not right.\"\n\n**Women's Media Center**\n\nIn 2005, Fonda co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content.\n\n**LGBTQ+ Support**\n\nFonda has publicly shown her support of the LGBTQ+ community many times throughout her career. In August 2021, she joined the cast of Grace and Frankie and other advocates to support a fundraiser hosted by the Los Angeles LGBT Center.\n\n**Native Americans**\n\nIn 1970, Fonda went to Seattle to support a group of Native Americans who were led by Bernie Whitebear. The group had occupied part of the grounds of Fort Lawton, which was in the process of being surplussed by the United States Army and turned into a park.\n\n**Israeli-Palestinian Conflict**\n\nIn December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\n**Opposition to the Iraq War**\n\nFonda argued that the Iraq War would turn people all over the world against America and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nFonda's charitable works have focused on youth and education, adolescent reproductive health, environment, human services, and the arts. She has established the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential (GCAPP) and the Fonda Family Foundation.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nFonda has been married three times: to Roger Vadim, Tom Hayden, and Ted Turner.

heralded a new kind of acting: for the first time, she was willing to alienate viewers, rather than try to win them over Fonda's ability to continue to develop her talent is what sets her apart from many other performers of her generation [31]\n\n\n1980–1991: Established star and hiatus\nIn 1980, Fonda starred in 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton The film was a huge critical and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year [51] Fonda had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship [43] She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her [52] The father-daughter rift depicted on screen closely paralleled the real-life relationship between the two Fondas; they eventually became the first father-daughter duo to earn Oscar nominations (Jane earned her first Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination) for their roles in the same film On Golden Pond, which also starred four-time Oscar winner Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home He died five months later [43] Both films grossed over $100 million domestically [53] [54]\n\n\n2005–2014: Return to acting and Broadway\nIn 2005, she returned to the screen with the box office success Monster-in-Law, starring opposite Jennifer Lopez [43] Two years later, Fonda starred in the Garry Marshall-directed drama Georgia Rule alongside Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan Georgia Rule was panned by critics, but A O Scott of The New York Times felt the film belonged to Fonda and co-star Lohan, before writing, \"Ms Fonda's straight back and piercing eyes, the righteous jaw line she inherited from her father and a reputation for humorlessness all serve her well here, but it is her warmth and comic timing that make Georgia more than a provincial scold.\" [61] In 2009, Fonda returned to Broadway for the first time since 1963, playing Katherine Brandt in Moisés Kaufman's 33 Variations [62] [63] In a mixed review, Ben Brantley of The New York Times praised Fonda's \"layered crispness\" and her \"aura of beleaguered briskness that flirts poignantly with the ghost of her spiky, confrontational screen presence as a young woman For those who grew up enthralled with Ms Fonda's screen image, it's hard not to respond to her performance here, on some level, as a personal memento mori.\" [64] The role earned her a Tony nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play [65]\n\n\n2015–present: Grace and Frankie and other roles\nFonda appeared as the co-lead in the Netflix series Grace and Frankie She and Lily Tomlin played aging women whose husbands reveal they are in love with one another Filming on the first season was completed in November 2014, [75] and the show premiered online on May 8, 2015 The series concluded in 2022 after running for 7 seasons [76]\n\n\nPolitical activism\nDuring the 1960s, Fonda engaged in political activism in support of the Civil Rights Movement, and in opposition to the Vietnam War [43] Fonda's visits to France brought her into contact with leftist French intellectuals who were opposed to war, an experience that she later characterized as \"small-c communism\" [83] Along with other celebrities, she supported the Alcatraz Island occupation by Indigenous Americans in 1969, which was intended to call attention to the failures of the government with regard to treaty rights and the movement for greater Indigenous sovereignty [84]\n\n\nOpposition to the Vietnam War\nOn May 4, 1970, Fonda appeared before an assembly at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, to speak on G.I rights and issues The end of her presentation was met with a discomfiting silence until Beat poet Gregory Corso staggered onto the stage, drunk He challenged Fonda, using a four-letter expletive: why hadn't she addressed the shooting of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard, which had just taken place? In her autobiography, Fonda revisited the incident: \"I was shocked by the news and felt like a fool.\" On the same day, she joined a protest march on the home of university president Ferrel Heady The protesters called themselves \"They Shoot Students, Don't They?\" – a reference to Fonda's recently released film, They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, which had just been screened in Albuquerque [20]\n\n\nVisit to Hanoi\nBetween 1965 and 1972, almost 300 Americans – mostly civil rights activists, teachers, and pastors – traveled to North Vietnam to see firsthand the war situation with the Vietnamese, believing that the news media in the United States predominantly provided a U.S viewpoint American travelers to North Vietnam were routinely harassed upon their return home [93] Fonda also visited Vietnam, traveling to Hanoi in July 1972 to witness firsthand the bombing damage to the dikes After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam, she said the United States had been intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River Sweden's ambassador to Vietnam, however, observed the bomb damage to the dikes and described it as \"methodic\" Other journalists reported that the attacks were \"aimed at the whole system of dikes\" [93] Columnist Joseph Kraft, who was also touring North Vietnam, said he believed the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that, if the U.S Air Force were \"truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way\" [94] Due to the publicity surrounding Fondas visit, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assessed arial photography of the North Vietnamese dyke system leading to two conclusions: First that the North Vietnamese dyke system was incredibly robust, meaning it would be costly to attack and easy to repair They note that \"A crew of less than 50 men with wheelbarrows and hand tools probably could repair in one day the largest crater observed.\" [95] Second that \"all the damaged sections of dikes are close to valid military-related targets\", [95] and not in areas that would cause the most damage to the dyke system Thus the CIA argue that \"A study of available photography shows conclusively that there has been no concerted and intentional bombing of North Vietnam's vital duke system.\"\n\n\nRegrets\nIn a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions, stating:\n\n\nSubject of government surveillance\nIn 2013, it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1,600 Americans

several small baggies containing pills were seized [118] Although Fonda protested that the pills were harmless vitamins, she was booked by police and then released on bond Fonda alleged that the arresting officer told her he was acting on direct orders from the Nixon White House [119] As she wrote in 2009, \"I told them what  [the vitamins] were but they said they were getting orders from the White House I think they hoped this 'scandal' would cause the college speeches to be canceled and ruin my respectability.\" [117] After lab tests confirmed the pills were vitamins, the charges were dropped with little media attention.\n\n\nFeminist causes\nIn a 2017 interview with Brie Larson, published by People magazine, Fonda stated, \"One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault We were violated and it's not right.\" She said, \"I've been raped, I've been sexually abused as a child and I've been fired because I wouldn't sleep with my boss.\" She said, \"I always thought it was my fault; that I didn't do or say the right thing I know young girls who've been raped and didn't even know it was rape They think,

urged her to speak out against the Iraq War [149] She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism [150]\n\n\nFonda and Kerry\nIn the 2004 presidential election, her name was used as a disparaging epithet against John Kerry, a former VVAW leader, who was then the Democratic Party presidential candidate Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie called Kerry a \"Jane Fonda Democrat\" Kerry's opponents also circulated a photograph showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti-war rally, though they sat

in the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant Different models of the T-90 tank are powered by various motors in its initial models, like the V-84MS 618 kW (840 hp) four-stroke V-12 piston engine, uprated 1,000 hp (750 kW) engines and 1,250 hp (930 kW) engines made by Uralvagonzavod and are delivered by Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant The Т-90S with 1,000 hp (750 kW) engine can attain a top speed of 60 km/h on the road and up to 45 km/h on rough terrain The T-90 tank has a typical drivetrain arrangement, with a rear placed engine and transmission The 1,000 hp (750 kW) engines are V-92 four stroke, 12 cylinder, multi-fuel diesel while the 1,250 hp (930 kW) engine is V-96 The T-90 export version i.e modified T-90S is fitted with an increased power multi-fuel 1,000 hp (750 kW) diesel engine with turbochargers The tank has an air conditioning system for work in hot places [citation needed]\n\n\nProtection\nThe T-90 has a \"three-tiered\" protection system The first tier is the composite armour in the turret, consisting of basic armour shell with an insert of alternating layers of aluminum and plastics and a controlled deformation section [citation needed]\n\n\nEstimated protection level comparison\nThe T-90A / T-90S turret uses a stronger steel alloy, giving an approximately 10–15% increase in the protection level given from the steel elements of the armor array; as the array from many aspects is not wholly steel, the overall increase in protection is less than this margin over these areas [103] [104] Protection values will decrease somewhat against Tandem HEAT or penetrators with precursor tips These measures are not as effective against heavier, newer generations of E.R.A such as Relikt.\n\n\nTurret issues\nThe T-90 has an unknown issue that causes it to become disabled via the turret spinning uncontrollably Currently there is no concrete understanding of what precisely causes this issue, but a theory by a former tank commander of the British Army, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, states: “It’ll likely be a combination between inexperienced crews and poor electronics.” [106]\n\n\nVariants\nBackground: History of the tank, Tank

At least two were confirmed destroyed in the initial phases of the war, being the first-ever proven total loss of the combat vehicle.\n\n**Export**\n\nThe T-90S Bhishma is a vehicle tailored for Indian service, improving upon the T-90S, and developed with assistance from Russia and France. The tanks are equipped with the French Thales-built Catherine-FC thermal sights. They use Russian Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour, in addition to the primary armor, which consists of laminated plates and ceramic layers with high-tensile properties.

It can fire armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS), high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT-FS), and high-explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG) ammunition, as well as 9M119M Refleks anti-tank guided missiles.\n\n**Mobility**\n\nThe prime mover is the V-92S diesel engine, built in the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. Different models of the T-90 tank are powered by various motors in its initial models, like the V-84MS 618 kW (840 hp) four-stroke V-12 piston engine, uprated 1,000 hp (750 kW) engines and 1,250 hp (930 kW) engines made by Uralvagonzavod and are delivered by Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant.\n\n**Protection**\n\nThe T-90 has a \"three-tiered\" protection system. The first tier is the composite armor in the turret, consisting of basic armor shell with an insert of alternating layers of aluminum and plastics and a controlled deformation section.\n\n**Estimated Protection Level Comparison**\n\nThe T-90A/T-90S turret uses a stronger steel alloy, giving an approximately 10-15% increase in the protection level given from the steel elements of the armor array; as the array from many aspects is not wholly steel, the overall increase in protection is less than this margin over these areas.\n\n**Turret Issues**\n\nThe T-90 has an unknown issue that causes it to become disabled via the turret spinning uncontrollably. Currently, there is no concrete understanding of what precisely causes this issue, but a theory by a former tank commander of the British Army, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, states: \"It'll likely be a

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"T-90\" following this outline:\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe T-90 has its origins in a Soviet-era program aimed at developing a replacement for the T-64, T-72 and T-80 series of main battle tanks (MBT) The T-72 platform was selected as the basis for the new generation of tank owing to its cost-effectiveness, simplicity and automotive qualities The Kartsev-Venediktov Design Bureau from Nizhny Tagil was responsible for the design work and prepared two parallel proposals—the Object 188, which was a relatively simple upgrade of the existing T-72B tank (Object 184), and the far more advanced Object 187—only vaguely related to the T-72 series and incorporating major improvements to the hull and turret design, armor, powerplant and armament Development work was approved in 1986 and the first prototypes were completed by 1988 The vehicles resulting from the Object 187 program have not been declassified to this date [9]\n\n\nProduction and service history\nRussian tank production dwindled in the years before and after the breakup of the Soviet Union The Kharkov tank plant belonged to the newly independent Ukraine, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant ended production in 1989, and Kirov in Leningrad in 1990 In the two remaining tank plants at Omsk and Nizhni-Tagil, state orders all but ceased in 1992 Around the same time, the Russian Ministry of Defense decided it would commit to eventually producing just one tank type [12]\n\n\nCombat use\nAn early variant of the export-oriented T-90S allegedly saw combat action during the 1999 Chechen invasion of Dagestan instead of being delivered to India The tank's survivability against rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) is disputed Gordon L Rottman writes that T-90s were \"frequently\" knocked out by three or four hits from a RPG-7 He adds that Chechens found a way to compromise T-90s fitted with explosive reactive armor: they would fire an RPG-7 from close range (within 50m) to trigger the explosive reactive armor protection, and then re-attack the exposed tank armour underneath with two or more RPG hits, again from close range [36]\n\n\nRussian service\nAn early variant of

136th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade equipped with T-90A tanks conducting operations in Luhansk Oblast of Ukraine were identified in social media posts, and locations of their photographs were geolocated by open-source investigators [39]\n\n\nSyrian service\nIn early February 2016, Syrian Army forces began using T-90As in combat [48] A video was leaked on the internet which showed a T-90 survive a direct frontal turret hit by a TOW missile in Aleppo [49] The Kontakt-5 reactive armor discharged the TOW warhead before impact [48] Two Syrian Army operated T-90 were captured by HTS militias while ISIS fighters captured a third in November 2017 A rebel operated T-90 was recaptured by Syrian government forces while the second was reportedly destroyed in combat by a T-72 Another 5 Syrian Army

{"title": "Glioblastoma", "content": "\nSigns and symptoms\nCommon symptoms include seizures, headaches, nausea and vomiting, memory loss, changes to personality, mood or concentration, and localized neurological problems [18] The kinds of symptoms produced depend more on the location of the tumor than on its pathological properties The tumor can start producing symptoms quickly, but occasionally is an asymptomatic condition until it reaches an enormous size [19]\n\n\nRisk factors\nThe cause of most cases is unclear [2] The best known risk factor is exposure to ionizing radiation, and CT scan radiation is an important cause [20] [21] About 5% develop from certain hereditary syndromes [18]\n\n\nGenetics\nUncommon risk factors include genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis, Li–Fraumeni syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, or Turcot syndrome [18] Previous radiation therapy is also a risk [2] [3] For unknown reasons, it occurs more commonly in males [22]\n\n\nEnvironmental\nOther associations include exposure to smoking, pesticides, and working in petroleum refining or rubber manufacturing [18]\n\n\nOther\nResearch has been done to see if consumption of cured meat is a risk factor No risk had been confirmed as of 2003 [29] Similarly, exposure to formaldehyde, and residential electromagnetic fields, such as from cell phones and electrical wiring within homes, have been studied as risk factors As of 2015, they had not been shown to cause GBM [18] [30] [31]\n\n\nPathogenesis\nThe cellular origin of glioblastoma is unknown Because of the similarities in immunostaining of glial cells and glioblastoma, gliomas such as glioblastoma have long been assumed to originate from glial-type stem cells found in the subventricular zone More recent studies suggest that astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and neural stem cells could all serve as the cell of origin [32] [33]\n\n\nGlioblastoma classification\nBrain tumor classification has been traditionally based on histopathology at macroscopic level, measured in hematoxylin-eosin sections The World Health Organization published the first standard classification in 1979 [36] and has been doing so since The 2007 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System [37] was the last classification mainly based on microscopy features The new 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System [38] was a paradigm shift: some of the tumors were defined also by their genetic composition as well as their cell morphology.\n\n\nMolecular alterations\nThere are currently three molecular subtypes of glioblastoma that were identified based on gene expression: [41]\n\n\nCancer stem cells\nGlioblastoma cells with properties similar to progenitor cells (glioblastoma cancer stem cells) have been found in glioblastomas Their presence, coupled with the glioblastoma's diffuse nature results in difficulty in removing them completely by surgery, and is therefore believed to be the possible cause behind resistance to conventional treatments, and the high recurrence rate [52] Glioblastoma cancer stem cells share some resemblance with neural progenitor cells, both expressing the surface receptor CD133 [53] CD44 can also be used as a cancer stem cell marker in a subset of glioblastoma tumour cells [54] Glioblastoma cancer stem cells appear to exhibit enhanced resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy mediated, at least in part, by up-regulation of the DNA damage response [55]\n\n\nMetabolism\nThe IDH1 gene encodes for the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and is not mutated in glioblastoma As such, these tumors behave more aggressively compared to IDH1-mutated astrocytomas [48]\n\n\nIon channels\nFurthermore, GBM exhibits numerous alterations in genes that encode for ion channels, including upregulation of gBK potassium channels and ClC-3 chloride channels By upregulating these ion channels, glioblastoma tumor cells are hypothesized to facilitate increased ion movement over the cell membrane, thereby increasing H2O movement through osmosis, which aids glioblastoma cells in changing cellular volume very rapidly This is helpful in their extremely aggressive invasive behavior because quick adaptations in cellular volume can facilitate movement through the sinuous extracellular matrix of the brain [56]\n\n\nMicroRNA\nAs of 2012, RNA interference, usually microRNA, was under investigation in tissue culture, pathology specimens, and preclinical animal models of glioblastoma [57] Additionally, experimental observations suggest that microRNA-451 is a key regulator of LKB1/AMPK signaling in cultured glioma cells [58] and that miRNA clustering controls epigenetic pathways in the disease [59]\n\n\nTumor vasculature\nGBM is characterized by abnormal vessels that present disrupted morphology and functionality [60] The high permeability and poor perfusion of the vasculature result in a disorganized blood flow within the tumor and can lead to increased hypoxia, which in turn facilitates cancer progression by promoting processes such as immunosuppression [60] [61]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nWhen viewed with MRI, glioblastomas often appear as ring-enhancing lesions The appearance is not specific, however, as other lesions such as abscess, metastasis, tumefactive multiple sclerosis, and other entities may have a similar appearance [63] Definitive diagnosis of a suspected GBM on CT or MRI requires a stereotactic biopsy or a craniotomy with tumor resection and pathologic confirmation Because the tumor grade is based upon the most malignant portion of the tumor, biopsy or subtotal tumor resection can result in undergrading of the lesion Imaging of tumor blood flow using perfusion MRI and measuring tumor metabolite concentration with MR spectroscopy may add diagnostic value to standard MRI in select cases by showing increased relative cerebral blood volume and increased choline peak, respectively, but pathology remains the gold standard for diagnosis and molecular characterization [citation needed]\n\n\nPrevention\nThere are no known methods to prevent glioblastoma [3] It is the case for most gliomas, unlike for some other forms of cancer, that they happen without previous warning and there are no known ways to prevent them [66]\n\n\nTreatment\nTreating glioblastoma is difficult due to several complicating factors: [67]\n\n\nSymptomatic therapy\nSupportive treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving the patient's neurologic function The primary supportive agents are anticonvulsants and corticosteroids.\n\n\nSurgery\nSurgery is the first stage of treatment of glioblastoma An average GBM tumor contains 1011 cells, which is on average reduced to 109 cells after surgery (a reduction of 99%) Benefits of surgery include resection for a pathological diagnosis, alleviation of symptoms related to mass effect, and potentially removing disease before secondary resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy occurs [69]\n\n\nRadiotherapy\nSubsequent to surgery, radiotherapy becomes the mainstay of treatment for people with glioblastoma It is typically performed along with giving temozolomide [10] A pivotal clinical trial carried out in the early 1970s showed that among 303 GBM patients randomized to radiation or best medical therapy, those who received radiation had a median survival more than double those who did not [79] Subsequent clinical research has attempted to build on the backbone of surgery followed by radiation Whole-brain radiotherapy does not improve when compared to the more precise and targeted three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy [80] A total radiation dose of 60–65 Gy has been found to be optimal for treatment [81]\n\n\nChemotherapy\nMost studies show no benefit from the addition of chemotherapy However, a large clinical trial of 575 participants randomized to standard radiation versus radiation plus temozolomide chemotherapy showed that the group receiving temozolomide survived a median of 14.6 months as opposed to 12.1 months for the group receiving radiation alone [10] [84] This treatment regimen is now standard for most cases of glioblastoma where the person is not enrolled in a clinical trial [85] [86] Temozolomide seems to work by sensitizing the tumor cells to radiation, and appears more effective for tumors with MGMT promoter methylation [87] High doses of temozolomide in high-grade gliomas yield low toxicity, but the results are comparable to the standard doses [88] Antiangiogenic therapy with medications such as bevacizumab control symptoms, but do not appear to affect overall survival in those with glioblastoma A 2018 systematic review found that the overall benefit of anti-angiogenic therapies was unclear [89] In elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who are reasonably fit, concurrent and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy gives the best overall survival but is associated with a greater risk of haematological adverse events than radiotherapy alone [90]\n\n\nImmunotherapy\nPhase 3 clinical trials of immunotherapy treatments for glioblastoma have largely failed [91]\n\n\nOther procedures\nAlternating electric field therapy is an FDA-approved therapy for newly diagnosed [92] and recurrent glioblastoma [93] In 2015, initial results from a phase-III randomized clinical trial of alternating electric field therapy plus temozolomide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma reported a three-month improvement in progression-free survival, and a five-month improvement in overall survival compared to temozolomide therapy alone, [94] [95] representing the first large trial in a decade to show a survival improvement in this setting [95] Despite these results, the efficacy of this approach remains controversial among medical experts [96] However, increasing understanding of the mechanistic basis through which alternating electric field therapy exerts anti-cancer effects and results from ongoing phase-III clinical trials in extracranial cancers may help facilitate increased clinical acceptance to treat glioblastoma in the future [97]\n\n\nPrognosis\nThe most common length of survival following diagnosis is 10 to 13 months (although recent research points to a median survival rate of 15 months), [98] [99] [8] with fewer than 1–3% of people surviving longer than five years [2] [5] [100] In the United States between 2012 and 2016 five-year survival was 6.8% [5] Without treatment, survival is typically three months [14] Complete cures are extremely rare, but have been reported [101] [102]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nAbout three per 100,000 people develop the disease a year, [3] although regional frequency may be much higher [107] The frequency in England doubled between 1995 and 2015 [108]\n\n\nHistory\nThe term glioblastoma multiforme was introduced in 1926 by Percival Bailey and Harvey Cushing, based on the idea that the tumor originates from primitive precursors of glial cells (glioblasts), and the highly variable appearance due to the presence of necrosis, hemorrhage, and cysts (multiform) [110]\n\n\nResearch\nGene therapy has been explored as a method to treat glioblastoma, and while animal models and early-phase clinical trials have been successful, as of 2017, all gene-therapy drugs that had been tested in phase-III clinical trials for glioblastoma had failed [111] [112] [113] Scientists have developed the core–shell nanostructured LPLNP-PPT (long persistent luminescence nanoparticles PPT refers to polyetherimide, PEG and trans-activator of transcription, and TRAIL is the human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand [114]) for effective gene delivery and tracking, with positive results This is a TRAIL ligand that has been encoded to induce apoptosis of cancer cells, more specifically glioblastomas Although this study was still in clinical trials in 2017, it has shown diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities, and will open great interest for clinical applications in stem-cell-based therapy [115]\n\n\nGene therapy\nGene therapy has been explored as a method to treat glioblastoma, and while

stages Several viruses including herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, poliovirus, and reovirus are currently being tested in phases I and II of clinical trials for glioblastoma therapy and have shown to improve overall survival [117]\n\n\nIntranasal drug delivery\nDirect nose-to-brain drug delivery is being explored as a means to achieve higher, and hopefully more effective, drug concentrations in the brain [118] [119] A clinical phase-I/II study with glioblastoma patients in Brazil investigated the natural compound perillyl alcohol for intranasal delivery as an aerosol The results were encouraging [118] [120] [121] and, as of 2016, a similar trial has been initiated in the United States [122]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Glioblastoma\n\nGlioblastoma, also known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is a type of brain cancer that arises from the brain's supportive tissue, called glial cells. It is a highly aggressive and malignant tumor that can grow rapidly and infiltrate surrounding brain tissue. Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and is characterized by its poor prognosis and limited treatment options.\n\n## Signs and Symptoms\n\nThe symptoms of glioblastoma can vary depending on the location of the tumor, but common symptoms include seizures, headaches, nausea and vomiting, memory loss, changes to personality, mood or concentration, and localized neurological problems. The tumor can start producing symptoms quickly, but occasionally, it is an asymptomatic condition until it reaches an enormous size.\n\n## Risk Factors\n\nThe cause of most cases of glioblastoma is unclear, but the best-known risk factor is exposure to ionizing radiation, including CT scan radiation. About 5% of glioblastomas develop from certain hereditary syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, or Turcot syndrome. Previous radiation therapy is also a risk factor, and glioblastoma occurs more commonly in males.\n\n## Genetics\n\nGlioblastoma is a complex disease with multiple genetic alterations. Uncommon risk factors include genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, or Turcot syndrome. Previous radiation therapy is also a risk, and glioblastoma occurs more commonly in males. Recent studies suggest that glioblastoma cells may arise from glial-type stem cells found in the subventricular zone, but other cell types, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, may also serve as the cell of origin.\n\n## Glioblastoma Classification\n\nBrain tumor classification has traditionally been based on histopathology at the macroscopic level, measured in hematoxylin-eosin sections. The World Health Organization published the first standard classification in 1979, and subsequent classifications have been based on microscopy features. The 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System introduced a new paradigm, defining some tumors by their genetic composition as well as their cell morphology.\n\n## Molecular Alterations\n\nThere are currently three molecular subtypes of glioblastoma that have been identified based on gene expression. These subtypes have distinct genetic and molecular profiles, which are associated with different clinical outcomes and treatment responses.\n\n## Cancer Stem Cells\n\nGlioblastoma cells with properties similar to progenitor cells, known as glioblastoma cancer stem cells, have been found in glioblastomas. These cells are thought to contribute to the tumor's resistance to conventional treatments and its high recurrence rate. Glioblastoma cancer stem cells share some resemblance with neural progenitor cells, both expressing the surface receptor CD133.\n\n## Metabolism\n\nGlioblastoma cells exhibit altered metabolism, which is characterized by increased glucose uptake and lactate production. The IDH1 gene, which encodes for the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, is not mutated in glioblastoma, which results in more aggressive tumor behavior compared to IDH1-mutated astrocytomas.\n\n## Ion Channels\n\nGlioblastoma cells exhibit numerous alterations in genes that encode for ion channels, including upregulation of gBK potassium channels and ClC-3 chloride channels. These ion channels facilitate increased ion movement over the cell membrane, which aids glioblastoma cells in changing cellular volume rapidly, facilitating their invasive behavior.\n\n## MicroRNA\n\nMicroRNA, a type of RNA interference, has been investigated in glioblastoma tissue culture, pathology specimens, and preclinical animal models. Experimental observations suggest that microRNA-451 is a key regulator of LKB1/AMPK signaling in cultured glioma cells, and that miRNA clustering controls epigenetic pathways in the disease.\n\n## Tumor Vasculature\n\nGlioblastoma is characterized by abnormal vessels that present disrupted morphology and functionality.

Chemotherapy is also used, and temozolomide has been found to be effective in extending survival. However, most studies show no benefit from the addition of chemotherapy, and antiangiogenic therapy with medications such as bevacizumab control symptoms but do not appear to affect overall survival in those with glioblastoma.\n\n## Immunotherapy\n\nPhase 3 clinical trials of immunotherapy treatments for glioblastoma have largely failed. However, various immunotherapy approaches are being explored, including checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines.\n\n## Other Procedures\n\nAlternating electric field therapy is an FDA-approved therapy for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. In 2015, initial results from a phase-III randomized clinical trial of alternating electric field therapy plus temozolomide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma reported a three-month improvement in progression-free survival, and a five-month improvement in overall survival compared to temozolomide therapy alone.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe most common length of survival following diagnosis is 10 to 13 months, with fewer than 1–3% of people surviving longer than five years. In the United States between 2012 and 2016, five-year survival was 6.8%. Without treatment, survival is typically three months.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nAbout three per 100,000 people develop glioblastoma a year, although regional frequency may be much higher. The frequency in England doubled between 1995 and 2015.\n\n## History\n\nThe term glioblastoma multiforme was introduced in 1926 by Percival Bailey and Harvey Cushing, based on the idea that the tumor originates from primitive precursors of glial cells (glioblasts), and the highly variable appearance due to the presence of necrosis, hemorrhage, and cysts (multiform).\n\n## Research\n\nGene therapy has been explored as a method to treat glioblastoma, and while animal models and early-phase clinical trials have been successful, as of 2017, all gene-therapy drugs that had been tested in phase-III clinical trials for glioblastoma had failed.

{"title": "Theodore_Roosevelt", "content": "\nEarly life\nRoosevelt was born on October 27, 1858, at 28 East 20th Street in Manhattan [1] He was the second of four children born to Martha Stewart Bulloch and businessman Theodore Roosevelt Sr He had an older sister (Anna),  younger brother (Elliott) and younger sister (Corinne) [2]\n\n\nEducation\nRoosevelt was homeschooled Biographer H W Brands wrote that, \"The most obvious drawback...was uneven coverage of...various areas of...knowledge.\" [10] He was solid in geography and bright in history, biology, French, and German; however, he struggled in mathematics and the classical languages.\n\n\nNaval history and strategy\nWhile at Harvard, Roosevelt began a systematic study of the role played by the United States Navy in the War of 1812 [18] [19] He ultimately published The Naval War of 1812 in 1882 The book included comparisons of British and American leadership down to the ship-to-ship level It was praised for its scholarship and style, and remains a standard study of the war [20]\n\n\nFirst marriage and widowerhood\nIn 1880, Roosevelt married socialite Alice Hathaway Lee [24] Their daughter, Alice Lee Roosevelt, was born on February 12, 1884 Two days later, the new mother died of undiagnosed kidney failure, on the same day as Roosevelt's mother Martha died of typhoid fever In his diary, Roosevelt wrote a large \"X\" on the page and then, \"The light has gone out of my life.\" Distraught, Roosevelt left baby Alice in the care of his sister Bamie while he grieved; he assumed custody of Alice when she was three [25]\n\n\nEarly political career\nIn 1881, Roosevelt won election to the New York State Assembly, representing the 21st district, then centered on the \"Silk Stocking District\" of New York County's Upper East Side  He served in the 1882, 1883, and 1884 sessions of the legislature He began making his mark immediately: he blocked a corrupt effort of financier Jay Gould to lower his taxes Roosevelt exposed the collusion of Gould and Judge Theodore Westbrook and successfully argued for an investigation, aiming for the judge to be impeached Although the investigation committee rejected the impeachment, Roosevelt had exposed corruption in Albany and assumed a high and positive profile in New York publications [28]\n\n\nState Assemblyman\nIn 1881, Roosevelt won election to the New York State Assembly, representing the 21st district, then centered on the \"Silk Stocking District\" of New York County's Upper East Side  He served in the 1882, 1883, and 1884 sessions of the legislature He began making his mark immediately: he blocked a corrupt effort of financier Jay Gould to lower his taxes Roosevelt exposed the collusion of Gould and Judge Theodore Westbrook and successfully argued for an investigation, aiming for the judge to be impeached Although the investigation committee rejected the impeachment, Roosevelt had exposed corruption in Albany and assumed a high and positive profile in New York publications [28]\n\n\nPresidential election of 1884\nWith numerous presidential hopefuls, Roosevelt supported Senator George F Edmunds of Vermont The state Republican Party preferred incumbent president, Chester Arthur, who was known for passing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act Roosevelt succeeded in influencing the Manhattan delegates at the state convention He then took control of the convention, bargaining through the night and outmaneuvering supporters of Arthur and James G Blaine; consequently, he gained a national reputation as a key politician in his state [34]\n\n\nCattle rancher in Dakota\nRoosevelt first visited the Dakota Territory in 1883 to hunt bison Exhilarated by the western lifestyle and with the cattle business booming, Roosevelt invested $14,000 ($457,800 in 2023) in hope of becoming a prosperous cattle rancher For several years, he shuttled between his home in New York and ranch in Dakota [41]\n\n\nSecond marriage\nOn December 2, 1886, Roosevelt married his childhood friend, Edith Kermit Carow, at St George's, Hanover Square, in London, England [50] [51] Roosevelt felt deeply troubled that his second marriage was soon after the death of his first wife and he faced resistance from his sisters [52] The couple had five children: Theodore \"Ted\" III in 1887, Kermit in 1889, Ethel in 1891, Archibald in 1894, and Quentin in 1897 They also raised Roosevelt's daughter from his first marriage, Alice, who often clashed with her stepmother [53]\n\n\nReentering public life\nUpon Roosevelt's return to New York, Republican leaders approached him about running for mayor of New York City in the 1886 election [54] Roosevelt accepted the nomination despite having little hope against United Labor Party candidate Henry George and Democrat Abram Hewitt Roosevelt campaigned hard, but Hewitt won with 41%, taking the votes of many Republicans who feared George's radical policies George was held to 31%, and Roosevelt took third with 27% [55] [56] Fearing his political career might never recover, Roosevelt turned to writing The Winning of the West, tracking the westward movement of Americans; it was a great success, earning favorable reviews and selling all copies from the first printing [57]\n\n\nCivil Service Commission\nAfter Benjamin Harrison unexpectedly defeated Blaine for the presidential nomination at the 1888 Republican National Convention, Roosevelt gave stump speeches in the Midwest in support of Harrison [58] On the insistence of Henry Cabot Lodge, President Harrison appointed Roosevelt to the United States Civil Service Commission, where he served until 1895 [59] While many of his predecessors had approached the office as a sinecure, [60] Roosevelt fought the spoilsmen and demanded enforcement of civil service laws [61] The Sun described Roosevelt as \"irrepressible, belligerent, and enthusiastic\" [62] Roosevelt clashed with Postmaster General John Wanamaker, who handed out patronage positions to Harrison supporters, and Roosevelt's attempt to force out several postal workers damaged Harrison politically [63] Despite Roosevelt's support for Harrison's reelection in the 1892 presidential election, the winner, Grover Cleveland, reappointed him [64] Roosevelt's close friend and biographer, Joseph Bucklin Bishop, described his assault on the spoils system:\n\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner\nIn 1894, reform Republicans approached Roosevelt about running for Mayor of New York again; he declined, mostly due to his wife's resistance to being removed from the Washington social set Soon after, he realized he had missed an opportunity to reinvigorate a dormant political career He retreated to the Dakotas; Edith regretted her role in the decision and vowed there would be no repeat [65]\n\n\nEmergence as national figure\nIn the 1896 presidential election, Roosevelt backed Thomas Brackett Reed for the Republican nomination, but William McKinley won the nomination and defeated William Jennings Bryan in the general election [73] Roosevelt strongly opposed Bryan's free silver platform, viewing many of Bryan's followers as dangerous fanatics He gave campaign speeches for McKinley [74] Urged by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, President McKinley appointed Roosevelt as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897 [75] Secretary of the Navy John D Long was in poor health and left many major decisions to Roosevelt Influenced by Alfred Thayer Mahan, Roosevelt called for a build-up in naval strength, particularly the construction of battleships [76] Roosevelt also began pressing his national security views regarding the Pacific and the Caribbean on McKinley and was adamant that Spain be ejected from Cuba [77] He explained his priorities to one of the Navy's planners in late 1897:\n\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Navy\nIn the 1896 presidential election, Roosevelt backed Thomas Brackett Reed for the Republican nomination, but

explained his priorities to one of the Navy's planners in late 1897:\n\n\nWar in Cuba\nWith the beginning of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Roosevelt resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy Along with Army Colonel Leonard Wood, he formed the First U.S Volunteer Cavalry Regiment [83] His wife and many friends begged Roosevelt to remain in Washington, but Roosevelt was determined to see battle When the newspapers reported the formation of the new regiment, Roosevelt and Wood were flooded with applications [84] Referred to by the press as the \"Rough Riders\", it was one of many temporary units active only during the war [85]\n\n\nGovernor of New York\nShortly after Roosevelt's return, Republican Congressman Lemuel E Quigg, a lieutenant of New York machine boss Thomas C Platt, asked Roosevelt to run in the 1898 gubernatorial election Prospering politically from the Platt machine, Roosevelt's rise to power was marked by the pragmatic decisions of Platt, who disliked Roosevelt Platt feared Roosevelt would oppose his interests in office and was reluctant to propel Roosevelt to the forefront of national politics, but needed a strong candidate due to the unpopularity of the incumbent Republican governor, Frank S Black Roosevelt agreed to become the nominee and to try not to \"make war\" with the Republican establishment once in office Roosevelt defeated Black in the Republican caucus, and faced Democrat Augustus Van Wyck, a well-respected judge, in the general election [90] Roosevelt campaigned on his war record, winning by just 1% [91]\n\n\nVice presidency (1901)\nIn November 1899, Vice President Garret Hobart died, leaving an open spot on the 1900 Republican national ticket Though Henry Cabot Lodge and others urged him to run for vice president in 1900, Roosevelt issued a public statement saying that he would not accept the nomination [100] Eager to be rid of Roosevelt, Platt nonetheless began a newspaper campaign in favor of Roosevelt's nomination [101] Roosevelt attended the 1900 Republican National Convention as a state delegate and struck a bargain with Platt: Roosevelt would accept the nomination if the convention offered it to him but would otherwise serve another term as governor Platt asked Pennsylvania party boss Matthew Quay to lead the campaign for Roosevelt's nomination, and Quay outmaneuvered Mark Hanna at the convention to put Roosevelt on the ticket [102] Roosevelt won the nomination unanimously [103]\n\n\nPresidency (1901–1909)\nOn September 6, 1901, President McKinley was attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, when he was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz Roosevelt, vacationing in Isle La Motte, Vermont, [109] traveled to Buffalo to visit McKinley in the hospital When McKinley seemed to recover, Roosevelt resumed his vacation [110] When McKinley's condition worsened, Roosevelt rushed back to Buffalo He was in North Creek when he learned of McKinley's death on September 14 Roosevelt then continued to Buffalo and was sworn in as the 26th president at the Ansley Wilcox House [111]\n\n\nDomestic policies: The Square Deal\nRoosevelt was hailed as the \"trust-buster\" for his aggressive use of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, compared to his predecessors [116] He viewed big business as essential to the American economy, prosecuting only \"bad trusts\" that restrained trade and charged unfair prices [117] Roosevelt brought 44 antitrust suits, breaking up the Northern Securities Company, the largest railroad monopoly, and regulating Standard Oil, the largest oil company [116] His predecessors, Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland, and William McKinley, had together prosecuted only 18 antitrust violations [116]\n\n\nTrust busting and regulation\nRoosevelt was hailed as the \"trust-buster\" for his aggressive use of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, compared to his predecessors [116] He viewed big business as essential to the American economy, prosecuting only \"bad trusts\" that restrained trade and charged unfair prices [117] Roosevelt brought 44 antitrust suits, breaking up the Northern Securities Company, the largest railroad monopoly, and regulating Standard Oil, the largest oil company [116] His predecessors, Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland, and William McKinley, had together prosecuted only 18 antitrust violations [116]\n\n\nCoal strike\nIn May 1902, anthracite coal miners went on strike, threatening a national energy shortage After threatening the coal operators with federal troops, Roosevelt won their agreement to dispute arbitration by a commission, stopping the strike The accord with J P Morgan resulted in miners getting more pay for fewer hours but no union recognition [121] [122] Roosevelt said, \"My action on labor should always be considered in connection with my action as regards capital, and both are reducible to my favorite formula—a square deal for every man.\" [123] He was the first president to help settle a labor dispute [124]\n\n\nProsecuted misconduct\nDuring Roosevelt's second year in office, corruption was uncovered in the Indian Service, the United States General Land Office, and the Post Office Department He prosecuted corrupt Indian agents who had cheated Native American tribes out of land parcels Land fraud and speculation involving Oregon timberlands, led to him and Ethan A Hitchcock forcing General Land Office Commissioner Binger Hermann from office, in November 1902 Special prosecutor Francis J Heney obtained 146 indictments in the Oregon Land Office bribery ring [125] Roosevelt also prosecuted 44 postal employees on charges of bribery and fraud [126] Historians agree he moved \"quickly and decisively\" to address misconduct in his administration [127]\n\n\nRailroads\nMerchants complained that some railroad rates were too high In the 1906 Hepburn Act, Roosevelt sought to give the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to regulate rates, but the Senate, led by conservative Nelson Aldrich, resisted Roosevelt worked with Democratic Senator Benjamin Tillman to pass the bill They ultimately reached a compromise that gave the ICC the power to replace existing rates with \"just-and-reasonable\" maximum rates, allowing railroads to appeal to federal courts on what was \"reasonable\" [128] [129] The Hepburn Act also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and other aspects of railroad operations [130]\n\n\nPure food and drugs\nRoosevelt responded to public outrage over abuses in the food packing industry by pushing Congress to pass the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 and the Pure Food and Drug Act Conservatives initially opposed the bill, but Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, published in 1906, galvanized support for reform [131] The Meat Inspection Act banned misleading labels and preservatives with harmful chemicals The Pure Food and Drug Act banned impure or falsely labeled food and drugs from being made, sold, and shipped Roosevelt served as honorary president of the American School Hygiene Association from 1907 to 1908 and convened the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children in 1909 [132]\n\n\nConservation\nRoosevelt was proudest of his work in conserving natural resources and extending federal protection to land and wildlife [133] He worked closely with Interior Secretary James Rudolph Garfield and Chief of the United States Forest Service Gifford Pinchot to enact a series of conservation programs that met resistance from Western Congress members, such as Charles William Fulton [134] Nonetheless, Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service, signed the creation of five National Parks, and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act, under which he proclaimed 18 new U.S National Monuments He also established the first 51 bird reserves, four game preserves, and 150 National Forests The area of the United States he placed under public protection totals approximately 230 million acres (930,000 square kilometers) [135] Roosevelt was the first honorary member of the Camp-Fire Club of America [136]\n\n\nBusiness panic of 1907\nIn 1907, Roosevelt faced the greatest domestic economic crisis since the Panic of 1893 Wall Street's stock market entered a slump in early 1907, and many investors blamed Roosevelt's regulatory policies for the decline in stock prices [141] Roosevelt ultimately helped calm the crisis by meeting with the leaders of U.S Steel on November 4, 1907, and approving their plan to purchase a Tennessee steel company near bankruptcy—its failure would ruin a major New York bank [142]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe American annexation of Hawaii in 1898 was stimulated in part by fear that Japan would dominate or seize the Hawaiian Republic [145] Similarly, Germany was the alternative to American takeover of the Philippines in 1900, and Tokyo strongly preferred the U.S to take over As the U.S became a naval world power, it needed to find a way to avoid a military confrontation in the Pacific with Japan [146]\n\n\nJapan\nThe American annexation of Hawaii in 1898 was stimulated in part by

over As the U.S became a naval world power, it needed to find a way to avoid a military confrontation in the Pacific with Japan [146]\n\n\nChina\nFollowing the Boxer Rebellion, foreign powers, including the United States, required China to pay indemnities as part of the Boxer protocol In 1908, Roosevelt appropriated these indemnities for the Boxer Indemnity Scholarships, which funded tens of thousands of Chinese students to study in the U.S over the next 40 years [154]: 91 \n\n\nEurope\nSuccess in the war against Spain and the new empire, plus having the largest economy in the world, meant that the United States had emerged as a world power [155] Roosevelt searched for ways to win recognition for the position abroad [156] He also played a major role in mediating the First Moroccan Crisis by calling the Algeciras Conference, which averted war between France and Germany [157]\n\n\nLatin America and the Panama Canal\nAs president, Roosevelt primarily directed the nation's overseas ambitions towards the Caribbean, especially locations that had a bearing on the defense of his pet project, the Panama Canal [161] Roosevelt also increased the size of the navy, and by the end of his second term, the U.S had more battleships than any country other than Britain The Panama Canal, when it opened in 1914, allowed the U.S Navy to rapidly move back and forth from the Pacific to the Caribbean to European waters [162]\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nElection of 1904\nWith the waning of Thomas Platt's power, Roosevelt faced little effective opposition for the 1904 nomination [176] In deference to Mark Hanna's conservative loyalists, Roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to Cornelius Bliss, but he declined Roosevelt turned to his own man, George B Cortelyou of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor To buttress his hold on the party's nomination, Roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing Cortelyou would be considered opposing the President [177] The President secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, Robert R Hitt, was not nominated [178] Senator Charles Warren Fairbanks of Indiana, a favorite of conservatives, gained the nomination [176]\n\n\nSecond term\nAs his second term progressed, Roosevelt moved to the left of his Republican Party base and called for a series of reforms, most of which Congress failed to pass [185] [failed verification – see discussion] Roosevelt's influence waned as he approached the end of his second term, as his promise to forego a third term made him a lame duck and his concentration of power provoked a backlash from many Congressmen [186] He sought a national incorporation law, called for a federal income tax (despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Pollock v Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.), and an inheritance tax Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws) and an eight-hour work day for federal employees In other areas, he also sought a postal savings system (to provide competition for local banks), and he asked for campaign reform laws [187]\n\n\nRhetoric of righteousness\n\nRoosevelt's rhetoric was characterized by an intense moralism of personal righteousness [189] [190] [191] The tone was typified by his denunciation of \"predatory wealth\" in a message he sent Congress in January 1908 calling for passage of new labor laws: \n\nPost-presidency (1909–1919)\nRoosevelt enjoyed being president but believed limited terms provided a check against dictatorship He decided to honor his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term Though he favored Secretary of State Elihu Root as his successor, Root's ill health made him unsuitable New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes was a strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt considered him too independent He settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had been his friend since 1890 and consistently supported Roosevelt's policies [193] Roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice, and wrote to Taft: \"Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials? I will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word!\" Just weeks later, he branded as \"false and malicious\" the charge he was using the offices at his disposal to favor Taft [194] At the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted \"four years more\" of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after Henry Cabot Lodge made it clear Roosevelt was not interested [195]\n\n\nElection of 1908\nRoosevelt enjoyed being president but believed limited terms provided a check against dictatorship He decided to honor his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term Though he favored Secretary of State Elihu Root as his successor, Root's ill health made him unsuitable New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes was a strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt considered him too independent He settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had been his friend since 1890 and consistently supported Roosevelt's policies [193] Roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice, and wrote to Taft: \"Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials?

it took years to mount them all Regarding the large number taken, Roosevelt said, \"I can be condemned only if the existence of the National Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned\" [200] He wrote a detailed account of the trip in African Game Trails [201]\n\n\nRepublican Party schism\nRoosevelt had attempted to refashion Taft into a copy of himself, but recoiled as Taft began to display his individuality He was offended on election night when Taft indicated his success had been possible not just through Roosevelt, but also Taft's half-brother Charles P Taft Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft did not consult him about cabinet appointments [210] Roosevelt and other progressives were ideologically dissatisfied over Taft's conservation policies and his handling of the tariff, when he concentrated power with conservative party leaders in Congress [211] Others have argued that Taft abided by the goals and procedures of the \"Square Deal\" promoted by Roosevelt in his first term The problem was Roosevelt and the more radical progressives had moved on to more aggressive goals, such as curbing the judiciary, which Taft rejected [212]\n\n\nDispute over court power\nRoosevelt gave speeches in the West in the late summer and early fall of 1910 in which he severely criticized the nation's judiciary Roosevelt not only attacked the Supreme Court's 1905 decision in Lochner v New York, he accused federal courts of undermining democracy, branding the suspect jurists \"fossilized judges,\" and compared their tendency to strike down progressive reform legislation, to Justice Roger B Taney's ruling in Dred Scott v Sandford (1857) To ensure the constitution served the public interests, Roosevelt joined other progressives in calling for the \"judicial recall,\" which would enable popular majorities to remove judges from office and reverse unpopular judicial decisions This attack horrified Taft, who, though he privately agreed that Lochner and other decisions had been poorly decided, was an adamant believer in judicial authority preserving constitutional government His horror was shared with other prominent members of the elite legal community, and solidified in Taft's mind that Roosevelt must not be permitted to regain the presidency [214]\n\n\nRoosevelt's \"New Nationalism\"\nIn August 1910, Roosevelt escalated the rivalry with a speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, which was the most radical of his career It marked his public break with Taft and conservative Republicans Advocating a program he called the \"New Nationalism\", Roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and the need to control corporate creation and combination He called for a ban on corporate political contributions [215] Returning to New York, Roosevelt began a battle to take control of the state Republican party from William Barnes Jr. Taft had pledged his support to Roosevelt in this endeavor, and Roosevelt was outraged when Taft's support failed to materialize at the 1910 state convention [216] Roosevelt campaigned for the Republicans in the 1910 elections, in which the Democrats gained control of the House for the first time since 1892 Among the newly elected Democrats was senator Franklin D Roosevelt, who argued he represented his distant cousin's policies better than his Republican opponent [217]\n\n\nBattling Taft over arbitration treaties\nTaft was world leader for arbitration as a guarantee of world peace In 1911 he and Secretary of State Philander C Knox negotiated treaties with Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated Disputes had to be submitted to the Hague Court or another tribunal These were signed in August 1911, but had to be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Senate Neither Taft nor Knox consulted with Senate leaders during negotiations By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft, and the president felt lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat He made speeches supporting the treaties in October, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing them [222]\n\n\nElection of 1912\nIn November 1911, a group of Ohio Republicans endorsed Roosevelt for the party's nomination for president Roosevelt conspicuously declined to refuse a nomination Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, \"I am really sorry for Taft.. I am sure he means well, but he means well feebly, and he does not know how! He is utterly unfit for leadership and this is a time when we need leadership.\" In January 1912, Roosevelt declared \"if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve\" [228] Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms—even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions [229] In reaction to Roosevelt's proposals Taft said, \"Such extremists are not progressives—they are political emotionalists or neurotics\" [230]\n\n\nRepublican primaries and convention\nIn November 1911, a group of Ohio Republicans endorsed Roosevelt for the party's nomination for president Roosevelt conspicuously declined to refuse a nomination Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, \"I am really sorry for Taft..

Roosevelt's proposals Taft said, \"Such extremists are not progressives—they are political emotionalists or neurotics\" [230]\n\n\nProgressive Party\nOnce his defeat appeared probable, Roosevelt announced he would \"accept the progressive nomination on a progressive platform and I shall fight to the end, win or lose\" Roosevelt prophetically said, \"My feeling is that the Democrats will probably win if they nominate a progressive\" [238] Roosevelt left the Republican Party and created the Progressive Party [239] [240] Leadership of the new party included a range of reformers Jane Addams campaigned vigorously for the party as a breakthrough in social reform [241] Gifford Pinchot represented environmentalists and anti-trust crusaders Publisher Frank Munsey provided cash [242] and George W Perkins, a Wall Street financier came from the efficiency movement He handled the new party's finances efficiently but was distrusted by many reformers [243]\n\n\nAttempted assassination\nOn October 14, 1912, while arriving at a campaign event in Milwaukee, Roosevelt was shot by delusional saloonkeeper John Schrank, who believed the ghost of assassinated president William McKinley had directed him to kill Roosevelt [252] [253] The bullet lodged in Roosevelt's chest after penetrating his eyeglass case and passing through a 50-page folded copy of the speech titled \"Progressive Cause Greater Than Any Individual\" [254] Schrank was disarmed and captured by Roosevelt's stenographer, Elbert E Martin as he attempted to fire a second time, and might have been lynched had Roosevelt not shouted for Schrank to remain unharmed [255] Roosevelt assured the crowd he was all right, then ordered police to take Schrank and make sure no violence was done to him [256]\n\n\nDemocratic victory\nAfter the Democrats nominated Governor Woodrow Wilson, Roosevelt did not expect to win the election, as Wilson had compiled a record attractive to progressive Democrats who might have considered voting for Roosevelt [261] Roosevelt still campaigned vigorously, and the election developed into a two-person contest despite Taft's quiet presence Roosevelt respected Wilson, but they differed on various issues; Wilson opposed federal intervention regarding women's suffrage or child labor, and attacked Roosevelt's tolerance of large businesses [262]\n\n\nSouth American expedition (1913–1914)\nIn 1907 a friend of Roosevelt's, John Augustine Zahm, invited Roosevelt to help plan a research expedition to South America To finance it, Roosevelt obtained support from the American Museum of Natural History in return for promising to bring back new animal specimens Roosevelt's popular book, Through the Brazilian Wilderness [265] describes his expedition into the Brazilian jungle in 1913 as a member of the Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition, co-named after its leader, Brazilian Cândido Rondon.\n\n\nFinal years\nRoosevelt returned to the U.S in May 1914 Though he was outraged by the Wilson Administration's conclusion of a treaty that expressed \"sincere regret\" for the way in which the U.S had acquired the Panama Canal Zone, he was impressed by many reforms passed Roosevelt made campaign appearances for the Progressives, but the 1914 elections were a disaster for the fledgling third party [270] Roosevelt began to envision another campaign for president, this time with himself at the head of the Republican Party, but conservative party leaders remained opposed to Roosevelt [271] In hopes of engineering a joint nomination, the Progressives scheduled the 1916 Progressive National Convention at the same time as the 1916 Republican National Convention When the Republicans nominated Charles Evans Hughes, Roosevelt declined the Progressive nomination and urged his Progressive followers to support the Republican candidate [272] Though Roosevelt had long disliked Hughes, he disliked Wilson even more, and campaigned energetically for the Republican nominee However, Wilson won the 1916 election by a narrow margin [273] The Progressives disappeared as a party, and Roosevelt and many of his followers re-joined the Republican Party [274]\n\n\nWorld War I\nWhen the First World War began in 1914, Roosevelt strongly supported the Allies and demanded a harsher policy against Germany, especially regarding submarine warfare Roosevelt angrily denounced the foreign policy of Wilson, calling it a failure regarding the atrocities in Belgium and the violations of American rights [275] In 1916, while campaigning for Hughes, Roosevelt repeatedly denounced Irish Americans and German Americans whom he described as unpatriotic; he insisted that one had to be 100% American, not a \"hyphenated American\" who juggled multiple loyalties In March 1917, Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise a maximum of four divisions similar to the Rough Riders [276] [277] However, President Wilson announced to the press that he would not send Roosevelt and his volunteers to France, but instead an American Expeditionary Force under the command of General John J Pershing [278] Roosevelt never forgave Wilson, and published The Foes of Our Own Household, an indictment of the sitting president [279] [280] [281] Roosevelt's youngest son, Quentin, a pilot with the American forces in France, was killed when shot down behind German lines on July 14, 1918, aged 20 Roosevelt never recovered from his loss [282]\n\n\nLeague of Nations\nRoosevelt was an early supporter of the modern view that there needs to be a global order In his Nobel prize address of 1910, he said, \"it would be a master stroke if those great Powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace, not only to keep the peace among themselves, but to prevent, by force if necessary, its being broken by others.\" [283] It would have executive power such as the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 lacked He called for American participation.\n\n\nFinal political activities\nRoosevelt's attacks on Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections of 1918 He declined a request from New York Republicans to run for another gubernatorial term, but attacked Wilson's Fourteen Points, calling instead for the unconditional surrender of Germany Though his health was uncertain, he was seen as a leading contender for the 1920 Republican nomination, but insisted that, \"If they take me, they'll have to take me without a single modification of the things that I have always stood for!\" [290] He wrote William Allen White, \"I wish to do everything in my power to make the Republican Party the Party of sane, constructive radicalism, just as it was under Lincoln.\" Accordingly, he told the 1918 state convention of the Maine Republican Party that he stood for old-age pensions, insurance for sickness and unemployment, construction of public housing for low-income families, the reduction of working hours, aid to farmers, and more regulation of large corporations [290]\n\n\nDeath\nOn the night of January 5, 1919, Roosevelt suffered breathing problems After receiving treatment from his physician, George W Faller, he felt better and went to bed Roosevelt's last words were either \"Please put out that light, James\" [292] or \"James, will you please put out the light.\", [293] [294] said to his family servant James E Amos Between 4:00 and 4:15 the next morning, Roosevelt died at the age of 60 in his sleep at Sagamore Hill of a pulmonary embolism [292]\n\n\nWriter\nRoosevelt was a prolific author, writing with passion on subjects ranging from foreign policy to the importance of the national park system Roosevelt was also an avid reader of poetry Poet Robert Frost said that Roosevelt \"was our kind He quoted poetry to me He knew poetry.\" [299]\n\n\nCharacter and beliefs\nBritish scholar Marcus Cunliffe evaluates the liberal argument that Roosevelt was an opportunist, exhibitionist, and imperialist Cunliffe praises Roosevelt's versatility, his respect for law, and his sincerity He argues that Roosevelt's foreign policy was better than his detractors allege Cunliffe calls him \"a big man in several respects\" [305]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nWhen he assumed the presidency, Roosevelt reassured many conservatives, stating that \"the mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance.\" [322] The following year, Roosevelt asserted the president's independence from business interests by opposing the merger which created the Northern Securities Company, and many were surprised that any president, much less an unelected one, would challenge powerful banker J.P Morgan [323] In his last two years as president, Roosevelt became increasingly distrustful of big business, despite its close ties to the Republican Party [324] Roosevelt sought to replace the 19th-century laissez-faire economic environment with a new economic model which included a larger regulatory role for the federal government He believed that 19th-century entrepreneurs had risked their fortunes on innovations and new businesses, and that these capitalists had been rightly rewarded By contrast, he believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and, given the lack of risk, unjust, economic rewards Without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class, Roosevelt feared that the country would turn to radicals or fall to revolution [325] His Square Deal domestic program had three main goals: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection  The Square Deal evolved into his program of \"New Nationalism\", which emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions [215]\n\n\nForeign policy beliefs\nIn the analysis by Henry Kissinger, Roosevelt was the first president to develop the guideline that it was the duty of the United States to make its enormous power and potential influence felt globally The idea of being a passive \"city on the hill\" model that others could look up to, he rejected Roosevelt, trained in biology, was a social Darwinist who believed in survival of the fittest The international world in his view was a realm of violence and conflict The United States had all the economic and geographical potential to be the fittest nation on the globe [326] The United States had a duty to act decisively For example, in terms of the Monroe Doctrine, the United States had to prevent European incursions in the Western Hemisphere But there was more, as he expressed in his Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine: the U.S had to be the policeman of the region because unruly, corrupt smaller nations had to be controlled, and if United States did not do it, European powers would in fact intervene and develop their own base of power in the hemisphere in contravention to the Monroe Doctrine [327]\n\n\nLegacy\nHistorians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by placing the \"bully pulpit\" of the presidency at center stage and emphasizing character as much as issues His accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism He is a hero to liberals and progressives for his early proposals that foreshadowed the modern welfare state, including federal taxation, labor reforms, and more direct democracy Conservationists admire Roosevelt for prioritizing the environment and selflessness towards future generations Conservatives and nationalists respect his commitment to law and order, civic duty, and military values Dalton states, \"Today he is heralded as the architect of the modern presidency, as a world leader who boldly reshaped the office to meet the needs of the new century.\" [331]\n\n\nPersona and masculinity\nDalton says Roosevelt is remembered as \"one of the most picturesque personalities who has ever enlivened the landscape\" [334] His friend, historian Henry Adams, proclaimed: \"Roosevelt, more than any other man.. showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter—the quality that medieval theology assigned to God—he was pure act\" [335] Cooper compared him with Woodrow Wilson, highlighting their roles as warrior and priest [336] Dalton stressed Roosevelt's strenuous life [337] Brands calls Roosevelt \"the last romantic\", viewing his romantic notion of life as emerging from his belief in physical bravery as the highest virtue [338] Henry F Pringle, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Theodore Roosevelt (1931), stated the \"Roosevelt of later years was the most adolescent of men.\" [339]\n\n\nMemorials and cultural depictions\nRoosevelt was included with Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln at the Mount Rushmore Memorial, designed in 1927 [348] [349]\n\n\nAudiovisual media\nRoosevelt was one of the first presidents whose voice was recorded for posterity Several of his recorded speeches survive [370] A 1912 voice recording of The Right of the People to Rule, [371] which preserves Roosevelt's lower timbre ranges particularly well for its time, is available from the Michigan State University libraries The audio clip sponsored by the Authentic History Center includes his defense [372] of the Progressive Party in 1912, wherein he proclaims it the \"party of the people\" – in contrast with the other major parties.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nOrganizations\n\n\nLibraries and collections\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nOther\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Theodore Roosevelt\n\nIntroduction\nTheodore Roosevelt was the 26th President of the United States, serving from 1901 to 1909. He was a leading figure in the Republican Party and a pioneer of the Progressive movement. Roosevelt was known for his robust personality, his commitment to conservation, and his trust-busting policies. He was also a prolific writer and a skilled politician who played a significant role in shaping the nation's politics and policies.\n\nEarly Life\nRoosevelt was born on October 27, 1858, in New York City. He was the second of four children born to Martha Stewart Bulloch and Theodore Roosevelt Sr. He had an older sister, Anna, and two younger siblings, Elliott and Corinne. Roosevelt's early life was marked by a strong sense of family and a love of nature. He was educated at home and developed a passion for reading, writing, and the outdoors.\n\nEducation\nRoosevelt was homeschooled by his mother and a series of tutors. He was a bright and curious student, but his education was uneven in some areas. He struggled with mathematics and classical languages, but excelled in geography, history, biology, French, and German. Roosevelt's education was also influenced by his travel experiences, particularly his time spent in Europe in 1873.\n\nNaval History and Strategy\nWhile at Harvard, Roosevelt began a systematic study of the role played by the United States Navy in the War of 1812. He ultimately published The Naval War of 1812 in 1882, which was praised for its scholarship and style. The book remains a standard study of the war and is still widely read today.\n\nFirst Marriage and Widowerhood\nIn 1880, Roosevelt married socialite Alice Hathaway Lee. Their daughter, Alice Lee Roosevelt, was born on February 12, 1884. Two days after the birth, the new mother died of undiagnosed kidney failure, as did Roosevelt's mother Martha on the same day. Roosevelt was devastated by the loss of his wife and mother, and he assumed custody of his daughter when she was three years old.\n\nEarly Political Career\nIn 1881, Roosevelt won election to the New York State Assembly, representing the 21st district in Manhattan. He served in the 1882, 1883, and 1884 sessions of the legislature. Roosevelt quickly made a name for himself by blocking a corrupt effort of financier Jay Gould to lower his taxes. He exposed the collusion of Gould and Judge Theodore Westbrook and successfully argued for an investigation, aiming to impeach Westbrook.\n\nState Assemblyman\nIn 1881, Roosevelt won election to the New York State Assembly, representing the 21st district in Manhattan. He served in the 1882, 1883, and 1884 sessions of the legislature. Roosevelt quickly made a name for himself by blocking a corrupt effort of financier Jay Gould to lower his taxes. He exposed the collusion of Gould and Judge Theodore Westbrook and successfully argued for an investigation, aiming to impeach Westbrook.\n\nPresidential Election of 1884\nIn the 1884 presidential election, Roosevelt supported Senator George F Edmunds of Vermont for the Republican nomination. The state Republican Party preferred incumbent President Chester Arthur, but Roosevelt succeeded in influencing the Manhattan delegates at the state convention. He then took control of the convention, bargaining through the night and outmaneuvering supporters of Arthur and James G Blaine.\n\nCattle Rancher in Dakota\nRoosevelt first visited the Dakota Territory in 1883 to hunt bison. Exhilarated by the western lifestyle and with the cattle business booming, Roosevelt invested $14,000 in a cattle ranch in Dakota. For several years, he shuttled between his home in New York and his ranch in Dakota.\n\nSecond Marriage\nOn December 2, 1886, Roosevelt married his childhood friend, Edith Kermit Carow, at St George's, Hanover Square, in London, England. The couple had five children: Theodore \"Ted\" III in 1887, Kermit in 1889, Ethel in 1891, Archibald in 1894, and Quentin in 1897. They also raised Roosevelt's daughter from his first marriage, Alice.\n\nReentering Public Life\nAfter leaving the presidency, Roosevelt embarked on a series of expeditions and adventures, including the African Safari in 1909 and the Brazilian Wilderness expedition in 1913. He also wrote extensively on politics, history, and the natural world.\n\nState of the Union Address\nIn his 1912 State of the Union address, Roosevelt called for a series of progressive reforms, including stricter regulations on industry, greater funding for education and public health, and a more equitable distribution of wealth. He also advocated for the creation of a national health service and a federal labor department.\n\nDomestic Policies: The Square Deal\nRoosevelt was hailed as the \"trust-buster\" for his aggressive use of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, compared to his predecessors. He viewed big business as essential to the American economy, prosecuting only \"bad trusts\" that restrained trade and charged unfair prices. Roosevelt brought 44 antitrust suits, breaking up the Northern Securities Company, the largest railroad monopoly, and regulating Standard Oil, the largest oil company.\n\nPure Food and Drugs\nRoosevelt responded to public outrage over abuses in the food packing industry by pushing Congress to pass the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 and the Pure Food and Drug Act. Conservatives initially opposed the bill, but Upton Sinclair's The Jungle galvanized support for reform.\n\nConservation\nRoosevelt was proudest of his work in conserving natural resources and extending federal protection to land and wildlife. He established the United States Forest Service, signed the creation of five National Parks, and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act.\n\nBusiness Panic of 1907\nIn 1907, Roosevelt faced the greatest domestic economic crisis since the Panic of 1893. The stock market entered a slump in early 1907, and many investors blamed Roosevelt's regulatory policies for the decline in stock prices. Roosevelt ultimately helped calm the crisis by meeting with the leaders of U.S Steel.\n\nForeign Policy\nRoosevelt was the first president to develop the guideline that it was the duty of the United States to make its enormous power and potential influence felt globally. He believed in the concept of social Darwinism, advocating for the survival of the fittest. Roosevelt rejected the idea of being a passive \"city on the hill\" model, instead believing that the United States had a duty to act decisively.\n\nLegacy\nHistorians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by placing the \"bully pulpit\" of the presidency at center stage and emphasizing character as much as issues.

great success, earning favorable reviews and selling all copies from the first printing [57]\n\n\nCivil Service Commission\nAfter Benjamin Harrison unexpectedly defeated Blaine for the presidential nomination at the 1888 Republican National Convention, Roosevelt gave stump speeches in the Midwest in support of Harrison [58] On the insistence of Henry Cabot Lodge, President Harrison appointed Roosevelt to the United States Civil Service Commission, where he served until 1895 [59] While many of his predecessors had approached the office as a sinecure, [60] Roosevelt fought the spoilsmen and demanded enforcement of civil service laws [61] The Sun described Roosevelt as \"irrepressible, belligerent, and enthusiastic\" [62] Roosevelt clashed with Postmaster General John Wanamaker, who handed out patronage positions to Harrison supporters, and Roosevelt's attempt to force out several postal workers damaged Harrison politically [63] Despite Roosevelt's support for Harrison's

system:\n\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner\nIn 1894, reform Republicans approached Roosevelt about running for Mayor of New York again; he declined, mostly due to his wife's resistance to being

Platt, asked Roosevelt to run in the 1898 gubernatorial election Prospering politically from the Platt machine, Roosevelt's rise to power was marked by the pragmatic decisions of Platt, who disliked Roosevelt Platt feared Roosevelt would oppose his interests in office and was reluctant to propel Roosevelt to the forefront of national politics, but needed a strong candidate due to the unpopularity of the incumbent Republican governor, Frank S Black Roosevelt agreed to become the nominee and to try not to \"make war\" with the Republican establishment once in office Roosevelt defeated Black in

nomination [101] Roosevelt attended the 1900 Republican National Convention as a state delegate and struck a bargain with Platt: Roosevelt would accept the nomination if the convention offered it to

arbitration by a commission, stopping the strike The accord with J P Morgan resulted in miners getting more pay for fewer hours but no union recognition [121] [122] Roosevelt said, \"My action on labor should always be considered in connection with my action as regards capital, and both are reducible to my favorite formula—a square deal for every man.\" [123] He was the first president to help settle a labor dispute [124]\n\n\nProsecuted misconduct\nDuring Roosevelt's second year in office, corruption was uncovered in the Indian Service, the United States General Land Office, and the Post Office Department He prosecuted corrupt Indian agents who had cheated Native American tribes out of land parcels Land fraud and speculation involving Oregon timberlands, led to him and Ethan A Hitchcock forcing General Land Office Commissioner Binger Hermann from office, in November 1902 Special prosecutor Francis J Heney obtained 146 indictments in the Oregon Land Office bribery ring [125] Roosevelt also prosecuted 44 postal employees on charges of bribery and fraud [126] Historians agree he moved \"quickly and decisively\" to address misconduct in his administration [127]\n\n\nRailroads\nMerchants complained that some railroad rates were too high In the 1906 Hepburn Act, Roosevelt sought to give the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to regulate rates, but the Senate, led by conservative Nelson Aldrich, resisted Roosevelt worked with Democratic Senator Benjamin Tillman to pass the bill They ultimately reached a compromise that gave the ICC the power to replace existing rates with \"just-and-reasonable\" maximum rates, allowing railroads to appeal to federal courts on what was \"reasonable\" [128] [129] The Hepburn Act also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and other aspects of railroad operations [130]\n\n\nPure food and drugs\nRoosevelt responded to public outrage over abuses in the food packing industry by pushing Congress to pass the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 and the Pure Food and Drug Act Conservatives initially opposed the bill, but Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, published in 1906, galvanized support for reform [131] The Meat Inspection Act banned misleading labels and preservatives with harmful chemicals The Pure Food and Drug Act banned impure or falsely labeled food and drugs from being made, sold, and shipped Roosevelt served as honorary president of the American School Hygiene Association from 1907 to 1908 and convened the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children in 1909 [132]\n\n\nConservation\nRoosevelt was proudest of his work in conserving natural resources and extending federal protection to land and wildlife [133] He worked closely with Interior Secretary James Rudolph Garfield and Chief of the United States Forest Service Gifford Pinchot to enact a series of conservation programs that met resistance from Western Congress members, such as Charles William Fulton [134] Nonetheless, Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service, signed the creation of five National Parks, and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act, under which he proclaimed 18 new U.S National Monuments He also established the first 51 bird reserves, four game preserves, and 150 National Forests The area of the United States he placed under public protection totals approximately 230 million acres (930,000 square kilometers) [135] Roosevelt was the first honorary member of the Camp-Fire Club of America [136]\n\n\nBusiness panic of 1907\nIn 1907, Roosevelt faced the greatest domestic economic crisis since the Panic of 1893 Wall Street's stock market entered a slump in early 1907, and many investors blamed Roosevelt's regulatory policies for the decline in stock prices [141] Roosevelt ultimately helped calm the crisis by meeting with the leaders of U.S Steel on November 4, 1907, and approving their plan to purchase a Tennessee steel company near bankruptcy—its failure would ruin a major New York bank [142]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe American annexation of Hawaii in 1898 was stimulated in part by fear that Japan would dominate or seize the Hawaiian Republic [145] Similarly, Germany was the alternative to American takeover of the Philippines in 1900, and Tokyo strongly preferred the U.S to take over As the U.S became a naval world power, it needed to find a way to avoid a military confrontation in the Pacific with Japan [146]\n\n\nJapan\nThe American annexation of Hawaii in 1898 was stimulated in part by fear that Japan would dominate or seize the Hawaiian Republic [145] Similarly, Germany was the alternative to American takeover of the Philippines in 1900, and Tokyo strongly preferred the U.S to take over As the U.S became a naval world power, it needed to find a way to avoid a military confrontation in the Pacific with Japan [146]\n\n\nChina\nFollowing the Boxer Rebellion, foreign powers, including the United States, required China to pay indemnities as part of the Boxer protocol In 1908, Roosevelt appropriated these indemnities for the Boxer Indemnity Scholarships, which funded tens of thousands of Chinese students to study in the U.S over the next 40 years [154]: 91 \n\n\nEurope\nSuccess in the war against Spain and the new empire, plus having the largest economy in the world, meant that the United States had emerged as a world power [155] Roosevelt searched for ways to win recognition for the position abroad [156] He also played a major role in mediating the First Moroccan Crisis by calling the Algeciras Conference, which averted war between France and Germany [157]\n\n\nLatin America and the Panama Canal\nAs president, Roosevelt primarily directed the nation's overseas ambitions towards the Caribbean, especially locations that had a bearing on the defense of his pet project, the Panama Canal [161] Roosevelt also increased the size of the navy, and by the end of his second term, the U.S had more battleships than any country other than Britain The Panama Canal, when it opened in 1914, allowed the U.S Navy to rapidly move back and forth from the Pacific to the Caribbean to European waters [162]\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nElection of 1904\nWith the waning of Thomas Platt's power, Roosevelt faced little effective opposition for the 1904 nomination [176] In deference to Mark Hanna's conservative loyalists, Roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to Cornelius Bliss, but he declined Roosevelt turned to his own man, George B Cortelyou of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor To buttress his hold on the party's nomination, Roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing Cortelyou would be considered opposing the President [177] The President secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, Robert R Hitt, was not nominated [178] Senator Charles Warren Fairbanks of Indiana, a favorite of conservatives, gained the nomination [176]\n\n\nSecond term\nAs his second term progressed, Roosevelt moved to the left of his Republican Party base and called for a series of reforms, most of which Congress failed to pass [185] [failed verification – see discussion] Roosevelt's influence waned as he approached the end of his second term, as his promise to forego a third term made him a lame duck and his concentration of power provoked a backlash from many Congressmen [186] He sought a national incorporation law, called for a federal income tax (despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Pollock v Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.), and an inheritance tax Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws) and an eight-hour work day for federal employees In other areas, he also sought a postal savings system (to provide competition for local banks), and he asked for campaign reform laws [187]\n\n\nRhetoric of righteousness\n\nRoosevelt's rhetoric was characterized by an intense moralism of personal righteousness [189] [190] [191] The tone was typified by his denunciation of \"predatory wealth\" in a message he sent Congress in January 1908 calling for passage of new labor laws: \n\nPost-presidency (1909–1919)\nRoosevelt enjoyed being president but believed limited terms provided a check against dictatorship He decided to honor his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term Though he favored Secretary of State Elihu Root as his successor, Root's ill health made him unsuitable New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes was a strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt considered him too independent He settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had been his friend since 1890 and consistently supported Roosevelt's policies [193] Roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice, and wrote to Taft: \"Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials? I will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word!\" Just weeks later, he branded as \"false and malicious\" the charge he was using the offices at his disposal to favor Taft [194] At the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted \"four years more\" of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after Henry Cabot Lodge made it clear Roosevelt was not interested [195]\n\n\nElection of 1908\nRoosevelt enjoyed being president but believed limited terms provided a check against dictatorship He decided to honor his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term Though he favored Secretary of State Elihu Root as his successor, Root's ill health made him unsuitable New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes was a strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt considered him too independent He settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had been his friend since 1890 and consistently supported Roosevelt's policies [193] Roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice, and wrote to Taft: \"Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials?

it took years to mount them all Regarding the large number taken, Roosevelt said, \"I can be condemned only if the existence of the National Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned\" [200] He wrote a detailed account of the trip in African Game Trails [201]\n\n\nRepublican Party schism\nRoosevelt had attempted to refashion Taft into a copy of himself, but recoiled as Taft began to display his individuality He was offended on election night when Taft indicated his success had been possible not just through Roosevelt, but also Taft's half-brother Charles P Taft Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft did not consult him about cabinet appointments [210] Roosevelt and other progressives were ideologically dissatisfied over Taft's conservation policies and his handling of the tariff, when he concentrated power with conservative party leaders in Congress [211] Others have argued that Taft abided by the goals and procedures of the \"Square Deal\" promoted by Roosevelt in his first term The problem was Roosevelt and the more radical progressives had moved on to more aggressive goals, such as curbing the judiciary, which Taft rejected [212]\n\n\nDispute over court power\nRoosevelt gave speeches in the West in the late summer and early fall of 1910 in which he severely criticized the nation's judiciary Roosevelt not only attacked the Supreme Court's 1905 decision in Lochner v New York, he accused federal courts of undermining democracy, branding the suspect jurists \"fossilized judges,\" and compared their tendency to strike down progressive reform legislation, to Justice Roger B Taney's ruling in Dred Scott v Sandford (1857) To ensure the constitution served the public interests, Roosevelt joined other progressives in calling for the \"judicial recall,\" which would enable popular majorities to remove judges from office and reverse unpopular judicial decisions This attack horrified Taft, who, though he privately agreed that Lochner and other decisions had been poorly decided, was an adamant believer in judicial authority preserving constitutional government His horror was shared with other prominent members of the elite legal community, and solidified in Taft's mind that Roosevelt must not be permitted to regain the presidency [214]\n\n\nRoosevelt's \"New Nationalism\"\nIn August 1910, Roosevelt escalated the rivalry with a speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, which was the most radical of his career It marked his public break with Taft and conservative Republicans Advocating a program he called the \"New Nationalism\", Roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and the need to control corporate creation and combination He called for a ban on corporate political contributions [215] Returning to New York, Roosevelt began a battle to take control of the state Republican party from William Barnes Jr. Taft had pledged his support to Roosevelt in this endeavor, and Roosevelt was outraged when Taft's support failed to materialize at the 1910 state convention [216] Roosevelt campaigned for the Republicans in the 1910 elections, in which the Democrats gained control of the House for the first time since 1892 Among the newly elected Democrats was senator Franklin D Roosevelt, who argued he represented his distant cousin's policies better than his Republican opponent [217]\n\n\nBattling Taft over arbitration treaties\nTaft was world leader for arbitration as a guarantee of world peace In 1911 he and Secretary of State Philander C Knox negotiated treaties with Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated Disputes had to be submitted to the Hague Court or another tribunal These were signed in August 1911, but had to be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Senate Neither Taft nor Knox consulted with Senate leaders during negotiations By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft, and the president felt lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat He made speeches supporting the treaties in October, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing them [222]\n\n\nElection of 1912\nIn November 1911, a group of Ohio Republicans endorsed Roosevelt for the party's nomination for president Roosevelt conspicuously declined to refuse a nomination Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, \"I am really sorry for Taft.. I am sure he means well, but he means well feebly, and he does not know how! He is utterly unfit for leadership and this is a time when we need leadership.\" In January 1912, Roosevelt declared \"if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve\" [228] Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms—even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions [229] In reaction to Roosevelt's proposals Taft said, \"Such extremists are not progressives—they are political emotionalists or neurotics\" [230]\n\n\nRepublican primaries and convention\nIn November 1911, a group of Ohio Republicans endorsed Roosevelt for the party's nomination for president Roosevelt conspicuously declined to refuse a nomination Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, \"I am really sorry for Taft.. I am sure he means well, but he means well feebly, and he does not know how! He is utterly unfit for leadership and this is a time when we need leadership.\" In January 1912, Roosevelt declared \"if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve\" [228] Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms—even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions [229] In reaction to Roosevelt's proposals Taft said, \"Such extremists are not progressives—they are political emotionalists or neurotics\" [230]\n\n\nProgressive Party\nOnce his defeat appeared probable, Roosevelt announced he would \"accept the progressive nomination on a progressive platform and I shall fight to the end, win or lose\" Roosevelt prophetically said, \"My feeling is that the Democrats will probably win if they nominate a progressive\" [238] Roosevelt left the Republican Party and created the Progressive Party [239] [240] Leadership of the new party included a range of reformers Jane Addams campaigned vigorously for the party as a breakthrough in social reform [241] Gifford Pinchot represented environmentalists and anti-trust crusaders Publisher Frank Munsey provided cash [242] and George W Perkins, a Wall Street financier came from the efficiency movement He handled the new party's finances efficiently but was distrusted by many reformers [243]\n\n\nAttempted assassination\nOn October 14, 1912, while arriving at a campaign event in Milwaukee, Roosevelt was shot by delusional saloonkeeper John Schrank, who believed the ghost of assassinated president William McKinley had directed him to kill Roosevelt [252] [253] The bullet lodged in Roosevelt's chest after penetrating his eyeglass case and passing through a 50-page folded copy of the speech titled \"Progressive Cause Greater Than Any Individual\" [254] Schrank was disarmed and captured by Roosevelt's stenographer, Elbert E Martin as he attempted to fire a second time, and might have been lynched had Roosevelt not shouted for Schrank to remain unharmed [255] Roosevelt assured the crowd he was all right, then ordered police to take Schrank and make sure no violence was done to him [256]\n\n\nDemocratic victory\nAfter the Democrats nominated Governor Woodrow Wilson, Roosevelt did not expect to win the election, as Wilson had compiled a record attractive to progressive Democrats who might have considered voting for Roosevelt [261] Roosevelt still campaigned vigorously, and the election developed into a two-person contest despite Taft's quiet presence Roosevelt respected Wilson, but they differed on various issues; Wilson opposed federal intervention regarding women's suffrage or child labor, and attacked Roosevelt's tolerance of large businesses [262]\n\n\nSouth American expedition (1913–1914)\nIn 1907 a friend of Roosevelt's, John Augustine Zahm, invited Roosevelt to help plan a research expedition to South America To finance it, Roosevelt obtained support from the American Museum of Natural History in return for promising to bring back new animal specimens Roosevelt's popular book, Through the Brazilian Wilderness [265] describes his expedition into the Brazilian jungle in 1913 as a member of the Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition, co-named after its leader, Brazilian Cândido Rondon.\n\n\nFinal years\nRoosevelt returned to the U.S in May 1914 Though he was outraged by the Wilson Administration's conclusion of a treaty that expressed \"sincere regret\" for the way in which the U.S had acquired the Panama Canal Zone, he was impressed by many reforms passed Roosevelt made campaign appearances for the Progressives, but the 1914 elections were a disaster for the fledgling third party [270] Roosevelt began to envision another campaign for president, this time with himself at the head of the Republican Party, but conservative party leaders remained opposed to Roosevelt [271] In hopes of engineering a joint nomination, the Progressives scheduled the 1916 Progressive National Convention at the same time as the 1916 Republican National Convention When the Republicans nominated Charles Evans Hughes, Roosevelt declined the Progressive nomination and urged his Progressive followers to support the Republican candidate [272] Though Roosevelt had long disliked Hughes, he disliked Wilson even more, and campaigned energetically for the Republican nominee However, Wilson won the 1916 election by a narrow margin [273] The Progressives disappeared as a party, and Roosevelt and many of his followers re-joined the Republican Party [274]\n\n\nWorld War I\nWhen the First World War began in 1914, Roosevelt strongly supported the Allies and demanded a harsher policy against Germany, especially regarding submarine warfare Roosevelt angrily denounced the foreign policy of Wilson, calling it a failure regarding the atrocities in Belgium and the violations of American rights [275] In 1916, while campaigning for Hughes, Roosevelt repeatedly denounced Irish Americans and German Americans whom he described as unpatriotic; he insisted that one had to be 100% American, not a \"hyphenated American\" who juggled multiple loyalties In March 1917, Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise a maximum of four divisions similar to the Rough Riders [276] [277] However, President Wilson announced to the press that he would not send Roosevelt and his volunteers to France, but instead an American Expeditionary Force under the command of General John J Pershing [278] Roosevelt never forgave Wilson, and published The Foes of Our Own Household, an indictment of the sitting president [279] [280] [281] Roosevelt's youngest son, Quentin, a pilot with the American forces in France, was killed when shot down behind German lines on July 14, 1918, aged 20 Roosevelt never recovered from his loss [282]\n\n\nLeague of Nations\nRoosevelt was an early supporter of the modern view that there needs to be a global order In his Nobel prize address of 1910, he said, \"it would be a master stroke if those great Powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace, not only to keep the peace among themselves, but to prevent, by force if necessary, its being broken by others.\" [283] It would have executive power such as the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 lacked He called for American participation.\n\n\nFinal political activities\nRoosevelt's attacks on Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections of 1918 He declined a request from New York Republicans to run for another gubernatorial term, but attacked Wilson's Fourteen Points, calling instead for the unconditional surrender of Germany Though his health was uncertain, he was seen as a leading contender for the 1920 Republican nomination, but insisted that, \"If they take me, they'll have to take me without a single modification of the things that I have always stood for!\" [290] He wrote William Allen White, \"I wish to do everything in my power to make the Republican Party the Party of sane, constructive radicalism, just as it was under Lincoln.\" Accordingly, he told the 1918 state convention of the Maine Republican Party that he stood for old-age pensions, insurance for sickness and unemployment, construction of public housing for low-income families, the reduction of working hours, aid to farmers, and more regulation of large corporations [290]\n\n\nDeath\nOn the night of January 5, 1919, Roosevelt suffered breathing problems After receiving treatment from his physician, George W Faller, he felt better and went to bed Roosevelt's last words were either \"Please put out that light, James\" [292] or \"James, will you please put out the light.\", [293] [294] said to his family servant James E Amos Between 4:00 and 4:15 the next morning, Roosevelt died at the age of 60 in his sleep at Sagamore Hill of a pulmonary embolism [292]\n\n\nWriter\nRoosevelt was a prolific author, writing with passion on subjects ranging from foreign policy to the importance of the national park system Roosevelt was also an avid reader of poetry Poet Robert Frost said that Roosevelt \"was our kind He quoted poetry to me He knew poetry.\" [299]\n\n\nCharacter and beliefs\nBritish scholar Marcus Cunliffe evaluates the liberal argument that Roosevelt was an opportunist, exhibitionist, and imperialist Cunliffe praises Roosevelt's versatility, his respect for law, and his sincerity He argues that Roosevelt's foreign policy was better than his detractors allege Cunliffe calls him \"a big man in several respects\" [305]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nWhen he assumed the presidency, Roosevelt reassured many conservatives, stating that \"the mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance.\" [322] The following year, Roosevelt asserted the president's independence from business interests by opposing the merger which created the Northern Securities Company, and many were surprised that any president, much less an unelected one, would challenge powerful banker J.P Morgan [323] In his last two years as president, Roosevelt became increasingly distrustful of big business, despite its close ties to the Republican Party [324] Roosevelt sought to replace the 19th-century laissez-faire economic environment with a new economic model which included a larger regulatory role for the federal government He believed that 19th-century entrepreneurs had risked their fortunes on innovations and new businesses, and that these capitalists had been rightly rewarded By contrast, he believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and, given the lack of risk, unjust, economic rewards Without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class, Roosevelt feared that the country would turn to radicals or fall to revolution [325] His Square Deal domestic program had three main goals: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection  The Square Deal evolved into his program of \"New Nationalism\", which emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions [215]\n\n\nForeign policy beliefs\nIn the analysis by Henry Kissinger, Roosevelt was the first president to develop the guideline that it was the duty of the United States to make its enormous power and potential influence felt globally The idea of being a passive \"city on the hill\" model that others could look up to, he rejected Roosevelt, trained in biology, was a social Darwinist who believed in survival of the fittest The international world in his view was a realm of violence and conflict The United States had all the economic and geographical potential to be the fittest nation on the globe [326] The United States had a duty to act decisively For example, in terms of the Monroe Doctrine, the United States had to prevent European incursions in the Western Hemisphere But there was more, as he expressed in his Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine: the U.S had to be the policeman of the region because unruly, corrupt smaller nations had to be controlled, and if United States did not do it, European powers would in fact intervene and develop their own base of power in the hemisphere in contravention to the Monroe Doctrine [327]\n\n\nLegacy\nHistorians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by placing the \"bully pulpit\" of the presidency at center stage and emphasizing character as much as issues His accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism He is a hero to liberals and progressives for his early proposals that foreshadowed the modern welfare state, including federal taxation, labor reforms, and more direct democracy Conservationists admire Roosevelt for prioritizing the environment and selflessness towards future generations Conservatives and nationalists respect his commitment to law and order, civic duty, and military values Dalton states, \"Today he is heralded as the architect of the modern presidency, as a world leader who boldly reshaped the office to meet the needs of the new century.\" [331]\n\n\nPersona and masculinity\nDalton says Roosevelt is remembered as \"one of the most picturesque personalities who has ever enlivened the landscape\" [334] His friend, historian Henry Adams, proclaimed: \"Roosevelt, more than any other man.. showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter—the quality that medieval theology assigned to God—he was pure act\" [335] Cooper compared him with Woodrow Wilson, highlighting their roles as warrior and priest [336] Dalton stressed Roosevelt's strenuous life [337] Brands calls Roosevelt \"the last romantic\", viewing his romantic notion of life as emerging from his belief in physical bravery as the highest virtue [338] Henry F Pringle, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Theodore Roosevelt (1931), stated the \"Roosevelt of later years was the most adolescent of men.\" [339]\n\n\nMemorials and cultural depictions\nRoosevelt was included with Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln at the Mount Rushmore Memorial, designed in 1927 [348] [349]\n\n\nAudiovisual media\nRoosevelt was one of the first presidents whose voice was recorded for posterity Several of his recorded speeches survive [370] A 1912 voice recording of The Right of the People to Rule, [371] which preserves Roosevelt's lower timbre ranges particularly well for its time, is available from the Michigan State University libraries The audio clip sponsored by the Authentic History Center includes his defense [372] of the Progressive Party in 1912, wherein he proclaims it the \"party of the people\" – in contrast with the other major parties.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nOrganizations\n\n\nLibraries and collections\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

For example, places rich in oil and gas tend to have high GDP-per-capita figures. However, it is increasingly being recognized that tax havens, or corporate tax havens, have distorted economic data, producing artificially high, or inflated, GDP-per-capita figures. It is estimated that over 15 percent of global jurisdictions are tax havens.

departure from the 49ers in 2016, Kaepernick went unsigned through the off-season and 2017 training camps, leading to allegations that he was being blackballed because of his on-field political

play.\" [112] The Baltimore Ravens considered signing Kaepernick as a backup to starting quarterback Joe Flacco before the 2017 season According to former Raven Ray Lewis, the team did not go through with this after Kaepernick's girlfriend made comparisons of Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti to a slave owner, and Lewis his slave, in a tweet; [113] [114] Bisciotti reportedly believed the signing would result in heavy backlash and criticism from the general public, [115] a claim that was refuted by the team [116] By August 2017, the statistics website FiveThirtyEight concluded that \"it's obvious Kaepernick is being frozen out for his political opinions\", calling it \"extraordinary.. that a player like him can't find a team\", based on the observation that \"no above-average quarterback has been unemployed nearly as long as Kaepernick this offseason\" [9]\nThe Seahawks set up another visit and workout with him in April 2018, but the team postponed it indefinitely after he would not say whether he would continue his national anthem protest or not [117]\n\n\nNFL career statistics\nLeading up to the 2016 season, Kaepernick was active in July on social media with social commentary on

than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder\", referencing a series of African-American deaths caused by law enforcement that led to the Black Lives Matter movement and adding that he would continue to protest until he feels like \" [the American flag] represents what
