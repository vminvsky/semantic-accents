Vikrant explains that if they divert to Trivandrum, they can attempt a landing there and save fuel, but Tanya is not convinced.\n\nDue to miscommunication, the pilots do not realize that Trivandrum is facing weather worse than Cochin, which reduces the visibility level.

Fleming, née Rose, and his father was Valentine Fleming, the Member of Parliament for Henley from 1910 to 1917 [3] [4] As an infant he briefly lived with his family at Braziers Park in Oxfordshire [5] Fleming was a grandson of the Scottish financier Robert Fleming, who co-founded the Scottish American Investment Company and the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co [1] [a]\n\n\nBirth and family\nIan Lancaster Fleming was born on 28 May 1908, at 27 Green Street in the wealthy London district of Mayfair [1] [2] His mother was Evelyn \"Eve\" Fleming, née Rose, and his father was Valentine Fleming, the Member of Parliament for Henley from 1910 to 1917 [3] [4] As an infant he briefly lived with his family at Braziers Park in Oxfordshire [5] Fleming was a grandson of the Scottish financier Robert Fleming, who co-founded the Scottish American Investment Company and the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co [1] [a]\n\n\nEducation and early life\nIn 1914 Fleming attended Durnford School, a preparatory school on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset [13] [b] He did not enjoy his time at Durnford; he suffered unpalatable food, physical hardship and bullying [13]\n\n\nSecond World War\nIn May 1939 Fleming was recruited by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, Director of Naval Intelligence of the Royal Navy, to become his personal assistant He joined the organisation full-time in August 1939, [31] with the codename \"17F\", [32] and worked out of Room 39 at the Admiralty, now known as the Ripley Building [33] Fleming's biographer, Andrew Lycett, notes that Fleming had \"no obvious qualifications\" for the role [1] As part of his appointment, Fleming was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in July 1939, [31] initially as lieutenant, [33] but was promoted to lieutenant commander a few months later [34]\n\n\n30 Assault Unit\nIn 1942 Fleming formed a unit of commandos, known as No 30 Commando or 30 Assault Unit (30AU), composed of specialist intelligence troops [47] 30AU's job was to be near the front line of an advance—sometimes in front of it—to seize enemy documents from previously targeted headquarters [48] The unit was based on a German group headed by Otto Skorzeny, who had undertaken similar activities in the Battle of Crete in May 1941 [49] The German unit was thought by Fleming to be \"one of the most outstanding innovations in German intelligence\" [50]\n\n\nT-Force\nThe success of 30AU led to the August 1944 decision to establish a \"Target Force\", which became known as T-Force The official memorandum, held at The National Archives in London, describes the unit's primary role: \"T-Force = Target Force, to guard and secure documents, persons, equipment, with combat and Intelligence personnel, after capture of large towns, ports etc in liberated and enemy territory.\" [61]\n\n\nPost-war\nUpon Fleming's demobilisation in May 1945, he became the foreign manager in the Kemsley newspaper group, which at the time owned The Sunday Times In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents His contract allowed him to take three months' holiday every winter, which he took in Jamaica [1] Fleming worked full-time for the paper until December 1959, [73] but continued to write articles and attend the Tuesday weekly meetings until at least 1961 [74] [75]\n\n\n1950s\nThe scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning Then the soul erosion produced by high gambling—a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension—becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it.\n\n\n1960s\nIn 1960 Fleming was commissioned by the Kuwait Oil Company to write a book on the country and its oil industry The Kuwaiti government disapproved of the typescript, State of Excitement: Impressions of Kuwait, and it was never published According to Fleming: \"The Oil Company expressed approval of the book but felt it their duty to submit the typescript to members of the Kuwait Government for their approval The Sheikhs concerned found unpalatable certain mild comments and criticisms and particularly the passages referring to the adventurous past of the country which now wishes to be 'civilised' in every respect and forget its romantic origins.\" [115]\n\n\nDeath\nFleming was a heavy smoker and drinker throughout his adult life, and suffered from heart disease [d] In 1961, aged 53, he suffered a heart attack and struggled to recuperate [141] On 11 August 1964, while staying at a hotel in Canterbury, Fleming went to the Royal St George's Golf Club for lunch and later dined at his hotel with friends The day had been tiring for him, and he collapsed with another heart attack shortly after the meal [141] Fleming died at age 56 at Kent and Canterbury Hospital in the early morning of 12 August 1964—his son Caspar's 12th birthday [142] [143] His last recorded words were an apology to the ambulance drivers for having inconvenienced them, [144] saying \"I am sorry to trouble you chaps I don't know how you get along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days.\" [145] Fleming was buried in the churchyard of Sevenhampton, near Swindon [146] His will was proved on 4 November, with his estate valued at £302,147 (equivalent to £7,733,951 in 2023 [147]) [148]\n\n\nWriting\nThe author Raymond Benson, who later wrote a series of Bond novels, noted that Fleming's books fall into two stylistic periods Those books written between 1953 and 1960 tend to concentrate on \"mood, character development, and plot advancement\", while those released between 1961 and 1966 incorporate more detail and imagery Benson argues that Fleming had become \"a master storyteller\" by the time he wrote Thunderball in 1961 [154]\n\n\nStyle and technique\nFleming said of his work, \"while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as 'thrillers designed to be read as literature'\" [160] He named Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Eric Ambler and Graham Greene as influences [161] William Cook in the New Statesman considered James Bond to be \"the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature As a boy, Fleming devoured the Bulldog Drummond tales of Lieutenant Colonel H C McNeile (aka \"Sapper\") and the Richard Hannay stories of John Buchan His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain .. In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age.\" [98] Umberto Eco considered Mickey Spillane to have been another major influence [162]\n\n\nMajor themes\nThe Bond books were written in post-war Britain, when the country was still an imperial power [173] As the series progressed, the British Empire was in decline; journalist William Cook observed that \"Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight.\" [98] This decline of British power was referred to in several of the novels; in From Russia, with Love, it manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim, when Bond admits that in England, \"we don't show teeth any more—only gums.\" [174] [175] The theme is strongest in one of the later books of the series, the 1964 novel You Only Live Twice, in conversations between Bond and the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, Tiger Tanaka Fleming was acutely aware of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire \"with both hands\" [175] [176] [177]\n\n\nBritain's position in the world\nThe Bond books were written in post-war Britain, when the country was still an imperial power [173] As the series progressed, the British Empire was in decline; journalist William Cook observed that \"Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight.\" [98] This decline of British power was referred to in several of the novels; in From Russia, with Love, it manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim, when Bond admits that in England, \"we don't show teeth any more—only gums.\" [174] [175] The theme is strongest in one of the later books of the series, the 1964 novel You Only Live Twice, in conversations between Bond and the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, Tiger Tanaka Fleming was acutely aware of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire \"with both hands\" [175] [176] [177]\n\n\nEffects of the war\nA theme throughout the series was the effect of the Second World War [187] The Times journalist Ben Macintyre considers that Bond was \"the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power\", [188] at a time when coal and many items of food were still rationed [98] Fleming often used the war as a signal to establish good or evil in characters: [104] [189] in For Your Eyes Only, the villain, Hammerstein, is a former Gestapo officer, while the sympathetic Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, Colonel Johns, served with the British under Montgomery in the Eighth Army [190] Similarly, in Moonraker, Drax (Graf Hugo von der Drache) is a \"megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman\", [191] and his assistant, Krebs, bears the same name as Hitler's last Chief of Staff [104] In this, Fleming \"exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press.\" [191] As the series progressed, the threat of a re-emergent Germany was overtaken by concerns about the Cold War, and the novels changed their focus accordingly [192]\n\n\nComradeship\nPeriodically in the series, the topic of comradeship or friendship arises, with a male ally who works with Bond on his mission [193] Raymond Benson believes that the relationships Bond has with his allies \"add another dimension to Bond's character, and ultimately, to the thematic continuity of the novels\" [194] In Live and Let Die, agents Quarrel and Leiter represent the importance of male friends and allies, seen especially in Bond's response to the shark attack on Leiter; Benson observes that \"the loyalty Bond feels towards his friends is as strong as his commitment to his job\" [195] In Dr No, Quarrel is \"an indispensable ally\" [196] Benson sees no evidence of discrimination in their relationship [197] and notes Bond's genuine remorse and sadness at Quarrel's death [198]\n\n\nThe \"traitor within\"\nFrom the opening novel in the series, the theme of treachery was strong Bond's target in Casino Royale, Le Chiffre, was the paymaster of a French communist trade union, and the overtones of a fifth column struck a chord with the largely British readership, as Communist influence in the trade unions had been an issue in the press and parliament, [199] especially after the defections of Burgess and Maclean in 1951 [183] The \"traitor within\" theme continued in Live and Let Die and Moonraker [200]\n\n\nGood versus evil\nRaymond Benson considered the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil [193] This crystallised in Goldfinger with the Saint George motif, which is stated explicitly in the book: [117] \"Bond sighed wearily Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time, it really was St George and the dragon And St George had better get a move on and do something\"; [201] Black notes that the image of St George is an English, rather than British personification [202]\n\n\nAnglo-American relations\nThe Bond novels also dealt with the question of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West [203] In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not focus on this directly, instead creating \"an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action\" [187] Author and journalist Christopher Hitchens observed that \"the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans\" [204] Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but did not focus on it strongly [187] Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, pointed out that \"Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization .. he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he\" [205]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn the late 1950s, the author Geoffrey Jenkins had suggested to Fleming that he write a Bond novel set in South Africa, and sent him his own idea for a plot outline which, according to Jenkins, Fleming felt had great potential [210] After Fleming's death, Jenkins was commissioned by Bond publishers Glidrose Productions to write a continuation Bond novel, Per Fine Ounce, but it was never published [211] Starting with Kingsley Amis's Colonel Sun, under the pseudonym \"Robert Markham\" in 1968, [212] several authors have been commissioned to write Bond novels, including Sebastian Faulks, who was asked by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel in observance of what would have been Fleming's 100th birthday in 2008 [213]\n\n\nWorks\n\n\n\nBiographical films\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Ian Fleming**\n\nIan Lancaster Fleming was a British author, journalist, and naval intelligence officer who is best known for creating the fictional character James Bond, a British secret agent. Born on 28 May 1908, Fleming was the eldest son of Valentine Fleming, a Member of Parliament, and his wife, Evelyn Rose Fleming. He was educated at Eton College and later attended the Royal Military College at Sandhurst.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nFleming's early life was marked by tragedy when his father, Valentine, died in 1917 due to complications from the Spanish flu. His mother, Evelyn, moved the family to various locations, including Braziers Park in Oxfordshire, where Fleming spent his early childhood. Fleming's grandfather, Robert Fleming, was a wealthy financier who co-founded the Scottish American Investment Company and the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co.\n\nIn 1914, Fleming attended Durnford School, a preparatory school on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset. However, he did not enjoy his time at Durnford, citing unpalatable food, physical hardship, and bullying as reasons for his dissatisfaction. In 1923, Fleming began his education at Eton College, where he excelled in sports and developed a passion for writing.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter completing his education, Fleming worked as a journalist for the Reuters news agency and later for the City Magazine. In 1939, he joined the British naval intelligence division, where he worked under the codename \"17F.\" Fleming's role involved gathering intelligence and providing information to the British government. During his time in naval intelligence, Fleming was commissioned as a lieutenant and later promoted to lieutenant commander.\n\nIn 1942, Fleming formed a unit of commandos known as No 30 Commando or 30 Assault Unit (30AU). The unit's primary goal was to seize enemy documents and equipment from previously targeted headquarters. Fleming's experiences in 30AU would later influence his writing, particularly in the James Bond series.\n\n**Writing Career**\n\nFleming's writing career began in the 1950s, when he started writing fiction. His first novel, Casino Royale, was published in 1953 and introduced the character James Bond, a British secret agent. The novel was a success, and Fleming went on to write 11 more Bond novels, including From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and Thunderball.\n\nFleming's writing style was characterized by his use of vivid descriptions, complex plots, and memorable characters. His novels often explored themes of good versus evil, loyalty, and the consequences of war. Fleming's writing was influenced by his experiences in naval intelligence and his love of adventure stories.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nFleming married Ann Charteris, a former wife of Lord Charteris, in 1952. The couple had one son, Caspar, who was born in 1952. Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker throughout his adult life, which took a toll on his health. In 1961, Fleming suffered a heart attack and was forced to retire from writing.\n\nFleming died on 12 August 1964, at the age of 56, due to complications from a heart attack. His final words were an apology to the ambulance drivers for having inconvenienced them. Fleming was buried in the churchyard of Sevenhampton, near Swindon.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIan Fleming's legacy is that of a prolific author and intelligence officer who created one of the most iconic characters in literature. James Bond has been portrayed by numerous actors, including Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Daniel Craig, and has been adapted into numerous films, television shows, and other media. Fleming's writing continues to be widely read and admired, and his influence can be seen in many other authors and writers.\n\n**Themes and Motifs**\n\nFleming's novels often explored themes of good versus evil, loyalty, and the consequences of war.

about \"Ian_Fleming\" following this outline:\n\n\nBiography\nIan Lancaster Fleming was born on 28 May 1908, at 27 Green Street in the wealthy London district of Mayfair [1] [2] His mother was Evelyn \"Eve\" Fleming, née Rose, and his father was Valentine Fleming, the Member of Parliament for Henley from 1910 to 1917 [3] [4] As an infant he briefly lived with his family at Braziers Park in Oxfordshire [5] Fleming was a grandson of the Scottish financier Robert Fleming, who co-founded the Scottish American Investment Company and the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co [1] [a]\n\n\nBirth and family\nIan Lancaster Fleming was born on 28 May 1908, at 27 Green Street in the wealthy London district of Mayfair [1] [2] His mother was Evelyn \"Eve\" Fleming, née Rose, and his father was Valentine Fleming, the Member of Parliament for Henley from 1910 to 1917 [3] [4] As an infant he briefly lived with his family at Braziers Park in Oxfordshire [5] Fleming was a grandson of the Scottish financier Robert Fleming, who co-founded the Scottish American Investment Company and the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co [1] [a]\n\n\nEducation and early life\nIn 1914 Fleming attended Durnford School, a preparatory school on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset [13] [b] He did not enjoy his time at Durnford; he suffered unpalatable food, physical hardship and bullying [13]\n\n\nSecond World War\nIn May 1939 Fleming was recruited by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, Director of Naval Intelligence of the Royal Navy, to become his personal assistant He joined the organisation full-time in August 1939, [31] with the codename \"17F\", [32] and worked out of Room 39 at the Admiralty, now known as the Ripley Building [33] Fleming's biographer, Andrew Lycett, notes that Fleming had \"no obvious qualifications\" for the role [1] As part of his appointment, Fleming was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in July 1939, [31] initially as lieutenant, [33] but was promoted to lieutenant commander a few months later [34]\n\n\n30 Assault Unit\nIn 1942 Fleming formed a unit of commandos, known as No 30 Commando or 30 Assault Unit (30AU), composed of specialist intelligence troops [47] 30AU's job was to be near the front line of an advance—sometimes in front of it—to seize enemy documents from previously targeted headquarters [48] The unit was based on a German group headed by Otto Skorzeny, who had undertaken similar activities in the Battle of Crete in May 1941 [49] The German unit was thought by Fleming to be \"one of the most outstanding innovations in German intelligence\" [50]\n\n\nT-Force\nThe success of 30AU led to the August 1944 decision to establish a \"Target Force\", which became known as T-Force The official memorandum, held at The National Archives in London, describes the unit's primary role: \"T-Force = Target Force, to guard and secure documents, persons, equipment, with combat and Intelligence personnel, after capture of large towns, ports etc in liberated and enemy territory.\" [61]\n\n\nPost-war\nUpon Fleming's demobilisation in May 1945, he became the foreign manager in the Kemsley newspaper group, which at the time owned The Sunday Times In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents His contract allowed him to take three months' holiday every winter, which he took in Jamaica [1] Fleming worked full-time for the paper until December 1959, [73] but continued to write articles and attend the Tuesday weekly meetings until at least 1961 [74] [75]\n\n\n1950s\nThe scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning Then the soul erosion produced by high gambling—a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension—becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it.\n\n\n1960s\nIn 1960 Fleming was commissioned by the Kuwait Oil Company to write a book on the country and its oil industry The Kuwaiti government disapproved of the typescript, State of Excitement: Impressions of Kuwait, and it was never published According to Fleming: \"The Oil Company expressed approval of the book but felt it their duty to submit the typescript to members of the Kuwait Government for their approval The Sheikhs concerned found unpalatable certain mild comments and criticisms and particularly the passages referring to the adventurous past of the country which now wishes to be 'civilised' in every respect and forget its romantic origins.\" [115]\n\n\nDeath\nFleming was a heavy smoker and drinker throughout his adult life, and suffered from heart disease [d] In 1961, aged 53, he suffered a heart attack and struggled to recuperate [141] On 11 August 1964, while staying at a hotel in Canterbury, Fleming went to the Royal St George's Golf Club for lunch and later dined at his hotel with friends The day had been tiring for him, and he collapsed with another heart attack shortly after the meal [141] Fleming died at age 56 at Kent and Canterbury Hospital in the early morning of 12 August 1964—his son Caspar's 12th birthday [142] [143] His last recorded words were an apology to the ambulance drivers for having inconvenienced them, [144] saying \"I am sorry to trouble you chaps I don't know how you get along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days.\" [145] Fleming was buried in the churchyard of Sevenhampton, near Swindon [146] His will was proved on 4 November, with his estate valued at £302,147 (equivalent to £7,733,951 in 2023 [147]) [148]\n\n\nWriting\nThe author Raymond Benson, who later wrote a series of Bond novels, noted that Fleming's books fall into two stylistic periods Those books written between 1953 and 1960 tend to concentrate on \"mood, character development, and plot advancement\", while those released between 1961 and 1966 incorporate more detail and imagery Benson argues that Fleming had become \"a master storyteller\" by the time he wrote Thunderball in 1961 [154]\n\n\nStyle and technique\nFleming said of his work, \"while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as 'thrillers designed to be read as literature'\" [160] He named Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Eric Ambler and Graham Greene as influences [161] William Cook in the New Statesman considered James Bond to be \"the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature As a boy, Fleming devoured the Bulldog Drummond tales of Lieutenant Colonel H C McNeile (aka \"Sapper\") and the Richard Hannay stories of John Buchan His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain .. In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age.\" [98] Umberto Eco considered Mickey Spillane to have been another major influence [162]\n\n\nMajor themes\nThe Bond books were written in post-war Britain, when the country was still an imperial power [173] As the series progressed, the British Empire was in decline; journalist William Cook observed that \"Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight.\" [98] This decline of British power was referred to in several of the novels; in From Russia, with Love, it manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim, when Bond admits that in England, \"we don't show teeth any more—only gums.\" [174] [175] The theme is strongest in one of the later books of the series, the 1964 novel You Only Live Twice, in conversations between Bond and the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, Tiger Tanaka Fleming was acutely aware of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire \"with both hands\" [175] [176] [177]\n\n\nBritain's position in the world\nThe Bond books were written in post-war Britain, when the country was still an imperial power [173] As the series progressed, the British Empire was in decline; journalist William Cook observed that \"Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight.\" [98] This decline of British power was referred to in several of the novels; in From Russia, with Love, it manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim, when Bond admits that in England, \"we don't show teeth any more—only gums.\" [174] [175] The theme is strongest in one of the later books of the series, the 1964 novel You Only Live Twice, in conversations between Bond and the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, Tiger Tanaka Fleming was acutely aware of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire \"with both hands\" [175] [176] [177]\n\n\nEffects of the war\nA theme throughout the series was the effect of the Second World War [187] The Times journalist Ben Macintyre considers that Bond was \"the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power\", [188] at a time when coal and many items of food were still rationed [98] Fleming often used the war as a signal to establish good or evil in characters: [104] [189] in For Your Eyes Only, the villain, Hammerstein, is a former Gestapo officer, while the sympathetic Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, Colonel Johns, served with the British under Montgomery in the Eighth Army [190] Similarly, in Moonraker, Drax (Graf Hugo von der Drache) is a \"megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman\", [191] and his assistant, Krebs, bears the same name as Hitler's last Chief of Staff [104] In this, Fleming \"exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press.\" [191] As the series progressed, the threat of a re-emergent Germany was overtaken by concerns about the Cold War, and the novels changed their focus accordingly [192]\n\n\nComradeship\nPeriodically in the series, the topic of comradeship or friendship arises, with a male ally who works with Bond on his mission [193] Raymond Benson believes that the relationships Bond has with his allies \"add another dimension to Bond's character, and ultimately, to the thematic continuity of the novels\" [194] In Live and Let Die, agents Quarrel and Leiter represent the importance of male friends and allies, seen especially in Bond's response to the shark attack on Leiter; Benson observes that \"the loyalty Bond feels towards his friends is as strong as his commitment to his job\" [195] In Dr No, Quarrel is \"an indispensable ally\" [196] Benson sees no evidence of discrimination in their relationship [197] and notes Bond's genuine remorse and sadness at Quarrel's death [198]\n\n\nThe \"traitor within\"\nFrom the opening novel in the series, the theme of treachery was strong Bond's target in Casino Royale, Le Chiffre, was the paymaster of a French communist trade union, and the overtones of a fifth column struck a chord with the largely British readership, as Communist influence in the trade unions had been an issue in the press and parliament, [199] especially after the defections of Burgess and Maclean in 1951 [183] The \"traitor within\" theme continued in Live and Let Die and Moonraker [200]\n\n\nGood versus evil\nRaymond Benson considered the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil [193] This crystallised in Goldfinger with the Saint George motif, which is stated explicitly in the book: [117] \"Bond sighed wearily Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time, it really was St George and the dragon And St George had better get a move on and do something\"; [201] Black notes that the image of St George is an English, rather than British personification [202]\n\n\nAnglo-American relations\nThe Bond novels also dealt with the question of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West [203] In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not focus on this directly, instead creating \"an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action\" [187] Author and journalist Christopher Hitchens observed that \"the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans\" [204] Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but did not focus on it strongly [187] Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, pointed out that \"Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization .. he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he\" [205]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn the late 1950s, the author Geoffrey Jenkins had suggested to Fleming that he write a Bond novel set in South Africa, and sent him his own idea for a plot outline which, according to Jenkins, Fleming felt had great potential [210] After Fleming's death, Jenkins was commissioned by Bond publishers Glidrose Productions to write a continuation Bond novel, Per Fine Ounce, but it was never published [211] Starting with Kingsley Amis's Colonel Sun, under the pseudonym \"Robert Markham\" in 1968, [212] several authors have been commissioned to write Bond novels, including Sebastian Faulks, who was asked by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel in observance of what would have been Fleming's 100th birthday in 2008 [213]\n\n\nWorks\n\n\n\nBiographical films\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was nominated by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate on January 31, 2006.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nSamuel Alito was born on April 1, 1950, in Trenton, New Jersey, to Samuel A. Alito Sr. and Rose Fradusco. His father was a Calabrian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and his mother was an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata. Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher.\n\nAlito grew up in a devout Catholic family and was raised with strong moral principles. He attended St. Charles Borromeo Elementary School and later graduated from Princeton High School. He then attended Princeton University, where he graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1972. Alito was a member of the Princeton Debate Panel and was active in the Princeton Republican Club. After graduating from Princeton, Alito attended Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1975.\n\nEarly legal career\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I. Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977. He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired. Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey. There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry. While an Assistant U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime.\n\nCourt of Appeals judge\n\nThird Circuit Judges Leonard I. Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H.W. Bush. On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990, and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nNomination and confirmation\n\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor. President George W. Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor. Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\nTenure\n\nAlito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in Holmes v. South Carolina, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion; this practice is designed to help \"break in\" new justices so that each justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt. Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in Zedner v. United States, Woodford v. Ngo, and Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy.\n\nAbortion jurisprudence\n\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart. The Court had previously ruled in Stenberg v. Carhart that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after Stenberg, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in Roe) and O'Connor (a supporter of Roe) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in Gonzales v. Carhart was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the Stenberg case.\n\nFree speech jurisprudence\n\nAlito has also dissented from the opinions of the Court's conservative justices on free speech cases, one of which, Snyder v. Phelps, had to do with Westboro Baptist Church members' right to protest a military funeral. Alito offered the sole dissenting opinion, saying protesters \"were sued under a very well-established tort that goes back to the 19th century, the intentional infliction of emotional, of severe emotional distress. And I thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the First Amendment, but my colleagues disagreed about that.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1985, Alito married Martha-Ann Bomgardner, a law librarian who met him during his trips to the library as a law clerk. They have two adult children, Laura and Philip; Martha-Ann left her profession to raise them. Alito resided with his family in West Caldwell, New Jersey, before his Supreme Court nomination. He has since moved to Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nTeaching\n\nAs an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school's Saint Thomas More Medal \"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law.\" On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law's commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.\n\nEthical questions\n\nOn June 20, 2023, ProPublica published an investigation of Alito's relationship with billionaire businessman Paul Singer, focusing on a trip Alito and Singer took to a luxury fishing resort in Alaska and suggesting Alito \"violated a federal law that requires justices to disclose most gifts\", such as private jet travel. The article said he should have recused himself in cases involving Singer and that he was obligated to disclose certain benefits as gifts on his 2008 Financial Disclosure Report. Legal ethics experts quoted in ProPublica called Alito's behavior \"unacceptable.\"\n\nAccusations of accepting gifts\n\nOn June 20, 2023, ProPublica published an investigation of Alito's relationship with billionaire businessman Paul Singer, focusing on a trip Alito and Singer took to a luxury fishing resort in Alaska and suggesting Alito \"violated a federal law that requires justices to disclose most gifts\", such as private jet travel. The article said he should have recused himself in cases involving Singer and that he was obligated to disclose certain benefits as gifts on his 2008 Financial Disclosure Report. Legal ethics experts quoted in ProPublica called Alito's behavior \"unacceptable.\"\n\nFlag display controversy\n\nOn January 17, 2021, an upside-down American flag was flown outside Alito's residence in Alexandria, Virginia. The upside-down flag, traditionally a signal of distress, was displayed by supporters of former president Donald Trump during the January 6 Capitol attack and by members of the Stop the Steal movement, an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. In the summer of 2023, the Pine Tree Flag was flown at Alito's beach house on Long Beach Island in New Jersey. It was one of the flags used during the American Revolution, and has been used by Christian nationalists; it was also carried during the Capitol attack. The flag displays, reported by The New York Times, caused controversy, including questions about judicial impartiality. During the flag's presence, the Supreme Court was considering the appeal in United States v. Fischer (2023), a case involving the January 6 Capitol attack.\n\nBibliography\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Samuel_Alito\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nAlito was born in Trenton, New Jersey He was the son of Samuel A Alito Sr., a Calabrian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata [3] [4] [5] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984 Alito's mother was a schoolteacher [6]\n\n\nEarly legal career\nAfter graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977 [17] He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired [19] Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey [20] There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division Assistant U.S Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry (Barry, the eldest sister of Donald Trump, later became a federal judge) [21] While an Assistant U.S Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime [22]\n\n\nCourt of Appeals judge\nThird Circuit Judges Leonard I Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H W Bush [21] On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990, [36] [37] and received his commission three days later As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey [17]\n\n\nNomination and confirmation\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor President George W Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\n\nNotable opinions\nDefunct\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor President George W Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\n\nNomination and confirmation\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor President George W Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\n\nTenure\nAlito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in Holmes v South Carolina, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion;

It is a day of great celebration and patriotism in France, and is also observed in many other countries around the world. The holiday has a rich history and is steeped in tradition, and is a time for French people to come together and celebrate their national identity.\n\n# History\nThe French Revolution began in 1789, and was a time of great social and economic upheaval in France. The country was plagued by poverty, inequality, and corruption, and the people were demanding change. The National Assembly, which was formed in 1789, was a group of representatives who were tasked with writing a new constitution for France. On July 14, 1789, a mob stormed the Bastille, a symbol of the absolute monarchy, and the French Revolution was underway.\n\n## The Fête de la Fédération\nAs early as 1789, there were plans to hold a national festival to celebrate the Storming of the Bastille. The first proposal for a festival was made by Clément Gonchon, a French textile worker, who presented his design to the French city administration and the public on December 9, 1789. Other proposals and unofficial celebrations were also held on July 14, 1789, but the official festival sponsored by the National Assembly was called the Fête de la Fédération.\n\n## The Origins of the Current Celebration\nThe modern celebration of Bastille Day began in 1870, when a feast was held in Paris to honor the French Republic. This was followed by another feast in 1879, which included a reception in the Chamber of Deputies and a Republican Feast in the Pré Catelan. From that time on, Bastille Day was celebrated annually in France, with the military parade becoming a central part of the celebrations.\n\n# Bastille Day Military Parade\nThe Bastille Day military parade is a highly anticipated event that takes place every year on July 14 in Paris. The parade is a celebration of French military power and is attended by the President of France, government officials, and foreign ambassadors. The parade passes down the Champs-Élysées from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde, and includes performances by the French military bands and other military units.\n\n## History of the Parade\nThe Bastille Day military parade has a long history, dating back to 1880. For many years, the parade was held in different locations within or near the capital city, but since 1918, it has been held on the Champs-Élysées. During World War II, the parade was held in London, and since 1944, it has been held in Paris once again.\n\n## Participation in the Parade\nThe parade is a showcase of French military power and is attended by many military units and government officials. The parade includes performances by the French military bands, as well as other military units and civilian groups. The parade is a time for the French military to show off their skills and equipment, and is also a time for the French people to come together and celebrate their national identity.\n\n# Bastille Day Celebrations in Other Countries\nBastille Day is celebrated in many countries around the world, including Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, India, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, French Polynesia, United Kingdom, and United States. Each of these countries has its own unique way of celebrating Bastille Day, but they all share a common theme of patriotism and national identity.\n\n## Belgium\nLiège, Belgium, has been celebrating Bastille Day since the end of World War I. The city hosts a fireworks show outside of Congress Hall and also celebrates with a traditional festival dance of the French consul.\n\n## Canada\nVancouver, British Columbia, holds a celebration featuring exhibits, food, and entertainment.

It was held in two rounds, with the first round taking place on 23 April and the second round on 7 May. The election marked a significant shift in the French political landscape, with the election of Emmanuel Macron as the President of France.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe President of the French Republic and French Co-Prince of Andorra is elected to a five-year term in a two-round election under Article 7 of the Constitution: if no candidate secures an absolute majority of votes in the first round, a second round is held two weeks later between the two candidates who received the most votes. In 2017, the first and second rounds were held on 23 April and 7 May.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nOn 18 March 2017, the Constitutional Council published the names of the 11 candidates who received 500 valid sponsorships, with the order of the list determined by drawing lots.\n\n### Sponsorships\n\nA candidate must secure 500 signatures from elected officials in order to appear on the first-round ballot. The signature collection period ended on 17 March. The table below lists sponsorships received by the Constitutional Council by candidate.\n\n### Non-candidates\n\nThe 2017 presidential election was the first in the history of the Fifth Republic in which a sitting president did not seek a second term. On 1 December 2016, incumbent president François Hollande announced he would not seek a second term. His then-Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared on 5 December 2016 that he would run in the Socialist primary on 22 January 2017, but he was defeated by Benoît Hamon in its second round on 29 January.\n\n**Socialist Party (PS)**\n\nAt the 2012 Toulouse Congress, the Socialist Party (PS) modified its statutes to guarantee the selection of a candidate of the left through open primaries. The National Council of the Socialist Party announced the timetable and organization of the primaries at least one year beforehand. On 11 January, Libération published an editorial in favor of a \"primary of the left and ecologists\", and on 9 April the National Council of the Socialist Party unanimously approved the idea of holding such a primary in early December. On 18 June, the National Council finally confirmed that it would organize a primary to select a candidate for the 2017 presidential election.\n\n**Democratic Movement (MoDem)**\n\nFrançois Bayrou, the three-time centrist presidential candidate and leader of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), initially supported the candidacy of Alain Juppé in the primary of the right. However, Fillon's victory in the primary led Bayrou to reconsider lodging a bid for the presidency. On 22 February, he finally announced that he would not run for a fourth time, instead proposing a conditional alliance with Emmanuel Macron, who accepted his offer.\n\n**Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV)**\n\nOn 9 July 2016, Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV) announced that it would hold a primary election before the 2017 presidential election. Those wishing to be nominated required the support of 36 of its \"federal councilors\" out of 240. The vote was open to both party members as well as sympathizers who could register to vote in the primary. The announcement came just days after prominent environmentalist Nicolas Hulot's surprise declaration that he would not offer himself as a presidential candidate on 5 July.\n\n**Primaries**\n\nAfter his loss as the nominee of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in the 2012 presidential election, ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy pledged to return to being a \"Frenchman among the French\". He announced on 19 September 2014 that he would seek the presidency of the party, a position he secured in an online vote on 29 November with the backing of 64.50% of party members. He succeeded the triumvirate of Alain Juppé, François Fillon, and Jean-Pierre Raffarin, which assumed the party's leadership after the resignation of Jean-François Copé.\n\n**The Republicans (LR)**\n\nAfter his loss as the nominee of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in the 2012 presidential election, ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy pledged to return to being a \"Frenchman among the French\".

She collected a monthly salary of €3,900 to €4,600. After her husband's appointment as Minister of Social Affairs in 2002 and during his later tenure as Minister of National Education, she went on to serve until 2007 as a parliamentary aide to Marc Joulaud, Fillon's substitute, earning an increased salary upwards of €7,900 and with still no evidence of substantial work.\n\n**Other incidents**\n\nAfter securing his party's nomination in its presidential primary on 29 January 2017, Socialist Party (PS) dissident Benoît Hamon proposed forming a \"governmental majority\" with Jean-Luc Mélenchon of la France Insoumise (FI) and Yannick Jadot of Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV), seeking to \"reconcile the left and the environmentalists\".

The top two candidates, Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, advanced to the second round. Macron won the election with 24.01% of the vote, followed by Le Pen with 21.53%. The other candidates included Benoît Hamon, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, François Fillon, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, and Jacques Cheminade.\n\n**Debate**\n\nOn 20 March, a debate between François Fillon, Benoît Hamon, Marine Le Pen, Emmanuel Macron, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon took place, hosted by TF1 and moderated by journalists Anne-Claire Coudray and Gilles Bouleau. The debate was the first time that a debate prior to the first round was held.\n\n**Electorate**\n\nThe electorate in the 2017 French presidential election consisted of 46,981,021 eligible voters, who were 18 years old or older. The turnout was 75.04%, with 35,314,743 voters casting a ballot. The most prominent demographics in the electorate were the 18-24-year-olds, who made up 14.6% of the voters, and the 25-34-year-olds, who made up 16.9%.\n\n**Second round**\n\nOn 7 May, the second round of the presidential election was held. Emmanuel Macron won the election with 66.10% of the vote, followed by Marine Le Pen with 33.90%.\n\n**Campaign accounts**\n\nThe campaign accounts of the eleven candidates were submitted by 7 July 2017 and published in August 2017. The accounts were validated and reimbursement announced by the National Commission for Campaign Accounts and Political Financing on 13 February 2018.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2017 French presidential election marked a significant shift in the French political landscape. Emmanuel Macron, a centrist candidate, won the election with 66.10% of the vote. The election also marked the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic that a sitting president did not seek a second term.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"2017 French presidential election\".

a list of the movement's candidates for the legislative elections was published on 11 May [213]\n\n\nDebates\nA debate between François Fillon, Benoît Hamon, Marine Le Pen, Emmanuel Macron, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon took place on 20 March, hosted by TF1 and moderated by journalists Anne-Claire Coudray and Gilles Bouleau It was the first time that a debate prior to the first round was held The choice of date meant that TF1 would not be required to provide candidates with equal speaking time, as Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA) regulations do not go into force until 9 April, the start of the official campaign Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who was not invited, denounced the debate as a \"rape of democracy\", [163] and the CSA urged TF1 to guarantee fair speaking time for other candidates [164] Dupont-Aignan filed an appeal that was rejected in part because he had already received airtime proportionate to his support [165] On 18 March, appearing on TF1, he quit mid-interview, furious at his exclusion from the network's debate [166] The first debate began with an introductory question – \"What kind of president do you want to be?\" – followed by segments on three themes lasting about 50 minutes each: what type of society France should have, what type of economic model France should adopt, and the place of France in the world The five candidates were given two minutes to answer each question, but opponents had the opportunity to interject 90 seconds in [167] The debate was three and a half hours long, [168] and was watched by 9.8 million (47% of the audience share) on TF1, peaking at 11.5 million [169]\n\n\nElectorate\n\n\n\nSecond round\nOn 8 May, Macron joined President Hollande on the Champs-Elysées to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the surrender of Germany The official transfer of power took place on 14 May, [5] after which Macron nominated his prime minister and government [211] The legislative elections to elect the 15th National Assembly were held a month after the presidential election, with two rounds on 11 and 18 June 2017, [212] in which En Marche! presented its candidates under the label of La République En Marche!;

while all channels were welcome to broadcast the debate, CEO of France Télévisions Delphine Ernotte said, it would not accept such an arrangement with BFM TV, which would mean three journalists moderating the debate [201] Unlike Jacques Chirac, who refused to debate Jean-Marie Le Pen after the latter's surprise advancement to the second round in the 2002 presidential election, Macron agreed to debate Marine Le Pen on 3 May [202] The debate, planned to start at 21:00 CEST and last 2 hours and 20 minutes, was originally to be moderated by Gilles Bouleau and David Pujadas; however, after the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA) raised concerns that the moderators would both be men for the first time since 1995, the final pair of Christophe Jakubyszyn of TF1 and Nathalie Saint-Cricq of France 2 was chosen [203] A total of 16.5 million people (60% of the audience share) watched the debate [204]\n\n\nElectorate\n\n\n\nOpinion polls\n\n\n\nResults\nOn 8 May, Macron joined President Hollande on the Champs-Elysées to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the surrender of Germany The official transfer of power took place on 14 May, [5] after which Macron nominated his prime minister and government [211] The legislative elections to elect the 15th National Assembly were held a month after the presidential election, with two rounds on 11 and 18 June 2017, [212] in which En Marche! presented its candidates under the label of La République En Marche!;

foiled by a unified alliance including the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humanity, and extraterrestrial beings [c] The Mother Boxes are separated and hidden in different locations Thousands of years later, humanity is still in mourning two years after the death of Superman, which triggered the Mother Boxes' reactivation and Steppenwolf's return to Earth Steppenwolf aims to gather the boxes to form \"The Unity\", which will destroy Earth's ecology and terraform it in the image of Steppenwolf's homeworld.\n\n\nCast\nDuring a scene a half-hour into the film, depicting Steppenwolf's first invasion thousands of years earlier, Olympian Old Gods Zeus, Ares, and Artemis are portrayed by fitness model Sergi Constance, stuntman Nick McKinless, and MMA fighter Aurore Lauzeral, respectively [20] [21] [non-primary source needed] All three were required to reach a specific degree of physicality, with Snyder instructing McKinless to sport \"veins like worms and paper thin skin\" In the finished film, McKinless' face was replaced with that of David Thewlis using special effects; Thewlis received the credit as Ares [20] [22] The scene also shows a Green Lantern, named Yalan Gur, created through motion-capture CGI and embodied by an uncredited actor [23] Two ancient leaders of Earth appear during the scene, including King Atlan of Atlantis and King Arthur Pendragon of ancient England; portrayed by Julian Lewis Jones and Francis Magee, respectively [24] [25] Billy Crudup appears, uncredited, as Henry Allen, Barry Allen's father Joe Manganiello and Jesse Eisenberg appear uncredited in a post-credits scene as Slade Wilson / Deathstroke and Lex Luthor, respectively [26] Michael McElhatton appears as the leader of a group of terrorists who clash with Wonder Woman early in the film, [27] while Holt McCallany makes an uncredited appearance as a burglar [28] Marc McClure, who portrayed Jimmy Olsen in the Christopher Reeve Superman film series, has a brief cameo as a police officer [29]\n\n\nProduction\nWe're going to make a Justice League movie, whether it's now or 10 years from now But we're not going to do it and Warners is not going to do it until we know it's right.\n\n\nBackground\nWe're going to make a Justice League movie, whether it's now or 10 years from now But we're not going to do it and Warners is not going to do it until we know it's right.\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on April 11, 2016, with shooting taking place at Warner Bros Studios, Leavesden, as well as various locations around London and Scotland Additional filming took place in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles; and Djúpavík, in the Westfjords [85] of Iceland [86] [87] Snyder's longtime cinematographer Larry Fong was replaced by Fabian Wagner due to scheduling conflicts [87] Ben Affleck served as executive producer [88] In May 2016, it was revealed that Geoff Johns and Jon Berg would produce the Justice League films, and would also be in charge of the DC Extended Universe, after the largely negative critical reception of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice [89] The same month, Irons stated that the Justice League storyline would be more linear and simple, compared to the theatrical version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice [90] Johns confirmed on June 3, 2016, that the title of the film is Justice League, [91] and later stated that the film would be \"hopeful and optimistic\" in comparison to previous DC Extended Universe (DCEU) films [92]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn May 2017, Snyder stepped down from directorial duties on Justice League to cope with his daughter Autumn's suicide, and Whedon assumed his position to oversee post-production and complete the film [99] That July, it was announced the film was undergoing two months of reshoots in London and Los Angeles, with Warner Bros putting about $25 million into them, more than the typical $6–10 million additional filming costs, [100] which brought the budget of the film up to $300 million [7] The reshoots coincided with Cavill's schedule for Paramount Pictures' Mission: Impossible – Fallout, for which he had grown a mustache which he was contracted to keep while filming [101] Director Christopher McQuarrie, unwilling to let Cavill shave unless compensated, requested $3 million from the Justice League production to cover the costs of digitally re-adding Cavill's facial hair back for Fallout until it regrew Paramount executives eventually intervened and refused permission altogether, necessitating the mustache to be digitally removed for Justice League [102]\n\n\nMusic\nIn March 2016, Hans Zimmer, who co-composed the score for Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, stated that he had officially retired from the \"superhero business\", [117] though he would later score X-Men: Dark Phoenix and Wonder Woman 1984 Junkie XL, who wrote and composed the soundtrack of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice with Zimmer, was originally scoring the film, [118] but was replaced by Danny Elfman the following year in June [119] Elfman had previously composed the films Batman and Batman Returns, and the theme music for Batman: The Animated Series Elfman used the Batman theme music from the 1989 film Batman The John Williams' Superman theme was used during \"a dark, twisted moment\" in the film [120] [121] where a resurrected Superman fights the Justice League and later during the climax where Superman arrives to defeat Steppenwolf The film features a cover of Leonard Cohen's \"Everybody Knows\" performed by Sigrid, \"Icky Thump\" performed by the White Stripes, and a cover of the Beatles' \"Come Together\" performed by Gary Clark Jr and Junkie XL [122] WaterTower Music released the soundtrack album digitally on November 10 the same year, with a release of the physical format on December 8 [123]\n\n\nMarketing\nSuperman was intentionally left out on all early Justice League marketing materials, including trailers, clips, and posters, which actor Cavill commented as \"ridiculous\" Despite his character being hidden from promotional materials, Cavill still joined the rest of the cast on the film's press tour [124] [125] Clark Kent was revealed in a final trailer before the release of the film, but edited in a way that writers felt Lois Lane was dreaming about Clark [126] [127] Sponsorship and marketing partners of the film included AT&T, [128] Gillette, [129] Mercedes-Benz, [130] and TCL [131]\n\n\nRelease\nJustice League had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on November 13, 2017, [132] and was released in the United States on November 17, 2017 [80]\n\n\nTheatrical\nJustice League had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in

leaving directorial duties and the final cut of the film in the hands of Joss Whedon, has led to an argument comparing the situation to the one experienced by the film Superman II Both Justice League and Superman II feature a director who was replaced, for different reasons, before completion of a film, which led to a second director coming in and making substantial changes to the tone of each film Although the reasoning behind each director's departure differs, Richard Donner was able to complete his Superman II cut in 2006 In the belief that Snyder had shot enough material for a finished film, a campaign for a \"Snyder Cut\" was started to allow Snyder to receive a similar treatment to Donner Arguments were made that Snyder's vision would be more cohesive to the previous films than

right.\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on April 11, 2016, with shooting taking place at Warner Bros Studios, Leavesden, as well as various locations around London and Scotland Additional filming took place in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles; and Djúpavík, in the Westfjords [85] of Iceland [86] [87] Snyder's longtime cinematographer Larry Fong was replaced by Fabian Wagner due to scheduling conflicts [87] Ben Affleck served as executive producer [88] In May 2016, it was revealed that Geoff Johns and Jon Berg would produce the Justice League films, and would also be in charge of the DC Extended Universe, after the largely negative critical reception of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice [89] The same month, Irons stated that the Justice League storyline would be more linear and simple, compared to the theatrical version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice [90] Johns confirmed on June 3, 2016, that the title of the film is Justice League, [91] and later stated that the film would be \"hopeful and optimistic\" in comparison to previous DC Extended Universe (DCEU) films [92]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn May 2017, Snyder stepped down from directorial duties on Justice League to cope with his daughter Autumn's suicide, and Whedon assumed his position to oversee post-production and complete the film [99] That July, it was announced the film was undergoing two months of reshoots in London and Los Angeles, with Warner Bros putting about $25 million into them, more than the typical $6–10 million additional filming costs, [100] which brought the budget of the film up to $300 million [7] The reshoots coincided with Cavill's schedule for Paramount Pictures' Mission: Impossible – Fallout, for which he had grown a mustache which he was contracted to keep while filming [101] Director Christopher McQuarrie, unwilling to let Cavill shave unless compensated, requested $3 million from the Justice League production to cover the costs of digitally re-adding Cavill's facial hair back for Fallout until it regrew Paramount executives eventually intervened and refused permission altogether, necessitating the mustache to be digitally removed for Justice League [102]\n\n\nMusic\nIn March 2016, Hans Zimmer, who co-composed the score for Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, stated that he had officially retired from the \"superhero business\", [117] though he would later score X-Men: Dark Phoenix and Wonder Woman 1984 Junkie XL, who wrote and composed the soundtrack of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice with Zimmer, was originally scoring the film, [118] but was replaced by Danny Elfman the following year in June [119] Elfman had previously composed the films Batman and Batman Returns, and the theme music for Batman: The Animated Series Elfman used the Batman theme music from the 1989 film Batman The John Williams' Superman theme was used during \"a dark, twisted moment\" in the film [120] [121] where a resurrected Superman fights the Justice League and later during the climax where Superman arrives to defeat Steppenwolf The film features a cover of Leonard Cohen's \"Everybody Knows\" performed by Sigrid, \"Icky Thump\" performed by the White Stripes, and a cover of the Beatles' \"Come Together\" performed by Gary Clark Jr and Junkie XL [122] WaterTower Music released the soundtrack album digitally on November 10 the same year, with a release of the physical format on December 8 [123]\n\n\nMarketing\nSuperman was intentionally left out on all early Justice League marketing materials, including trailers, clips, and posters, which actor Cavill commented as \"ridiculous\" Despite his character being hidden from promotional materials, Cavill still joined the rest of the cast on the film's press tour [124] [125] Clark Kent was revealed in a final trailer before the release of the film, but edited in a way that writers felt Lois Lane was dreaming about Clark [126] [127] Sponsorship and marketing partners of the film included AT&T, [128] Gillette, [129] Mercedes-Benz, [130] and TCL [131]\n\n\nRelease\nJustice League had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in

[19]\n\n\nLetter, sightings and appeals\nOn 5 July, fearful of more shootings by Moat, police mounted a raid with armed officers, dogs and a helicopter on a house in North Kenton, and also detained a man from Sunderland, although neither action found Moat [11]\n\n\nRothbury\nOn the morning of 6 July, a house in Wrekenton was raided by police and a man was detained [26]\n\n\nFurther appeals and reward\nIn another press conference on the morning of 7 July, [31] the police said they believed that Moat was still at large mostly likely hiding in the surrounding countryside in the Rothbury area Within a tent thought to have been used by Moat at a secluded spot in Cartington, an eight-page letter to Sam Stobbart from Moat was found In it, Moat continued to assert that Brown was connected to the police, again denied by Detective Chief Superintendent Adamson The police called in TV survival expert Ray Mears to help track Moat's movements [32]\n\n\nDiscovery and death\nOn 9 July, a cordon was set up around the National Trust's Cragside estate in the parish of Cartington [36] Northumbria Police reported they had recovered three mobile phones used by Moat in recent days [36]\n\n\nInquest\nOn 13 July an inquest was opened and adjourned into Moat's death in Newcastle upon Tyne [45] The coroner declared the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head [45] A senior IPCC investigator told the inquest that during the final confrontation, Moat had been shot by two officers from West Yorkshire Police with Taser guns in an apparent attempt to prevent Moat from killing himself, although, at that time, it was still not clear whether the Tasers were fired before or after Moat turned his gun on himself [45] The IPCC stated to the inquest that the type of Taser used was a long-range XREP Taser, which operates without wires [46] A Home Office spokesman said the XREP Tasers were \"currently subject to testing by the Home Office Scientific Development Branch\".\n\n\nAssociated arrests\nA number of arrests were made both during the hunt for Moat, and after his death, as part of police attempts to capture anyone who had any involvement in Moat's offences.\n\n\nConvictions\nKarl Ness, 26, was given three concurrent life sentences totalling a minimum tariff of 40 years for the murder of Christopher Brown, conspiracy to murder and the attempted

His mother reportedly had bipolar disorder, and he and his half-brother Angus were mostly brought up by their grandmother as their mother spent much time in mental hospitals. Prior to the shootings, Moat had attempted to get psychiatric help.\n\n**Events**\n\nMoat was released from Durham Prison on July 1, 2010, and allegedly arrived in the early hours of July 3 at a house in Birtley, where Samantha Stobbart and her new partner, 29-year-old karate instructor Chris Brown, were visiting.

[19]\n\n\nLetter, sightings and appeals\nOn 5 July, fearful of more shootings by Moat, police mounted a raid with armed officers, dogs and a helicopter on a house in North Kenton, and also detained a man from Sunderland, although neither action found Moat [11]\n\n\nRothbury\nOn the morning of 6 July, a house in Wrekenton was raided by police and a man was detained [26]\n\n\nFurther appeals and reward\nIn another press conference on the morning of 7 July, [31] the police said they believed that Moat was still at large mostly likely hiding in the surrounding countryside in the Rothbury area Within a tent thought to have been used by Moat at a secluded spot in Cartington, an eight-page letter to Sam Stobbart from Moat was found In it, Moat continued to assert that Brown was connected to the police, again denied by Detective Chief Superintendent Adamson The police called in TV survival expert Ray Mears to help track Moat's movements [32]\n\n\nDiscovery and death\nOn 9 July, a cordon was set up around the National Trust's Cragside estate in the parish of Cartington [36] Northumbria Police reported they had recovered three mobile phones used by Moat in recent days [36]\n\n\nInquest\nOn 13 July an inquest was opened and adjourned into Moat's death in Newcastle upon Tyne [45] The coroner declared the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head [45] A senior IPCC investigator told the inquest that during the final confrontation, Moat had been shot by two officers from West Yorkshire Police with Taser guns in an apparent attempt to prevent Moat from killing himself, although, at that time, it was still not clear whether the Tasers were fired before or after Moat turned his gun on himself [45] The IPCC stated to the inquest that the type of Taser used was a long-range XREP Taser, which operates without wires [46] A Home Office spokesman said the XREP Tasers were \"currently subject to testing by the Home Office Scientific Development Branch\".\n\n\nAssociated arrests\nA number of arrests were made both during the hunt for Moat, and after his death, as part of police attempts to capture anyone who had any involvement in Moat's offences.\n\n\nConvictions\nKarl Ness, 26, was given three concurrent life sentences totalling a minimum tariff of 40 years for the murder of Christopher Brown, conspiracy to murder and the attempted

Stephen Stills had been a guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist, and songwriter in the band Buffalo Springfield (which also featured Neil Young); and Graham Nash had been a guitarist, singer, and songwriter with the Hollies [7]\n\n\nCSNY: Déjà Vu to 4 Way Street, August 1969 – April 1971\nWith the exceptions of drum parts (primarily performed by Dallas Taylor) and a handful of rhythm and acoustic guitar parts from Crosby and Nash, Stills (accorded the moniker \"Captain Many Hands\" by his bandmates) handled most of the instrumentation (including every lead guitar, bass and keyboard part) on the album, which left the band in need of additional personnel to be able to tour, a necessity given the debut album's commercial impact Retaining Taylor, the band tried initially to hire a keyboard player Stills initially approached virtuoso multi-instrumentalist Steve Winwood, who was already occupied with the newly formed group Blind Faith [20] Ertegun suggested former Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young, also managed by Elliot Roberts, as a fairly obvious choice; though principally a guitarist, Young was a proficient keyboardist and could alternate on the instrument with Stills and Nash in a live context [21] Stills and Nash initially objected, Stills because of his history with Young in Buffalo Springfield and Nash because of his personal unfamiliarity with Young Despite that, the trio expanded to a quartet with Young a full partner The terms of the contract allowed Young full freedom to maintain a parallel career with his new band, Crazy Horse.\n\n\nIndividual activity\nBetween September 1970 and May 1971, each of the quartet released high-profile solo albums: Young's After the Gold Rush in September (which peaked at No 8 and included his first Top 40 solo hit, \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\"  [#33]); Stills' eponymous debut in November; Crosby's If I Could Only Remember My Name in February, and Nash's Songs for Beginners in May Although all four solo LPs placed in the Top 15 on the Billboard 200, Stills' entry (including two Top 40 hits, \"Love the One You're With\"  [#14] and \"Sit Yourself Down\"  [#37]) peaked the highest at No 3 Stills was the first to release a second post-CSNY solo album, 1971's Stephen Stills 2, which included two minor hits (\"Change Partners\"  [#43]; \"Marianne\"  [#42]) and peaked at No 8 He supported this with a solo tour of major arenas (such as Madison Square Garden and the L.A Forum) in the summer of 1971 with Dallas Taylor, Fuzzy Samuels, and the Memphis Horns In the fall of 1971, Crosby and Nash embarked on a successful theater tour accompanied only by their acoustic guitars and a piano, as captured on the 1998 archival release Another Stoney Evening.\n\n\nCSNY, reconciliation and further estrangement: 1973–1976\nIn June and July 1973, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young met at Young's ranch in California and a recording studio in Hawaii for a working vacation, ostensibly to record a new album, tentatively titled Human Highway However, the bickering that had sunk the band in 1970 quickly resumed, scattering the group again After spontaneously reconvening for an acoustic set at a Manassas concert at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom in October, the quartet failed once again to commit to a reunion; however, three days later, the CSN configuration performed an acoustic set at another Manassas Winterland show [34] [35] Over the next few months, Roberts finally prevailed upon the group to realize their commercial potential, culminating in Stills announcing a CSNY summer tour and the projected studio album at a solo concert in March 1974 [36] The quartet reassembled in earnest that summer, with sidemen Tim Drummond on bass, Russ Kunkel on drums, and Joe Lala on percussion, to rehearse at Young's ranch near Woodside, California before embarking on the two-month, 31-date tour.\n\n\nCSN reform: 1976–1985\nLater in 1976, Stills approached Crosby and Nash during a performance at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, setting the stage for the return of the trio.\n\n\nCSNY again: 1988–2015\nBased on a promise he made to Crosby should he clean himself up, Young agreed to rejoin the trio in the studio upon Crosby's release from prison for American Dream in 1988 [60] Stills and Crosby (enfeebled by health problems from his fallow period that culminated in a 1994 liver transplant) were barely functioning for the making of the album, and the late eighties production completely swamped the band [61] [62] It did make it to No 16 on the Billboard chart during a 22-week stay, but the record received poor critical notices, and Young refused to support it with a CSNY tour The band did produce a video for Young's title-song single, wherein each member played a character loosely based on certain aspects of their personalities and public image Several years later, CSNY reunited to play the Bill Graham memorial concert (\"Laughter, Love and Music\") at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco on November 3, 1991.\n\n\nCSN breakup and Crosby's death: 2016–present\nDespite the unprecedented tumult between Crosby and Young, CSN embarked on a routine world tour encompassing American, European and Japanese venues in 2015, culminating in a performance of \"Silent Night\" at the National Christmas Tree lighting ceremony at The Ellipse in Washington, D.C., on December 3, 2015 [82] However, contrary to a previous November 2015 interview in which he stated he still hoped the band had a future, Nash announced on March 6, 2016, following his divorce from his wife of 38 years, Susan Sennett, that Crosby, Stills & Nash would never perform again because of his recent estrangement from Crosby [83] In the summer of 2016, Young told Rolling Stone that he wouldn't \"rule out\" future collaborations with the trio; according to Nash in a follow-up interview, \"Well, he's right, you never know There have been times when I've been so pissed at us all for wasting time and not getting on with the job that I wouldn't talk to any of them But if Crosby came and played me four songs that knocked me on my ass, what the fuck am I supposed to do as a musician, no matter how pissed we are at each other?\" [84]\n\n\nPolitical activism\nCSNY's music reflected the tastes and viewpoints of the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s With protest against the Vietnam War gearing up in 1970, the group (and Crosby in particular) made no secret of their political leanings.\n\n\nInfluence\nTheir collective abilities allowed CSNY to straddle all the genres of popular music eminent at the time, from country rock to confessional ballads, from acoustic guitars and voice to electric guitar, and three-part harmony With the Beatles' break-up made public by April 1970, and with Bob Dylan in reclusive low-key activity since mid-1966, CSNY found themselves the adopted standard bearers for the Woodstock Nation, serving an importance in society as counterculture figureheads, equaled at the time in rock and roll only by the Rolling Stones or the Who Such was their standing in 1970 that Bill Graham referred to them as \"The American Beatles\" [96] Producer Peter Fonda wanted CSN to create the soundtrack for Easy Rider, but director Dennis Hopper nixed the idea [97] Stills' composition, \"Find the Cost of Freedom\" (on the flip side of \"Ohio\"), was the only song known to be offered for the soundtrack.\n\n\nMembers\nFor individual discographies, see entries on David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young See also Crosby & Nash duo discography.\n\n\nOfficial members\nFor individual discographies, see entries on David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young See also Crosby & Nash duo discography.\n\n\nTimeline\nFor individual discographies, see entries on David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young See also Crosby & Nash duo discography.\n\n\nDiscography\nFor individual discographies, see entries on David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young See also Crosby & Nash duo discography.\n\n\nTours\nTour personnel\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) is an American rock band known for their eclectic and influential music, as well as their complex and often tumultuous history. Formed in 1968, the band consists of David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young. Each member has had a successful solo career, but the quartet has also produced some of the most iconic and enduring music of the 20th century.\n\n**History**\n\nThe formation of CSNY was a result of the convergence of three prominent bands: the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, and the Hollies. David Crosby played guitar, sang, and wrote songs with the Byrds; Stephen Stills had been a guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist, and songwriter in Buffalo Springfield (which also featured Neil Young); and Graham Nash had been a guitarist, singer, and songwriter with the Hollies.\n\n**CSN Formation and Debut Album: July 1968 – May 1969**\n\nCSNY was born with members from two prominent bands and the split of a third. The three musicians met in July 1968 and began writing and recording music together. They released their debut album, \"Crosby, Stills & Nash,\" in May 1969. The album was a commercial success, reaching No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart and featuring the hit single \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.\"\n\n**CSNY: Déjà Vu to 4 Way Street, August 1969 – April 1971**\n\nWith the exceptions of drum parts (primarily performed by Dallas Taylor) and a handful of rhythm and acoustic guitar parts from Crosby and Nash, Stills (accorded the moniker \"Captain Many Hands\" by his bandmates) handled most of the instrumentation (including every lead guitar, bass, and keyboard part) on the album, which left the band in need of additional personnel to be able to tour, a necessity given the debut album's commercial impact. Retaining Taylor, the band tried initially to hire a keyboard player. Stills initially approached virtuoso multi-instrumentalist Steve Winwood, who was already occupied with the newly formed group Blind Faith. Ertegun suggested former Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young, also managed by Elliot Roberts, as a fairly obvious choice; though principally a guitarist, Young was a proficient keyboardist and could alternate on the instrument with Stills and Nash in a live context. Stills and Nash initially objected, Stills because of his history with Young in Buffalo Springfield and Nash because of his personal unfamiliarity with Young. Despite that, the trio expanded to a quartet with Young a full partner.\n\n**Individual Activity: September 1970 – May 1971**\n\nBetween September 1970 and May 1971, each of the quartet released high-profile solo albums. Young's \"After the Gold Rush\" in September (which peaked at No. 8 and included his first Top 40 solo hit, \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\"  [#33]); Stills' eponymous debut in November; Crosby's \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" in February; and Nash's \"Songs for Beginners\" in May. Although all four solo LPs placed in the Top 15 on the Billboard 200, Stills' entry (including two Top 40 hits, \"Love the One You're With\"  [#14] and \"Sit Yourself Down\"  [#37]) peaked the highest at No. 3. Stills was the first to release a second post-CSNY solo album, 1971's \"Stephen Stills 2,\" which included two minor hits (\"Change Partners\"  [#43]; \"Marianne\"  [#42]) and peaked at No. 8. He supported this with a solo tour of major arenas (such as Madison Square Garden and the L.A. Forum) in the summer of 1971 with Dallas Taylor, Fuzzy Samuels, and the Memphis Horns. In the fall of 1971, Crosby and Nash embarked on a successful theater tour accompanied only by their acoustic guitars and a piano, as captured on the 1998 archival release \"Another Stoney Evening.\"\n\n**CSNY, Reconciliation and Further Estrangement: 1973–1976**\n\nIn June and July 1973, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young met at Young's ranch in California and a recording studio in Hawaii for a working vacation, ostensibly to record a new album, tentatively titled \"Human Highway.\" However, the bickering that had sunk the band in 1970 quickly resumed, scattering the group again. After spontaneously reconvening for an acoustic set at a Manassas concert at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom in October, the quartet failed once again to commit to a reunion; however, three days later, the CSN configuration performed an acoustic set at another Manassas Winterland show. Over the next few months, Roberts finally prevailed upon the group to realize their commercial potential, culminating in Stills announcing a CSNY summer tour and the projected studio album at a solo concert in March 1974. The quartet reassembled in earnest that summer, with sidemen Tim Drummond on bass, Russ Kunkel on drums, and Joe Lala on percussion, to rehearse at Young's ranch near Woodside, California before embarking on the two-month, 31-date tour.\n\n**CSN Reform: 1976–1985**\n\nLater in 1976, Stills approached Crosby and Nash during a performance at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, setting the stage for the return of the trio.\n\n**CSNY Again: 1988–2015**\n\nBased on a promise he made to Crosby should he clean himself up, Young agreed to rejoin the trio in the studio upon Crosby's release from prison for American Dream in 1988. Stills and Crosby (enfeebled by health problems from his fallow period that culminated in a 1994 liver transplant) were barely functioning for the making of the album, and the late eighties production completely swamped the band. It did make it to No. 16 on the Billboard chart during a 22-week stay, but the record received poor critical notices, and Young refused to support it with a CSNY tour. The band did produce a video for Young's title-song single, wherein each member played a character loosely based on certain aspects of their personalities and public image. Several years later, CSNY reunited to play the Bill Graham memorial concert (\"Laughter, Love and Music\") at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco on November 3, 1991.\n\n**CSN Breakup and Crosby's Death: 2016–present**\n\nDespite the unprecedented tumult between Crosby and Young, CSN embarked on a routine world tour encompassing American, European, and Japanese venues in 2015, culminating in a performance of \"Silent Night\" at the National Christmas Tree lighting ceremony at The Ellipse in Washington, D.C., on December 3, 2015. However, contrary to a previous November 2015 interview in which he stated he still hoped the band had a future, Nash announced on March 6, 2016, following his divorce from his wife of 38 years, Susan Sennett, that Crosby, Stills & Nash would never perform again because of his recent estrangement from Crosby. In the summer of 2016, Young told Rolling Stone that he wouldn't \"rule out\" future collaborations with the trio; according to Nash in a follow-up interview, \"Well, he's right, you never know. There have been times when I've been so pissed at us all for wasting time and not getting on with the job that I wouldn't talk to any of them. But if Crosby came and played me four songs that knocked me on my ass, what the fuck am I supposed to do as a musician, no matter how pissed we are at each other?\"\n\n**Political Activism**\n\nCSNY's music reflected the tastes and viewpoints of the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s. With protest against the Vietnam War gearing up in 1970, the group (and Crosby in particular) made no secret of their political leanings.\n\n**Influence**\n\nTheir collective abilities allowed CSNY to straddle all the genres of popular music eminent at the time, from country rock to confessional ballads, from acoustic guitars and voice to electric guitar, and three-part harmony. With the Beatles' break-up made public by April 1970, and with Bob Dylan in reclusive low-key activity since mid-1966, CSNY found themselves the adopted standard bearers for the Woodstock Nation, serving an importance in society as counterculture figureheads, equaled at the time in rock and roll only by the Rolling Stones or the Who. Such was their standing in 1970 that Bill Graham referred to them as \"The American Beatles.\" Producer Peter Fonda wanted CSN to create the soundtrack for Easy Rider, but director Dennis Hopper nixed the idea. Stills' composition, \"Find the Cost of Freedom\" (on the flip side of \"Ohio\"), was the only song known to be offered for the soundtrack.\n\n**Members**\n\nFor individual discographies, see entries on David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young.

Stephen Stills had been a guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist, and songwriter in the band Buffalo Springfield (which also featured Neil Young); and Graham Nash had been a guitarist, singer, and songwriter with the Hollies [7]\n\n\nCSN formation and debut album: July 1968 – May 1969\nCSN was born with members from two prominent bands and the split of a third David Crosby played guitar, sang, and wrote songs with the Byrds;

though principally a guitarist, Young was a proficient keyboardist and could alternate on the instrument with Stills and Nash in a live context [21] Stills and Nash initially objected, Stills because of his history with Young in Buffalo Springfield and Nash because of his personal unfamiliarity with Young Despite that, the trio expanded to a quartet with Young a full partner The terms of the contract allowed Young full freedom to maintain a parallel career with his new band, Crazy Horse.\n\n\nIndividual activity\nBetween September 1970 and May 1971, each of the quartet released high-profile solo albums: Young's After the Gold Rush in September (which peaked at No 8 and included his first Top 40 solo hit, \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\"  [#33]);

{"title": "Melania_Trump", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nMelanija Knavs was born in Novo Mesto, Yugoslavia, now part of present-day Slovenia, on April 26, 1970 [2] [3] Her father Viktor Knavs first worked as a chauffeur, and he eventually sold car parts for a state-owned vehicle manufacturer as he made connections with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the national communist party [4] Her mother Amalija worked as a patternmaker at the children's clothing manufacturer Jutranjka in Sevnica [2] [5] In Sevnica, the family lived in the state-run housing complex Naselje Heroja Maroka [6] She has an older sister, Ines, [7] and an older half-brother from her father's previous relationship, Denis Cigelnjak, whom she reportedly has never met [8] Her father denied paternity of the boy, even after it was confirmed by a paternity test [9]\n\n\nEarly modeling career\nMelania was discovered by Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko when she was sixteen, after modeling in a school-sponsored show [23] [24] At the time, she had wanted to be a fashion designer rather than a model [9] Melania won a modeling contest with the Italian studio Cinecittà that entitled her to a movie role, but she rejected the prize after a producer sexually propositioned her [25] As her modeling career progressed, Melania took on an alternate spelling of her name, Melania Knauss She traveled Europe to find modeling work [21] [26] Except a few close relatives, she did not maintain contact with anyone she knew in Slovenia [27] In 1992, Melania was named runner-up in the Jana Magazine Look of the Year contest, which promised its top three contestants an international modeling contract [2] [21] [9] She signed with RVR Reclame in Milan, but she left the organization a few months later [28]\n\n\nEuropean career\nMelania was discovered by Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko when she was sixteen, after modeling in a school-sponsored show [23] [24] At the time, she

three contestants an international modeling contract [2] [21] [9] She signed with RVR Reclame in Milan, but she left the organization a few months later [28]\n\n\nRelocating to New York\nZampolli urged Melania to travel to the United States, where he said he would like to represent her [14] In 1996, Melania moved to Manhattan [14] [9] By this time, she was already 26 years old, much older than most aspiring models [32] Zampolli encouraged Melania to live near and socialize with people in the fashion industry, [33] and he arranged for her to share an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian in Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square [34] [14] Her rent was taken from her pay with Zampolli's agency [35] Once she resided in the United States, she returned to her home country only sparingly and only for short periods of time [36] She lived a healthy lifestyle, managing her diet carefully, [37] and she avoided the drinking and partying that often consumed the lives of the models around her [38] She did not lead an active social life and only went out on rare occasions [38] [37] Melania was featured in a sexually explicit photo shoot for a 1997 issue of Max, a French men's magazine, with another female model The photos were shot by the photographer Alexandre Ale de Basseville, and the work was unpaid, instead promising Melania exposure in a prominent magazine The photos were largely forgotten until they were published by the New York Post in 2016 [39]\n\n\nMarriage and family\nIn September 1998, Zampolli introduced Melania to the real estate mogul Donald Trump at a party [42] Donald had a date to the event, Celina Midelfart When he asked Melania for her phone number, she refused Instead, she insisted that he give her his own number He passed her test when he gave her multiple personal numbers instead of an office number [43] [44] She later said that giving her own number would make her \"just one of the women he calls\" [43] The exact details of when and where this took place are unclear, though the Kit Kat Club is often described as where they met [45]\n\n\nMeeting Donald Trump\nIn September 1998, Zampolli introduced Melania to the real estate mogul

details of when and where this took place are unclear, though the Kit Kat Club is often described as where they met [45]\n\n\nRelationship with Donald Trump\nDonald's fame and connections gave her new career opportunities [58] Shortly after the death of Jacqueline Kennedy, whom Melania and her mother had deeply admired, Melania met the Kennedy family at a gala [59] She continued to encounter celebrities while attending events with Donald [60]\n\n\nEngagement and wedding\nDonald proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, on her birthday as they were leaving to attend the Met Gala [77] He reasoned that he was more willing to wed as she had not insisted on marriage, and he felt she was an influence in the success he had seen over the previous years [78] She also signed his prenuptial agreement without issue [79] A few months before the wedding, Melania traveled to Paris with Anna Wintour and André Leon Talley to find a wedding dress, and Melania decided on a dress by John Galliano [80] In the days leading up to the wedding, she appeared on the front cover of Vogue in her dress [81] [82]\n\n\nMarriage and motherhood\nThe Trumps had three residences that they traveled between: Trump Tower in New York, Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, and Mar-a-Lago in Florida [36] [87] To have her own private abode, Melania had a private spa constructed on the top floor of Trump Tower [87] As a couple, the two did not spend much direct time together, preferring to live adjacently with one another [88] According to Donald, their passive relationship suited him because he worked for a living and did not \"want to go home and work at a relationship\" [9] [89] Melania accepted a transaction element in their relationship, though she cared about Donald and did not believe that she was a gold digger [90] When she attended events with her husband at Trump facilities, she often stayed for only a few minutes to make an appearance before returning to the private residence [91] Donald did not learn to speak Melania's native language, which she said she accepted because she is \"not a nagging wife\" [2]\n\n\nBusiness ventures\n\nAs her son reached childhood, Melania found herself with more time for other pursuits [109] She trademarked her name, Melania, in 2009 as a jewelry brand, which she used to sell less expensive jewelry pieces on QVC [110] She was intentional about not using the Trump name in her branding, correcting reporters who called it Melania Trump [111] She drew the designs herself, [9] which were based on three places where she had lived: New York, Palm Beach, and Paris Over the following years, she released additional Melania collections, and they sold out each time [111]\n\nDonald Trump 2016 presidential campaign\nMelania was the one who finally convinced Donald to campaign for president in the 2016 presidential election, telling him that he either needed to do it or stop talking about it [115] [116] When the campaign began, Melania made it clear to her husband that she would not be pressured into campaigning or attending events, and that she would only make appearances when she wanted to She subsequently played a relatively small role in the campaign, which had been atypical of spouses of presidential candidates since the early 20th century [117] Explaining her absence, she cited the need to stay home with her son Barron [118] [119] Her daily routine was nonetheless altered by the campaign, as she had to take security arrangements into account when she traveled, and she could not post about her activities online in real time [120] Once a prolific user of Instagram and Twitter, she became less active on her social media accounts when the campaign began [9]\n\n\nPersonal life during the campaign\nMelania was the one who finally convinced Donald to campaign for president in the 2016 presidential election, telling him that he either needed to do it or stop talking about it [115] [116] When the campaign began, Melania made it clear to her husband that she would not be pressured into campaigning or attending events, and that she would only make appearances when she wanted to She subsequently played a

son Barron [118] [119] Her daily routine was nonetheless altered by the campaign, as she had to take security arrangements into account when she traveled, and she could not post about her activities online in real time [120] Once a prolific user of Instagram and Twitter, she became less active on her social media accounts when the campaign began [9]\n\n\nCampaign involvement\nMelania's career as a model was an advantage during the campaign, as she was prepared for photographers and did not need to hire a fashion consultant [21] As a model, she was required to be deliberate in all of her movement, including how she stood and walked [126] She resented being called shy during the campaign, saying that this was an impression spread by people who only briefly met her and wanted their \"15 minutes of fame\" [127] Melania's earliest speaking appearances in November 2015 and February 2016 were prompted by Donald calling on her to speak to the crowd Both times, she only said a few sentences [128] Her first scheduled speech during the campaign did not take place until April 2016 [119]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nAn attack ad against the Trumps was produced by a super PAC that supported Donald's opponent Ted Cruz featuring Melania's nude GQ photo with the caption \"Meet Melania Trump Your next first lady Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday\", intensifying the rivalry between the two candidates in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries [118] [132] [9] More nude images of Melania were published on the front page of the New York Post in July 2016 in a story titled \"The Ogle Office\" The images did not have a major effect on the campaign, as Melania was seen as the victim, but they were humiliating and she spent the following two months away from the public [133]\n\n\nAccess Hollywood tape\nOn October 7, a month before the election, the Access Hollywood tape was leaked The tape had been recorded in 2005, shortly after their marriage, and it featured audio of Donald making controversial remarks about his treatment of women Immediately after its release, the campaign's primary concern was Melania's reaction It took Donald two hours before he went to see Melania Upon their meeting, Melania reportedly told him \"Now you could lose, you could have blown this for us\", and then left the room after he apologized [142] In 2024, her husband's former personal counsel Michael Cohen testified during The People of the State of New York v Donald J Trump trial that Donald had privately credited her as having suggested that the campaign's response strategy should best characterize the conversation on the tape as \"locker room talk\" [143]\n\n\nFirst lady of the United States (2017–2021)\nAfter Donald's inauguration as president on January 20, 2017, [150] Melania announced that she would not move to Washington, D.C with him, instead staying in Manhattan so Barron could finish the school year there [151] This also allowed her to introduce her son to the White House gradually so as not to overwhelm him [152] During this time, Melania negotiated new terms for her prenuptial agreement with Donald to reflect the changes in their lives since it was signed and to ensure that Barron received a suitable inheritance [153]\n\n\nFirst lady in Manhattan\nAfter Donald's inauguration as president on January 20, 2017, [150] Melania announced that she would not move to Washington, D.C with him, instead staying in Manhattan so Barron could finish the school year there [151] This also allowed her to introduce her son to the White House gradually so as not to overwhelm him [152] During this time, Melania negotiated new terms for her prenuptial agreement with Donald to reflect the changes in their lives since it was signed and to ensure that Barron received a suitable inheritance [153]\n\n\nEast Wing staff\nThe lack of staff appointments in the East Wing during the first months of the Trump administration—typically the domain of the first lady—caused a backlog of tour requests to develop In February several hires were made for the Office of the First Lady: Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd as social secretary, Lindsay Reynolds as the first lady's chief of staff, Tham Kannalikham as her decorator, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff as the first lady's assistant, and Stephanie Grisham as communications director [175] Melania retained the head florist appointed by Michelle Obama, Hedieh Ghaffarian [176] The chief usher appointed under the Obama administration, Angella Reid, was replaced by Trump International Hotel employee Timothy Harleth, breaking the norm of the chief usher serving under multiple presidencies [175] Reid had been broadly unpopular with the staff, and the firing earned Melania their goodwill [177]\n\n\nLife in the White House\nMelania and her son, Barron, moved into the White House on June 11, 2017 [184] Like they had throughout their marriage, Melania and Donald chose to sleep in separate bedrooms [185] In her first year, Melania gave only eight speeches, compared to 74 by Michelle Obama and 42 by Laura Bush [186] Instead of frequent public appearances, she communicated her activities through video [181] Most of Melania's appearances as first lady in 2017 were in Manhattan and Washington, and she typically spoke about women's and children's issues [187]\n\n\nTribulations in early 2018\n\nA scandal broke in January 2018 when it was alleged that Donald had had an extramarital affair with the pornographic actress Stormy Daniels The affair was said to have taken place in July 2006, after the Trumps' marriage and the birth of their son Melania's public appearances became more infrequent after the news emerged, and she canceled several events that she was to attend with her husband [201] This included the 2018 State of the Union Address, where Melania made the unprecedented decision to ride separately from him on the way there [202] Michael Cohen, who had arranged the silencing of the alleged affair, stated that his greatest regret was lying to Melania, saying that she didn't deserve it [203] The next month, the story of a second affair in 2006 with the model Karen McDougal was made public [201] [204] To Melania, the worst part was that she felt Donald had publicly humiliated her [205] [161]\n\n2018 Africa tour\nIn October 2018, Melania took a tour of Africa without Donald, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt She spent much of her time with children in schools, orphanages, and hospitals She used the trip to tout relief work being carried out by the United States Agency for International Development, which raised questions about her husband's intention to cut its funding Melania also received criticism for her fashion choices, where a photo opportunity in front of the Great Sphinx of Giza was seen as exploitive and a pith helmet she wore in Kenya was criticized for its association with colonialism in Africa To these criticisms, she responded that people should pay more attention to her actions instead of her outfits [219] Perception of the trip grew worse when she responded to criticisms by saying that she was \"the most bullied person in the world\" [220]\n\n\nPolitical influence\nMelania was the one person exempt from the criticism and distrust that Donald leveled against those around him in the White House He held her opinion in high regard, often agreeing with her when she made it known, and he valued her loyalty as she did not seek public attention of her own [227] Melania believed that it was not her duty as first lady to take policy positions in her own right, but simply to advise Donald regarding his [9] She was the only person among those around him who could critique him directly without repercussion [228] Donald frequently asked for her opinion about issues he was considering or people who he interacted with, calling her over the phone when she was not in the same room [229]\n\n\nFamily separation policy\nMelania was openly critical of her husband's \"zero tolerance\" policy of denying asylum at the Mexico–United States border in 2018, where children were being separated from their parents Her official position was that she hated to see families separated and hoped for successful immigration reform [238] [239] Out of public view, she made her opposition clear to the president and influenced his decision to end it [240] Leaked tapes in 2020 featured Melania making statements defending some of the practices, expressing grief about family separation but questioning the validity of asylum claims and dismissing concerns that children were kept in substandard conditions [241]\n\n\nBe Best campaign\nOn May 7, 2018, Melania held a press conference in the White House Rose Garden to announce her official public initiative as first lady, the Be Best awareness campaign The initiative was created to support the welfare of children, advocate against cyberbullying, and prevent opioid abuse [210] [247] The initiative's name drew ridicule in the press for its grammatical structure [248] Instead of creating new programs like previous first ladies' projects, Be Best promoted existing initiatives and organizations that worked toward the cause Public awareness of the initiative remained low, and it was often regarded solely as an anti-cyberbullying campaign [249]\n\n\nCOVID-19 and 2020 presidential campaign\nMelania carried out a major reorganization of her staff in April 2020 in anticipation of her husband's reelection campaign She appointed Marcia Lee Kelly as her senior advisor and Emma Doyle as her policy advisor Melania's chief of staff, Lindsay Reynolds, was removed; her responsibilities went to Melania's communications director, Stephanie Grisham [181] Melania became an active campaigner for her husband during the 2020 presidential election, which was a strong contrast to her 2016 activity [252]\n\n\nAfter the White House (2021–present)\nAfter the Trumps left the White House, Melania returned to Mar-a-Lago, where she could live while avoiding public attention [161] She retained one White House advisor, Marcia Lee Kelly, to help her during the post-presidency [220] Melania kept in contact with her successor Jill Biden, and the two have exchanged birthday cards [189] Since her tenure as first lady ended, Melania has made occasional paid speaking appearances, she has founded a scholarship program for foster children, and she has minted a line of Apollo 11–themed non-fungible tokens that were not in compliance with NASA's image use policy [161] In November 2023, Melania attended the memorial service for former First Lady Rosalynn Carter [260]\n\n\nPublic image\nMelania limits her interactions with the public, creating a public image heavily influenced by speculation [265] She worked to protect her privacy as first lady, [266] and her staff was instructed not to answer any questions about her whereabouts at a given time [179] With limited information, commentators have portrayed her as being a reluctant companion to her husband or as a woman who has no independence of her own Several incidents during her husband's presidency led to rumors that she had a secret animosity toward her husband, such as her delay in moving to the White House and allegations that he had committed adultery [211] [266] [267] The rumors led to popular use of the hashtag #FreeMelania by those who believed them [268] Though she disliked the idea that people saw her as helpless, Melania found the campaign amusing [269] This became less common by 2020 as she had become more publicly associated with the role of first lady [270] She is often seen as cold by the public, though people who interact with her describe her as a warm presence

Trump, and was the First Lady of the United States from 2017 to 2021. Born on April 26, 1970, in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, now part of present-day Slovenia, she rose to fame as a model and later became a prominent figure in her husband's presidential campaign and presidency.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMelanija Knavs was born to Viktor Knavs, a car parts salesman, and Amalija Knavs, a patternmaker at a children's clothing factory. Her father sold car parts for a state-owned vehicle manufacturer, eventually becoming connected to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the national communist party. Melania and her family lived in the state-run housing complex Naselje Heroja Maroka in Sevnica. She has an older sister, Ines, and an older half-brother, Denis Cigelnjak, from her father's previous relationship. Melania has never met her half-brother.\n\nMelania was discovered by Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko at the age of 16, after modeling in a school-sponsored show. She won a modeling contest with the Italian studio Cinecittà, which entitled her to a movie role. However, she rejected the prize after a producer sexually propositioned her. Melania took on the alternate spelling of her name, Melania Knauss, and traveled Europe to find modeling work. She signed with RVR Reclame in Milan but left the organization a few months later.\n\n**European Career**\n\nMelania's early modeling career was marked by her work in Europe. She was discovered by Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko at the age of 16, after modeling in a school-sponsored show. She won a modeling contest with the Italian studio Cinecittà, which entitled her to a movie role. However, she rejected the prize after a producer sexually propositioned her. Melania took on the alternate spelling of her name, Melania Knauss, and traveled Europe to find modeling work. She signed with RVR Reclame in Milan but left the organization a few months later.\n\n**Relocating to New York**\n\nMelania moved to Manhattan in 1996, where she was represented by Zampolli, a fashion agent. She shared an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian in Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square. Her rent was taken from her pay with Zampolli's agency. Melania was featured in a sexually explicit photo shoot for a 1997 issue of Max, a French men's magazine, with another female model. The photos were shot by Alexandre Ale de Basseville and were unpaid, promising Melania exposure in a prominent magazine. The photos were largely forgotten until they were published by the New York Post in 2016.\n\n**Marriage and Family**\n\nMelania met Donald Trump at a party in 1998, where she was introduced by Zampolli. Donald had a date to the event, Celina Midelfart. Melania refused to give Donald her phone number, instead insisting that he give her his own number. Donald passed her test by giving her multiple personal numbers instead of an office number. Melania and Donald got engaged in 2004, on her birthday, and married on January 22, 2005. Melania signed Donald's prenuptial agreement without issue. They have one son, Barron, born on March 20, 2006.\n\n**Business Ventures**\n\nAs her son reached childhood, Melania found herself with more time for other pursuits. She trademarked her name, Melania, in 2009 as a jewelry brand, which she used to sell less expensive jewelry pieces on QVC. She drew the designs herself, based on three places where she had lived: New York, Palm Beach, and Paris. Melania released additional Melania collections, which sold out each time.\n\n**Donald Trump 2016 Presidential Campaign**\n\nMelania was the one who finally convinced Donald to campaign for president in the 2016 presidential election, telling him that he either needed to do it or stop talking about it. She made it clear to her husband that she would not be pressured into campaigning or attending events, and that she would only make appearances when she wanted to. Melania played a relatively small role in the campaign, which had been atypical of spouses of presidential candidates since the early 20th century. Explaining her absence, she cited the need to stay home with her son Barron.\n\n**First Lady of the United States (2017-2021)**\n\nAfter Donald's inauguration as president on January 20, 2017, Melania announced that she would not move to Washington, D.C. with him, instead staying in Manhattan so Barron could finish the school year there. This also allowed her to introduce her son to the White House gradually so as not to overwhelm him. During this time, Melania negotiated new terms for her prenuptial agreement with Donald to reflect the changes in their lives since it was signed and to ensure that Barron received a suitable inheritance.\n\n**First Lady in Manhattan**\n\nMelania was critical of the lack of staff appointments in the East Wing during the first months of the Trump administration. Several hires were made for the Office of the First Lady, including Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd as social secretary. Melania retained the head florist appointed by Michelle Obama, Hedieh Ghaffarian. The chief usher appointed under the Obama administration, Angella Reid, was replaced by Timothy Harleth.\n\n**Life in the White House**\n\nMelania and her son, Barron, moved into the White House on June 11, 2017. Like they had throughout their marriage, Melania and Donald chose to sleep in separate bedrooms. In her first year, Melania gave only eight speeches, compared to 74 by Michelle Obama and 42 by Laura Bush. Instead of frequent public appearances, she communicated her activities through video.\n\n**Tribulations in Early 2018**\n\nA scandal broke in January 2018 when it was alleged that Donald had had an extramarital affair with the pornographic actress Stormy Daniels. The affair was said to have taken place in July 2006, after the Trumps' marriage and the birth of their son. Melania's public appearances became more infrequent after the news emerged, and she canceled several events that she was to attend with her husband.\n\n**2018 Africa Tour**\n\nIn October 2018, Melania took a tour of Africa without Donald, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt. She spent much of her time with children in schools, orphanages, and hospitals. Melania used the trip to tout relief work being carried out by the United States Agency for International Development, which raised questions about her husband's intention to cut its funding.\n\n**COVID-19 and 2020 Presidential Campaign**\n\nMelania carried out a major reorganization of her staff in April 2020 in anticipation of her husband's reelection campaign.

New York\nZampolli urged Melania to travel to the United States, where he said he would like to represent her [14] In 1996, Melania moved to Manhattan [14] [9] By this time, she was already 26 years old, much older than most aspiring models [32] Zampolli encouraged Melania to live near and socialize with people in the fashion industry, [33] and he arranged for her to share an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian in Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square [34] [14] Her rent was taken from her pay with Zampolli's agency [35] Once she resided in the United States, she returned to her home country only sparingly and only for short periods of time [36] She lived a healthy lifestyle, managing her diet carefully, [37] and she avoided the drinking and partying that often consumed the lives of the models around her [38] She did not lead an active social life and only went out on rare occasions [38] [37] Melania was featured in a sexually explicit photo shoot for a 1997 issue of Max, a French men's magazine, with another female model The photos were shot by the photographer Alexandre Ale de Basseville, and the work was unpaid, instead promising Melania exposure in a prominent magazine The photos were largely forgotten until they were published by the New York Post in 2016 [39]\n\n\nMarriage and family\nIn September 1998, Zampolli introduced Melania to the real estate mogul Donald Trump at a party [42] Donald had a date to the event, Celina Midelfart When he asked Melania for her phone number, she refused Instead, she insisted that he give her his own number He passed

connections gave her new career opportunities [58] Shortly after the death of Jacqueline Kennedy, whom Melania and her mother had deeply admired, Melania met the Kennedy family at a gala [59] She continued to encounter celebrities while attending events with Donald [60]\n\n\nEngagement and wedding\nDonald proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, on her birthday as they were leaving to attend the Met Gala [77] He reasoned that he was more willing to wed as she had not insisted on marriage, and he felt she was an influence in the success he had seen over the previous years [78] She also signed his prenuptial agreement without issue [79] A few months before the wedding, Melania traveled to Paris with Anna Wintour and André Leon Talley to find a wedding dress, and Melania decided on a dress by John Galliano [80] In the days leading up to the wedding, she appeared on the front cover of Vogue in her dress [81] [82]\n\n\nMarriage and motherhood\nThe Trumps had three residences that they traveled between: Trump Tower in New York, Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, and Mar-a-Lago in Florida [36] [87] To have her own private abode, Melania had a private spa constructed on the top floor of Trump Tower [87] As a couple, the two did not spend much direct time together, preferring to live adjacently with one another [88] According to Donald, their passive relationship suited him because he worked for a living and did not \"want to go home and work at a relationship\" [9] [89] Melania accepted a transaction element in their relationship, though she cared about Donald and did not believe that she was a gold digger [90] When she attended events with her husband at Trump facilities, she often stayed for only a few minutes to make an appearance before returning to the private residence [91] Donald did not learn to speak Melania's native language, which she said she accepted because she is \"not a nagging wife\" [2]\n\n\nBusiness ventures\n\nAs her son reached childhood, Melania found herself with more time for other pursuits [109] She trademarked her name, Melania, in 2009 as a jewelry brand, which she used to sell less expensive jewelry pieces on QVC [110] She was intentional about not using the Trump name in her branding, correcting reporters who called it Melania Trump [111] She drew the designs herself, [9] which were based on three places where she had lived: New York, Palm Beach, and Paris Over the following years, she released additional Melania collections, and they sold out each time [111]\n\nDonald Trump 2016 presidential

post about her activities online in real time [120] Once a prolific user of Instagram and Twitter, she became less active on her social media accounts when the campaign began [9]\n\n\nCampaign involvement\nMelania's career as a model was an advantage during the campaign, as she was prepared for photographers and did not need to hire a fashion consultant [21] As a model, she was required to be deliberate in all of her movement, including how she stood and walked [126] She resented being called shy during the campaign, saying that this was an impression spread by people who only briefly met her and wanted their \"15 minutes of fame\" [127] Melania's earliest speaking appearances in November 2015 and February 2016 were prompted by Donald calling on her to speak to the crowd Both times, she only said a few sentences [128] Her first scheduled speech during the campaign did not take place until April 2016 [119]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nAn attack ad against the Trumps was produced by a super PAC that supported Donald's opponent Ted Cruz featuring Melania's nude GQ photo with the caption \"Meet Melania Trump Your next first lady Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday\", intensifying the rivalry between the two candidates in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries [118] [132] [9] More nude images of Melania were published on the front page of the New York Post in July 2016 in a story titled \"The Ogle Office\" The images did not have a major effect on the campaign, as Melania was seen as the victim, but they were humiliating and she spent the following two months away from the public [133]\n\n\nAccess Hollywood tape\nOn October 7, a month before the election, the Access Hollywood tape was leaked The tape had been recorded in 2005, shortly after their marriage, and it featured audio of Donald making controversial remarks about his treatment of women Immediately after its release, the campaign's primary concern was Melania's reaction It took Donald two hours before he went to see Melania Upon their meeting, Melania reportedly told him \"Now you could lose, you could have blown this for us\", and then left the room after he apologized [142] In 2024, her husband's former personal counsel Michael Cohen testified during The People of the State of New York v Donald J Trump trial that Donald had privately credited her as having suggested that the campaign's response strategy should best characterize the conversation on the tape as \"locker room talk\" [143]\n\n\nFirst lady of the United States (2017–2021)\nAfter Donald's inauguration as president on January 20, 2017, [150] Melania announced that she would not move to Washington, D.C with him, instead staying in Manhattan so Barron could finish the school year there [151] This also allowed her to introduce her son to the White House gradually so as not to overwhelm him [152] During this time, Melania negotiated new terms for her prenuptial agreement with Donald

lives since it was signed and to ensure that Barron received a suitable inheritance [153]\n\n\nEast Wing staff\nThe lack of staff appointments in the East Wing during the first months of the Trump administration—typically the domain of the first lady—caused a backlog of tour requests to develop In February several hires were made for the Office of the First Lady: Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd as social secretary, Lindsay Reynolds as the first lady's chief of staff, Tham Kannalikham as her decorator, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff as the first lady's assistant, and Stephanie Grisham as communications director [175] Melania retained the head florist appointed by Michelle Obama, Hedieh Ghaffarian [176] The chief usher appointed under the Obama administration, Angella Reid, was replaced by Trump International Hotel employee Timothy Harleth, breaking the norm of the chief usher serving under multiple presidencies [175] Reid had been broadly unpopular with the staff, and the firing earned Melania their goodwill [177]\n\n\nLife in the White House\nMelania and her son, Barron, moved into the White House on June 11, 2017 [184] Like they had throughout their marriage, Melania and Donald chose to sleep in separate bedrooms [185] In her first year, Melania gave only eight speeches, compared to 74 by Michelle Obama and 42 by Laura Bush [186] Instead of frequent public appearances, she communicated her activities through video [181] Most of Melania's appearances as first lady in 2017 were in Manhattan and Washington, and she typically spoke about women's and children's issues [187]\n\n\nTribulations in early 2018\n\nA scandal broke in January 2018 when it was alleged that Donald had had an extramarital affair with the pornographic actress Stormy Daniels The affair was said to have taken place in July 2006, after the Trumps' marriage and the birth of their son Melania's public appearances became more infrequent after the news emerged, and she canceled several events that she was to attend with her husband [201] This included the 2018 State of the Union Address, where Melania made the unprecedented decision to ride separately from him on the way there [202] Michael Cohen, who had arranged the silencing of the alleged affair, stated that his greatest regret was lying to Melania, saying that she didn't deserve it [203] The next month, the story of a second affair in 2006 with the model Karen McDougal was made public [201] [204] To Melania, the worst part was that she felt Donald had publicly humiliated her [205] [161]\n\n2018 Africa tour\nIn October 2018, Melania took a tour of Africa without Donald, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt She spent much of her time with children in schools, orphanages, and hospitals She used the trip to tout relief work being carried out by the United States Agency for International Development, which raised questions about her husband's intention to cut its funding Melania also received criticism for her fashion choices, where a photo opportunity in front of the Great Sphinx of Giza was seen as exploitive and a pith helmet she wore in Kenya was criticized for its association with colonialism in Africa To these criticisms, she responded that people should pay more attention to her actions instead of her outfits [219] Perception of the trip grew worse when she responded to criticisms by saying that she was \"the most bullied person in the world\" [220]\n\n\nPolitical influence\nMelania was the one person exempt from the criticism and distrust that Donald leveled against those around him in the White House He held her opinion in high regard, often agreeing with her when she made it known, and he valued her loyalty as she did not seek public attention of her own [227] Melania believed that it was not her duty as first lady to take policy positions in her own right, but simply to advise Donald regarding his [9] She was the only person among those around him who could critique him directly without repercussion [228] Donald frequently asked for her opinion about issues he was considering or people who he interacted with, calling her over the phone when she was not in the same room [229]\n\n\nFamily separation policy\nMelania was openly critical of her husband's \"zero tolerance\" policy of denying asylum at the Mexico–United States border in 2018, where children were being separated from their parents Her official position was that she hated to see families separated and hoped for successful immigration reform [238] [239] Out of public view, she made her opposition clear to the president and influenced his decision to end it [240] Leaked tapes in 2020 featured Melania making statements defending some of the practices, expressing grief about family separation but questioning the validity of asylum claims and dismissing concerns that children were kept in substandard conditions [241]\n\n\nBe Best campaign\nOn May 7, 2018, Melania held a press conference in the White House Rose Garden to announce her official public initiative as first lady, the Be Best awareness campaign The initiative was created to support the welfare of children, advocate against cyberbullying, and prevent opioid abuse [210] [247] The initiative's name drew ridicule in the press for its grammatical structure [248] Instead of creating new programs like previous first ladies' projects, Be Best promoted existing initiatives and organizations that worked toward the cause Public awareness of the initiative remained low, and it was often regarded solely as an anti-cyberbullying campaign [249]\n\n\nCOVID-19 and 2020 presidential campaign\nMelania carried out a major reorganization of her staff in April 2020 in anticipation of her husband's reelection campaign She appointed Marcia Lee Kelly as her senior advisor and Emma Doyle as her policy advisor Melania's chief of staff, Lindsay Reynolds, was removed; her responsibilities went to Melania's communications director, Stephanie Grisham [181] Melania became an active campaigner for her husband during the 2020 presidential election, which was a strong contrast to her 2016 activity [252]\n\n\nAfter the White House (2021–present)\nAfter the Trumps left the White House, Melania returned to Mar-a-Lago, where she could live while avoiding public attention [161] She retained one White House advisor, Marcia Lee Kelly, to help her during the post-presidency [220] Melania kept in contact with her successor Jill Biden, and the two have exchanged birthday cards [189] Since her tenure as first lady ended, Melania has made occasional paid speaking appearances, she has founded a scholarship program for foster children, and she has minted a line of Apollo 11–themed non-fungible tokens that were not in compliance with NASA's image use policy [161] In November 2023, Melania attended the memorial service for former First Lady Rosalynn Carter [260]\n\n\nPublic image\nMelania limits her interactions with the public, creating a public image heavily influenced by speculation [265] She worked to protect her privacy as first lady, [266] and her staff was instructed not to

his wood carving made in 1556 was based on a culled aurochs, which he had received in Mazovia [33] In 1827, Charles Hamilton Smith published an image of an aurochs that was based on an oil painting that he had purchased from a merchant in Augsburg, which is thought to have been made in the early 16th century [34] This painting is thought to have shown an aurochs, [5] [35] although some authors suggested it may have shown a hybrid between an aurochs and domestic cattle, or a Polish steer [36] Contemporary reconstructions of the aurochs are based on skeletons and the information derived from contemporaneous artistic depictions and historic descriptions of the animal [5]\n\n\nCoat colour\nRemains of aurochs hair were not known until the early 1980s [37] Depictions show that the North African aurochs may have had a light saddle marking on its back [35] Calves were probably born with a chestnut colour, and young bulls changed to black with a white eel stripe running down the spine, while cows retained a reddish-brown colour Both sexes had a light-coloured muzzle, but evidence for variation in coat colour does not exist Egyptian grave paintings show cattle with a reddish-brown coat colour in both sexes, with a light saddle, but the horn shape of these suggest that they may depict domesticated cattle [5]\nMany primitive cattle breeds, particularly those from Southern Europe, display similar coat colours to the aurochs, including the black colour in bulls with a light eel stripe, a pale mouth, and similar sexual dimorphism in colour [5] [35] A feature often attributed to the aurochs is blond forehead hairs According to historical descriptions of the aurochs, it had long and curly forehead hair, but none mentions a certain colour Although the colour is present in a variety of primitive cattle breeds, it is probably a discolouration that appeared after domestication [5]\n\n\nBody shape\nThe proportions and body shape of the aurochs were strikingly different from many modern cattle breeds For example, the legs were considerably longer and more slender, resulting in a shoulder height that nearly equalled the trunk length The skull, carrying the large horns, was substantially larger and more elongated than in most cattle breeds As in other wild bovines, the body shape of the aurochs was athletic, and especially in bulls, showed a strongly expressed neck and shoulder musculature Therefore, the fore hand was larger than the rear, similar to the wisent, but unlike many domesticated cattle Even in carrying cows, the udder was small and hardly visible from the side; this feature is equal to that of other wild bovines [5]\n\n\nSize\nThe aurochs was one of the largest herbivores in Holocene Europe The size of an aurochs appears to have varied by region, with larger specimens in northern Europe than farther south Aurochs in Denmark and Germany ranged in height at the shoulders between 155–180 cm (61–71 in) in bulls and 135–155 cm (53–61 in) in cows, while aurochs bulls in Hungary reached 160 cm (63 in) [38]\n\n\nHorns\nThe horns were massive, reaching 80 cm (31 in) in length and between 10 and 20 cm (3.9 and 7.9 in) in diameter [35] Its horns grew from the skull at a 60-degree angle to the muzzle facing forwards and were curved in three directions, namely upwards and outwards at the base, then swinging forwards and inwards, then inwards and upwards The curvature of bull horns was more strongly expressed than horns of cows [5] The basal circumference of horn cores reached 44.5 cm (17.5 in) in the largest Chinese specimen and 48 cm (19 in) in a French specimen [41] Some cattle breeds still show horn shapes similar to that of the aurochs, such as the Spanish fighting bull, and occasionally also individuals of derived breeds [5]\n\n\nGenetics\nA well-preserved aurochs bone yielded sufficient mitochondrial DNA for a sequence analysis, which showed that its genome consists of 16,338 base pairs [42] Further studies using the aurochs whole genome sequence have identified candidate microRNA-regulated domestication genes [43]\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe aurochs was widely distributed in North Africa, Mesopotamia, and throughout Europe to the Pontic–Caspian steppe, Caucasus and Western Siberia in the west and to the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga in the north [44]\n\n\nExtinction\nThe Indian aurochs (B p namadicus) became extinct during the Indus Valley Civilisation, likely due to habitat loss caused by expanding pastoralism and interbreeding with the domestic zebu [50] [51] The latest-known remains were dated to 3,800 YBP, making it the first of the three aurochs subspecies to die out [52]\n\n\nBehaviour and ecology\nAurochs formed small herds mainly in winter, but typically lived singly or in smaller groups during the summer [44] If aurochs had social behaviour similar to their descendants, social status would have been gained through displays and fights, in which both cows and bulls engaged [35] With its hypsodont jaw, the aurochs was probably a grazer, with a food selection very similar to domesticated cattle [5] feeding on grass, twigs and acorns [44]\n\n\nCultural significance\nAcheulean layers in Hunasagi on India's southern Deccan Plateau yielded aurochs bones with cut marks [62] An aurochs bone with cut marks induced with flint was found in a Middle Paleolithic layer at the Nesher Ramla Homo site in Israel; it was dated to Marine Isotope Stage 5 about 120,000 years ago [63] An archaeological excavation in Israel found traces of a feast held by the Natufian culture around 12,000 years BP, in which three aurochs were eaten This appears to be an uncommon occurrence in the culture and was held in conjunction with the burial of an older woman, presumably of some social status [64] Petroglyphs depicting aurochs in Gobustan Rock Art in Azerbaijan date to the Upper Paleolithic to Neolithic periods [65]\nAurochs bones and skulls found at the settlements of Mureybet, Hallan Çemi and Çayönü indicate that people stored and shared food in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B culture [66]\nRemains of an aurochs were also found in a necropolis in Sidon, Lebanon, dating to around 3,700 years BP; the aurochs was buried together with numerous animals, a few human bones and foods [67]\n\n\nIn Asia\nAcheulean layers in Hunasagi on India's southern Deccan Plateau yielded aurochs bones with cut marks [62] An aurochs bone with cut marks induced with flint was found in a Middle Paleolithic layer at the Nesher Ramla Homo site in Israel; it was dated to Marine Isotope Stage 5 about 120,000 years ago [63] An archaeological excavation in Israel found traces of a feast held by the Natufian culture around 12,000 years BP, in which three aurochs were eaten This appears to be an uncommon occurrence in the culture and was held in conjunction with the burial of an older woman, presumably of some social status [64] Petroglyphs depicting aurochs in Gobustan Rock Art in Azerbaijan date to the Upper Paleolithic to Neolithic periods [65]\nAurochs bones and skulls found at the settlements of Mureybet, Hallan Çemi and Çayönü indicate that people stored and shared food in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B culture [66]\nRemains of an aurochs were also found in a necropolis in Sidon, Lebanon, dating to around 3,700 years BP; the aurochs was buried together with numerous animals, a few human bones and foods [67]\n\n\nIn Africa\nPetroglyphs depicting aurochs found in Qurta in the upper Nile valley were dated to the Late Pleistocene about 19–15,000 years BP using luminescence dating and are the oldest engravings found to date in Africa [73] Aurochs are part of hunting scenes in reliefs in a tomb at Thebes, Egypt dating to the 20th century BC, and in the mortuary temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu dating to around 1175 BC The latter is the youngest depiction of aurochs in Ancient Egyptian art to date [74]\n\n\nIn Europe\nThe aurochs is widely represented in Paleolithic cave paintings in the Chauvet and Lascaux caves in southern France dating to 36,000 and 21,000 years BP, respectively [75]\nTwo Paleolithic rock engravings in the Calabrian Romito Cave depict an aurochs [76]\nPalaeolithic engravings showing aurochs were also found in the Grotta del Genovese on the Italian island of Levanzo [77]\nUpper Paleolithic rock engravings and paintings depicting the aurochs were also found in caves on the Iberian Peninsula dating from the Gravettian to the Magdalenian cultures [78] [79] [80]\nAurochs bones with chop and cut marks were found at various Mesolithic hunting and butchering sites in France, Luxemburg, Germany, the Netherlands, England and Denmark [81] Aurochs bones were also found in Mesolithic settlements by the Narva and Emajõgi rivers in Estonia [82] Aurochs and human bones were uncovered from pits and burnt mounds at several Neolithic sites in England [83]\nA cup found in the Greek site of Vaphio shows a hunting scene, in which people try to capture an aurochs [84] One of the bulls throws one hunter on the ground while attacking the second with its horns The cup seems to date to Mycenaean Greece [85] [86] Greeks and Paeonians hunted aurochs and used their huge horns as trophies, cups for wine, and offerings to the gods and heroes The ox mentioned by Samus, Philippus of Thessalonica and Antipater as killed by Philip V of Macedon on the foothills of mountain Orvilos, was actually an aurochs; Philip offered the horns, which were 105 cm (41 in) long and the skin to a temple of Hercules [87]\nThe aurochs was described in Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico [6]\nAurochs were occasionally captured and exhibited in venatio shows in Roman amphitheatres such as the Colosseum [88] Aurochs horns were often used by Romans as hunting horns [5]\n\n\nDomestication\nThe earliest-known domestication of the aurochs dates to the Neolithic Revolution in the Fertile Crescent, where cattle hunted and kept by Neolithic farmers gradually decreased in size between 9800 and 7500 BC Aurochs bones found at Mureybet and Göbekli Tepe are larger in size than cattle bones from later Neolithic settlements in northern Syria like Dja'de el-Mughara and Tell Halula [93]\nIn Late Neolithic sites of northern Iraq and western Iran dating to the sixth millennium BC, cattle remains are also smaller but more frequent, indicating that domesticated cattle were imported during the Halaf culture from the central Fertile Crescent region [94]\nResults of genetic research indicate that the modern taurine cattle (Bos taurus) arose from 80 aurochs tamed in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria about 10,500 years ago [15]\nTaurine cattle spread into the Balkans and northern Italy along the Danube River and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea [95]\nHybridisation between male aurochs and early domestic cattle occurred in central Europe between 9500 and 1000 BC [96]\nAnalyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences of Italian aurochs specimens dated to 17–7,000 years ago and 51 modern cattle breeds revealed some degree of introgression of aurochs genes into south European cattle, indicating that female aurochs had contact with free-ranging domestic cattle [97] Cattle bones of various sizes found at a Chalcolithic settlement in the Kutná Hora District provide further evidence for hybridisation of aurochs and domestic cattle between 3000 and 2800 BC in the Bohemian region [38]\nWhole genome sequencing of a 6,750-year-old aurochs bone found in England was compared with genome sequence data of 81 cattle and single-nucleotide polymorphism data of 1,225 cattle Results revealed that British and Irish cattle breeds share some genetic variants with the aurochs specimen; early herders in Britain might have been responsible for the local gene flow from aurochs into the ancestors of British and Irish cattle [98] The Murboden cattle breed also exhibits sporadic introgression of female European aurochs into domestic cattle in the Alps [99] Domestic cattle continued to diminish in both body and horn size until the Middle Ages [84]\n\n\nBreeding of aurochs-like cattle\nIn the early 1920s, Heinz Heck initiated a selective breeding program in Hellabrunn Zoo attempting to breed back the aurochs using several cattle breeds; the result is called Heck cattle [103]\nHerds of these cattle were released to Oostvaardersplassen, a polder in the Netherlands in the 1980s as aurochs surrogates for naturalistic grazing with the aim to restore prehistorical landscapes [104] Large numbers of them died of starvation during the cold winters of 2005 and 2010, and the project of no interference ended in 2018 [105]\n\n\nSee also\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Aurochs**\n\nThe aurochs (Bos primigenius) is an extinct species of large bovine that once roamed across much of Eurasia and North Africa. It is considered one of the most iconic and majestic animals of the prehistoric era, known for its impressive size, strength, and distinctive horns.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nBoth \"aur\" and \"ur\" are Germanic or Celtic words meaning \"wild ox\". In Old High German, this word was compounded with \"ohso\" ('ox') to \"ūrohso\", which became the early modern Aurochs. The Latin word \"urus\" was used for wild ox from the Gallic Wars onwards.\n\n**Taxonomy and Evolution**\n\nThe scientific name Bos taurus was introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for feral cattle in Poland. The scientific name Bos primigenius was proposed for the aurochs by Ludwig Heinrich Bojanus who described the skeletal differences between the aurochs and domestic cattle in 1825, published in 1827. The name Bos namadicus was used by Hugh Falconer in 1859 for cattle fossils found in Nerbudda deposits. Bos primigenius mauritanicus was coined by Philippe Thomas in 1881 who described fossils found in deposits near Oued Seguen west of Constantine, Algeria.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nCalibrations using fossils of 16 Bovidae species indicate that the Bovini tribe evolved about 11.7 million years ago. The Bos and Bison genetic lineages are estimated to have genetically diverged from the Bovini about 2.5 to 1.65 million years ago. The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic relationships of the aurochs based on analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in the Bovini tribe.\n\n**Description**\n\nAccording to a 16th-century description by Sigismund von Herberstein, the aurochs was pitch-black with a grey streak along the back. His wood carving made in 1556 was based on a culled aurochs, which he had received in Mazovia. In 1827, Charles Hamilton Smith published an image of an aurochs that was based on an oil painting that he had purchased from a merchant in Augsburg, which is thought to have been made in the early 16th century. This painting is thought to have shown an aurochs, although some authors suggested it may have shown a hybrid between an aurochs and domestic cattle, or a Polish steer. Contemporary reconstructions of the aurochs are based on skeletons and the information derived from contemporaneous artistic depictions and historic descriptions of the animal.\n\n**Coat Colour**\n\nRemains of aurochs hair were not known until the early 1980s. Depictions show that the North African aurochs may have had a light saddle marking on its back. Calves were probably born with a chestnut colour, and young bulls changed to black with a white eel stripe running down the spine, while cows retained a reddish-brown colour. Both sexes had a light-coloured muzzle, but evidence for variation in coat colour does not exist.\n\n**Body Shape**\n\nThe proportions and body shape of the aurochs were strikingly different from many modern cattle breeds. For example, the legs were considerably longer and more slender, resulting in a shoulder height that nearly equalled the trunk length. The skull, carrying the large horns, was substantially larger and more elongated than in most cattle breeds. As in other wild bovines, the body shape of the aurochs was athletic, and especially in bulls, showed a strongly expressed neck and shoulder musculature.\n\n**Size**\n\nThe aurochs was one of the largest herbivores in Holocene Europe. The size of an aurochs appears to have varied by region, with larger specimens in northern Europe than farther south. Aurochs in Denmark and Germany ranged in height at the shoulders between 155 and 180 cm (61 and 71 in) in bulls and 135 and 155 cm (53 and 61 in) in cows, while aurochs bulls in Hungary reached 160 cm (63 in).\n\n**Horns**\n\nThe horns were massive, reaching 80 cm (31 in) in length and between 10 and 20 cm (3.9 and 7.9 in) in diameter. Its horns grew from the skull at a 60-degree angle to the muzzle facing forwards and were curved in three directions, namely upwards and outwards at the base, then swinging forwards and inwards, then inwards and upwards. The curvature of bull horns was more strongly expressed than horns of cows.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nA well-preserved aurochs bone yielded sufficient mitochondrial DNA for a sequence analysis, which showed that its genome consists of 16,338 base pairs. Further studies using the aurochs whole genome sequence have identified candidate microRNA-regulated domestication genes.\n\n**Distribution and Habitat**\n\nThe aurochs was widely distributed in North Africa, Mesopotamia, and throughout Europe to the Pontic-Caspian steppe, Caucasus and Western Siberia in the west and to the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga in the north.\n\n**Extinction**\n\nThe Indian aurochs (B p namadicus) became extinct during the Indus Valley Civilisation, likely due to habitat loss caused by expanding pastoralism and interbreeding with the domestic zebu. The latest-known remains were dated to 3,800 YBP, making it the first of the three aurochs subspecies to die out.\n\n**Behaviour and Ecology**\n\nAurochs formed small herds mainly in winter, but typically lived singly or in smaller groups during the summer. If aurochs had social behaviour similar to their descendants, social status would have been gained through displays and fights, in which both cows and bulls engaged. With its hypsodont jaw, the aurochs was probably a grazer, with a food selection very similar to domesticated cattle, feeding on grass, twigs and acorns.\n\n**Cultural Significance**\n\nAcheulean layers in Hunasagi on India's southern Deccan Plateau yielded aurochs bones with cut marks. An aurochs bone with cut marks induced with flint was found in a Middle Paleolithic layer at the Nesher Ramla Homo site in Israel; it was dated to Marine Isotope Stage 5 about 120,000 years ago. An archaeological excavation in Israel found traces of a feast held by the Natufian culture around 12,000 years BP, in which three aurochs were eaten. This appears to be an uncommon occurrence in the culture and was held in conjunction with the burial of an older woman, presumably of some social status.\n\n**Domestication**\n\nThe earliest-known domestication of the aurochs dates to the Neolithic Revolution in the Fertile Crescent, where cattle hunted and kept by Neolithic farmers gradually decreased in size between 9800 and 7500 BC. Aurochs bones found at Mureybet and Göbekli Tepe are larger in size than cattle bones from later Neolithic settlements in northern Syria like Dja'de el-Mughara and Tell Halula.\n\n**Breeding of Aurochs-like Cattle**\n\nIn the early 1920s, Heinz Heck initiated a selective breeding program in Hellabrunn Zoo attempting to breed back the aurochs using several cattle breeds. The result is called Heck cattle. Herds of these cattle were released to Oostvaardersplassen, a polder in the Netherlands in the 1980s as aurochs surrogates for naturalistic grazing with the aim to restore prehistorical landscapes.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Heck cattle\n* Aurochs surrogates\n* Naturalistic grazing\n* Prehistoric landscapes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Aurochs\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nBoth \"aur\" and \"ur\" are Germanic or Celtic words meaning \"wild ox\" [3] [4]\nIn Old High German, this word was compounded with ohso ('ox') to ūrohso, which became the early modern Aurochs [5] The Latin word \"urus\" was used for wild ox from the Gallic Wars onwards [4] [6]\n\n\nTaxonomy and evolution\nThe scientific name Bos taurus was introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for feral cattle in Poland [9]\nThe scientific name Bos primigenius was proposed for the aurochs by Ludwig Heinrich Bojanus who described the skeletal differences between the aurochs and domestic cattle in 1825, published in 1827 [2] [10] The name Bos namadicus was used by Hugh Falconer in 1859 for cattle fossils found in Nerbudda deposits [11]\nBos primigenius mauritanicus was coined by Philippe Thomas in 1881 who described fossils found in deposits near Oued Seguen west of Constantine, Algeria [12]\n\n\nEvolution\nCalibrations using fossils of 16 Bovidae species indicate that the Bovini tribe evolved about 11.7 million years ago [18] The Bos and Bison genetic lineages are estimated to have genetically diverged from the Bovini about 2.5 to 1.65 million years ago [19] [20] The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic relationships of the aurochs based on analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in the Bovini tribe: [19] [21] [22]\n\n\nDescription\nAccording to a 16th-century description by Sigismund von Herberstein, the aurochs was pitch-black with a grey streak along the back; his wood carving made in 1556 was based on a culled aurochs, which he had received in Mazovia [33] In 1827, Charles Hamilton Smith published an image of an aurochs that was based on an oil painting that he had purchased from a merchant in Augsburg, which is thought to have been made in the early 16th century [34] This painting is thought to have shown an aurochs, [5] [35] although some authors suggested it may have shown a hybrid between an aurochs and domestic cattle, or a Polish steer [36] Contemporary reconstructions of the aurochs are based on skeletons and the information derived from contemporaneous artistic depictions and historic descriptions of the animal [5]\n\n\nCoat colour\nRemains of aurochs hair were not known until the early 1980s [37] Depictions show that the North African aurochs may have had a light saddle marking on its back [35] Calves were probably born with a chestnut colour, and young bulls changed to black with a white eel stripe running down the spine, while cows retained a reddish-brown colour Both sexes had a light-coloured muzzle, but evidence for variation in coat colour does not exist Egyptian grave paintings show cattle with a reddish-brown coat colour in both sexes, with a light saddle, but the horn shape of these suggest that they may depict domesticated cattle [5]\nMany primitive cattle breeds, particularly those from Southern Europe, display similar coat colours to the aurochs, including the black colour in bulls with a light eel stripe, a pale mouth, and similar sexual dimorphism in colour [5] [35] A feature often attributed to the aurochs is blond forehead hairs According to historical descriptions of the aurochs, it had long and curly forehead hair, but none mentions a certain colour Although the colour is present in a variety of primitive cattle breeds, it is probably a discolouration that appeared after domestication [5]\n\n\nBody shape\nThe proportions and body shape of the aurochs were strikingly different from many modern cattle breeds For example, the legs were considerably longer and more slender, resulting in a shoulder height that nearly equalled the trunk length The skull, carrying the large horns, was substantially larger and more elongated than in most cattle breeds As in other wild bovines, the body shape of the aurochs was athletic, and especially in bulls, showed a strongly expressed neck and shoulder musculature Therefore, the fore hand was larger than the rear, similar to the wisent, but unlike many domesticated cattle Even in carrying cows, the udder was small and hardly visible from the side; this feature is equal to that of other wild bovines [5]\n\n\nSize\nThe aurochs was one of the largest herbivores in Holocene Europe The size of an aurochs appears to have varied by region, with larger specimens in northern Europe than farther south Aurochs in Denmark and Germany ranged in height at the shoulders between 155–180 cm (61–71 in) in bulls and 135–155 cm (53–61 in) in cows, while aurochs bulls in Hungary reached 160 cm (63 in) [38]\n\n\nHorns\nThe horns were massive, reaching 80 cm (31 in) in length and between 10 and 20 cm (3.9 and 7.9 in) in diameter [35] Its horns grew from the skull at a 60-degree angle to the muzzle facing forwards and were curved in three directions, namely upwards and outwards at the base, then swinging forwards and inwards, then inwards and upwards The curvature of bull horns was more strongly expressed than horns of cows [5] The basal circumference of horn cores reached 44.5 cm (17.5 in) in the largest Chinese specimen and 48 cm (19 in) in a French specimen [41] Some cattle breeds still show horn shapes similar to that of the aurochs, such as the Spanish fighting bull, and occasionally also individuals of derived breeds [5]\n\n\nGenetics\nA well-preserved aurochs bone yielded sufficient mitochondrial DNA for a sequence analysis, which showed that its genome consists of 16,338 base pairs [42] Further studies using the aurochs whole genome sequence have identified candidate microRNA-regulated domestication genes [43]\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe aurochs was widely distributed in North Africa, Mesopotamia, and throughout Europe to the Pontic–Caspian steppe, Caucasus and Western Siberia in the west and to the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga in the north [44]\n\n\nExtinction\nThe Indian aurochs (B p namadicus) became extinct during the Indus Valley Civilisation, likely due to habitat loss caused by expanding pastoralism and interbreeding with the domestic zebu [50] [51] The latest-known remains were dated to 3,800 YBP, making it the first of the three aurochs subspecies to die out [52]\n\n\nBehaviour and ecology\nAurochs formed small herds mainly in winter, but typically lived singly or in smaller groups during the summer [44] If aurochs had social behaviour similar to their descendants, social status would have been gained through displays and fights, in which both cows and bulls engaged [35] With its hypsodont jaw, the aurochs was probably a grazer, with a food selection very similar to domesticated cattle [5] feeding on grass, twigs and acorns [44]\n\n\nCultural significance\nAcheulean layers in Hunasagi on India's southern Deccan Plateau yielded aurochs bones with cut marks [62] An aurochs bone with cut marks induced with flint was found in a Middle Paleolithic layer at the Nesher Ramla Homo site in Israel; it was dated to Marine Isotope Stage 5 about 120,000 years ago [63] An archaeological excavation in Israel found traces of a feast held by the Natufian culture around 12,000 years BP, in which three aurochs were eaten This appears to be an uncommon occurrence in the culture and was held in conjunction with the burial of an older woman, presumably of some social status [64] Petroglyphs depicting aurochs in Gobustan Rock Art in Azerbaijan date to the Upper Paleolithic to Neolithic periods [65]\nAurochs bones and skulls found at the settlements of Mureybet, Hallan Çemi and Çayönü indicate that people stored and shared food in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B culture [66]\nRemains of an aurochs were also found in a necropolis in Sidon, Lebanon, dating to around 3,700 years BP; the aurochs was buried together with numerous animals, a few human bones and foods [67]\n\n\nIn Asia\nAcheulean layers in Hunasagi on India's southern Deccan Plateau yielded aurochs bones with cut marks [62] An aurochs bone with cut marks induced with flint was found in a Middle Paleolithic layer at the Nesher Ramla Homo site in Israel; it was dated to Marine Isotope Stage 5 about 120,000 years ago [63] An archaeological excavation in Israel found traces of a feast held by the Natufian culture around 12,000 years BP, in which three aurochs were eaten This appears to be an uncommon occurrence in the culture and was held in conjunction with the burial of an older woman, presumably of some social status [64] Petroglyphs depicting aurochs in Gobustan Rock Art in Azerbaijan date to the Upper Paleolithic to Neolithic periods [65]\nAurochs bones and skulls found at the settlements of Mureybet, Hallan Çemi and Çayönü indicate that people stored and shared food in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B culture [66]\nRemains of an aurochs were also found in a necropolis in Sidon, Lebanon, dating to around 3,700 years BP; the aurochs was buried together with numerous animals, a few human bones and foods [67]\n\n\nIn Africa\nPetroglyphs depicting aurochs found in Qurta in the upper Nile valley were dated to the Late Pleistocene about 19–15,000 years BP using luminescence dating and are the oldest engravings found to date in Africa [73] Aurochs are part of hunting scenes in reliefs in a tomb at Thebes, Egypt dating to the 20th century BC, and in the mortuary temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu dating to around 1175 BC The latter is the youngest depiction of aurochs in Ancient Egyptian art to date [74]\n\n\nIn Europe\nThe aurochs is widely represented in Paleolithic cave paintings in the Chauvet and Lascaux caves in southern France dating to 36,000 and 21,000 years BP, respectively [75]\nTwo Paleolithic rock engravings in the Calabrian Romito Cave depict an aurochs [76]\nPalaeolithic engravings showing aurochs were also found in the Grotta del Genovese on the Italian island of Levanzo [77]\nUpper Paleolithic rock engravings and paintings depicting the aurochs were also found in caves on the Iberian Peninsula dating from the Gravettian to the Magdalenian cultures [78] [79] [80]\nAurochs bones with chop and cut marks were found at various Mesolithic hunting and butchering sites in France, Luxemburg, Germany, the Netherlands, England and Denmark [81] Aurochs bones were also found in Mesolithic settlements by the Narva and Emajõgi rivers in Estonia [82] Aurochs and human bones were uncovered from pits and burnt mounds at several Neolithic sites in England [83]\nA cup found in the Greek site of Vaphio shows a hunting scene, in which people try to capture an aurochs [84] One of the bulls throws one hunter on the ground while attacking the second with its horns The cup seems to date to Mycenaean Greece [85] [86] Greeks and Paeonians hunted aurochs and used their huge horns as trophies, cups for wine, and offerings to the gods and heroes The ox mentioned by Samus, Philippus of Thessalonica and Antipater as killed by Philip V of Macedon on the foothills of mountain Orvilos, was actually an aurochs; Philip offered the horns, which were 105 cm (41 in) long and the skin to a temple of Hercules [87]\nThe aurochs was described in Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico [6]\nAurochs were occasionally captured and exhibited in venatio shows in Roman amphitheatres such as the Colosseum [88] Aurochs horns were often used by Romans as hunting horns [5]\n\n\nDomestication\nThe earliest-known domestication of the aurochs dates to the Neolithic Revolution in the Fertile Crescent, where cattle hunted and kept by Neolithic farmers gradually decreased in size between 9800 and 7500 BC Aurochs bones found at Mureybet and Göbekli Tepe are larger in size than cattle bones from later Neolithic settlements in northern Syria like Dja'de el-Mughara and Tell Halula [93]\nIn Late Neolithic sites of northern Iraq and western Iran dating to the sixth millennium BC, cattle remains are also smaller but more frequent, indicating that domesticated cattle were imported during the Halaf culture from the central Fertile Crescent region [94]\nResults of genetic research indicate that the modern taurine cattle (Bos taurus) arose from 80 aurochs tamed in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria about 10,500 years ago [15]\nTaurine cattle spread into the Balkans and northern Italy along the Danube River and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea [95]\nHybridisation between male aurochs and early domestic cattle occurred in central Europe between 9500 and 1000 BC [96]\nAnalyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences of Italian aurochs specimens dated to 17–7,000 years ago and 51 modern cattle breeds revealed some degree of introgression of aurochs genes into south European cattle, indicating that female aurochs had contact with free-ranging domestic cattle [97] Cattle bones of various sizes found at a Chalcolithic settlement in the Kutná Hora District provide further evidence for hybridisation of aurochs and domestic cattle between 3000 and 2800 BC in the Bohemian region [38]\nWhole genome sequencing of a 6,750-year-old aurochs bone found in England was compared with genome sequence data of 81 cattle and single-nucleotide polymorphism data of 1,225 cattle Results revealed that British and Irish cattle breeds share some genetic variants with the aurochs specimen; early herders in Britain might have been responsible for the local gene flow from aurochs into the ancestors of British and Irish cattle [98] The Murboden cattle breed also exhibits sporadic introgression of female European aurochs into domestic cattle in the Alps [99] Domestic cattle continued to diminish in both body and horn size until the Middle Ages [84]\n\n\nBreeding of aurochs-like cattle\nIn the early 1920s, Heinz Heck initiated a selective breeding program in Hellabrunn Zoo attempting to breed back the aurochs using several cattle breeds; the result is called Heck cattle [103]\nHerds of these cattle were released to Oostvaardersplassen, a polder in the Netherlands in the 1980s as aurochs surrogates for naturalistic grazing with the aim to restore prehistorical landscapes [104] Large numbers of them died of starvation during the cold winters of 2005 and 2010, and the project of no interference ended in 2018 [105]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

matters reserved for States However, this can only be done if the Rajya Sabha first passes a resolution by a two-third majority granting such a power to the Union Parliament The Union government cannot make a law on a matter reserved for States without any authorisation from the Rajya Sabha.\n\n\nCreation of All-India services\nThe Rajya Sabha, by a two-thirds supermajority, can pass a resolution empowering the Indian government to create more all-India services common to both the union and the states.\n\n\nMembership by party\nMembers of the Rajya Sabha by their political party (as of 11 October 2024 [update]):\n\n\nComposition\nSeats are allotted in proportion to the population of each state or union territory Certain states may even have more representatives than states more populous than them, because in past they too had high population For example, Tamil Nadu has 18 representatives for 72 million inhabitants (in 2011) whereas Bihar (104 million) and West Bengal (91 million) only have 16 As the members are elected by the state legislature, some small union territories, those without legislatures, cannot have representation Hence, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Ladakh and Lakshadweep do not send any representatives Twelve members are nominated by the president [14] [15]\n\n\nNumber of members by state/union territory\n28 (4)\n\n\nOfficers\nBesides the chairman (vice-president of India) and the deputy chairman, there is also a position called leader of the House This is a cabinet minister – the prime minister if they are a member of the House or another nominated minister The leader has a seat next to the chairman, in the front row.\n\n\nLeader of the House\nBesides the chairman (vice-president of India) and the deputy chairman, there is also a position called leader of the House This is a cabinet minister – the prime minister if they are a member of the House or another nominated minister The leader has a seat next to the chairman, in the front row.\n\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nBesides the leader of the House, who is the government's chief representative in the House, there is also a leader of the opposition (LOP) – leading the opposition parties The function was only recognized in the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of the Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977 This is commonly the leader of the largest non-government party and is recognized as such by the chairman.\n\n\nSecretariat\nThe Secretariat of the Rajya Sabha was set up under the provisions contained in Article 98 of the Constitution The said Article, which provides for a separate secretarial staff for each house of Parliament, reads as follows:- 98 Secretariat of Parliament – Each House of Parliament shall have a separate secretarial staff: Provided that nothing in this clause shall be construed as preventing the creation of posts common to both Houses of Parliament (2) Parliament may by law regulate the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to the secretarial staff of either House of Parliament [17]\n\n\nMedia\nSansad TV (STV) is a 24-hour

autobiography ends with \"I play for Jon-Paul\" Gerrard's cousin, Jon-Paul Gilhooley, was killed in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, when Gerrard was eight Jon-Paul, who was 10 when he died, was the youngest of the 97 victims of the tragedy [221] \"It was difficult knowing one of your cousins had lost his life\", Gerrard said \"Seeing his family's reaction drove me on to become the player I am today [222]\n\n\nLegal problems\nOn 1 October 2007, Gerrard was involved in a low-speed collision in Southport when the car he was driving hit a ten-year-old cyclist, who had shot into the street and inadvertently crossed Gerrard's path He later visited the boy in the hospital and presented him with a pair of boots signed by Wayne Rooney, the boy's favourite player, after which he stayed to sign autographs for other young patients [225]\n\n\nEntertainment\nIn 2011, Gerrard appeared in the film Will, about an orphaned young Liverpool fan who hitchhikes to Istanbul for the 2005 UEFA Champions League final [232] In August 2014, Gerrard participated in the ALS Association's Ice Bucket Challenge and went on to challenge Cardiff City winger, Craig Noone [233]\n\n\nSponsorship\nGerrard has had several different sponsorships in his career including current deals with Adidas, Jaguar Cars and Lucozade [234] In 2014, Forbes listed his combined income from salaries, bonuses and off-field

{"title": "United_Kingdom", "content": "\nEtymology and terminology\n\n\n\nHistory\nSettlement by Cro-Magnons of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago [60] The island has been continuously inhabited only since the last retreat of the ice around 11,500 years ago By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland [61]\n\n\nPrior to the Treaty of Union\nSettlement by Cro-Magnons of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago [60] The island has been continuously inhabited only since the last retreat of the ice around 11,500 years ago By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland [61]\n\n\nUnion of England and Scotland\nOn 1 May 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the Acts of Union 1707 between the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland [79] In the 18th century, cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole, in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742) A series of Jacobite uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs The British colonies in North America that broke away in the American War of Independence became the United States British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to India [80]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\nIn 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801 [84]\n\n\nWorld wars and partition of Ireland\nBritain was one of the principal Allies that defeated the Central Powers in the First World War (1914–1918) Alongside their French, Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts, [96] British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the Western Front [97] The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt [97] The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections to all adult men and most adult women with the Representation of the People Act 1918 [97] After the war, Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the League of Nations and received a mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies Under the leadership of David Lloyd George, the British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population [98]\n\n\nPostwar 20th century\nThe UK was one of the Big Three powers (along with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the post-war world; [108] it drafted the Declaration by United Nations with the United States and became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council It worked closely with the United States to establish the IMF, World Bank and NATO [109] The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the Marshall Plan, [110] but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe [111]\n\n\n21st century\nThe UK broadly supported the United States' approach to the \"war on terror\" in the early 21st century [127] British troops fought in the War in Afghanistan, but controversy surrounded Britain's military deployment in Iraq, which saw the largest protest in British history in opposition to the government led by Tony Blair [128]\n\n\nGeography\nThe total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 94,354 square miles (244,376 km2), [f] [12] with a land area of 93,723 square miles (242,741 km2) [12] The country occupies the major part of the British Isles [142] archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel [143]\n\n\nClimate\nMost of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round [143] The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0 °C (32 °F) or rising above 30 °C (86 °F) [151] Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate and the mountains experience a tundra climate [152]\n\n\nTopography\nEngland accounts for 53 per cent of the UK, covering 50,350 square miles (130,395 km2) [159] Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, [160] with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees–Exe line which roughly divides the UK into lowland and upland areas Lowland areas include Cornwall, the New Forest, the South Downs and the Norfolk Broads Upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, and Dartmoor The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames, Severn, and the Humber England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike, at 978 metres (3,209 ft) in the Lake District; its largest island is the Isle of Wight.\n\n\nPolitics\nThe UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy operating under the Westminster system, otherwise known as a \"democratic parliamentary monarchy\" [167] It is a centralised, unitary state [168] [169] wherein the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign [170] Parliament is made up of the elected House of Commons, the appointed House of Lords and the Crown (as personified by the monarch) [r] [173] The main business of parliament takes place in the two houses, [173] but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of parliament (that is, statute law) [174] As a result of parliamentary sovereignty, the British constitution is uncodified, consisting mostly of disparate written sources, including parliamentary statutes, judge-made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions [175] Nevertheless, the Supreme Court recognises a number of principles underlying the British constitution, such as parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy, and upholding international law [176]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe geographical division of the United Kingdom into counties or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages, and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early Modern Period [194] Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and Wales in 1888, Scotland in 1889 and Ireland in 1898, meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the UK [195]\nUntil the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function [196]\n\n\nDevolution\nIn the United Kingdom a process of devolution has transferred various powers from the UK Government to three of the four UK countries - Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, as well as to the regions of England These powers vary and have been moved to the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and in England, the Greater London Authority, Combined Authorities and Combined County Authorities [203]\n\n\nEngland\nUnlike Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, England does not have a separate devolved government or national parliament, [210] rather a process of devolution of powers from the central government to local authorities has taken place, first in 1998 [211] The Greater London Authority (GLA) was set up following a referendum in 1998 Colloquially known as City Hall, it is the devolved regional government body for Greater London It consists of two political branches: an Executive Mayor and the London Assembly, which serves as a check and balance on the Mayor.\n\n\nScotland\nSince 1999, Scotland has had a devolved national government and parliament with wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK Parliament [214] [215] Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an act of the UK parliament passed in 2020 [209]\n\n\nWales\nSince 1999, Wales has a devolved national government and legislature, known as the Senedd Elections to the Senedd use the additional member system It has more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland [225] The Senedd can legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament by Acts of Senedd Cymru The current Welsh Government is Labour, led by First Minister Eluned Morgan, who has been the First Minister since 2024 Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself.\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\nThe devolved form of government in Northern Ireland is based on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought to an end a 30-year period of unionist-nationalist communal conflict known as The Troubles The Agreement was confirmed by referendum and implemented later that year It established power sharing arrangements for a devolved government and legislature, referred to as the Executive and Assembly respectively [226] Elections to the Assembly use the single transferable vote system The Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland [227] The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly [228]  The First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland are the joint heads of government of Northern Ireland [229] [230] Local government in Northern Ireland since 2015 has been divided between 11 councils with limited responsibilities [201]\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of NATO, AUKUS, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe and the OSCE [231] The UK has the British Council which is a British organisation based in over 100 countries specialising in international cultural and educational opportunities The UK is said to have a \"Special Relationship\" with the United States and a close partnership with France – the \"Entente cordiale\" – and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries; [232] [233] the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a Common Travel Area and co-operate through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and military engagements [234] Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are former colonies of the British Empire which share King Charles as their head of state, are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by British people [235]\n\n\nLaw and criminal justice\nThe United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as Article 19 of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system [236] Today the UK has three distinct systems of law: English law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords [237] The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies [238]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe British Armed Forces consist of three professional service branches: the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (forming the Naval Service), the British Army and the Royal Air Force [252] The armed forces of the United Kingdom are managed by the Ministry of Defence and controlled by the Defence Council, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence The Commander-in-Chief is the British monarch, to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance [253] The Armed Forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts They are active and regular participants in NATO (including the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps), the Five Power Defence Arrangements, RIMPAC and other worldwide coalition operations Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in Ascension Island, Bahrain, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Oman, Qatar and Singapore [254]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe UK has a regulated social market economy [260] [261] [262] Based on market exchange rates, the UK is the sixth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe, both by nominal GDP Its currency, the pound sterling, is the fourth most-traded currency in the foreign exchange market and the world's fourth-largest reserve currency (after the United States dollar, euro, and yen) [263] Sterling was the 2nd best-performing G10 currency against the dollar in 2023 with a gain of about 5%, with only the Swiss franc performing better [264] [265] London is the world capital for foreign exchange trading, with a market share of 38.1% in 2022 [266] of the daily $7.5 trillion global turnover [267]\n\n\nScience and technology\nEngland and Scotland were leading centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century [301] The United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances [302] Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science; [303] from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory; and more recently Stephen Hawking, who advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes [304]\n\n\nTransport\nA radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads [143] The M25, encircling London, is the largest and busiest bypass in the world [310] In 2022, there were a total of 40.8 million licensed vehicles in Great Britain [311]\n\n\nEnergy\nIn 2021, the UK was the world's 14th-largest consumer of energy and the 22nd-largest producer [325] The UK is home to many large energy companies, including two of the six major oil and gas companies – BP and Shell [326]\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nAccess to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal It is estimated that 96 per cent of households are connected to the sewer network [338] According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007 [339]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn the 2011 census the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775 [341] It is the fourth-largest in Europe (after Russia, Germany and France), the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth [342] Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 per cent [341] The 2011 census also showed that, over the previous 100 years, the proportion of the population aged 0–14 fell from 31 per cent to 18 per cent, and the proportion of people aged 65 and over rose from 5 to 16 per cent [341] In 2018 the median age of the UK population was 41.7 years [343]\n\n\nEthnicity\nHistorically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 12th century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK [358] The UK has a history of non-white immigration with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade During this period it is estimated the Afro-Caribbean population of Great Britain was 10,000 to 15,000 [359] which later declined due to the abolition of slavery [360] The UK also has the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century [361] In 2011 [update], 87.2 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 12.8 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of an ethnic minority group [362]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe English language is the official and most spoken language of the United Kingdom [369] [370] The United Kingdom proactively promotes the language globally to build connections, understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries worldwide [371] [372] It is estimated that 95 per cent of the UK's population are monolingual English speakers [373] Over 5.5 per cent of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent [when?] immigration [373] South Asian languages are the largest grouping which includes Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali, Sylheti, Hindi, Pahari-Pothwari, Tamil, and Gujarati [374] According to the 2011 census, Polish has become the second-largest language spoken in England and has 546,000 speakers [375] In 2019, some three-quarters of a million people spoke little or no English [376]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in the United Kingdom (2022 census) [385]\n\n\nMigration\nImmigration is now [when?] contributing to a rising UK population, [403] [404] with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 According to official statistics released in 2015, 27 per cent of UK live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK [405] The ONS reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 per cent to 239,000 [406]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system About 38 per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree, which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world [414] The United Kingdom is home to many universities, including the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge which often achieve first place on global rankings [415] [416]\n\n\nHealthcare\nThe modern system of universal publicly funded in the United Kingdom has its origins in the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1949 which still exists to this day and is the primary healthcare provider in the United Kingdom The widespread popularity of the NHS has led to it being described as a \"national religion\" [421] [422] Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each country has its own system of universal publicly funded healthcare, although private healthcare is also available Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation The World Health Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world [423]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of the United Kingdom is influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history; and being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism As a result of the British Empire, British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies, in particular, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland, a common culture known today as the Anglosphere [428] [429] The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led to it being described as a cultural superpower [116] [117] A global survey in 2023 ranked the UK 3rd in the 'Most Influential Countries' rankings (behind the US and China) [430]\n\n\nLiterature\nBritish literature includes literature associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands Most British literature is in English In 2022, 669 million physical books were sold in the UK, this is the highest overall level ever recorded [431] Britain is renowned for children's literature, writer's includes Daniel Defoe, Rudyard Kipling, Lewis Carroll and Beatrix Potter who also illustrated her own books Other writers include A.A Milne, Enid Blyton, J.R.R Tolkien, Roald Dahl, Terry Pratchett and J.K Rowling who wrote the best selling book series of all time [432]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nThe United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of 'British Empiricism', a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the 'Scottish School of Common Sense' [451] The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke, George Berkeley [x] and David Hume; while Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major exponents of the Scottish \"common sense\" school Two Britons are also notable for the ethical theory of utilitarianism, a moral philosophy first used by Jeremy Bentham and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work Utilitarianism [452]\n\n\nMusic\nVarious styles of music have become popular in the UK, including the indigenous folk music of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland Historically, there has been exceptional Renaissance music from the Tudor period, with masses, madrigals and lute music by Thomas Tallis, John Taverner, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons and John Dowland After the Stuart Restoration, an English tradition of dramatic masques, anthems and airs became established, led by Henry Purcell, followed by Thomas Arne and others The German-born composer George Frideric Handel became a naturalised British citizen in 1727, when he composed the anthem Zadok the Priest for the coronation of George II; it became the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs Handel's many oratorios, such as his famous Messiah, were written in the English language [453] In the second half of the 19th century, as Arthur Sullivan and his librettist W S Gilbert wrote their popular Savoy operas, Edward Elgar's wide range of music rivalled that of his contemporaries on the continent Increasingly, however, composers became inspired by the English countryside and its folk music, notably Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Benjamin Britten, a pioneer of modern British opera Among the many post-war composers, some of the most notable have made their own personal choice of musical identity: Peter Maxwell Davies (Orkney), Harrison Birtwistle (mythological), and John Tavener (religious) [454] Today, recent classical singers include: Alfie Boe, Bryn Terfel, Katherine Jenkins, Michael Ball, Roderick Williams, Russell Watson and Sarah Brightman, while Nicola Benedetti and Nigel Kennedy are renowned for their violin ability [455]\n\n\nVisual art\nMajor British artists include: the Romantics William Blake, John Constable, Samuel Palmer and J M W Turner; the portrait painters Sir Joshua Reynolds and Lucian Freud; the landscape artists Thomas Gainsborough and L S Lowry; the pioneer of the Arts and Crafts Movement William Morris; the figurative painter Francis Bacon; the Pop artists Peter Blake, Richard Hamilton and David Hockney; the pioneers of Conceptual art movement Art & Language; [482] the collaborative duo Gilbert and George; the abstract artist Howard Hodgkin; and the sculptors Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Henry Moore During the late 1980s and 1990s the Saatchi Gallery in London helped to bring to public attention a group of multi-genre artists who would become known as the \"Young British Artists\": Damien Hirst, Chris Ofili, Rachel Whiteread, Tracey Emin, Mark Wallinger, Steve McQueen, Sam Taylor-Wood and the Chapman Brothers are among the better-known members of this loosely affiliated movement.\n\n\nCinema\nThe United Kingdom has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema The British directors Alfred Hitchcock, whose film Vertigo is considered by some critics as the best film of all time, [484] and David Lean who directed Lawrence of Arabia are among the most critically acclaimed directors of all time [485] Recent popular directors include: Christopher Nolan, Sam Mendes, Steve McQueen, Richard Curtis, Danny Boyle, Tony Scott and Ridley Scott [486] [487] [488] [489] Many British actors have achieved international fame and critical success Some of the most commercially successful films of all time have been produced in the United Kingdom, including two of the highest-grossing film franchises (Harry Potter and James Bond) [490]\n\n\nCuisine\nBritish cuisine developed from various influences reflective of its land, settlements, arrivals of new settlers and immigrants, trade and colonialism The food of England has historically been characterised by its simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce [495] The traditional Sunday roast is one example, featuring a roasted joint, usually of beef, lamb, chicken or pork, often free range (and generally grass-fed, in the case of beef) Roasts are served with either roasted or boiled vegetables, Yorkshire pudding, and gravy Other traditional meals include meat pies and various stews A 2019 YouGov poll rated classic British food, the following had more than 80% of people like them who had tried them: Sunday roast, Yorkshire pudding, Fish and chips, Crumpets, and Full English breakfast [496]\n\n\nMedia\nThe BBC, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world [501] [502] [503] It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television licence [504] The BBC World Service is an international broadcaster owned and operated by the BBC It is the world's largest of any kind [505] It broadcasts radio news, speech and discussions in more than 40 languages [506]\n\n\nSport\nAssociation football, tennis, table tennis, badminton, rugby union, rugby league, rugby sevens, golf, boxing, netball, water polo, field hockey, billiards, darts, rowing, rounders and cricket originated or were substantially developed in the UK, with the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in late 19th-century Victorian Britain [y]\n\n\nSymbols\nThe flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag (also referred to as the Union Jack) [527] It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the flag of England, representing Saint George, on the flag of Scotland, representing Saint Andrew, and was updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag [528] Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out [529] The national anthem of the United Kingdom is \"God Save the King\",

"article": "The United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom, commonly referred to as the UK, is a sovereign state located off the northwestern coast of mainland Europe. It is a union of four constituent countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The UK has a rich history, a diverse culture, and a strong economy, making it a major player on the world stage.\n\n# Geography\n\nThe UK is an archipelago, with a total area of approximately 94,354 square miles (244,376 km2). The country occupies the major part of the British Isles, including the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland, and several smaller surrounding islands. The UK is situated between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, with its southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France.\n\n# Climate\n\nMost of the UK has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round. The temperature varies with the seasons, seldom dropping below 0°C (32°F) or rising above 30°C (86°F). Some parts of the UK, away from the coast, experience a subpolar oceanic climate, while higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate and the mountains experience a tundra climate.\n\n# Topography\n\nEngland accounts for 53% of the UK, covering 50,350 square miles (130,395 km2). Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees-Exe line. Lowland areas include Cornwall, the New Forest, the South Downs, and the Norfolk Broads, while upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, and Dartmoor. The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames, Severn, and the Humber. England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike, at 978 meters (3,209 ft) in the Lake District.\n\n# Politics\n\nThe UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy operating under the Westminster system. It is a centralised, unitary state, wherein the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign. Parliament is made up of the elected House of Commons, the appointed House of Lords, and the Crown (as personified by the monarch). The main business of parliament takes place in the two houses, but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of parliament.\n\n# Administrative Divisions\n\nThe geographical division of the UK into counties or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early Modern Period. Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and Wales in 1888, Scotland in 1889, and Ireland in 1898.\n\n# Devolution\n\nIn the UK, a process of devolution has transferred various powers from the UK Government to three of the four UK countries: Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. Each country has a devolved national government and legislature, with powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The UK Government retains control over certain areas, such as defense and foreign policy.\n\n# Foreign Relations\n\nThe UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of NATO, AUKUS, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe, and the OSCE. The UK has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United States and a close partnership with France, known as the Entente Cordiale.\n\n# Economy\n\nThe UK has a regulated social market economy, with a GDP of over $2.6 trillion. It is the sixth-largest economy in the world, the second-largest in Europe, and has a highly developed service sector. The UK is home to many large energy companies, including two of the six major oil and gas companies: BP and Shell.\n\n# Science and Technology\n\nThe UK has a strong tradition of scientific and technological innovation. It was a leading centre of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century and led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century. The UK is home to many world-renowned scientists and engineers, including Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, and Stephen Hawking.\n\n# Transport\n\nA radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways, and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads. The M25, encircling London, is the largest and busiest bypass in the world. In 2022, there were a total of 40.8 million licensed vehicles in Great Britain.\n\n# Energy\n\nIn 2021, the UK was the world's 14th-largest consumer of energy and the 22nd-largest producer. The UK is home to many large energy companies, including two of the six major oil and gas companies: BP and Shell.\n\n# Water Supply and Sanitation\n\nAccess to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal. It is estimated that 96% of households are connected to the sewer network. According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007.\n\n# Demographics\n\nIn the 2011 census, the total population of the UK was 63,181,775. The UK is the fourth-largest in Europe, the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth, and the 22nd-largest in the world. In mid-2014 and mid-2015, net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth. Between 2001 and 2011, the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7%.\n\n# Ethnicity\n\nHistorically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 12th century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse, and the Normans. The UK has a history of non-white immigration, with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country, dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade.\n\n# Languages\n\nThe English language is the official and most spoken language of the UK. It is estimated that 95% of the UK's population are monolingual English speakers. Over 5.5% of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent immigration.\n\n# Education\n\nEducation in the UK is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system. About 38% of the UK population has a university or college degree, which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world.\n\n# Healthcare\n\nThe modern system of universal publicly funded healthcare in the UK has its origins in the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1949, which still exists to this day and is the primary healthcare provider in the UK.\n\n# Culture\n\nThe culture of the UK is influenced by many factors, including the nation's island status, its history, and being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs, and symbolism. The UK has a rich cultural heritage, with many world-renowned artists, writers, and musicians, including J.M.W. Turner, William Blake, and Paul McCartney.\n\n# Symbols\n\nThe flag of the UK is the Union Flag (also referred to as the Union Jack), which was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the flag of England, representing Saint George, on the flag of Scotland, representing Saint Andrew, and was updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag. The national anthem of the UK is \"God Save the King,\" with \"King\" replaced with \"Queen\" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman.\n\nThe UK is a country with a rich history, a diverse culture, and a strong economy, making it a major player on the world stage. From its early days as a small island nation to its current status as a global superpower, the UK has played a significant role in shaping the world we live in today.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"United_Kingdom\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology and terminology\n\n\n\nHistory\nSettlement by Cro-Magnons of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago [60] The island has been continuously inhabited only since the last retreat of the ice around 11,500 years ago By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland [61]\n\n\nPrior to the Treaty of Union\nSettlement by Cro-Magnons of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago [60] The island has been continuously inhabited only since the last retreat of the ice around 11,500 years ago By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland [61]\n\n\nUnion of England and Scotland\nOn 1 May 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the Acts of Union 1707 between the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland [79] In the 18th century, cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole, in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742) A series of Jacobite uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs The British colonies in North America that broke away in the American War of Independence became the United States British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to India [80]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\nIn 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801 [84]\n\n\nWorld wars and partition of Ireland\nBritain was one of the principal Allies that defeated the Central Powers in the First World War (1914–1918) Alongside their French, Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts, [96] British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the Western Front [97] The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt [97] The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections to all adult men and most adult women with the Representation of the People Act 1918 [97] After the war, Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the League of Nations and received a mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies Under the leadership of David Lloyd George, the British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population [98]\n\n\nPostwar 20th century\nThe UK was one of the Big Three powers (along with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the post-war world; [108] it drafted the Declaration by United Nations with the United States and became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council It worked closely with the United States to establish the IMF, World Bank and NATO [109] The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the Marshall Plan, [110] but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe [111]\n\n\n21st century\nThe UK broadly supported the United States' approach to the \"war on terror\" in the early 21st century [127] British troops fought in the War in Afghanistan, but controversy surrounded Britain's military deployment in Iraq, which saw the largest protest in British history in opposition to the government led by Tony Blair [128]\n\n\nGeography\nThe total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 94,354 square miles (244,376 km2), [f] [12] with a land area of 93,723 square miles (242,741 km2) [12] The country occupies the major part of the British Isles [142] archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel [143]\n\n\nClimate\nMost of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round [143] The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0 °C (32 °F) or rising above 30 °C (86 °F) [151] Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate and the mountains experience a tundra climate [152]\n\n\nTopography\nEngland accounts for 53 per cent of the UK, covering 50,350 square miles (130,395 km2) [159] Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, [160] with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees–Exe line which roughly divides the UK into lowland and upland areas Lowland areas include Cornwall, the New Forest, the South Downs and the Norfolk Broads Upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, and Dartmoor The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames, Severn, and the Humber England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike, at 978 metres (3,209 ft) in the Lake District; its largest island is the Isle of Wight.\n\n\nPolitics\nThe UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy operating under the Westminster system, otherwise known as a \"democratic parliamentary monarchy\" [167] It is a centralised, unitary state [168] [169] wherein the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign [170] Parliament is made up of the elected House of Commons, the appointed House of Lords and the Crown (as personified by the monarch) [r] [173] The main business of parliament takes place in the two houses, [173] but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of parliament (that is, statute law) [174] As a result of parliamentary sovereignty, the British constitution is uncodified, consisting mostly of disparate written sources, including parliamentary statutes, judge-made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions [175] Nevertheless, the Supreme Court recognises a number of principles underlying the British constitution, such as parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy, and upholding international law [176]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe geographical division of the United Kingdom into counties or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages, and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early Modern Period [194] Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and Wales in 1888, Scotland in 1889 and Ireland in 1898, meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the UK [195]\nUntil the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function [196]\n\n\nDevolution\nIn the United Kingdom a process of devolution has transferred various powers from the UK Government to three of the four UK countries - Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, as well as to the regions of England These powers vary and have been moved to the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and in England, the Greater London Authority, Combined Authorities and Combined County Authorities [203]\n\n\nEngland\nUnlike Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, England does not have a separate devolved government or national parliament, [210] rather a process of devolution of powers from the central government to local authorities has taken place, first in 1998 [211] The Greater London Authority (GLA) was set up following a referendum in 1998 Colloquially known as City Hall, it is the devolved regional government body for Greater London It consists of two political branches: an Executive Mayor and the London Assembly, which serves as a check and balance on the Mayor.\n\n\nScotland\nSince 1999, Scotland has had a devolved national government and parliament with wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK Parliament [214] [215] Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an act of the UK parliament passed in 2020 [209]\n\n\nWales\nSince 1999, Wales has a devolved national government and legislature, known as the Senedd Elections to the Senedd use the additional member system It has more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland [225] The Senedd can legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament by Acts of Senedd Cymru The current Welsh Government is Labour, led by First Minister Eluned Morgan, who has been the First Minister since 2024 Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself.\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\nThe devolved form of government in Northern Ireland is based on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought to an end a 30-year period of unionist-nationalist communal conflict known as The Troubles The Agreement was confirmed by referendum and implemented later that year It established power sharing arrangements for a devolved government and legislature, referred to as the Executive and Assembly respectively [226] Elections to the Assembly use the single transferable vote system The Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland [227] The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly [228]  The First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland are the joint heads of government of Northern Ireland [229] [230] Local government in Northern Ireland since 2015 has been divided between 11 councils with limited responsibilities [201]\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of NATO, AUKUS, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe and the OSCE [231] The UK has the British Council which is a British organisation based in over 100 countries specialising in international cultural and educational opportunities The UK is said to have a \"Special Relationship\" with the United States and a close partnership with France – the \"Entente cordiale\" – and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries; [232] [233] the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a Common Travel Area and co-operate through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and military engagements [234] Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are former colonies of the British Empire which share King Charles as their head of state, are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by British people [235]\n\n\nLaw and criminal justice\nThe United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as Article 19 of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system [236] Today the UK has three distinct systems of law: English law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords [237] The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies [238]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe British Armed Forces consist of three professional service branches: the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (forming the Naval Service), the British Army and the Royal Air Force [252] The armed forces of the United Kingdom are managed by the Ministry of Defence and controlled by the Defence Council, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence The Commander-in-Chief is the British monarch, to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance [253] The Armed Forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts They are active and regular participants in NATO (including the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps), the Five Power Defence Arrangements, RIMPAC and other worldwide coalition operations Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in Ascension Island, Bahrain, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Oman, Qatar and Singapore [254]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe UK has a regulated social market economy [260] [261] [262] Based on market exchange rates, the UK is the sixth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe, both by nominal GDP Its currency, the pound sterling, is the fourth most-traded currency in the foreign exchange market and the world's fourth-largest reserve currency (after the United States dollar, euro, and yen) [263] Sterling was the 2nd best-performing G10 currency against the dollar in 2023 with a gain of about 5%, with only the Swiss franc performing better [264] [265] London is the world capital for foreign exchange trading, with a market share of 38.1% in 2022 [266] of the daily $7.5 trillion global turnover [267]\n\n\nScience and technology\nEngland and Scotland were leading centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century [301] The United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances [302] Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science; [303] from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory; and more recently Stephen Hawking, who advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes [304]\n\n\nTransport\nA radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads [143] The M25, encircling London, is the largest and busiest bypass in the world [310] In 2022, there were a total of 40.8 million licensed vehicles in Great Britain [311]\n\n\nEnergy\nIn 2021, the UK was the world's 14th-largest consumer of energy and the 22nd-largest producer [325] The UK is home to many large energy companies, including two of the six major oil and gas companies – BP and Shell [326]\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nAccess to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal It is estimated that 96 per cent of households are connected to the sewer network [338] According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007 [339]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn the 2011 census the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775 [341] It is the fourth-largest in Europe (after Russia, Germany and France), the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth [342] Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 per cent [341] The 2011 census also showed that, over the previous 100 years, the proportion of the population aged 0–14 fell from 31 per cent to 18 per cent, and the proportion of people aged 65 and over rose from 5 to 16 per cent [341] In 2018 the median age of the UK population was 41.7 years [343]\n\n\nEthnicity\nHistorically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 12th century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK [358] The UK has a history of non-white immigration with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade During this period it is estimated the Afro-Caribbean population of Great Britain was 10,000 to 15,000 [359] which later declined due to the abolition of slavery [360] The UK also has the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century [361] In 2011 [update], 87.2 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 12.8 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of an ethnic minority group [362]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe English language is the official and most spoken language of the United Kingdom [369] [370] The United Kingdom proactively promotes the language globally to build connections, understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries worldwide [371] [372] It is estimated that 95 per cent of the UK's population are monolingual English speakers [373] Over 5.5 per cent of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent [when?] immigration [373] South Asian languages are the largest grouping which includes Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali, Sylheti, Hindi, Pahari-Pothwari, Tamil, and Gujarati [374] According to the 2011 census, Polish has become the second-largest language spoken in England and has 546,000 speakers [375] In 2019, some three-quarters of a million people spoke little or no English [376]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in the United Kingdom (2022 census) [385]\n\n\nMigration\nImmigration is now [when?] contributing to a rising UK population, [403] [404] with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 According to official statistics released in 2015, 27 per cent of UK live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK [405] The ONS reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 per cent to 239,000 [406]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system About 38 per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree, which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world [414] The United Kingdom is home to many universities, including the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge which often achieve first place on global rankings [415] [416]\n\n\nHealthcare\nThe modern system of universal publicly funded in the United Kingdom has its origins in the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1949 which still exists to this day and is the primary healthcare provider in the United Kingdom The widespread popularity of the NHS has led to it being described as a \"national religion\" [421] [422] Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each country has its own system of universal publicly funded healthcare, although private healthcare is also available Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation The World Health Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world [423]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of the United Kingdom is influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history; and being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism As a result of the British Empire, British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies, in particular, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland, a common culture known today as the Anglosphere [428] [429] The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led to it being described as a cultural superpower [116] [117] A global survey in 2023 ranked the UK 3rd in the 'Most Influential Countries' rankings (behind the US and China) [430]\n\n\nLiterature\nBritish literature includes literature associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands Most British literature is in English In 2022, 669 million physical books were sold in the UK, this is the highest overall level ever recorded [431] Britain is renowned for children's literature, writer's includes Daniel Defoe, Rudyard Kipling, Lewis Carroll and Beatrix Potter who also illustrated her own books Other writers include A.A Milne, Enid Blyton, J.R.R Tolkien, Roald Dahl, Terry Pratchett and J.K Rowling who wrote the best selling book series of all time [432]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nThe United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of 'British Empiricism', a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the 'Scottish School of Common Sense' [451] The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke, George Berkeley [x] and David Hume; while Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major exponents of the Scottish \"common sense\" school Two Britons are also notable for the ethical theory of utilitarianism, a moral philosophy first used by Jeremy Bentham and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work Utilitarianism [452]\n\n\nMusic\nVarious styles of music have become popular in the UK, including the indigenous folk music of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland Historically, there has been exceptional Renaissance music from the Tudor period, with masses, madrigals and lute music by Thomas Tallis, John Taverner, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons and John Dowland After the Stuart Restoration, an English tradition of dramatic masques, anthems and airs became established, led by Henry Purcell, followed by Thomas Arne and others The German-born composer George Frideric Handel became a naturalised British citizen in 1727, when he composed the anthem Zadok the Priest for the coronation of George II; it became the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs Handel's many oratorios, such as his famous Messiah, were written in the English language [453] In the second half of the 19th century, as Arthur Sullivan and his librettist W S Gilbert wrote their popular Savoy operas, Edward Elgar's wide range of music rivalled that of his contemporaries on the continent Increasingly, however, composers became inspired by the English countryside and its folk music, notably Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Benjamin Britten, a pioneer of modern British opera

Michael Rubin [5] He grew up in Lido Beach While a student at Long Beach High School, Rubin befriended the school's audiovisual department director, who gave him a few lessons in guitar playing and songwriting [6] He then played in a band with three friends, performing at garage gigs and school shows until a teacher helped him create a punk band called the Pricks Their biggest claim to fame was being thrown off the stage at CBGB after performing two songs due to brawling with hecklers, which had actually been instigated by friends of the band who had been instructed to do so to get the show

[9]\n\n\nAmerican Recordings\nRubin had originally given his new label the name \"Def American Recordings\" In 1993, he found that the word \"def\" had been accepted into the standardized dictionary and held an actual funeral for the word, complete with a casket, grave, celebrity mourners, and a eulogy by Al Sharpton [5] [18] Def American became American Recordings Rubin has said: \"When advertisers and the fashion world co-opted the image of hippies, a group of the original hippies in San Francisco literally buried the image of the hippie When 'def' went from street lingo to

vocals, and reverb, and instead having naked vocals and bare instrumentation But by the 2000s, Rubin's style [32] included such elements, as noted in The Washington Post: \"As the track reaches a

He is best known for his work with Def Jam Recordings and American Recordings, and has produced music for a wide range of artists, including hip hop, rock, and pop.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nFrederick Jay Rubin was born into a Jewish family in Long Beach, New York, on March 10, 1963. He grew up in Lido Beach and developed an interest in music at an early age. While a student at Long Beach High School, Rubin befriended the school's audiovisual department director, who gave him a few lessons in guitar playing and songwriting. He then played in a band with three friends, performing at garage gigs and school shows until a teacher helped him create a punk band called the Pricks. Their biggest claim to fame was being thrown off the stage at CBGB after performing two songs due to brawling with hecklers, which had actually been instigated by friends of the band who had been instructed to do so to get the show shut down and create a buzz.\n\n**Career**\n\nRubin founded Def Jam Recordings while in college at New York University. He moved on to form the band Hose, influenced by San Francisco's Flipper, where he played guitar. In 1982, a Hose track became Def Jam's first release, a 45 rpm 7\" vinyl single in a brown paper bag, and no label. The band played in and around the NYC punk scene, toured the Midwest and California, and played with seminal hardcore bands like Meat Puppets, Hüsker Dü, Circle Jerks, Butthole Surfers, and Minor Threat, becoming friends with Fugazi frontman and Dischord Records owner Ian MacKaye. The band broke up in 1984 as Rubin's passion moved toward the NYC hip hop scene.\n\n**Def Jam**\n\nRubin founded Def Jam Recordings while in college at New York University.

The band broke up in 1984 as Rubin's passion moved toward the NYC hip hop scene.\n\n**American Recordings**\n\nRubin had originally given his new label the name \"Def American Recordings.\" In 1993, he found that the word \"def\" had been accepted into the standardized dictionary and held an actual funeral for the word, complete with a casket, grave, celebrity mourners, and a eulogy by Al Sharpton. Def American became American Recordings. Rubin has said, \"When advertisers and the fashion world co-opted the image of hippies, a group of the original hippies in San Francisco literally buried the image of the hippie. When 'def' went from street lingo to mainstream, it defeated its purpose.\"\n\n**Universal Records**\n\nIn 2003, Rubin produced The Mars Volta's debut album De-Loused in the Comatorium.\n\n**Columbia**\n\nIn May 2007, Rubin was named co-head of Columbia Records. He co-produced Linkin Park's 2007 album Minutes to Midnight with Mike Shinoda. Rubin and Shinoda have since co-produced the band's 2010 album A Thousand Suns and its 2012 release Living Things.\n\n**Post-Columbia**\n\nRubin left Columbia in 2012, and revived the American Recordings imprint through a deal with Republic Records. The first albums released under this new deal were ZZ Top's La Futura and the Avett Brothers' The Carpenter.\n\n**Other Work**\n\nRubin has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss's book Tools of Titans, and often gives advice on creativity via his Instagram page.\n\n**Production Style**\n\nRubin's biggest trademark as a producer has been a \"stripped-down\" sound, which involves eliminating production elements such as string sections, backup vocals, and reverb, and instead having naked vocals and bare instrumentation. But by the 2000s, Rubin's style included such elements, as noted in The Washington Post: \"As the track reaches a crescendo and Neil Diamond's portentous baritone soars over a swelling string arrangement, Rubin leans back, as though floored by the emotional power of the song.\"\n\n**Praise**\n\nRubin's biggest trademark as a producer has been a \"stripped-down\" sound, which involves eliminating production elements such as string sections, backup vocals, and reverb, and instead having naked vocals and bare instrumentation.

The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium during the games, was the primary venue for all track and field events, while the road events, including the marathon and racewalks, took place at Odori Park in Sapporo.\n\n**Olympic Stadium and Venues**\n\nThe National Stadium, which was rebuilt and inaugurated on 21 December 2019, was designed to provide a world-class athletics facility for the games. The stadium's design was influenced by traditional Japanese architecture and included a unique roof structure that provided excellent shade and ventilation for athletes and spectators. The stadium's track was designed to meet international standards and featured a 400-meter oval track with eight lanes.\n\nIn addition to the National Stadium, the road events, including the marathon and racewalks, took place at Odori Park in Sapporo. The park was chosen as the venue for these events due to its scenic location and flat terrain. The park's terrain was modified to meet international standards, and a temporary track was built to accommodate the events.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe athletics events at the 2020 Summer Olympics were held over a period of 10 days, from 30 July to 8 August 2021. The schedule for the events was designed to provide maximum visibility for the sport across all time zones. Nine track and field events held finals in the morning session to ensure that they received maximum visibility for the sport.\n\nThe schedule for the events was also influenced by the heat concerns in Tokyo. On 16 October 2019, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced plans to relocate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo due to heat concerns. The plans were made official on 1 November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThe qualification system for the 2020 Summer Olympics was fundamentally different from previous versions. Instead of being only based on set qualifying standards, the new qualifying system was also based on IAAF World Rankings. Qualifying standards provided an alternate pathway, but were set high enough that only exceptional performances would meet them.\n\nThe qualification system also included a maximum entry limit per event, unlike previous years where entries were based on how many athletes met the qualifying standard. The world rankings were used to fill the quota after the standards-based entrants and universality entrants were set.\n\n**Record Figures**\n\nThe athletics events at the 2020 Summer Olympics saw several record-breaking performances. Three world records and 12 Olympic records were set during the games. In addition to the world and Olympic records, 28 continental (area) records and 151 national records were set.\n\n**Medal Summary**\n\n| Rank | Nation | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 |  Japan | 8 | 6 | 6 | 20 |\n\n**Medal Table**\n\n| Rank | Nation | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 |  Japan | 8 | 6 | 6 | 20 |\n\n**Men**\n\n| Event | Gold | Silver | Bronze |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 100m | Marcell Jacobs (Italy) | Fred Kerley (USA) | Trayvon Bromell (USA) |\n| 200m | Andre De Grasse (Canada) | Noah Lyles (USA) | Kenneth Bednarek (USA) |\n| 400m | Stephen Gardiner (Bahamas) | Anthony Zambrano (Colombia) | Kizito Kiplangat (Uganda) |\n| 800m | Jakob Ingebrigtsen (Norway) | Abel Kipsang (Kenya) | Amel Tuka (Bosnia and Herzegovina) |\n| 1500m | Jakob Ingebrigtsen (Norway) | Abel Kipsang (Kenya) | Mohamed Katir (Spain) |\n| 5000m | Joshua Cheptegei (Uganda) | Mohammed Ahmed (Canada) | Grant Fisher (USA) |\n| 10,000m | Selemon Barega (Ethiopia) | Josh Kerr (Great Britain) | Jacob Kiplimo (Uganda) |\n| Marathon | Eliud Kipchoge (Kenya) | Abdi Nageeye (Netherlands) | Bashir Abdi (Belgium) |\n| 110m Hurdles | Grant Holloway (USA) | Devon Allen (USA) | Shane Brackin (Great Britain) |\n| 400m Hurdles | Karsten Warholm (Norway) | Rai Benjamin (USA) | Alison Dos Santos (Brazil) |\n| High Jump | Mutaz Essa Barshim (Qatar) | Gianmarco Tamberi (Italy) | Maksim Nedasekau (Belarus) |\n| Pole Vault | Armand Duplantis (Sweden) | Christopher Nilsen (USA) | Noah Williams (USA) |\n| Long Jump | Miltiadis Tentoglou (Greece) | Thobias Montler (Sweden) | Maykel Masso (Cuba) |\n| Triple Jump | Pedro Pichardo (Portugal) | Hugues Fabrice Zango (Burkina Faso) | Yasser Triki (Algeria) |\n| Shot Put | Ryan Crouser (USA) | Joe Kovacs (USA) | Tom Walsh (New Zealand) |\n| Discus Throw | Daniel Ståhl (Sweden) | Simon Pettersson (Sweden) | Lukas Weißhaidinger (Austria) |\n| Javelin Throw | Neeraj Chopra (India) | Jakub Vadlejch (Czech Republic) | Vítězslav Veselý (Czech Republic) |\n| Hammer Throw | Wojciech Nowicki (Poland) | Eivind Henriksen (Norway) | Bence Halász (Hungary) |\n\n**Women**\n\n| Event | Gold | Silver | Bronze |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 100m | Elaine Thompson-Herah (Jamaica) | Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (Jamaica) | Dina Asher-Smith (Great Britain) |\n| 200m | Elaine Thompson-Herah (Jamaica) | Dina Asher-Smith (Great Britain) | Gabby Thomas (USA) |\n| 400m | Shaunae Miller-Uibo (Bahamas) | Marileidy Paulino (Dominican Republic) | Shericka Jackson (Jamaica) |\n| 800m | Athing Mu (USA) | Raevyn Rogers (USA) | Halimah Nakaayi (Uganda) |\n| 1500m | Sifan Hassan (Netherlands) | Laura Muir (Great Britain) | Gudaf Tsegay (Ethiopia) |\n| 5000m | Sifan Hassan (Netherlands) | Gudaf Tsegay (Ethiopia) | Melissa Courtney-Bryant (Great Britain) |\n| 10,000m | Sifan Hassan (Netherlands) | Letesenbet Gidey (Ethiopia) | Agnes Tirop (Kenya) |\n| Marathon | Peres Jepchirchir (Kenya) | Brigid Kosgei (Kenya) | Molly Seidel (USA) |\n| 100m Hurdles | Jasmine Camacho-Quinn (Puerto Rico) | Megan Tapper (Jamaica) | Britany Anderson (Jamaica) |\n| 400m Hurdles | Sydney McLaughlin (USA) | Dalilah Muhammad (USA) | Rushell Clayton (Jamaica) |\n| High Jump | Mariya Lasitskene (ROC) | Yaroslava Mahuchikh (Ukraine) | Nicola McDermott (Australia) |\n| Pole Vault | Katie Nageotte (USA) | Anzhelika Sidorova (ROC) | Holly Bradshaw (Great Britain) |\n| Long Jump | Malaika Mihambo (Germany) | Ese Brume (Nigeria) | Maryna Bekh-Romanchuk (Ukraine) |\n| Triple Jump | Yulimar Rojas (Venezuela) | Patrícia Mamona (Portugal) | Ana Peleteiro (Spain) |\n| Shot Put | Gong Lijiao (China) | Danniel Thomas-Dodd (Jamaica) | Danniel Thomas (Jamaica) |\n| Discus Throw | Valarie Allman (USA) | Yaime Pérez (Cuba) | Denia Caballero (Cuba) |\n| Javelin Throw | Liu Shiying (China) | Maria Andrejczyk (Poland) | Kelsey-Lee Barber (Australia) |\n| Hammer Throw | Anna Rüh (Germany) | Wang Zheng (China) | Malwina Kopron (Poland) |\n\n**Mixed**\n\n| Event | Gold | Silver | Bronze |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 4x400m Relay |  Great Britain (Great Britain) |  United States (USA) |  Poland (Poland) |\n\n**Competitors**\n\nThe Placing table assigns points to the top eight athletes in the final, with eight points to first place, seven to second place, and so on until one point for eighth place.

University, Miami University (offensive coordinator), Illinois, and again at San Diego State (running backs coach), before landing a job as the quarterbacks coach with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1997

University, Miami University (offensive coordinator), Illinois, and again at San Diego State (running backs coach), before landing a job as the quarterbacks coach with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1997 [20]\n\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Payton was quarterbacks coach for the Philadelphia Eagles and worked with offensive coordinator Jon Gruden and offensive line coach Bill Callahan [25] In 1998, Gruden and Callahan left for the Oakland Raiders, and Eagles head coach Ray Rhodes and Payton were fired [26] The Eagles' quarterbacks passed for 4,009 yards in 1997 [27] Payton would not be retained by new head coach Andy Reid.\n\n\nNew York Giants\nIn 1999, Payton was hired as the quarterbacks coach for the New York Giants and was promoted to the role of offensive coordinator in 2000 [28] [29] Under his guidance, the Giants would go on to represent the NFC in Super Bowl XXXV [30] During this time, he was known to lock himself in the stadium and sleep on the couches while studying plays during off-days.\n\n\nDallas Cowboys\nPayton joined Bill Parcells and the Dallas Cowboys as an assistant head coach and a quarterbacks coach in 2003 He guided three different quarterbacks (Quincy Carter, Vinny Testaverde, and Drew Bledsoe) to 3,000-yard passing seasons, while contributing to improve the passing offense from a 31st rank to 15th in the league He also has been attributed as the primary factor for the team signing undrafted free agent Tony Romo in 2003.\n\n\nNew Orleans Saints (2006-11)\nPayton began his first head coaching assignment in 2006 with the New Orleans Saints [34] In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, during the 2005 season the Saints had finished with a 3–13 record, ranking as the second worst team in the league However, Payton turned the struggling

first in passing, [35] and fifth in points scored [36] The Saints won the NFC South with a 10–6 record, earned a first-round playoff bye and notched only the second playoff win in franchise history,

Receiving 44 out of 50 votes from a panel of sports journalists and broadcasters, Payton won the AP NFL Coach of the Year Award in January 2007 [37]\n\n\nBounty scandal and suspension\nOn March 2, 2012, the NFL concluded after a thorough investigation that from 2009 to 2011, the Saints implemented a bounty program that rewarded players for deliberately attempting to knock opposing players out of games The slush fund was determined to be administered by defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, who joined the team in 2009 An extensive league investigation found that Payton was implicated in the Bounty Scandal The league determined Payton went as far as to orchestrate a cover-up when the league first investigated it in the 2009–10 offseason When informed that the league was investigating reports of a bounty program, Payton met with Williams and assistant head coach Joe Vitt and told them, \"Let's make sure our ducks are in a row.\" [42]\n\n\nLiberty Christian Warriors (Argyle, TX)\nDuring his 2012 suspension from the NFL, Payton served as the offensive coordinator for his son Connor's sixth-grade team in Argyle, Texas [54] Payton used a simplified version of the Saints

"**Sean Payton**\n\nSean Michael Payton is a former American football coach and current head coach of the Denver Broncos. He is best known for being the head coach of the New Orleans Saints, leading the team to a Super Bowl victory in 2010. Payton has also worked as an assistant coach for several teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas Cowboys, and New York Giants.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPayton was born in San Mateo, California, and raised in Naperville, Illinois, by parents Thomas and Jeanne Payton. His parents were originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania; Thomas worked in the insurance industry. Payton lived in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, during his grade school and middle school years (1970-1978). He attended Naperville Central High School in Naperville, Illinois, starting as quarterback his senior year before graduating in 1982. Winning a football scholarship, Payton had a successful career playing quarterback at Eastern Illinois University, leading the Panthers to an 11-2 record and the quarter-finals of the Division I-AA Playoffs in 1986. While attending EIU, he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and was later named a Significant Sig; one of Sigma Chi's highest honors. Under coach Al Molde, Payton's Eastern Illinois teams were known as \"Eastern Airlines\" due to their prolific passing attack that frequently topped 300 yards per game (and had 509 passing yards in one game, still a school record).\n\n**Playing Career**\n\nAlthough he was not drafted in the 1987 NFL draft, Payton tried out for the Kansas City Chiefs for one day. In 1987, he played quarterback for the Chicago Bruisers and Pittsburgh Gladiators during the inaugural season of the Arena Football League, before his rights were sold for $1,000 to the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League. He was also a member of the Chicago Bears squad of strikebreaking replacement players, known as the \"Spare Bears\", during the 1987 NFL players strike. In 3 games he completed 8 of 23 passes (34.8%) for 79 yards, no touchdowns, an interception, and a passer rating of 27.3 He was also sacked 7 times for 47 yards and had one rush attempt for 28 yards His one interception came against the New Orleans Saints, the team he would later go on to coach to a Super Bowl victory.\n\n**Coaching Career**\n\nPayton began his coaching career in 1988 as an offensive assistant at San Diego State University. He made a series of assistant coaching positions at Indiana State University, Miami University (offensive coordinator), Illinois, and again at San Diego State (running backs coach), before landing a job as the quarterbacks coach with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1997. From 1997 to 1998, Payton was quarterbacks coach for the Philadelphia Eagles and worked with offensive coordinator Jon Gruden and offensive line coach Bill Callahan. In 1998, Gruden and Callahan left for the Oakland Raiders, and Eagles head coach Ray Rhodes and Payton were fired. The Eagles' quarterbacks passed for 4,009 yards in 1997. Payton would not be retained by new head coach Andy Reid.\n\n**New York Giants**\n\nIn 1999, Payton was hired as the quarterbacks coach for the New York Giants and was promoted to the role of offensive coordinator in 2000. Under his guidance, the Giants would go on to represent the NFC in Super Bowl XXXV. During this time, he was known to lock himself in the stadium and sleep on the couches while studying plays during off-days.\n\n**Dallas Cowboys**\n\nPayton joined Bill Parcells and the Dallas Cowboys as an assistant head coach and a quarterbacks coach in 2003. He guided three different quarterbacks (Quincy Carter, Vinny Testaverde, and Drew Bledsoe) to 3,000-yard passing seasons, while contributing to improve the passing offense from a 31st rank to 15th in the league. He also has been attributed as the primary factor for the team signing undrafted free agent Tony Romo in 2003.\n\n**New Orleans Saints (2006-11)**\n\nPayton began his first head coaching assignment in 2006 with the New Orleans Saints. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, during the 2005 season the Saints had finished with a 3-13 record, ranking as the second worst team in the league. However, Payton turned the struggling team around, and, with newly acquired free agent quarterback Drew Brees, led them to their first playoff appearance in six years. The team had one of the league's most productive offenses, ranking first in passing, and fifth in points scored. The Saints won the NFC South with a 10-6 record, earned a first-round playoff bye and notched only the second playoff win in franchise history, giving them a berth in the NFC Championship Game against the top-seeded Chicago Bears. The Saints out-gained the Bears in total yards on offense, but lost the game by the lopsided score of 39-14. Receiving 44 out of 50 votes from a panel of sports journalists and broadcasters, Payton won the AP NFL Coach of the Year Award in January 2007.\n\n**Bounty Scandal and Suspension**\n\nOn March 2, 2012, the NFL concluded after a thorough investigation that from 2009 to 2011, the Saints implemented a bounty program that rewarded players for deliberately attempting to knock opposing players out of games. The slush fund was determined to be administered by defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, who joined the team in 2009. An extensive league investigation found that Payton was implicated in the Bounty Scandal. The league determined Payton went as far as to orchestrate a cover-up when the league first investigated it in the 2009-10 offseason. When informed that the league was investigating reports of a bounty program, Payton met with Williams and assistant head coach Joe Vitt and told them, \"Let's make sure our ducks are in a row.\"\n\n**Liberty Christian Warriors (Argyle, TX)**\n\nDuring his 2012 suspension from the NFL, Payton served as the offensive coordinator for his son Connor's sixth-grade team in Argyle, Texas. Payton used a simplified version of the Saints playbook, and the team went unbeaten until they suffered a loss near the end of the regular season to a team that ran the single-wing, which his team was unable to stop. Since he believed he would face that team again in the league's playoffs, he obtained video that the father of one of his players had recorded, and then contacted his mentor Bill Parcells to help him break down the opponent's offense. The teams indeed faced one another in the league finals; Payton's team lost a considerably closer game in which they were able to slow down the opposing offense.\n\n**New Orleans Saints (2013-21)**\n\nPayton agreed to a new multi-year contract extension as head coach of the Saints, beginning in 2013.

The 2023 season ended on a controversial note after quarterback Russell Wilson was benched in favor of Jarrett Stidham for the final two games of the season to \"preserve financial flexibility.\"\n\n**Head Coaching Record**\n\nPayton has worked under eight head coaches: Al Molde (Eastern Illinois University), Rickey Thompson (Eastern Illinois University), Ray Rhodes (Philadelphia Eagles), Jon Gruden (Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders), Bill Callahan (Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders), Bill Parcells (Dallas Cowboys), Sean Payton (New Orleans Saints), and Nathaniel Hackett (Denver Broncos).\n\n**Coaching Tree**\n\nPayton has worked under eight head coaches: Al Molde (Eastern Illinois University), Rickey Thompson (Eastern Illinois University), Ray Rhodes (Philadelphia Eagles), Jon Gruden (Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders), Bill Callahan (Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders), Bill Parcells (Dallas Cowboys), Sean Payton (New Orleans Saints), and Nathaniel Hackett (Denver Broncos).\n\n**Broadcasting Career**\n\nAfter stepping down as head coach of the Saints, Payton joined Fox to work in studio throughout 2022, becoming a part of the Fox NFL Sunday panel as a fill-in for Jimmy Johnson's off days. Payton was also in talks to join Amazon's NFL coverage before accepting the role.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPayton met Beth Shuey, an Indiana State University graduate, while coaching there. The couple have two children, daughter Meghan (born 1997) and son Connor (born 2000). Payton is Irish Catholic. Payton and his family moved to a home in Mandeville, Louisiana when he became the Saints' head coach. The home, like many built on the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, later turned out to be constructed with defective Chinese drywall, and Payton eventually became a named plaintiff in a widely reported class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin Co Ltd.\n\n**Honors and Awards**\n\nPayton has received numerous honors and awards for his coaching career, including:\n\n* 2x Super Bowl champion (Super Bowl XLIV and Super Bowl XLVIII)\n* 1x Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (Super Bowl XLIV)\n* 1x NFL Coach of the Year (2006)\n* 4x NFC Championship Game appearances\n\n**References**\n\nPayton's coaching career has been the subject of numerous books, articles, and documentaries.

Born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel, Afrifah has made a name for himself in the athletics world with his impressive performances on the track.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAfrifah was born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel, and later moved with his family to Ramat Gan, Israel. His parents are of Akan ethnicity, from Kumasi, Ghana, and moved to Israel a decade before he was born. His father initially came to Israel as a tourist in the mid-1990s, working in the consular division of Ghana's embassy. His mother also came to Israel as a tourist, working as a cleaning lady. Grateful to Israel, they pledged that they would have a son named Blessing and a daughter named Mercy. His younger sister Mercy is also a sprinter.\n\nGrowing up in Israel, Afrifah was exposed to the country's vibrant cultural and sporting scene. His parents' decision to settle in Israel has had a profound impact on his life, shaping his identity and aspirations. Afrifah's athletic prowess was evident from an early age, and he began working with national coach Igor Balon at the age of 14.\n\n**Running Career**\n\nAfrifah's club is Maccabi Tel Aviv, one of the most successful and storied sports clubs in Israel. Under the guidance of Coach Balon, Afrifah has honed his skills and developed a impressive technique. His dedication and hard work have paid off, earning him recognition and accolades in the athletics world.\n\n**Early Years; Israeli Championships**\n\nAfrifah's early years in athletics were marked by success in Israeli championships. He won several titles, showcasing his talent and potential. His performances caught the attention of national selectors, who recognized his potential to represent Israel at international competitions.\n\n**2022; World U20 Champion**\n\nAt the 2022 World Athletics U20 Championships in Cali, Colombia, Afrifah made history by winning the 200m in a photo finish. With a championship record time of 19.954, he edged out Botswanan Letsile Tebogo by a mere 0.006 seconds. This achievement marked Afrifah's first major international title, cementing his status as a rising star in the athletics world.\n\nAfrifah's victory was all the more remarkable given his youth and inexperience at the international level. He was just 18 years old at the time, making him one of the youngest athletes to win a World U20 Championship title. His performance also made him the first Israeli to run the 200 meters in under 20 seconds, a feat that had only been achieved by a select few athletes in recorded competitions.\n\n**2023-present; European U23 Champion**\n\nThe following year, Afrifah continued his winning streak by capturing the 200m title at the 2023 European Athletics U23 Championships in Espoo, Finland. With a time of 20.67, he narrowly edged out Dutch athlete Raphael Bouju by just 0.01 seconds. This achievement marked Afrifah's second major international title, solidifying his position as one of the top sprinters in the world.\n\n**2024 Paris Olympics**\n\nAfrifah represented Israel at the 2024 Paris Olympics in the men's 200 meters at the Stade de France. He attended a ceremony at the Paris Olympics to remember the 11 Israeli Olympic athletes killed in the Munich Massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. At 20 years old, Afrifah ran a 20.78 in his first round qualification heat, finishing 5th. He also ran a 20.88 in the last chance repechage round, finishing 16th and not making it to the semifinals.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2010, Afrifah was granted permanent residence status, along with his sister and parents, following a government decision to not deport children of foreign workers born in Israel. At the age of 16, he was granted Israeli citizenship after appealing to Israel's Minister of the Interior Aryeh Deri. This decision has had a profound impact on Afrifah's life, allowing him to integrate fully into Israeli society and pursue his athletic dreams.\n\n**Career Statistics**\n\nAfrifah's career statistics are impressive, with several personal bests and international championships to his name. His progress in the 100m and 200m events is particularly notable, with him consistently improving his times and performances over the years.\n\n**International Championships**\n\nAfrifah has represented Israel at several international championships, including the World U20 Championships, European Athletics U23 Championships, and the Paris Olympics. His performances at these events have been consistently strong, earning him recognition and accolades in the athletics world.\n\n**100m Progression**\n\nAfrifah's progress in the 100m event is notable, with him consistently improving his time and performances over the years. His personal best in the 100m event is 10.23 seconds, achieved at the 2022 World Athletics U20 Championships.\n\n**200m Progression**\n\nAfrifah's progress in the 200m event is particularly notable, with him consistently improving his time and performances over the years. His personal best in the 200m event is 19.954 seconds, achieved at the 2022 World Athletics U20 Championships.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of Israeli athletes\n* Ghanaian diaspora in Israel\n* Athletics in Israel\n\n**References**\n\n* World Athletics profile\n* Israel Athletics Federation\n* European Athletics\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Blessing Afrifah's official website\n* Blessing Afrifah's social media profiles", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Blessing_Afrifah\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAfrifah was born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel, and later moved with his family to Ramat Gan, Israel [3] His parents are of Akan ethnicity, from Kumasi, Ghana, and moved to Israel a decade before he was born [2] [1] [4] [5] [6] His father and his mother initially came to Israel separately as tourists in the mid-1990s [3] They remained -- with his father working in the consular division of Ghana’s embassy, and his mother working as a cleaning lady [5] [3]  Grateful to Israel they pledged that they would have a son named Blessing and a daughter named Mercy [3] His younger sister Mercy is also a sprinter [3]\n\n\nRunning career\nAt the age of 14, Afrifah began working with national coach Igor Balon [6] Afrifah's club is Maccabi Tel Aviv [7]\n\n\nEarly years; Israeli championships\nAt the age of 14, Afrifah began working with national coach Igor Balon [6] Afrifah's club is Maccabi Tel Aviv [7]\n\n\n2022; World U20 Champion\nAt the 2022 World Athletics U20 Championships in Cali, Colombia, at 18 years of age Afrifah won the 200 m in a photo finish with a championship record time of 19.954, 0.006 seconds ahead of Botswanan Letsile Tebogo [8] [9] Afrifah, who then draped the Israeli flag across his body, was the first Israeli to run the 200 metres race in under 20 seconds [2] [10] In recorded competitions, only two humans under age 20 had run a faster 200 meters, one being Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, who later won the event three times in the Olympics and four times in the world championships [2]\n\n\n2023-present; European U23 Champion\nNext year, at the 2023 European Athletics U23 Championships in Espoo, Finland, Afrifah won the 200 m with a time of 20.67, just 0.01 second ahead of Dutch Raphael Bouju [11]\n\n\n2024 Paris Olympics\nAfrifah represented Israel at the 2024 Paris Olympics in the men's 200 metres at the Stade de France [13] [14] He attended a ceremony at the Paris Olympics that was held to remember the 11 Israeli Olympicans killed in the Munich Massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games [15] At 20 years of age, he ran a 20.78 and came in 5th in his first round qualification heat, and he ran a 20.88 in the last chance repechage round, finishing 16th and not making it to the semifinals [16] [17]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2010, Afrifah was granted permanent residence status, along with his sister and parents, following a government decision to not deport children of foreign workers born in Israel [6] At the age of 16, he was granted Israeli citizenship after he appealed to Israel's Minister of the Interior Aryeh Deri [18] [6]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nFigures from World Athletics profile [3]\n\n\nPersonal bests\n\n\nInternational championships\n\n\n100m progression\n\n\n200m progression\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

although in practice, real power was often held elsewhere, such as in the hands of the Fujiwara clan, who intermarried with the imperial family in the Heian period, or by the ruling shōgun Theoretically, the last ritsuryō code, the Yōrō Code enacted in 752, was still in force at the time of the Meiji Restoration [5]\n\n\nAppointment\nThe prime minister is nominated by both houses of the Diet, before the conduct of any other business For that purpose, each conducts a ballot under the run-off system If the two houses choose different individuals, then a joint committee of both houses is appointed to agree on a common nominee Ultimately, however, if the two houses do not agree, the decision of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet If the House of Councillors does not make a nomination within 10 days of the House of Representatives' nomination, the House of Representatives' nomination becomes the Diet's decision Therefore, the House of Representatives can theoretically ensure the appointment of any prime minister it wants [11] The nominee is then presented with his or her commission, and formally appointed to office by the emperor at the Tokyo Imperial Palace [12]\n\n\nQualifications\nUnlike most of his counterparts in constitutional monarchies, the prime minister is both de jure and de facto chief executive In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is at least nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the prime minister is the leader;

The position is established by the Constitution of Japan and is responsible for leading the Cabinet, which is the executive branch of the Japanese government.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Prime Minister of Japan is a key figure in the country's government, playing a crucial role in the decision-making process and the implementation of policies. The position has a long history, dating back to the Meiji period, when the country's modern system of government was established. Since then, the Prime Minister has been a vital part of Japan's government, working to promote the country's interests and well-being.\n\n**Designation**\n\nIn Japanese, the Prime Minister's title varies depending on the context. The official title is Naikaku Sōri-Daijin (内閣総理大臣), which is often abbreviated to Sōri-Daijin (総理大臣). Other common abbreviations include Sōri (総理), Shushō (首相), and Saishō (宰相).\n\n**English Notation**\n\nIn English, the official translation of the Prime Minister's title is 'Prime Minister'. This translation was introduced in the late 19th century, when Japan began to adopt Western-style government systems. Prior to this, the title was translated as 'Grand Minister', which was an informal translation.\n\n**History**\n\nBefore the adoption of the Meiji Constitution in 1889, Japan had no written constitution. The country's government was based on an elaborate and rational meritocratic bureaucracy, which served under the ultimate authority of the emperor. However, in practice, real power was often held by other groups, such as the Fujiwara clan, who intermarried with the imperial family in the Heian period, or by the ruling shōgun. The last ritsuryō code, the Yōrō Code, was enacted in 752 and was still in force at the time of the Meiji Restoration.\n\n**Appointment**\n\nThe Prime Minister is nominated by both houses of the Diet, the National Diet of Japan, which is the country's legislative body. The nomination process involves a ballot under the run-off system. If the two houses choose different individuals, a joint committee is appointed to agree on a common nominee. If the two houses do not agree, the decision of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet. The nominee is then presented with their commission and formally appointed to office by the Emperor at the Tokyo Imperial Palace.\n\n**Qualifications**\n\nUnlike most of his counterparts in constitutional monarchies, the Prime Minister is both de jure and de facto chief executive. In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is at least nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the Prime Minister is the leader. This greatly enhances the Prime Minister's position compared to Prime Ministers in other parliamentary democracies.\n\n**Role**\n\nThe Prime Minister is responsible for leading the Cabinet and implementing policies. The Cabinet is composed of ministers, who are responsible for various government departments. The Prime Minister works closely with the Cabinet to make decisions and implement policies. The Prime Minister is also responsible for advising the Emperor on important matters of state.\n\n**Constitutional Roles**\n\nThe Prime Minister has several constitutional roles, including:\n\n* Leading the Cabinet and implementing policies\n* Advising the Emperor on important matters of state\n* Representing Japan abroad\n* Promoting national unity and stability\n\n**Statutory Roles**\n\nThe Prime Minister has several statutory roles, including:\n\n* Signing bills into law\n* Appointing and dismissing ministers\n* Representing Japan in international organizations\n* Implementing policies and decisions made by the Cabinet\n\n**Insignia**\n\nThe Office of the Prime Minister of Japan is located near the Diet building and is called the Naikaku Sōri-Daijin Kantei (内閣総理大臣官邸). The original Kantei served from 1929 until 2002, when a new building was inaugurated to serve as the current Kantei. The old Kantei was then converted into the Official Residence, or Kōtei (公邸).\n\n**Official Office and Residence**\n\nThe Prime Minister's official office and residence are located near the Diet building. The Office of the Prime Minister is called the Naikaku Sōri-Daijin Kantei (内閣総理大臣官邸), and the Official Residence is called the Kōtei (公邸). The Kōtei lies to the southwest of the Kantei and is linked by a walkway.\n\n**Travel**\n\nThe Prime Minister of Japan travels in a Toyota Century. Prior to 2008, the Prime Minister's official car was a Lexus LS 600h L, which was then replaced by a Toyota Century.\n\n**Retirement Honours and Emoluments**\n\nUntil the mid-1930s, the Prime Minister of Japan was normally granted a hereditary peerage prior to leaving office. Titles were usually bestowed in the ranks of count, viscount, or baron, depending on the relative accomplishments and status of the Prime Minister. However, the peerage was abolished when the Constitution of Japan came into effect in May 1947.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of Prime Ministers of Japan\n* History of Japan\n* Government of Japan\n* Constitution of Japan\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Constitution of Japan came into effect in 1947 and established the current system of government in Japan.\n* The Prime Minister is responsible for leading the Cabinet and implementing policies.\n* The Cabinet is composed of ministers, who are responsible for various government departments.\n* The Prime Minister works closely with the Cabinet to make decisions and implement policies.\n* The Prime Minister is also responsible for advising the Emperor on important matters of state.\n\n**References**\n\n* Constitution of Japan\n* Government of Japan\n* List of Prime Ministers of Japan\n* History of Japan\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Official website of the Prime Minister of Japan\n* Government of Japan website\n* Constitution of Japan website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Prime_Minister_of_Japan\" following this outline:\n\n\nDesignation\nIn Japanese, due to the special nature of the work of the head of government, the prime minister's titles vary depending on context, sometimes demonstrating his/her role Since the inception of the cabinet system, the prime minister is known in Japanese as Naikaku Sōri-Daijin (内閣総理大臣) whenever he is referred to as the head of the Cabinet However, this title is usually abbreviated to Sōri-Daijin (総理大臣) Other abbreviations include Sōri (総理), Shushō (首相) or even Saishō (宰相) [3]\n\n\nAbbreviations\nIn Japanese, due to the special nature of the work of the head of government, the prime minister's titles vary depending on context, sometimes demonstrating his/her role Since the inception of the cabinet system, the prime minister is known in Japanese as Naikaku Sōri-Daijin (内閣総理大臣) whenever he is referred to as the head of the Cabinet However, this title is usually abbreviated to Sōri-Daijin (総理大臣) Other abbreviations include Sōri (総理), Shushō (首相) or even Saishō (宰相) [3]\n\n\nEnglish notation\nThe official English rendering is 'Prime Minister' [4] This English translation was informally used as the English translation of 'Grand Minister' before the introduction of the cabinet system However, this was not the original English translation of 'Prime Minister', and a German translation, 'Minister President of the State', was also used in the past.\n\n\nHistory\nBefore the adoption of the Meiji Constitution, Japan had in practice no written constitution Originally, a Chinese-inspired legal system known as ritsuryō was enacted in the late Asuka period and early Nara period It described a government based on an elaborate and rational meritocratic bureaucracy, serving, in theory, under the ultimate authority of the emperor;

Gies, along with her husband Jan and other Opekta employees, helped to conceal the families in a secret annex above the company's office building in Amsterdam. After the war, Gies was recognized for her bravery and selflessness by Yad Vashem, and she became a celebrated figure in the Netherlands.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMiep Gies was born in Vienna, Austria on February 15, 1909, to Karoline Maria Santrouschitz. At the time of her birth, Austria was still part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Vienna was a vibrant and cosmopolitan city. Gies's early life was marked by her parents' struggles to make ends meet, and in 1920, she was sent to Leiden, Netherlands to live with a foster family, the Nieuwenburgs. The Nieuwenburgs were a working-class family with five children of their own, and they took Gies in as their foster daughter, renaming her \"Miep.\"\n\nGies grew up in Leiden and later moved with her foster family to Amsterdam, where she attended high school. She was an honors student and described herself as \"reserved and very independent.\" After graduating from high school, Gies worked as an accountant and later as a secretary for the Dutch branch of the German spice firm Opekta.\n\n**Hiding the Families**\n\nIn July 1942, Gies's life took a dramatic turn when she began helping to hide the Jewish Frank family, including Otto and Edith Frank, their daughters Margot and Anne, and several other individuals in a secret annex above the Opekta office building in Amsterdam. Gies, along with her husband Jan and other Opekta employees, including Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, and Bep Voskuijl, worked tirelessly to conceal the families from the Nazi authorities. The families lived in cramped and difficult conditions, with Gies and the others providing them with food, clothing, and other essentials.\n\nGies's motivations for helping the families were rooted in her outrage and horror at the Nazi persecution of Jews. Every day, she saw trucks loaded with Jews heading to the railway station, en route to Nazi concentration camps. Despite the dangers, Gies did not tell anyone, including her foster parents, about the people in hiding whom she was assisting.\n\n**The Capture**\n\nOn August 4, 1944, Gies and the other helpers were confronted by a group of Nazi officers who had discovered the secret annex. The families were arrested, and Gies and the others were interrogated. However, Gies was able to persuade the officer who was questioning her to let her go, using her birthplace of Vienna as a common ground. The officer, who was from Vienna himself, was amazed by the coincidence and decided to let Gies stay.\n\nGies remained in hiding with her husband throughout the rest of the war, but she was shaken by the experience. She later said that the war had left her with a deep sense of trauma and anxiety.\n\n**Honors and Awards**\n\nIn 1972, Gies and her husband Jan were recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust memorial center. This honor was bestowed upon her in recognition of her bravery and selflessness in helping to save the lives of the Frank family and others during the war.\n\n**Death and Legacy**\n\nMiep Gies died on January 11, 2010, at the age of 100, in the city of Hoorn, Netherlands. Her legacy as a hero of the Holocaust has endured, and she remains a celebrated figure in the Netherlands and around the world. Her story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of courage, compassion, and selflessness in the face of adversity.\n\nIn the years following her death, Gies's legacy has been remembered and honored in various ways. In 2011, a museum dedicated to her life and work was opened in Amsterdam. The Miep Gies Museum showcases her story and the history of the secret annex, and serves as a tribute to her bravery and selflessness.\n\nGies's story has also been the subject of numerous books, films, and other works of art. Her life and legacy continue to inspire people around the world, and serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up against injustice and protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Miep_Gies\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Vienna, Austria on 15 February 1909 to Karoline Maria Santrouschitz, [10] [11] She was sent to Leiden from Vienna in December 1920 to escape the food shortages prevailing in Austria after World War I The Nieuwenburgs, a working-class family who already had five children of their own, took her as their foster daughter, and called her by the diminutive \"Miep\" by which she became known In 1922, she moved with her foster family to Gaaspstraat 25 [9] [12] in Amsterdam Gies was an honors student, and described herself as \"reserved and very independent\"; after graduating high school, she worked as an accountant and then in 1933 as a secretary with the Dutch branch of the German spice firm Opekta Gies wrote, \"But the office was not the only thing in my life My social life at this time was very lively I loved to dance and belonged like many young Dutch girls, to a dance club.\" [13]\n\n\nHiding the families\nWith her husband Jan and other Opekta employees (Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman and Bep Voskuijl), Miep Gies helped hide Otto and Edith Frank; their daughters Margot and Anne; Hermann, Auguste and Peter van Pels; and Fritz Pfeffer in several upstairs rooms in the company's office building on Amsterdam's Prinsengracht from 6 July 1942 to 4 August 1944 [15] In an interview, Gies said she was glad to help the families hide because she was extremely concerned after seeing what was happening to the Jews in Amsterdam Every day, she saw trucks loaded with Jews heading to the railway station, en route to Nazi concentration camps She did not tell anyone, including her foster parents, about the people in hiding whom she was assisting [citation needed]\n\n\nThe capture\nOn the morning of 4 August 1944, sitting at her desk, Gies, along with Voskuijl and Kleiman, was confronted by a man with a gun commanding \"Stay put!

{"title": "Henry_Kissinger", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nKissinger was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger [b] on May 27, 1923, in Fürth, Bavaria, Germany He was the son of homemaker Paula (née Stern), from Leutershausen, and Louis Kissinger, a schoolteacher He had a younger brother, Walter, who was a businessman Kissinger's family was German-Jewish [12] His great-great-grandfather Meyer Löb adopted \"Kissinger\" as his surname in 1817, taking it from the Bavarian spa town of Bad Kissingen [13] In his childhood, Kissinger enjoyed playing soccer He played for the youth team of SpVgg Fürth, one of the nation's best clubs at the time [14]\n\n\nU.S. Army\nKissinger underwent basic training at Camp Croft in Spartanburg, South Carolina On June 19, 1943, while stationed in South Carolina, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen The army sent him to study engineering at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania under the Army Specialized Training Program, but the program was canceled and Kissinger was reassigned to the 84th Infantry Division There, he made the acquaintance of Fritz Kraemer, a fellow immigrant from Germany who noted Kissinger's fluency in German and his intellect and arranged for him to be assigned to the division's military intelligence Kissinger saw combat with the division and volunteered for hazardous intelligence duties during the Battle of the Bulge On April 10, 1945, he participated in the liberation of the Hannover-Ahlem concentration camp, a subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp At the time, Kissinger wrote in his journal, \"I had never seen people degraded to the level that people were in Ahlem They barely looked human They were skeletons.\" After the initial shock, however, Kissinger was relatively silent about his wartime service [23] [24]\n\n\nAcademic career\nKissinger earned his Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa [32] in political science from Harvard College in 1950, where he lived in Adams House and studied under William Yandell Elliott [33] His senior undergraduate thesis, titled The Meaning of History: Reflections on Spengler, Toynbee and Kant, was over 400 pages long, and provoked Harvard's current cap on the length of undergraduate theses (35,000 words) [34] [35] [36] He earned his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy at Harvard University in 1951 and 1954, respectively In 1952, while still a graduate student at Harvard, he served as a consultant to the director of the Psychological Strategy Board, [37] and founded a magazine, Confluence [38] At that time, he sought to work as a spy for the FBI [38] [39]\n\n\nForeign policy\nKissinger served as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon and continued as Secretary of State under Nixon's successor Gerald Ford [52] With the death of George Shultz in February 2021, Kissinger was the last surviving member of the Nixon administration Cabinet [53]\n\n\nDétente and opening to the People's Republic of China\nKissinger initially had little interest in China when he began his work as National Security Adviser in 1969, and the driving force behind the rapprochement with China was Nixon [62] In April 1970, both Nixon and Kissinger promised Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, that they would never abandon Taiwan or make any compromises with Mao Zedong, although Nixon did speak vaguely of his wish to improve relations with the People's Republic [63]\n\n\nVietnam War\nKissinger discussed being involved in Indochina prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon [72] According to Kissinger, his friend Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the Ambassador to Saigon, employed Kissinger as a consultant, leading to Kissinger visiting Vietnam once in 1965 and twice in 1966, where Kissinger realized that the United States \"knew neither how to win or how to conclude\" the Vietnam War [72] Kissinger also stated that in 1967, he served as an intermediary for negotiations between the United States and North Vietnam, with Kissinger providing the American position, while two Frenchmen provided the North Vietnamese position [72]\n\n\nInterview with Oriana Fallaci\nOn November 4, 1972, [104] Kissinger agreed to an interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci Kissinger, who rarely engaged in one-on-one interviews with the press and knew very little about Fallaci, accepted her request after reportedly being impressed with her 1969 interview with Võ Nguyên Giáp [105] The interview turned out to be a political and public relations disaster for Kissinger as he agreed that Vietnam was a \"useless war\", implied that he preferred to have dinner with Lê Đức Thọ over Nguyễn Văn Thiệu (in her 1976 book Interview with History, Fallaci recalled that Kissinger agreed with many of her negative sentiments towards Thiệu in a private discussion before the interview), and engaged in a now infamous exchange with the hard-pressing Fallaci, with Kissinger comparing himself to a cowboy leading the Nixon administration:\n\n\nBangladesh Liberation War\nNixon supported Pakistani dictator Yahya Khan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 Kissinger sneered at people who \"bleed\" for \"the dying Bengalis\" and ignored the first telegram from the U.S consul general in East Pakistan, Archer K Blood, and 20 members of his staff, which informed the U.S that their allies West Pakistan were undertaking, in Blood's words, \"a selective genocide\" targeting the Bengali intelligentsia, supporters of independence for East Pakistan, and the Hindu minority [108] In the second, more famous, Blood Telegram the word 'genocide' was again used to describe the events, and further that with its continuing support for West Pakistan the U.S government had \"evidenced .. moral bankruptcy\" [109] As a direct response to the dissent against U.S policy, Kissinger and Nixon ended Archer Blood's tenure as United States consul general in East Pakistan and put him to work in the State Department's Personnel Office [110] [111] Christopher Clary argues that Nixon and Kissinger were unconsciously biased, leading them to overestimate the likelihood of Pakistani victory against Bengali rebels [112]\n\n\nEurope\nAs National Security Adviser under Nixon, Kissinger pioneered the policy of détente with the Soviet Union, seeking a relaxation in tensions between the two superpowers As a part of this strategy, he negotiated the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (culminating in the SALT I treaty) and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the Lyndon Johnson administration but were postponed in protest upon the invasion by Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 [121]\n\n\nIsraeli policy and Soviet Jewry\nAccording to notes taken by H R Haldeman, Nixon \"ordered his aides to exclude all Jewish-Americans from policy-making on Israel\", including Kissinger [124] One note quotes Nixon as saying \"get K  [Kissinger] out of the play—Haig handle it\" [124]\n\n\nArab–Israeli conflict\nIn September 1973, Nixon fired William P Rogers as Secretary of State and replaced him with Kissinger He would later state he had not been given enough time to know the Middle East as he settled into the State Department [128] Kissinger later admitted that he was so engrossed with the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam war that he and others in Washington missed the significance of the Egyptian-Saudi alliance Egyptian president Anwar Sadat expelled Soviet advisors from Egypt in May 1972, attempting to signal to the U.S that he was open to disentangling Egypt from the Soviet sphere of influence; Kissinger offered secret talks on a settlement for the Middle East, though nothing came of the offer By March 1973, Sadat had moved back towards the Soviets, closing the largest arms package between Egypt and the Soviet Union and allowing for the return of Soviet military personnel and advisors to Egypt [129]\n\n\nPersian Gulf\nA major concern for Kissinger was the possibility of Soviet influence in the Persian Gulf In April 1969, Iraq came into conflict with Iran when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi renounced the 1937 treaty governing the Shatt-al-Arab river On December 1, 1971, after two years of skirmishes along the border, President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr broke off diplomatic relations with Iran [146] In May 1972, Nixon and Kissinger visited Tehran to tell the Shah that there would be no \"second-guessing of his requests\" to buy American weapons [146] At the same time, Nixon and Kissinger agreed to a plan of the Shah's that the United States together with Iran and Israel would support the Kurdish peshmerga guerrillas fighting for independence from Iraq [146] Kissinger later wrote that after Vietnam, there was no possibility of deploying American forces in the Middle East, and henceforward Iran was to act as America's surrogate in the Persian Gulf [147] Kissinger described the Ba'athist regime in Iraq as a potential threat to the United States and believed that building up Iran and supporting the peshmerga was the best counterweight [147]\n\n\nTurkish invasion of Cyprus\nFollowing a period of steady relations between the U.S Government and the Greek military regime after 1967, Secretary of State Kissinger was faced with the coup by the Greek junta and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July and August 1974 In an August 1974 edition of The New York Times, it was revealed that Kissinger and State Department were informed in advance of the impending coup by the Greek junta in Cyprus Indeed, according to the journalist, [148] the official version of events as told by the State Department was that it felt it had to warn the Greek military regime not to carry out the coup.\n\n\nLatin American policy\nIn 1970, Kissinger parroted to Nixon the United States Department of Defense's position that the country should maintain control over the Panama Canal, which was a reversal of the commitment by the Lyndon Johnson administration [154] Later, in the face of international pressure, Kissinger changed his stance, viewing the past hardline position in the Panama Canal issue as a hindrance to American relations with Latin America and an international setback that the Soviet Union would approve of [154] Kissinger in 1973 called for \"new dialogue\" between the United States and Latin America, then in 1974, Kissinger met Panama military leader Omar Torrijos and an agreement on eight operating principles for an eventual handover of the Panama Canal to Panama was made between Kissinger and Panamanian foreign minister Juan Antonio Tack, which angered the United States Congress, but ultimately provided a framework for the 1977 U.S.–Panama treaties [154]\n\n\nIntervention in Chile\nChilean Socialist Party presidential candidate Salvador Allende was elected by a plurality of 36.2 percent in 1970, causing serious concern in Washington, D.C., due to his openly socialist and pro-Cuban politics The Nixon administration, with Kissinger's input, authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to encourage a military coup that would prevent Allende's inauguration, but the plan was not successful.: 115  [157]: 495  [158]: 177 \n\n\nArgentina\nKissinger took a similar line as he had toward Chile when the Argentine Armed Forces, led by Jorge Videla, toppled the elected government of Isabel Perón in 1976 with a process called the National Reorganization Process by the military, with which they consolidated power, launching brutal reprisals and \"disappearances\" against political opponents An October 1987 investigative report in The Nation broke the story of how, in a June 1976 meeting in the Hotel Carrera in Santiago, Kissinger gave the military junta in neighboring Argentina the \"green light\" for their own clandestine repression against leftwing guerrillas and other dissidents, thousands of whom were kept in more than 400 secret concentration camps before they were executed During a meeting with Argentine foreign minister César Augusto Guzzetti, Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally but urged him to \"get back to normal procedures\" quickly before the U.S Congress reconvened and had a chance to consider sanctions [169] [170] [171] [172]\n\n\nBrazil's nuclear weapons program\nKissinger was in favor of accommodating Brazil while it pursued a nuclear weapons program in the 1970s Kissinger justified his position by arguing that Brazil was a U.S ally and on the grounds that it would benefit private nuclear industry actors in the U.S Kissinger's position on Brazil was out of sync with influential voices in the U.S Congress, the State Department, and the U.S Arms Control and Disarmament Agency [177]\n\n\nRhodesia\nIn September 1976, Kissinger was actively involved in negotiations regarding the Rhodesian Bush War Kissinger, along with South Africa's prime minister John Vorster, pressured Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith to hasten the transition to black majority rule in Rhodesia With FRELIMO in control of Mozambique and even the apartheid regime of South Africa withdrawing its support, Rhodesia's isolation was nearly complete According to Smith's autobiography, Kissinger told Smith of Mrs Kissinger's admiration for him, but Smith stated that he thought Kissinger was asking him to sign Rhodesia's \"death certificate\" Kissinger, bringing the weight of the United States, and corralling other relevant parties to put pressure on Rhodesia, hastened the end of white minority rule [178]\n\n\nPortuguese Empire\nIn contrast to the unfriendly disposition of the previous Kennedy and Johnson administrations towards the Estado Novo regime of Portugal, particularly with regards to its attempts to maintain the Portuguese Colonial Empire by waging the Portuguese Colonial War against anti-colonial rebellions in defense of its empire, the Department of State under Kissinger adopted a more conciliatory attitude towards Portugal In 1971, the administration of President Nixon successfully renewed the lease of the American military base in the Azores, despite condemnation from the Congressional Black Caucus and some members of the Senate Though privately continuing to view Portugal contemptibly for its perceived atavistic foreign policy towards Africa, Kissinger publicly expressed thanks for Portugal's agreement to use its military base in Lajes in the Azores to resupply Israel in the Yom Kippur War Following the fall of the far-right Portuguese regime in 1974, Kissinger worried that the new government's hasty decolonization plan might benefit radical factions such as the MPLA in Angola He also expressed concern that the inclusion of the Portuguese Communist Party in the new Portuguese government could legitimize communist parties in other NATO member states, such as Italy [179]\n\n\nEast Timor\nThe Portuguese decolonization process brought U.S attention to the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, which declared its independence in 1975 Indonesian president Suharto regarded East Timor as rightfully part of Indonesia In December 1975, Suharto discussed invasion plans during a meeting with Kissinger and President Ford in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta Both Ford and Kissinger made clear that U.S relations with Indonesia would remain strong and that it would not object to the proposed annexation [180] They only wanted it done \"fast\" and proposed that it be delayed until after they had returned to Washington [181] Accordingly, Suharto delayed the operation for one day Finally on December 7, Indonesian forces invaded the former Portuguese colony U.S arms sales to Indonesia continued, and Suharto went ahead with the annexation plan According to Ben Kiernan, the invasion and occupation resulted in the deaths of nearly a quarter of the Timorese population from 1975 to 1981 [182]\n\n\nCuba\nDuring the 1970 Cienfuegos Crisis, in which the Soviet Navy was strongly suspected of building a submarine base in the Cuban city of Cienfuegos, Kissinger met with Anatoly Dobrynin, Soviet Ambassador to the United States, informing him that the United States government considered this act a violation of the agreements made in 1962 by President John F Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, prompting the Soviets to halt construction of their planned base in Cienfuegos [183]\n\n\nWestern Sahara\nThe Kissingerian doctrine endorsed the forced concession of Spanish Sahara to Morocco [185] At the height of the 1975 Sahara crisis, Kissinger misled Gerald Ford into thinking the International Court of Justice had ruled in favor of Morocco [186] Kissinger was aware in advance of the Moroccan plans for the invasion of the territory, materialized on November 6, 1975, in the so-called Green March [186]\n\n\nZaire\nKissinger was involved in furthering cooperation between the U.S and the Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and held multiple meetings with him Kissinger later described these efforts as \"one of our policy successes in Africa\" and praised Mobutu as \"courageous, politically astute\" and \"relatively honest in a country where governmental corruption is a way of life\" [187]\n\n\nLater roles\nAfter Nixon was forced to resign in the Watergate scandal, Kissinger's influence in the new presidential administration of Gerald R Ford was somewhat diminished after he was replaced by Brent Scowcroft as National Security Advisor during the \"Halloween Massacre\" cabinet reshuffle of November 1975 [188] Ford later explained his decision as such: \"When Kissinger had both State and NSC, there was not an independent evaluation of proposals, and I never liked that arrangement that I inherited And when the time came to make some  [other] changes at the Pentagon and CIA, it was logical to tell Henry, ‘I'm gonna just leave you as secretary of state and upgrade Brent Scowcroft’\" [189]  Kissinger left office as Secretary of State when Democrat Jimmy Carter defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election [190]\n\n\nViews on U.S. foreign policy\nIn several articles of his and interviews that he gave during the Yugoslav Wars, he criticized the United States' policies in Southeast Europe, among other things for the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state, which he described as a foolish act [218] Most importantly he dismissed the notion of Serbs and Croats being aggressors or separatist, saying that \"they can't be separating from something that has never existed\" [219] In addition, he repeatedly warned the West against inserting itself into a conflict that has its roots at least hundreds of years back in time, and said that the West would do better if it allowed the Serbs and Croats to join their respective countries [219] Kissinger shared similarly critical views on Western involvement in Kosovo In particular, he held a disparaging view of the Rambouillet Agreement: [220]\n\n\nYugoslav Wars\nIn several articles of his and interviews that he gave during the Yugoslav Wars, he criticized the United States' policies in Southeast Europe, among other things for the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state, which he described as a foolish act [218] Most importantly he dismissed the notion of Serbs and Croats being aggressors or separatist, saying that \"they can't be separating from something that has never existed\" [219] In addition, he repeatedly warned the West against inserting itself into a conflict that has its roots at least hundreds of years back in time, and said that the West would do better if it allowed the Serbs and Croats to join their respective countries [219] Kissinger shared similarly critical views on Western involvement in Kosovo In particular, he held a disparaging view of the Rambouillet Agreement: [220]\n\n\nIraq\nIn 2006, it was reported in the book State of Denial by Bob Woodward that Kissinger met regularly with President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to offer advice on the Iraq War [222] Kissinger confirmed in recorded interviews with Woodward [223] that the advice was the same as he had given in a column in The Washington Post on August 12, 2005: \"Victory over the insurgency is the only meaningful exit strategy.\" [224] Kissinger also frequently met with U.S Secretary of State Colin Powell, whom he warned that Coalition Provisional Authority Director L Paul Bremer was \"a control freak\" [225]\n\n\nIndia\nKissinger said in April 2008 that \"India has parallel objectives to the United States\", and he called the nation an ally of the U.S [228]\n\n\nChina\nKissinger attended the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics [229] A few months before the Games opened, as controversy over China's human rights record was intensifying due to criticism by Amnesty International and other groups of the widespread use of the death penalty and other issues, Kissinger told China's official press agency Xinhua: \"I think one should separate Olympics as a sporting event from whatever political disagreements people may have had with China I expect that the games will proceed in the spirit for which they were designed, which is friendship among nations, and that other issues are discussed in other forums.\" He said China had made huge efforts to stage the Games \"Friends of China should not use the Olympics to pressure China now.\" He added that he would bring two of his grandchildren to watch the Games and planned to attend the opening ceremony [230] During the Games, he participated with Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe, film star Jackie Chan, and former British prime minister Tony Blair at a Peking University forum on the qualities that make a champion [231] He sat with his wife Nancy Kissinger, President George W Bush, former president George H W Bush, and Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi at the men's basketball game between China and the U.S [232]\n\n\nIran\nKissinger's position on this issue of U.S.–Iran talks was reported by the Tehran Times to be that \"Any direct talks between the U.S and Iran on issues such as the nuclear dispute would be most likely to succeed if they first involved only diplomatic staff and progressed to the level of secretary of state before the heads of state meet.\" [242] In 2016, Kissinger said that the biggest challenge facing the Middle East is the \"potential domination of the region by an Iran that is both imperial and jihadist\" He further wrote in August 2017 that if the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran and its Shiite allies were allowed to fill the territorial vacuum left by a militarily defeated Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the region would be left with a land corridor extending from Iran to the Levant \"which could mark the emergence of an Iranian radical empire\" [243] Commenting on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Kissinger said that he would not have agreed to it, but that Trump's plan to end the agreement after it was signed would \"enable the Iranians to do more than us\" [244]\n\n\n2014 Ukrainian crisis\nOn March 5, 2014, The Washington Post published an op-ed piece by Kissinger, 11 days before the Crimean referendum on whether Autonomous Republic of Crimea should officially rejoin Ukraine or join neighboring Russia [245] In it, he attempted to balance the Ukrainian, Russian, and Western desires for a functional state He made four main points:\n\n\nComputers and nuclear weapons\nIn 2019, Kissinger wrote about the increasing tendency to give control of nuclear weapons to computers operating with artificial intelligence (AI) that: \"Adversaries' ignorance of AI-developed configurations will become a strategic advantage\" [250] Kissinger argued that giving power to launch nuclear weapons to computers using algorithms to make decisions would eliminate the human factor and give the advantage to the state that had the most effective AI system as a computer can make decisions about war and peace far faster than any human ever could [250] Just as an AI-enhanced computer can win chess games by anticipating human decision-making, an AI-enhanced computer could be useful in a crisis as in a nuclear war, the side that strikes first would have the advantage by destroying the opponent's nuclear capacity Kissinger also noted there was always the danger that a computer could make a decision to start a nuclear war before diplomacy had been exhausted, or for a reason that would not be understandable to the operators [251] Kissinger also warned the use of AI to control nuclear weapons would impose \"opacity\" on the decision-making process as the algorithms that control the AI system are not readily understandable, destabilizing the decision-making process:\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nOn April 3, 2020, Kissinger shared his diagnostic view of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that it threatens the \"liberal world order\" Kissinger added that the virus does not know borders although global leaders are trying to address the crisis on a mainly national basis He stressed that the key is not a purely national effort but greater international cooperation [1]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nIn May 2022, speaking to the World Economic Forum on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kissinger advocated for a diplomatic settlement that would restore the status quo ante bellum, effectively ceding Crimea and parts of Donbas to Russian control [252] Kissinger urged Ukrainians to \"match the heroism they have shown with wisdom\", arguing that \" [p]ursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself.\" [253] He spoke to Edward Luce and a Financial Times audience in the same month [254] Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected Kissinger's suggestions, saying Ukraine would not agree to peace until Russia agreed to return Crimea and the Donbas region to Ukraine [255]\n\n\n2023 Israel–Hamas war\nIn a statement made a month before his death, Kissinger responded to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war by saying that the goals of Hamas \"can only be to mobilize the Arab world against Israel and to get off the track of peaceful negotiations\" In response to celebrations of the attack by some Arabs in Germany, he issued a statement denouncing Muslim immigration into Germany: \"It was a grave mistake to let in so many people of totally different culture and religion and concepts, because it creates a pressure group inside each country that does that.\" [259]\n\n\nPublic perception\nA 2014 poll of American international relations scholars conducted by the College of William & Mary ranked Kissinger as the most effective Secretary of State in the 50 years prior to 2015 [7] In 1972, Time commented that \"a streak of suspicion seems to underlie all that he does\" and \"His jokes about his paranoia have an uncomfortable edge of truth\" He was so often seen escorting Hollywood starlets that the Village Voice charged he was \"a secret square posing as a swinger\" [260] The insight, \"Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac\", is widely attributed to him, although Kissinger was paraphrasing Napoleon Bonaparte [261] Critics on the right, such as Ray Takeyh, have faulted Kissinger for his role in the Nixon administration's opening to China and secret negotiations with North Vietnam Takeyh writes that while rapprochement with China was a worthy goal, the Nixon administration failed to achieve any meaningful concessions from Chinese officials in return, as China continued to support North Vietnam and various \"revolutionary forces throughout the Third World\", \"nor does there appear to be even a remote, indirect connection between Nixon and Kissinger's diplomacy and the communist leadership's decision, after Mao's bloody rule, to move away from a communist economy towards state capitalism.\" [60]\n\n\nLegacy and reception\nKissinger has generally received a polarizing reception; some have portrayed him as a strategic genius who was willing to act in a utilitarian manner, others have portrayed his foreign policy decisions as immoral and profoundly damaging in the long run [274]\n\n\nPositive views\nHistorian Niall Ferguson has argued that Kissinger is one of the most effective secretaries of state in American history [275] The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal stated in the aftermath of his death \"Kissinger was a target of both the right and left in those perilous Cold War years, often unfairly\" The article noted that he was often criticized by American conservatives for overlooking human rights in China, while saying \"he had no illusions about the Communist Party or its nationalist ambitions His view was that the U.S and China had to achieve some modus vivendi to avoid war despite their profound cultural and political differences\" while claiming that \"the alternatives then, as now, weren't usually  [democracy advocates] of the left's imagining They were often Communists who would have aligned themselves with the Soviets ..  The U.S provided covert aid to Allende's political opponents, but declassified briefings from the time show the U.S was unaware of the military coup that deposed him Kissinger wasn't responsible for Augusto Pinochet's coup or its bloody excesses Chile eventually became a democracy .. Cuba remains a dictatorship.\" [276]\n\n\nNegative views\nA number of journalists, activists, and human rights lawyers accused Kissinger of being responsible for war crimes during his tenure in government [8] [277] Some sought civil and even criminal penalties against Kissinger, but none of these attempts were successful [162] In September 2001, relatives and survivors of General Rene Schneider filed civil proceedings in federal court in Washington, D.C [278] The suit was later dismissed [166] In April 2002, a petition for Kissinger's arrest was filed in the High Court of Justice in London by human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, citing the destruction of civilian populations and the environment in Indochina during the years 1969–1975 [279] [280] The petition was rejected one day after filing [281]\n\n\nOther perspectives\n\nSeveral historians have rejected both prominent reputations of Kissinger David Greenberg argued that each are exaggerated caricatures that overstate both his genius and immorality: \n\nFamily and personal life\nKissinger married Anneliese \"Ann\" Fleischer (born November 6, 1925, in Fürth, Germany) on February 6, 1949 They had two children, Elizabeth and David, and divorced in 1964 In 1955, he met Austrian poet Ingeborg Bachmann during a symposium at Harvard; the two had a romantic relationship that lasted several years [291] On March 30, 1974, he married Nancy Maginnes [292] [293] They lived in Kent, Connecticut, and in New York City Kissinger's son David served as an executive with NBC Universal Television Studio before becoming head of Conaco, Conan O'Brien's production company, in 2005 [294] In February 1982, at the age of 58, Henry Kissinger underwent coronary bypass surgery On May 27, 2023, he turned 100 [295]\n\n\nSoccer\nDaryl Grove characterized Kissinger as one of the most influential people in the growth of soccer in the United States [297] Kissinger was named chairman of the North American Soccer League board of directors in 1978 [298]\n\n\nDeath\nKissinger died from heart failure at his home in Kent, Connecticut, on November 29, 2023, at the age of 100 [303] At the time of his death, he was last living former U.S Cabinet member who served in the Richard Nixon administration [304] [305] [306] [307] He was survived by his wife, Nancy Maginnes Kissinger; two children, David and Elizabeth; and five grandchildren [308] His death was announced by Kissinger Associates, his consulting firm [308] Kissinger Associates announced that the funeral would be private; [309] He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery [310]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nKissinger was widely admired within China and praised by the Chinese Communist Party [311] Government figures on state media uniformly released posts mourning his death Chinese social media expressed widespread sorrow after news of his death was released, and hashtags idolizing Kissinger became the most searched trend in China [312] [273] China News Service stated in its obituary for Kissinger that \"Today, this 'old friend of the Chinese people,' who had a sharp vision and a thorough understanding of world affairs, has completed his legendary life\" China Central Television, the state broadcaster, called Kissinger a \"legendary diplomat\" and a \"living fossil\" who had witnessed the development of China-U.S relations [272] Shortly before his death, Chinese president Xi Jinping stated: \"The Chinese people never forget their old friends, and Sino-U.S relations will always be linked with the name of Henry Kissinger\" [272]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nThe announcement of Kissinger's death saw a widespread mix of tribute and criticism on American social media [322]\n\n\nAwards, honors, and associations\n\n\nNotable works\n\n\nTheses\n\n\nMemoirs\n\n\nPublic policy\n\n\nOther works\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nBiographies\n\n\nOther\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Henry Kissinger**\n\nHenry Kissinger is a German-American diplomat, politician, and economist who served as the 56th United States Secretary of State from 1973 to 1977.

However, the driving force behind the rapprochement with China was Nixon. In April 1970, both Nixon and Kissinger promised Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, that they would never abandon Taiwan or make any compromises with Mao Zedong.\n\n## Vietnam War\n\nKissinger discussed being involved in Indochina prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon. According to Kissinger, his friend Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the Ambassador to Saigon, employed Kissinger as a consultant, leading to Kissinger visiting Vietnam once in 1965 and twice in 1966.\n\n## Interview with Oriana Fallaci\n\nOn November 4, 1972, Kissinger agreed to an interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci. The interview turned out to be a political and public relations disaster for Kissinger, as he agreed that Vietnam was a \"useless war\" and implied that he preferred to have dinner with Lê Đức Thọ over Nguyễn Văn Thiệu.\n\n## Bangladesh Liberation War\n\nNixon supported Pakistani dictator Yahya Khan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Kissinger sneered at people who \"bleed\" for \"the dying Bengalis\" and ignored the first telegram from the U.S consul general in East Pakistan, Archer K Blood, and 20 members of his staff.\n\n## Europe\n\nAs National Security Adviser under Nixon, Kissinger pioneered the policy of détente with the Soviet Union, seeking a relaxation in tensions between the two superpowers. He negotiated the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (culminating in the SALT I treaty) and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Leonid Brezhnev.\n\n## Persian Gulf\n\nA major concern for Kissinger was the possibility of Soviet influence in the Persian Gulf. In April 1969, Iraq came into conflict with Iran when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi renounced the 1937 treaty governing the Shatt-al-Arab river.\n\n## Turkish Invasion of Cyprus\n\nFollowing a period of steady relations between the U.S Government and the Greek military regime after 1967, Secretary of State Kissinger was faced with the coup by the Greek junta and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July and August 1974.\n\n## Latin American Policy\n\nIn 1970, Kissinger parroted to Nixon the United States Department of Defense's position that the country should maintain control over the Panama Canal, which was a reversal of the commitment by the Lyndon Johnson administration.\n\n## Intervention in Chile\n\nChilean Socialist Party presidential candidate Salvador Allende was elected by a plurality of 36.2 percent in 1970, causing serious concern in Washington, D.C. due to his openly socialist and pro-Cuban politics.\n\n## Argentina\n\nKissinger took a similar line as he had toward Chile when the Argentine Armed Forces, led by Jorge Videla, toppled the elected government of Isabel Perón in 1976 with a process called the National Reorganization Process by the military.\n\n## East Timor\n\nThe Portuguese decolonization process brought U.S attention to the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, which declared its independence in 1975.

the division and volunteered for hazardous intelligence duties during the Battle of the Bulge On April 10, 1945, he participated in the liberation of the Hannover-Ahlem concentration camp, a subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp At the time, Kissinger wrote in his journal, \"I had never seen people degraded to the level that people were in Ahlem They barely looked human They were skeletons.\" After the initial shock, however, Kissinger was relatively silent about his wartime service [23] [24]\n\n\nAcademic career\nKissinger earned his Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude, Phi Beta

[63]\n\n\nVietnam War\nKissinger discussed being involved in Indochina prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon [72] According to Kissinger, his friend Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the Ambassador to Saigon, employed Kissinger as a consultant, leading to Kissinger visiting Vietnam once in 1965 and twice in 1966, where Kissinger realized that the United States \"knew neither how to win or how to conclude\" the Vietnam War [72] Kissinger also stated that in 1967, he served as an intermediary for negotiations between the United States and North Vietnam, with Kissinger providing the American position, while two Frenchmen provided the North Vietnamese position [72]\n\n\nInterview with Oriana Fallaci\nOn November 4, 1972, [104] Kissinger agreed to an interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci Kissinger, who rarely engaged in one-on-one interviews with the press and knew very little about Fallaci, accepted her request after reportedly being impressed with her 1969 interview with Võ Nguyên Giáp [105] The interview turned out to be a political and public relations disaster for Kissinger as he agreed that Vietnam was a \"useless war\", implied that he preferred to have dinner with Lê Đức Thọ over Nguyễn Văn Thiệu (in her 1976 book Interview with History, Fallaci recalled that Kissinger agreed with many of her negative sentiments towards Thiệu in a private discussion before the interview), and engaged in a now infamous exchange with the hard-pressing Fallaci, with Kissinger comparing himself to a cowboy leading the Nixon administration:\n\n\nBangladesh Liberation War\nNixon supported Pakistani dictator Yahya Khan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 Kissinger sneered at people who \"bleed\" for \"the dying Bengalis\" and ignored the first telegram from the U.S consul general in East Pakistan, Archer K Blood, and 20 members of his staff, which informed the U.S that their allies West Pakistan were undertaking, in Blood's words, \"a selective genocide\" targeting the Bengali intelligentsia, supporters of independence for East Pakistan, and the Hindu minority [108] In the second, more famous, Blood Telegram the word 'genocide' was again used to describe the events, and further that with its continuing support for West Pakistan the U.S government had \"evidenced .. moral bankruptcy\" [109] As a direct response to the dissent against U.S policy, Kissinger and Nixon ended Archer Blood's tenure as United States consul general in East Pakistan and put him to work in the State Department's Personnel Office [110] [111] Christopher Clary argues that Nixon and Kissinger were unconsciously biased, leading them to overestimate the likelihood of Pakistani victory against Bengali rebels [112]\n\n\nEurope\nAs National Security Adviser under Nixon, Kissinger pioneered the policy of détente with the Soviet Union, seeking a relaxation in tensions between the two superpowers As a part of this strategy, he negotiated the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (culminating in the SALT I treaty) and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the Lyndon Johnson administration but were postponed in protest upon the invasion by Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 [121]\n\n\nIsraeli policy and Soviet Jewry\nAccording to notes taken by H R Haldeman, Nixon \"ordered his aides to exclude all Jewish-Americans from policy-making on Israel\", including Kissinger [124] One note quotes Nixon as saying \"get K  [Kissinger] out of the play—Haig handle it\" [124]\n\n\nArab–Israeli conflict\nIn September 1973, Nixon fired William P Rogers as Secretary of State and replaced him with Kissinger He would later state he had not been given enough time to know the Middle East as he settled into the State Department [128] Kissinger later admitted that he was so engrossed with the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam war that he and others in Washington missed the significance of the Egyptian-Saudi alliance Egyptian president Anwar Sadat expelled Soviet advisors from Egypt in May 1972, attempting to signal to the U.S that he was open to disentangling Egypt from the Soviet sphere of influence; Kissinger offered secret talks on a settlement for the Middle East, though nothing came of the offer By March 1973, Sadat had moved back towards the Soviets, closing the largest arms package between Egypt and the Soviet Union and allowing for the return of Soviet military personnel and advisors to Egypt [129]\n\n\nPersian Gulf\nA major concern for Kissinger was the possibility of Soviet influence in the Persian Gulf In April 1969, Iraq came into conflict with Iran when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi renounced the 1937 treaty governing the Shatt-al-Arab river On December 1, 1971, after two years of skirmishes along the border, President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr broke off diplomatic relations with Iran [146] In May 1972, Nixon and Kissinger visited Tehran to tell the Shah that there would be no \"second-guessing of his requests\" to buy American weapons [146] At the same time, Nixon and Kissinger agreed to a plan of the Shah's that the United States together with Iran and Israel would support the Kurdish peshmerga guerrillas fighting for independence from Iraq [146] Kissinger later wrote that after Vietnam, there was no possibility of deploying American forces in the Middle East, and henceforward Iran was to act as America's surrogate in the Persian Gulf [147] Kissinger described the Ba'athist regime in Iraq as a potential threat to the United States and believed that building up Iran and supporting the peshmerga was the best counterweight [147]\n\n\nTurkish invasion of Cyprus\nFollowing a period of steady relations between the U.S Government and the Greek military regime after 1967, Secretary of State Kissinger was faced with the coup by the Greek junta and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July and August 1974 In an August 1974 edition of The New York Times, it was revealed that Kissinger and State Department were informed in advance of the impending coup by the Greek junta in Cyprus Indeed, according to the journalist, [148] the official version of events as told by the State Department was that it felt it had to warn the Greek military regime not to carry out the coup.\n\n\nLatin American policy\nIn 1970, Kissinger parroted to Nixon the United States Department of Defense's position that the country should maintain control over the Panama Canal, which was a reversal of the commitment by the Lyndon Johnson administration [154] Later, in the face of international pressure, Kissinger changed his stance, viewing the past hardline position in the Panama Canal issue as a hindrance to American relations with Latin America and an international setback that the Soviet Union would approve of [154] Kissinger in 1973 called for \"new dialogue\" between the United States and Latin America, then in 1974, Kissinger met Panama military leader Omar Torrijos and an agreement on eight operating principles for an eventual handover of the Panama Canal to Panama was made between Kissinger and Panamanian foreign minister Juan Antonio Tack, which angered the United States Congress, but ultimately provided a framework for the 1977 U.S.–Panama treaties [154]\n\n\nIntervention in Chile\nChilean Socialist Party presidential candidate Salvador Allende was elected by a plurality of 36.2 percent in 1970, causing serious concern in Washington, D.C., due to his openly socialist and pro-Cuban politics The Nixon administration, with Kissinger's input, authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to encourage a military coup that would prevent Allende's inauguration, but the plan was not successful.: 115  [157]: 495  [158]: 177 \n\n\nArgentina\nKissinger took a similar line as he had toward Chile when the Argentine Armed Forces, led by Jorge Videla, toppled the elected government of Isabel Perón in 1976 with a process called the National Reorganization Process by the military, with which they consolidated power, launching brutal reprisals and \"disappearances\" against political opponents An October 1987 investigative report in The Nation broke the story of how, in a June 1976 meeting in the Hotel Carrera in Santiago, Kissinger gave the military junta in neighboring Argentina the \"green light\" for their own clandestine repression against leftwing guerrillas and other dissidents, thousands of whom were kept in more than 400 secret concentration camps before they were executed During a meeting with Argentine foreign minister César Augusto Guzzetti, Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally but urged him to \"get back to normal procedures\" quickly before the U.S Congress reconvened and had a chance to consider sanctions [169] [170] [171] [172]\n\n\nBrazil's nuclear weapons program\nKissinger was in favor of accommodating Brazil while it pursued a nuclear weapons program in the 1970s Kissinger justified his position by arguing that Brazil was a U.S ally and on the grounds that it would benefit private nuclear industry actors in the U.S Kissinger's position on Brazil was out of sync with influential voices in the U.S Congress, the State Department, and the U.S Arms Control and Disarmament Agency [177]\n\n\nRhodesia\nIn September 1976, Kissinger was actively involved in negotiations regarding the Rhodesian Bush War Kissinger, along with South Africa's prime minister John Vorster, pressured Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith to hasten the transition to black majority rule in Rhodesia With FRELIMO in control of Mozambique and even the apartheid regime of South Africa withdrawing its support, Rhodesia's isolation was nearly complete According to Smith's autobiography, Kissinger told Smith of Mrs Kissinger's admiration for him, but Smith stated that he thought Kissinger was asking him to sign Rhodesia's \"death certificate\" Kissinger, bringing the weight of the United States, and corralling other relevant parties to put pressure on Rhodesia, hastened the end of white minority rule [178]\n\n\nPortuguese Empire\nIn contrast to the unfriendly disposition of the previous Kennedy and Johnson administrations towards the Estado Novo regime of Portugal, particularly with regards to its attempts to maintain the Portuguese Colonial Empire by waging the Portuguese Colonial War against anti-colonial rebellions in defense of its empire, the Department of State under Kissinger adopted a more conciliatory attitude towards Portugal In 1971, the administration of President Nixon successfully renewed the lease of the American military base in the Azores, despite condemnation from the Congressional Black Caucus and some members of the Senate Though privately continuing to view Portugal contemptibly for its perceived atavistic foreign policy towards Africa, Kissinger publicly expressed thanks for Portugal's agreement to use its military base in Lajes in the Azores to resupply Israel in the Yom Kippur War Following the fall of the far-right Portuguese regime in 1974, Kissinger worried that the new government's hasty decolonization plan might benefit radical factions such as the MPLA in Angola He also expressed concern that the inclusion of the Portuguese Communist Party in the new Portuguese government could legitimize communist parties in other NATO member states, such as Italy [179]\n\n\nEast Timor\nThe Portuguese decolonization process brought U.S attention to the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, which declared its independence in 1975 Indonesian president Suharto regarded East Timor as rightfully part of Indonesia In December 1975, Suharto discussed invasion plans during a meeting with Kissinger and President Ford in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta Both Ford and Kissinger made clear that U.S relations with Indonesia would remain strong and that it would not object to the proposed annexation [180] They only wanted it done \"fast\" and proposed that it be delayed until after they had returned to Washington [181] Accordingly, Suharto delayed the operation for one day Finally on December 7, Indonesian forces invaded the former Portuguese colony U.S arms sales to Indonesia continued, and Suharto went ahead with the annexation plan According to Ben Kiernan, the invasion and occupation resulted in the deaths of nearly a quarter of the Timorese population from 1975 to 1981 [182]\n\n\nCuba\nDuring the 1970 Cienfuegos Crisis, in which the Soviet Navy was strongly suspected of building a submarine base in the Cuban city of Cienfuegos, Kissinger met with Anatoly Dobrynin, Soviet Ambassador to the United States, informing him that the United States government considered this act a violation of the agreements made in 1962 by President John F Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, prompting the Soviets to halt construction of their planned base in Cienfuegos [183]\n\n\nWestern Sahara\nThe Kissingerian doctrine endorsed the forced concession of Spanish Sahara to Morocco [185] At the height of the 1975 Sahara crisis, Kissinger misled Gerald Ford into thinking the International Court of Justice had ruled in favor of Morocco [186] Kissinger was aware in advance of the Moroccan plans for the invasion of the territory, materialized on November 6, 1975, in the so-called Green March [186]\n\n\nZaire\nKissinger was involved in furthering cooperation between the U.S and the Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and held multiple meetings with him Kissinger later described these efforts as \"one of our policy successes in Africa\" and praised Mobutu as \"courageous, politically astute\" and \"relatively honest in a country where governmental corruption is a way of life\" [187]\n\n\nLater roles\nAfter Nixon was forced to resign in the Watergate scandal, Kissinger's influence in the new presidential administration of Gerald R Ford was somewhat diminished after he was replaced by Brent Scowcroft as National Security Advisor during the \"Halloween Massacre\" cabinet reshuffle of November 1975 [188] Ford later explained his decision as such: \"When Kissinger had both State and NSC, there was not an independent evaluation of proposals, and I never liked that arrangement that I inherited And when the time came to make some  [other] changes at the Pentagon and CIA, it was logical to tell Henry, ‘I'm gonna just leave you as secretary of state and upgrade Brent Scowcroft’\" [189]  Kissinger left office as Secretary of State when Democrat Jimmy Carter defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election [190]\n\n\nViews on U.S. foreign policy\nIn several articles of his and interviews that he gave during the Yugoslav Wars, he criticized the United States' policies in Southeast Europe, among other things for the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state, which he described as a foolish act [218] Most importantly he dismissed the notion of Serbs and Croats being aggressors or separatist, saying that \"they can't be separating from something that has never existed\" [219] In addition, he repeatedly warned the West against inserting itself into a conflict that has its roots at least hundreds of years back in time, and said that the West would do better if it allowed the Serbs and Croats to join their respective countries [219] Kissinger shared similarly critical views on Western involvement in Kosovo In particular, he held a disparaging view of the Rambouillet Agreement: [220]\n\n\nYugoslav Wars\nIn several articles of his and interviews that he gave during the Yugoslav Wars, he criticized the United States' policies in Southeast Europe, among other things for the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state, which he described as a foolish act [218] Most importantly he dismissed the notion of Serbs and Croats being aggressors or separatist, saying that \"they can't be separating from something that has never existed\" [219] In addition, he repeatedly warned the West against inserting itself into a conflict that has its roots at least hundreds of years back in time, and said that the West would do better if it allowed the Serbs and Croats to join their respective countries [219] Kissinger shared similarly critical views on Western involvement in Kosovo In particular, he held a disparaging view of the Rambouillet Agreement: [220]\n\n\nIraq\nIn 2006, it was reported in the book State of Denial by Bob Woodward that Kissinger met regularly with President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to offer advice on the Iraq War [222] Kissinger confirmed in recorded interviews with Woodward [223] that the advice was the same as he had given in a column in The Washington Post on August 12, 2005: \"Victory over the insurgency is the only meaningful exit strategy.\" [224] Kissinger also frequently met with U.S Secretary of State Colin Powell, whom he warned that Coalition Provisional Authority Director L Paul Bremer was \"a control freak\" [225]\n\n\nIndia\nKissinger said in April 2008 that \"India has parallel objectives to the United States\", and he called the nation an ally of the U.S [228]\n\n\nChina\nKissinger attended the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics [229] A few months before the Games opened, as controversy over China's human rights record was intensifying due to criticism by Amnesty International and other groups of the widespread use of the death penalty and other issues, Kissinger told China's official press agency Xinhua: \"I think one should separate Olympics as a sporting event from whatever political disagreements people may have had with China I expect that the games will proceed in the spirit for which they were designed, which is friendship among nations, and that other issues are discussed in other forums.\" He said China had made huge efforts to stage the Games \"Friends of China should not use the Olympics to pressure China now.\" He added that he would bring two of his grandchildren to watch the Games and planned to attend the opening ceremony [230] During the Games, he participated with Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe, film star Jackie Chan, and former British prime minister Tony Blair at a Peking University forum on the qualities that make a champion [231] He sat with his wife Nancy Kissinger, President George W Bush, former president George H W Bush, and Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi at the men's basketball game between China and the U.S [232]\n\n\nIran\nKissinger's position on this issue of U.S.–Iran talks was reported by the Tehran Times to be that \"Any direct talks between the U.S and Iran on issues such as the nuclear dispute would be most likely to succeed if they first involved only diplomatic staff and progressed to the level of secretary of state before the heads of state meet.\" [242] In 2016, Kissinger said that the biggest challenge facing the Middle East is the \"potential domination of the region by an Iran that is both imperial and jihadist\" He further wrote in August 2017 that if the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran and its Shiite allies were allowed to fill the territorial vacuum left by a militarily defeated Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the region would be left with a land corridor extending from Iran to the Levant \"which could mark the emergence of an Iranian radical empire\" [243] Commenting on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Kissinger said that he would not have agreed to it, but that Trump's plan to end the agreement after it was signed would \"enable the Iranians to do more than us\" [244]\n\n\n2014 Ukrainian crisis\nOn March 5, 2014, The Washington Post published an op-ed piece by Kissinger, 11 days before the Crimean referendum on whether Autonomous Republic of Crimea should officially rejoin Ukraine or join neighboring Russia [245] In it, he attempted to balance the Ukrainian, Russian, and Western desires for a functional state He made four main points:\n\n\nComputers and nuclear weapons\nIn 2019, Kissinger wrote about the increasing tendency to give control of nuclear weapons to computers operating with artificial intelligence (AI) that: \"Adversaries' ignorance of AI-developed configurations will become a strategic advantage\" [250] Kissinger argued that giving power to launch nuclear weapons to computers using algorithms to make decisions would eliminate the human factor and give the advantage to the state that had the most effective AI system as a computer can make decisions about war and peace far faster than any human ever could [250] Just as an AI-enhanced computer can win chess games by anticipating human decision-making, an AI-enhanced computer could be useful in a crisis as in a nuclear war, the side that strikes first would have the advantage by destroying the opponent's nuclear capacity Kissinger also noted there was always the danger that a computer could make a decision to start a nuclear war before diplomacy had been exhausted, or for a reason that would not be understandable to the operators [251] Kissinger also warned the use of AI to control nuclear weapons would impose \"opacity\" on the decision-making process as the algorithms that control the AI system are not readily understandable, destabilizing the decision-making process:\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nOn April 3, 2020, Kissinger shared his diagnostic view of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that it threatens the \"liberal world order\" Kissinger added that the virus does not know borders although global leaders are trying to address the crisis on a mainly national basis He stressed that the key is not a purely national effort but greater international cooperation [1]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nIn May 2022, speaking to the World Economic Forum on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kissinger advocated for a diplomatic settlement that would restore the status quo ante bellum, effectively ceding Crimea and parts of Donbas to Russian control [252] Kissinger urged Ukrainians to \"match the heroism they have shown with wisdom\", arguing that \" [p]ursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself.\" [253] He spoke to Edward Luce and a Financial Times audience in the same month [254] Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected Kissinger's suggestions, saying Ukraine would not agree to peace until Russia agreed to return Crimea and the Donbas region to Ukraine [255]\n\n\n2023 Israel–Hamas war\nIn a statement made a month before his death, Kissinger responded to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war by saying that the goals of Hamas \"can only be to mobilize the Arab world against Israel and to get off the track of peaceful negotiations\" In response to celebrations of the attack by some Arabs in Germany, he issued a statement denouncing Muslim immigration into Germany: \"It was a grave mistake to let in so many people of totally different culture and religion and concepts, because it creates a pressure group inside each country that does that.\" [259]\n\n\nPublic perception\nA 2014 poll of American international relations scholars conducted by the College of William & Mary ranked Kissinger as the most effective Secretary of State in the 50 years prior to 2015 [7] In 1972, Time commented that \"a streak of suspicion seems to underlie all that he does\" and \"His jokes about his paranoia have an uncomfortable edge of truth\" He was so often seen escorting Hollywood starlets that the Village Voice charged he was \"a secret square posing as a swinger\" [260] The insight, \"Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac\", is widely attributed to him, although Kissinger was paraphrasing Napoleon Bonaparte [261] Critics on the right, such as Ray Takeyh, have faulted Kissinger for his role in the Nixon administration's opening to China and secret negotiations with North Vietnam Takeyh writes that while rapprochement with China was a worthy goal, the Nixon administration failed to achieve any meaningful concessions from Chinese officials in return, as China continued to support North Vietnam and various \"revolutionary forces throughout the Third World\", \"nor does there appear to be even a remote, indirect connection between Nixon and Kissinger's diplomacy and the communist leadership's decision, after Mao's bloody rule, to move away from a communist economy towards state capitalism.\" [60]\n\n\nLegacy and reception\nKissinger has generally received a polarizing reception; some have portrayed him as a strategic genius who was willing to act in a utilitarian manner, others have portrayed his foreign policy decisions as immoral and profoundly damaging in the long run [274]\n\n\nPositive views\nHistorian Niall Ferguson has argued that Kissinger is one of the most effective secretaries of state in American history [275] The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal stated in the aftermath of his death \"Kissinger was a target of both the right and left in those perilous Cold War years, often unfairly\" The article noted that he was often criticized by American conservatives for overlooking human rights in China, while saying \"he had no illusions about the Communist Party or its nationalist ambitions His view was that the U.S and China had to achieve some modus vivendi to avoid war despite their profound cultural and political differences\" while claiming that \"the alternatives then, as now, weren't usually  [democracy advocates] of the left's imagining They were often Communists who would have aligned themselves with the Soviets ..  The U.S provided covert aid to Allende's political opponents, but declassified briefings from the time show the U.S was unaware of the military coup that deposed him Kissinger wasn't responsible for Augusto Pinochet's coup or its bloody excesses Chile eventually became a democracy .. Cuba remains a dictatorship.\" [276]\n\n\nNegative views\nA number of journalists, activists, and human rights lawyers accused Kissinger of being responsible for war crimes during his tenure in government [8] [277] Some sought civil and even criminal penalties against Kissinger, but none of these attempts were successful [162] In September 2001, relatives and survivors of General Rene Schneider filed civil proceedings in federal court in Washington, D.C [278] The suit was later dismissed [166] In April 2002, a petition for Kissinger's arrest was filed in the High Court of Justice in London by human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, citing the destruction of civilian populations and the environment in Indochina during the years 1969–1975 [279] [280] The petition was rejected one day after filing [281]\n\n\nOther perspectives\n\nSeveral historians have rejected both prominent reputations of Kissinger David Greenberg argued that each are exaggerated caricatures that overstate both his genius and immorality: \n\nFamily and personal life\nKissinger married Anneliese \"Ann\" Fleischer (born November 6, 1925, in Fürth, Germany) on February 6, 1949 They had two children, Elizabeth and David, and divorced in 1964 In 1955, he met Austrian poet Ingeborg Bachmann during a symposium at Harvard; the two had a romantic relationship that lasted several years [291] On March 30, 1974, he married Nancy Maginnes [292] [293] They lived in Kent, Connecticut, and in New York City Kissinger's son David served as an executive with NBC Universal Television Studio before becoming head of Conaco, Conan O'Brien's production company, in 2005 [294] In February 1982, at the age of 58, Henry Kissinger underwent coronary bypass surgery On May 27, 2023, he turned 100 [295]\n\n\nSoccer\nDaryl Grove characterized Kissinger as one of the most influential people in the growth of soccer in the United States [297] Kissinger was named chairman of the North American Soccer League board of directors in 1978 [298]\n\n\nDeath\nKissinger died from heart failure at his home in Kent, Connecticut, on November 29, 2023, at the age of 100 [303] At the time of his death, he was last living former U.S Cabinet member who served in the Richard Nixon administration [304] [305] [306] [307] He was survived by his wife, Nancy Maginnes Kissinger; two children, David and Elizabeth; and five grandchildren [308] His death was announced by Kissinger Associates, his consulting firm [308] Kissinger Associates announced that the funeral would be private; [309] He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery [310]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nKissinger was widely admired within China and praised by the Chinese Communist Party [311] Government figures on state media uniformly released posts mourning his death Chinese social media expressed widespread sorrow after news of his death was released, and hashtags idolizing Kissinger became the most searched trend in China [312] [273] China News Service stated in its obituary for Kissinger that \"Today, this 'old friend of the Chinese people,' who had a sharp vision and a thorough understanding of world affairs, has completed his legendary life\" China Central Television, the state broadcaster, called Kissinger a \"legendary diplomat\" and a \"living fossil\" who had witnessed the development of China-U.S relations [272] Shortly before his death, Chinese president Xi Jinping stated: \"The Chinese people never forget their old friends, and Sino-U.S relations will always be linked with the name of Henry Kissinger\" [272]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nThe announcement of Kissinger's death saw a widespread mix of tribute and criticism on American social media [322]\n\n\nAwards, honors, and associations\n\n\nNotable works\n\n\nTheses\n\n\nMemoirs\n\n\nPublic policy\n\n\nOther works\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nBiographies\n\n\nOther\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[110]\n\n\nGoal kick\nSince the first FA laws of 1863, a player has not been penalised for being in an offside position at the moment a teammate takes a goal kick [109]  (According to the \"strict\" offside law used in 1863, every player on the attacking side would automatically have been in an offside position from such a goalkick, since it had to be taken from the goal line and a player could be in an offside position even when in their own half.) [110]\n\n\nThrow-in\nUnder the original laws of 1863, it was not possible to be offside from a throw-in; [111] however, since the ball was required to be thrown in at right-angles to the touch-line, it would have been unusual for a player to gain significant advantage from being ahead of the ball [112]\n\n\nCorner kick\nWhen first introduced in 1872, the corner kick was required to be taken from the corner-flag itself, which made it impossible for an attacking player to be in an offside position relative to the ball [118] In 1874, the corner-kick was allowed to be taken up to one yard from the corner-flag, thus opening up the possibility of a player being in an offside position [119]  At the International Football Conference of December 1882, it was agreed that a player should not be offside from a corner-kick; this change was incorporated into the Laws of the Game in 1883 [120]\n\n\nFree kick\nThe laws of football have always permitted an offside offence to be committed from a free kick  The free kick contrasts, in this respect, with other restarts of play such as the goal kick, corner kick, and throw-in.\n\n\nOffside trap\nPioneered in the early 20th century by Notts County [128] and later adopted by influential Argentine coach Osvaldo Zubeldía, [129] the offside trap is a defensive tactic designed to force the attacking team into an offside position Just before an attacking player is played a through ball, the last defender or defenders move up field, isolating the attacker into an offside position The execution requires careful timing by the defence and is considered a risk, since running up field against the direction of attack may leave the goal exposed [130]  Now that changes to the interpretations of \"interfering with play, interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage\" mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play, players not involved in active play cannot be \"caught offside\", making the tactic riskier An attacker, upon realising they are in an offside position, may simply choose to avoid interfering with play until the ball is played by someone else.\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Offside (Association Football)\n\nIntroduction\nOffside is one of the most debated and complex rules in association football, with its origins dating back to the early 19th century. The rule is designed to prevent attacking players from gaining an unfair advantage by staying ahead of the ball and the opposing team's defense. Over the years, the rule has undergone numerous changes and interpretations, with the most recent updates aimed at simplifying the process and reducing controversy.\n\nSignificance\nOffside is judged at the moment the ball is last touched by the most recent teammate to touch the ball. Being in an offside position is not an offense in itself. A player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a teammate must then become involved in active play, in the opinion of the referee, in order for an offense to occur. When the offside offense occurs, the referee stops play, and awards an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play.\n\nApplication\nThe application of the offside rule may be considered in three steps: offside position, offside offense, and offside sanction.\n\nOffside Position\nA player is in an \"offside position\" if they are in the opposing team's half of the field and also \"nearer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent.\" The 2005 edition of the Laws of the Game included a new IFAB decision that stated, \"In the definition of offside position, 'nearer to his opponents' goal line' means that any part of their head, body, or feet is nearer to their opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent.\" By 2017, the wording had changed to say that, in judging offside position, \"The hands and arms of all players, including the goalkeepers, are not considered.\" A player is in an offside position if two conditions are met:\n\n* They are in the opposing team's half of the field\n* They are nearer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent\n\nOffside Offense\nA player in an offside position at the moment the ball is touched or played by a teammate is only penalized for committing an offside offense if, in the opinion of the referee, they become involved in active play by:\n\n* Interfering with play\n* Interfering with an opponent\n* Gaining an advantage\n\nOffside Sanction\nThe sanction for an offside offense is an indirect free kick for the opponent at the place where the offense occurred, even if it is in the player's own half of the field of play.\n\nOfficiating\nIn enforcing this rule, the referee depends greatly on an assistant referee, who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent, the ball, or the halfway line, whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end. An assistant referee signals for an offside offense by first raising their flag to a vertical position and then, if the referee stops play, by partly lowering their flag to an angle that signifies the location of the offense.\n\nMotivation\nThe motivations for offside rules varied at different times, and were not always clearly stated when the rules were changed.\n\nHistory\nA law similar to offside was used in the game of hurling to goals played in Cornwall in the early 17th century. Before 1863, the concept of offside was not explicitly stated in the rules of football. Traditional games, such as those played at English public schools, had their own versions of offside laws.\n\nSchool and University Football\nOffside laws were found in the largely uncodified and informal football games played at English public schools in the early 19th century. An 1832 article discussing the Eton wall game complained of \"the interminable multiplicity of rules about sneaking, picking up, throwing, rolling, in straight, with a vast number more,\" using the term \"sneaking\" to refer to Eton's offside law. The novel Tom Brown's School Days, published in 1857 but based on the author's experiences at Rugby School from 1834 to 1842, discussed that school's offside law.\n\nClub Football\nMost surviving rules of independent football clubs from before 1860 lack any offside law. This is true of the brief handwritten set of laws for the Foot-Ball Club of Edinburgh (1833), the published laws of Surrey Football Club (1849), the first set of laws of Sheffield Football Club (1858), and those of Melbourne Football Club (1859).\n\nJ. C. Thring\nJ. C. Thring was an advocate for the strictest possible offside law. A resident master at Uppingham School from 1859 to 1864, Thring criticized most existing offside laws for being too lax. The Rugby laws, for example, were at fault because they permitted an offside player to rejoin play immediately after an opponent touched the ball, while Eton's rule of four allowed \"an immense amount of sneaking\" when the number of players was unlimited.\n\nThe F. A. Laws of 1863\nOn November 17, 1863, the newly formed Football Association adopted a resolution mirroring Thring's law from the Simplest Game.\n\nSubsequent Developments: Offside Position\nAt the first revision of the FA laws, in February 1866, an important qualifier was added to soften the \"strict\" offside law. The three-player rule, which stated that a player was offside if they were in the opposing team's half and closer to the opponents' goal line than the ball and the second-to-last opponent, was introduced.\n\nThree-Player Rule (1866)\nAt the first revision of the FA laws, in February 1866, an important qualifier was added to soften the \"strict\" offside law.\n\nEarly Proposals for Change (1867-1874)\nOver the next seven years, there were several attempts to change the three-player rule, but none was successful.\n\nOffside in Own Half (1907)\nThe original laws allowed players to be in an offside position even when in their own half. This happened rarely, but was possible when one team pressed high up the field, for example in a Sunderland v Wolverhampton Wanderers match in December 1901.\n\nTwo-Player Rule (1925)\nThe Scottish FA urged the change from a three-player to a two-player offside rule as early as 1893. Such a change was first proposed at a meeting of IFAB in 1894, where it was rejected. A further proposal from the SFA also failed in 1913, after the Football Association objected.\n\nAttacker Level with Second-Last Defender (1990)\nIn 1990, IFAB declared that an attacker level with the second-last defender is onside, whereas previously such a player had been considered offside. This change, proposed by the Scottish FA, was made in order to \"encourage the attacking team\" by \"giving the attacking player an advantage over the defender.\"\n\nParts of Body (2005)\nIn 2005, IFAB clarified that, when evaluating an attacking player's position for the purposes of the offside law, the part of the player's head, body, or feet closest to the defending team's goal-line should be considered, with the hands and arms being excluded because \"there is no advantage to be gained if only the arms are in advance of the opponent.\"\n\nDefender Outside the Field of Play (2009)\nIn 2009, it was stated that a defender who leaves the field of play without the referee's permission must be considered to be on the nearest boundary line for the purposes of deciding whether an attacker is in an offside position.\n\nHalfway Line (2016)\nIn 2016, it was clarified that a player on the halfway line itself cannot be in an offside position: part of the player's head, body, or feet must be within the opponent's half of the field of play in order to be considered offside.\n\nUnadopted Experiments\nDuring the 1973-74 and 1974-75 seasons, an experimental version of the offside rule was operated in the Scottish League Cup and Drybrough Cup competitions. The concept was that offside should only apply in the last 18 yards (16 meters) of play (inside or beside the penalty area). To signify this, the horizontal line of the penalty area was extended to the touchlines.

A. laws of 1863\nOn 17 November 1863, the newly formed Football Association adopted a resolution mirroring Thring's law from the Simplest Game: [47]\n\n\nSubsequent developments: offside position\n\nAt the first revision of the FA laws, in February 1866, an important qualifier was added to soften the \"strict\" offside law: [53] \n\nThree-player rule (1866)\n\nAt the first revision of the FA laws, in February 1866, an important qualifier was added to soften the \"strict\" offside law: [53] \n\nEarly proposals for change (1867–1874)\nOver the next seven years, there were several attempts to change the three-player rule, but none was successful:\n\n\nOffside in own half (1907)\nThe original laws allowed players to be in an offside position even when in their own half  This happened rarely, but was possible when one team pressed high up the field, for example in a Sunderland v Wolverhampton Wanderers match in December 1901 [67] [68]  When an attacking team adopted the so-called \"one back\" game, in which only the goalkeeper and one outfield player remained in defensive positions, it was even possible for players to be caught offside in their own penalty area [69]\n\n\nTwo-player rule (1925)\nThe Scottish FA urged the change from a three-player to a two-player offside rule as early as 1893 [80] Such a change was first proposed at a meeting of IFAB in 1894, where it was rejected [81]  It was proposed again by the SFA in 1902, upon the urging of Celtic FC, and again rejected [82] [83] [84]  A further proposal from the SFA also failed in 1913, after the Football Association objected [85] [86] [87]  The SFA advanced the same proposal in 1914, when it was again rejected after opposition from both the Football Association and the Football Association of Wales [88] [89] [90] [91] [92]\n\n\nAttacker level with second-last defender (1990)\nIn 1990, IFAB declared that an attacker level with the second-last defender is onside, whereas previously such a player had been considered offside  This change, proposed by the Scottish FA, was made in order to \"encourage the attacking team\" by \"giving the attacking player an advantage over the defender\" [101] [102]\n\n\nParts of body (2005)\nIn 2005, IFAB clarified that, when evaluating an attacking player's position for the purposes of the offside law, the part of the player's head, body or feet closest to the defending team's goal-line should be considered, with the hands and arms being excluded because \"there is no advantage to be gained if only the arms are in advance of the opponent\" [103]  In 2016, it was further clarified that this principle should apply to all players, both attackers and defenders, including the goalkeeper [104]\n\n\nDefender outside the field of play (2009)\nIn 2009, it was stated that a defender who leaves the field of play without the referee's permission must be considered to be on the nearest boundary line for the purposes of deciding whether an attacker is in an offside position [105]\n\n\nHalfway line (2016)\nIn 2016, it was clarified that a player on the halfway line itself cannot be in an offside position: part of the player's head, body or feet must be within the opponent's half of the field of play in order to be considered offside [104]\n\n\nUnadopted experiments\nDuring the 1973–74 and 1974–75 seasons, an experimental version of the offside rule was operated in the Scottish League Cup and Drybrough Cup competitions [106] The concept was that offside should only apply in the last 18 yards (16 m) of play (inside or beside the penalty area) [106] To signify this, the horizontal line of the penalty area was extended to the touchlines [106] FIFA President Sir Stanley Rous attended the 1973 Scottish League Cup Final, which was played using these rules [106] The manager of one of the teams involved, Celtic manager Jock Stein, complained that it was unfair to expect teams to play under one set of rules in one game and then a different set a few days before or later [106] The experiment was quietly dropped after the 1974–75 season, as no proposal for a\nfurther experiment or rule change was submitted for the Scottish Football Association board to consider [106] It was briefly experimented again in the 1991 FIFA U-17 World Championship, in Italy [107]\n\n\nSubsequent developments: exceptions at the restart of play\nSince the first FA laws of 1863, a player has not been penalised for being in an offside position at the moment a teammate takes a goal kick [109]  (According to the \"strict\" offside law used in 1863, every player on the attacking side would automatically have been in an offside position from such a goalkick, since it had to be taken from the goal line and a player could be in an offside position even when in their own half.) [110]\n\n\nGoal kick\nSince the first FA laws of 1863, a player has not been penalised for being in an offside position at the moment a teammate takes a goal kick [109]  (According to the \"strict\" offside law used in 1863, every player on the attacking side would automatically have been in an offside position from such a goalkick, since it had to be taken from the goal line and a player could be in an offside position even when in their own half.) [110]\n\n\nThrow-in\nUnder the original laws of 1863, it was not possible to be offside from a throw-in; [111] however, since the ball was required to be thrown in at right-angles to the touch-line, it would have been unusual for a player to gain significant advantage from being ahead of the ball [112]\n\n\nCorner kick\nWhen first introduced in 1872, the corner kick was required to be taken from the corner-flag itself, which made it impossible for an attacking player to be in an offside position relative to the ball [118] In 1874, the corner-kick was allowed to be taken up to one yard from the corner-flag, thus opening up the possibility of a player being in an offside position [119]  At the International Football Conference of December 1882, it was agreed that a player should not be offside from a corner-kick; this change was incorporated into the Laws of the Game in 1883 [120]\n\n\nFree kick\nThe laws of football have always permitted an offside offence to be committed from a free kick  The free kick contrasts, in this respect, with other restarts of play such as the goal kick, corner kick, and throw-in.\n\n\nOffside trap\nPioneered in the early 20th century by Notts County [128] and later adopted by influential Argentine coach Osvaldo Zubeldía, [129] the offside trap is a defensive tactic designed to force the attacking team into an offside position Just before an attacking player is played a through ball, the last defender or defenders move up field, isolating the attacker into an offside position The execution requires careful timing by the defence and is considered a risk, since running up field against the direction of attack may leave the goal exposed [130]  Now that changes to the interpretations of \"interfering with play, interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage\" mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play, players not involved in active play cannot be \"caught offside\", making the tactic riskier An attacker, upon realising they are in an offside position, may simply choose to avoid interfering with play until the ball is played by someone else.\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Lombardy", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Lombardy comes from Lombard, which is derived from Late Latin Longobardus, Langobardus (\"a Lombard\"), which derived from the Proto-Germanic elements *langaz + *bardaz; equivalent to long beard According to some scholars, the second element derives from Proto-Germanic *bardǭ, *barduz (\"axe\"), related to German Barte [19] [20] [21]\n\n\nGeography\nLombardy has a surface area of 23,861 km2 (9,213 sq mi), and is the fourth-largest region of Italy after Sicily, Piedmont and Sardinia [11] It is bordered by Canton Ticino and Canton Grisons of Switzerland to the north, and by the Italian regions of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Veneto to the east, Emilia-Romagna to the south and Piedmont to the west \n\n\nSoils\nThe surface area of Lombardy is divided almost equally between the plains (which represent approximately 47% of the territory) and the mountainous areas (which represent 41%) The remaining 12% of the region is hilly [23]\n\n\nHydrography\nThe Po marks the southern border of the region for about 210 km (130 mi); its major tributaries are the Ticino, which rises in the Val Bedretto in Switzerland and joins the Po near Pavia, [28] the Olona, the Lambro, the Adda, the Oglio and the Mincio.\n\n\nAlpine passes\nThe Lombard Alpine valleys are wider than those found, again in the Alps, in Piedmont and Aosta Valley Most of them are crossed by streams that descend towards the Po Valley, forming rivers which then flow into the Po on the hydrographic left Thanks to the width of their valleys, the Lombard Alpine passes, although they are at a high altitude, are easily accessible.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe plains have been intensively cultivated for centuries, and little of the original environment remains The most common trees are elm, alder, sycamore, poplar, willow and hornbeam In the area of the foothills lakes, however, olive, cypresses and larches grow, as do varieties of subtropical flora such as magnolia, azalea and acacias Numerous species of endemic flora in the Prealpine area include some species of saxifrage, Lombardy garlic, [32] groundsel and bellflowers.\n\n\nClimate\nLombardy has a wide array of climates due to variance in elevation, proximity to inland water basins, and large metropolitan areas The climate is mainly humid subtropical (Köppen Cfa), especially in the plains, though with significant variations to the Köppen model, especially in the normally long, damp, and cold winters There is high seasonal temperature variation; in Milan, the average temperature is 2.5 °C (36.5 °F) in January and 24 °C (75 °F) in July The plains are often subject to fog during the coldest months [40]\n\n\nGeology\nThe geological structure of Lombardy derives from the orogeny of the Alps due to the collision between the African and Eurasian plates which generated the Alpine chain from the Upper Cretaceous to the Miocene [44]\n\n\nPollution\nLombardy is one of the most-air-polluted areas of Europe [46] Because of high levels of industrialisation and the lack of wind due to the region being enclosed between mountain ranges, air pollution remains a severe problem in Lombardy and northern Italy.\n\n\nHistory\nFrom archaeological findings of ceramics, arrows, axes, and carved stones, the area of current-day Lombardy has been settled at least since the second millennium BC Well-preserved rock drawings left by ancient Camuni in the Valcamonica depicting animals, people, and symbols were made over 8,000 years before the Iron Age, [52] based on about 300,000 records [53]\n\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\nFrom archaeological findings of ceramics, arrows, axes, and carved stones, the area of current-day Lombardy has been settled at least since the second millennium BC Well-preserved rock drawings left by ancient Camuni in the Valcamonica depicting animals, people, and symbols were made over 8,000 years before the Iron Age, [52] based on about 300,000 records [53]\n\n\nKingdom of the Lombards\nDuring and after the fall of the Western Empire, Lombardy heavily suffered from destruction brought about by a series of invasions by tribal peoples After 540, Pavia became the permanent capital of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the fixed site of the court and the royal treasury [57] The last and most effective invasion was that of the Germanic Lombards or Longobards, whose nation migrated to the region from the Carpathian basin in fear of the conquering Pannonian Avars in 568 The Lombards' long-lasting reign, with its capital in Pavia, gave the current name to the region There was a close relationship between the Frankish, Bavarian and Lombard nobility for many centuries.\n\n\nCommunes and the Empire\nIn the 10th century, Lombardy, although formally under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire, was included in the kingdom of Italy, of which Pavia remained the capital until 1024 [60] Starting gradually in the late-11th century, Lombardy became divided into many small, autonomous city-states, the medieval communes Also in the 11th century, the region's economy underwent a significant boom due to improved trading, sartorial manufacturing of silk and wool, and agricultural conditions; arms manufacturing for the purpose of defensive army development, by the German imperial divisions of Guelphs (Welfen) defending the Pope and Ghibellins (Wibellingen) defending the Emperor, became a significant factor As in other areas of Italy, this led to a growing self-acknowledgement of the cities, whose increasing wealth made them able to defy the traditional feudal supreme power that was represented by the German emperors and their local legates \n\n\nRenaissance duchies of Milan and Mantua\nIn the 15th century, the Duchy of Milan was one of the wealthiest states during the Renaissance [62] Milan and Mantua became centres of the Renaissance, whose culture with people such as Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea Mantegna, and works of art such as da Vinci's The Last Supper were highly regarded The enterprising class of the communes extended its trade and banking activities well into northern Europe; the metonym \"Lombard\" designated a merchant or banker from northern Italy, for example Lombard Street, London \n\n\nLate-Middle Ages, Renaissance and Enlightenment\nAfter the Battle of Pavia, the Duchy of Milan became a possession of the Habsburgs of Spain; the new rulers did little to improve the economy of Lombardy, instead imposing a growing series of taxes to support their lengthy series of European wars The eastern part of modern-day Lombardy, including the cities Bergamo and Brescia, was controlled by the Republic of Venice, which had begun to extend its influence in the area from the 14th century onwards Between the mid-15th century and the battle of Marignano in 1515, the northern part of east Lombardy from Airolo to Chiasso (modern Ticino), and the Valtellina valley came under possession of the Old Swiss Confederacy.\n\n\nModern era\nThe restoration of Austrian rule in 1815 as the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was characterised by a struggle with the new ideals introduced by the Napoleonic era Lombardy was then an important centre of the Risorgimento, with the Five Days of Milan in March 1848, the Ten Days of Brescia in 1849, the Belfiore martyrs in Mantua in the years between 1851 and 1853 The annexation of Lombardy to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia occurred following the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, a war during which Lombardy was the main theatre of battle (battles of Montebello, Palestro, Magenta, Solferino and San Fermo) \n\n\nContemporary era\nThe Alpine front of World War I crossed the eastern Lombardy Alpine side, and in the post-war period Milan was the centre of the Italian Fasces of Combat Milan then became the Gold Medal of Military Valor for the Italian resistance movement [66] during the Italian Civil War after its liberation from fascism during the World War II, while the partisan resistance spread across the valleys and provinces.\n\n\nEconomy\nLombardy is the first [13] region of Italy in terms of economic importance [14] As of 2021 [update], the gross regional product (GRP) of Lombardy was equal to over €366 billion and accounted for about 22% of Italy's total GDP Lombardy's 2021 GRP was €36,500 per person, more than 25% higher than the national average of €25,729 [72] Lombardy is the second region of the European Union by nominal GDP [2]\n\n\nAgriculture\nThe productivity of agriculture is enhanced by the use of fertilisers and the traditional abundance of water, which has been boosted since the Middle Ages by the construction of irrigation systems that were partly designed by Leonardo da Vinci Lower plains are used for fodder crops, cereals (rice, wheat and maize) and sugar beet Lombardy is one of the main European regions for rice production and together with Piedmont, produces 93% of Italian rice Cultivation is concentrated in the provinces of Pavia (84,000 ha (210,000 acres), Milan (14,000 ha (35,000 acres)), Lodi 2,000 ha (4,900 acres) and Mantua (1,200 ha (3,000 acres)) [120] Produce of the higher plains includes cereals, vegetables, fruit trees and mulberries Fruits and wine are produced in upland areas such as the Prealps and Alps sectors in the north.\n\n\nAerospace and defence\nItaly is a major exporter of heavy helicopters (over 2,000 kg (4,400 lb)) with a market share of about 30% [127] The headquarters of Leonardo Helicopters Division (ex-AgustaWestland) is in Lombardy, and is responsible for about a third of the company's orders [128] The region also has a plant of Leonardo Aircraft Division (ex-Aermacchi) [129] The main helicopter design, production and training facilities are located in Cascina Costa di Samarate, Vergiate and Sesto Calende The company's aircraft division manufactures military training aircraft in Venegono Superiore [129]\n\n\nAutomotive\nThere is no longer any car production in Lombardy; the factories of mass-market manufacturers Alfa Romeo, [130] Autobianchi [131] and Innocenti [132] having been closed, abandoned or demolished Iveco continues to manufacture light trucks Daily in Suzzara [133] and makes EuroCargo lorries in Brescia [134] Same-Deutz Fahr manufactures tractors under the brands SAME and Lamborghini in Treviglio, and BCS Group makes tractors in Abbiategrasso.\n\n\nElectronics\nThe largest European semiconductor company STMicroelectronics employs 5,600 people at its plant in a suburb of Milan Manufacturers of general-purpose integrated circuits (ICs) Agrate Brianza, which employs 4,500, and Cornaredo, which employs 1,100, have R&D and production facilities [138]\n\n\nEnergy\nIn Lombardy, in 2015, electricity consumption per inhabitant amounted to 6,374 Wh In the same year, gross energy production reached 41 GWh per 10,000 inhabitants and 26% of electricity consumption was covered by energy from renewable sources [141] There are 488 hydroelectric plants, 1,056 thermoelectric plants, 7 wind plants and 94,202 photovoltaic plants [142] The length of power lines in the region in 2014 is 3,867.8 km (2,403.34 mi), of which 2,190.8 km (1,361.30 mi) are 220 kV and 1,677 km (1,042.04 mi) are 380 kV [142]\n\n\nFashion\nMilan is a fashion capital of the world Lombardy has always been an important centre for silk and textile production, notably the cities of Pavia, Vigevano and Cremona Milan is one of the fashion capitals of the world; the city has approximately 12,000 companies, 800 showrooms and 6,000 sales outlets; the city hosts the headquarters of global fashion houses The best-known high-class shopping district is Quadrilatero della moda.\n\n\nFurniture\nFurniture is manufactured in the industrial district around Brianza, which has an annual turnover of about €2 billion from 1,700 companies [145] The furniture factories, which have about 40,000 employees, are mainly concentrated in Lissone, Meda, Cantù and Mariano Comense This district has close relations with Milan's design industry A number of large furniture exhibitions take place in Milan, including \"Salone del Mobile Milano\" [146]\n\n\nTourism\nIn the most dynamic and busiest of Italian regions it is not possible, on the basis of the figures, to distinguish tourists in the strict sense from those who travel for business [147] In 2019, 40,482,939 arrivals were recorded [148] Non-residents contributed to 51.8% of arrivals and 57.4% of presences [149]\n\n\nUnemployment\nThe unemployment rate of Lombardy stood at 4.3% in 2023 [158] In that year, regional unemployment was one of the lowest in Italy [159]\n\n\nDemographics\nOne-sixth of the Italian population, about 10 million people, live in Lombardy (16.2% of the national population; 2% of the European Union population) Lombardy is the second most populous region in the European Union (EU) [12]\n\n\nPopulation\nOne-sixth of the Italian population, about 10 million people, live in Lombardy (16.2% of the national population; 2% of the European Union population) Lombardy is the second most populous region in the European Union (EU) [12]\n\n\nReligion\nThe primary religion is Roman Catholicism Over the centuries, the Catholic dioceses of Lombardy have given birth to ten popes: Pope John XIV, Pope Alexander II, Pope Urban III, Pope Celestine IV, Pope Pius IV, Pope Gregory XIV, Pope Innocent XI, Pope Pius XI, Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI \n\n\nGovernment and politics\nLombardy has a system of representative democracy in which the President of the Region (Presidente della Regione) is the head of government and of a pluriform multi-party system Executive power is vested in the regional government (Giunta Regionale) and legislative power is vested in the Regional Council (Consiglio Regionale).\n\n\nGovernment\nLombardy has a system of representative democracy in which the President of the Region (Presidente della Regione) is the head of government and of a pluriform multi-party system Executive power is vested in the regional government (Giunta Regionale) and legislative power is vested in the Regional Council (Consiglio Regionale).\n\n\nPolitics\nFrom 1945 to the early 1990s, the moderate Christian Democrats maintained a large majority of the popular support and control of the most important cities and provinces from the end of the Second World War The opposition Italian Communist Party was a considerable presence only in southern Lombardy and in the working-class districts of Milan; their base, however, was increasingly eroded by the rival centrist Italian Socialist Party until the Mani Pulite corruption scandal, which spread from Milan to the whole of Italy, almost completely erased the old political class [167]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nLombardy is divided into 1,502 comuni (the region with the largest number of comuni in the entire national territory [10]), distributed in twelve administrative subdivisions (eleven provinces plus the Metropolitan City of Milan) The largest province is that of Brescia, the smallest that of Monza and Brianza The exclave of Campione d'Italia also belongs to the region, a comune entirely surrounded by Swiss territory and part of the province of Como.\n\n\nSymbols\nThe symbols of Lombardy are, pursuant to the region's statute of autonomy, the flag, the coat of arms, the banner and the celebration of 29 May [170]\n\n\nSociety\nLombard cuisine is the style of cooking in the Northern Italian region of Lombardy The historical events of its provinces and the diversity of its territories resulted in a varied culinary tradition First courses in Lombard cuisine range from risottos to soups and stuffed pasta (in broth or not), and a large choice of second-course meat or fish dishes, due to the many lakes and rivers of Lombardy [180]\n\n\nCuisine\nLombard cuisine is the style of

belonging to the Gallo-Italic group within the Romance languages characterized by a Celtic linguistic substratum and a Lombardic linguistic superstratum [184] It is a cluster of homogeneous varieties used by at least 3,500,000 native speakers in Lombardy and some areas of neighbouring regions, such as the eastern part of Piedmont and the southern Switzerland cantons of Ticino and Grisons [184] The language is also spoken in Santa Catarina in Brazil by Lombard immigrants from the Province of Bergamo, in Italy [185] [186]\n\n\nCulture\nThe first artistic evidence in Lombardy dates back to the Mesolithic period when, at the end of the Würm glaciation, the historical cycle of the Rock Drawings in Valcamonica began, which continued and subsequently expanded in the Neolithic and the Copper Age to end only in Roman and medieval times [191] The Camunian cycle is considered one of the most important testimonies of prehistory worldwide [192] and is therefore included in the list of World Heritage Site.\n\n\nArt and architecture\nThe first artistic evidence in Lombardy dates back to the Mesolithic period when, at the end of the Würm glaciation, the historical cycle of the Rock Drawings

list of World Heritage Site.\n\n\nFrom late antiquity to the modern era\nIn the late ancient period, the Lombardy territory acquired importance, with Milan being the capital of the Western Roman Empire, and consequently, the artistic production also increased, of which evidence remains especially in sacred architecture with the construction of Early Christian churches, particularly in Milan.\n\n\nContemporary age\nIn February 1910 the painters Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Giacomo Balla, Gino Severini and Luigi Russolo signed the Manifesto dei pittori futuristi in Milan and in April of the same year the Manifesto tecnico della pittura futurista,, [197] which they contributed, together with others posters signed in other Italian cities, to found the artistic movement of Futurism Upon the death of Umberto Boccioni in 1916, Carrà and Severini found themselves in a phase of evolution towards cubist painting, consequently, the Milanese group disbanded, moving the headquarters of the movement from Milan to Rome, with the consequent birth of the \"second Futurism\".\n\n\nHistorical and artistic villages\nLombardy has many small and picturesque villages, 26 of them have been selected by I Borghi più belli d'Italia (English: The most beautiful villages of Italy), [200] a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, [201] that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities [202] The Lombard villages that are members of the association I Borghi più belli d'Italia (\"The most beautiful villages in Italy\") are: [200]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe first texts written in the vernacular Lombard language date back to the 13th century These are mainly works of a didactic-religious nature; an example is the Sermon Divin by Pietro da Barsegapè  [it], which narrates the Passion of Jesus Very important is the contribution to Lombard literature of Bonvesin de la Riva, who wrote, among other works, the Liber di Tre Scricciur, the De magnalibus urbis Mediolani (\"The Wonders of Milan\"), and an etiquette, the De quinquaginta curialitatibus ad mensam (\"Fifty table courtesies\") [203]\n\n\nMain sights\nLombardy has more than 300 museums in subjects such as ethnographic, historical, technical-scientific, artistic and naturalistic fields

Donizetti and home of the Teatro Donizetti; Brescia hosts the 1709 Teatro Grande; Cremona is regarded as the origin of the violin and is home to several of the most prestigious luthiers; [215] and Mantua was one of the founding and most important cities in 16th- and 17th-century opera and classical music.\n\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites\nThere are ten UNESCO World Heritage sites wholly or partially located in Lombardy [216] Some of these comprise several individual objects in different locations One of the entries has been listed as natural heritage and the others are cultural heritage

Swiss cantons of Ticino and Grisons to the north. It is the second most populous region in the European Union, with a population of over 10 million people, and is the first region of Italy in terms of economic importance. The region is known for its rich history, cultural heritage, and natural beauty, with a diverse landscape that includes mountains, lakes, and plains.\n\nGeography\n\nLombardy has a surface area of 23,861 km2 (9,213 sq mi), making it the fourth largest region in Italy. The region is bordered by the Swiss cantons of Ticino and Grisons to the north, the Italian regions of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Veneto to the east, Emilia-Romagna to the south, and Piedmont to the west. The region is divided almost equally between the plains (47%) and the mountainous areas (41%), with the remaining 12% being hilly.\n\nSoils\n\nThe surface area of Lombardy is divided almost equally between the plains (which represent approximately 47% of the territory) and the mountainous areas (which represent 41%). The remaining 12% of the region is hilly. The plains are used for agriculture, while the mountainous areas are used for forestry and tourism.\n\nHydrography\n\nThe Po marks the southern border of the region for about 210 km (130 mi). The major tributaries of the Po are the Ticino, which rises in the Val Bedretto in Switzerland and joins the Po near Pavia, the Olona, the Lambro, the Adda, the Oglio, and the Mincio.\n\nAlpine passes\n\nThe Lombard Alpine valleys are wider than those found in the Alps in Piedmont and Aosta Valley. Most of them are crossed by streams that descend towards the Po Valley, forming rivers which then flow into the Po on the hydrographic left. Thanks to the width of their valleys, the Lombard Alpine passes, although they are at a high altitude, are easily accessible.\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nThe plains have been intensively cultivated for centuries, and little of the original environment remains. The most common trees are elm, alder, sycamore, poplar, willow, and hornbeam. In the area of the foothills lakes, however, olive, cypresses, and larches grow, as do varieties of subtropical flora such as magnolia, azalea, and acacias. Numerous species of endemic flora in the Prealpine area include some species of saxifrage, Lombardy garlic, groundsel, and bellflowers.\n\nClimate\n\nLombardy has a wide array of climates due to variance in elevation, proximity to inland water basins, and large metropolitan areas. The climate is mainly humid subtropical (Köppen Cfa), especially in the plains, though with significant variations to the Köppen model, especially in the normally long, damp, and cold winters. There is high seasonal temperature variation; in Milan, the average temperature is 2.5°C (36.5°F) in January and 24°C (75°F) in July. The plains are often subject to fog during the coldest months.\n\nGeology\n\nThe geological structure of Lombardy derives from the orogeny of the Alps due to the collision between the African and Eurasian plates which generated the Alpine chain from the Upper Cretaceous to the Miocene.\n\nHistory\n\nFrom archaeological findings of ceramics, arrows, axes, and carved stones, the area of current-day Lombardy has been settled at least since the second millennium BC. Well-preserved rock drawings left by ancient Camuni in the Valcamonica depicting animals, people, and symbols were made over 8,000 years before the Iron Age.\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\n\nFrom archaeological findings of ceramics, arrows, axes, and carved stones, the area of current-day Lombardy has been settled at least since the second millennium BC. Well-preserved rock drawings left by ancient Camuni in the Valcamonica depicting animals, people, and symbols were made over 8,000 years before the Iron Age.\n\nKingdom of the Lombards\n\nDuring and after the fall of the Western Empire, Lombardy heavily suffered from destruction brought about by a series of invasions by tribal peoples. After 540, Pavia became the permanent capital of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the fixed site of the court and the royal treasury. The last and most effective invasion was that of the Germanic Lombards or Longobards, whose nation migrated to the region from the Carpathian basin in fear of the conquering Pannonian Avars in 568. The Lombards' long-lasting reign, with its capital in Pavia, gave the current name to the region.\n\nCommunes and the Empire\n\nIn the 10th century, Lombardy, although formally under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire, was included in the kingdom of Italy, of which Pavia remained the capital until 1024. Starting gradually in the late-11th century, Lombardy became divided into many small, autonomous city-states, the medieval communes. Also in the 11th century, the region's economy underwent a significant boom due to improved trading, sartorial manufacturing of silk and wool, and agricultural conditions; arms manufacturing for the purpose of defensive army development, by the German imperial divisions of Guelphs (Welfen) defending the Pope and Ghibellins (Wibellingen) defending the Emperor, became a significant factor.\n\nRenaissance duchies of Milan and Mantua\n\nIn the 15th century, the Duchy of Milan was one of the wealthiest states during the Renaissance. Milan and Mantua became centres of the Renaissance, whose culture with people such as Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea Mantegna, and works of art such as da Vinci's The Last Supper were highly regarded. The enterprising class of the communes extended its trade and banking activities well into northern Europe; the metonym \"Lombard\" designated a merchant or banker from northern Italy, for example Lombard Street, London.\n\nLate-Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Enlightenment\n\nAfter the Battle of Pavia, the Duchy of Milan became a possession of the Habsburgs of Spain; the new rulers did little to improve the economy of Lombardy, instead imposing a growing series of taxes to support their lengthy series of European wars. The eastern part of modern-day Lombardy, including the cities Bergamo and Brescia, was controlled by the Republic of Venice, which had begun to extend its influence in the area from the 14th century onwards. Between the mid-15th century and the battle of Marignano in 1515, the northern part of east Lombardy from Airolo to Chiasso (modern Ticino), and the Valtellina valley came under possession of the Old Swiss Confederacy.\n\nModern era\n\nThe restoration of Austrian rule in 1815 as the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia was characterized by a struggle with the new ideals introduced by the Napoleonic era. Lombardy was then an important centre of the Risorgimento, with the Five Days of Milan in March 1848, the Ten Days of Brescia in 1849, the Belfiore martyrs in Mantua in the years between 1851 and 1853. The annexation of Lombardy to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia occurred following the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, a war during which Lombardy was the main theatre of battle (battles of Montebello, Palestro, Magenta, Solferino, and San Fermo).\n\nContemporary era\n\nThe Alpine front of World War I crossed the eastern Lombardy Alpine side, and in the post-war period Milan was the centre of the Italian Fasces of Combat Milan then became the Gold Medal of Military Valor for the Italian resistance movement during the Italian Civil War after its liberation from fascism during the World War II, while the partisan resistance spread across the valleys and provinces.\n\nEconomy\n\nLombardy is the first region of Italy in terms of economic importance. As of 2021, the gross regional product (GRP) of Lombardy was equal to over €366 billion and accounted for about 22% of Italy's total GDP. Lombardy's 2021 GRP was €36,500 per person, more than 25% higher than the national average of €25,729. Lombardy is the second region of the European Union by nominal GDP.\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe productivity of agriculture is enhanced by the use of fertilizers and the traditional abundance of water, which has been boosted since the Middle Ages by the construction of irrigation systems that were partly designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Lower plains are used for fodder crops, cereals (rice, wheat, and maize), and sugar beet. Lombardy is one of the main European regions for rice production, and together with Piedmont, it produces 93% of Italian rice.\n\nAerospace and Defence\n\nItaly is a major exporter of heavy helicopters (over 2,000 kg/4,400 lb) with a market share of about 30%. The headquarters of Leonardo Helicopters Division (ex-AgustaWestland) is in Lombardy, and is responsible for about a third of the company's orders. The region also has a plant of Leonardo Aircraft Division (ex-Aermacchi). The main helicopter design, production, and training facilities are located in Cascina Costa di Samarate, Vergiate, and Sesto Calende.\n\nAutomotive\n\nThere is no longer any car production in Lombardy; the factories of mass-market manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Autobianchi, and Innocenti having been closed, abandoned, or demolished. Iveco continues to manufacture light trucks Daily in Suzzara and makes EuroCargo lorries in Brescia. Same-Deutz Fahr manufactures tractors under the brands SAME and Lamborghini in Treviglio, and BCS Group makes tractors in Abbiategrasso.\n\nElectronics\n\nThe largest European semiconductor company STMicroelectronics employs 5,600 people at its plant in a suburb of Milan. Manufacturers of general-purpose integrated circuits (ICs) Agrate Brianza, which employs 4,500, and Cornaredo, which employs 1,100, have R&D and production facilities.\n\nEnergy\n\nIn 2015, electricity consumption per inhabitant amounted to 6,374 Wh. In the same year, gross energy production reached 41 GWh per 10,000 inhabitants, and 26% of electricity consumption was covered by energy from renewable sources.\n\nFashion\n\nMilan is a fashion capital of the world. Lombardy has always been an important centre for silk and textile production, notably the cities of Pavia, Vigevano, and Cremona. Milan is one of the fashion capitals of the world; the city has approximately 12,000 companies, 800 showrooms, and 6,000 sales outlets; the city hosts the headquarters of global fashion houses. The best-known high-class shopping district is Quadrilatero della moda.\n\nFurniture\n\nFurniture is manufactured in the industrial district around Brianza, which has an annual turnover of about €2 billion from 1,700 companies. The furniture factories, which have about 40,000 employees, are mainly concentrated in Lissone, Meda, Cantù, and Mariano Comense. This district has close relations with Milan's design industry. A number of large furniture exhibitions take place in Milan, including \"Salone del Mobile Milano\".\n\nTourism\n\nIn the most dynamic and busiest of Italian regions, it is not possible, on the basis of the figures, to distinguish tourists in the strict sense from those who travel for business. In 2019, 40,482,939 arrivals were recorded. Non-residents contributed to 51.8% of arrivals and 57.4% of presences.\n\nUnemployment\n\nThe unemployment rate of Lombardy stood at 4.3% in 2023. In that year, regional unemployment was one of the lowest in Italy.\n\nLanguage\n\nLombard language is widely used in Lombardy, in diglossia with Italian. Lombard is a language belonging to the Gallo-Italic group within the Romance languages, characterized by a Celtic linguistic substratum and a Lombardic linguistic superstratum. It is a cluster of homogeneous varieties used by at least 3,500,000 native speakers in Lombardy and some areas of neighboring regions, such as the eastern part of Piedmont and the southern Switzerland cantons of Ticino and Grisons. The language is also spoken in Santa Catarina in Brazil by Lombard immigrants from the Province of Bergamo, in Italy.\n\nCulture\n\nThe first artistic evidence in Lombardy dates back to the Mesolithic period when, at the end of the Würm glaciation, the historical cycle of the Rock Drawings in Valcamonica began, which continued and subsequently expanded in the Neolithic and the Copper Age to end only in Roman and medieval times. The Camunian cycle is considered one of the most important testimonies of prehistory worldwide and is therefore included in the list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nArt and architecture\n\nThe first artistic evidence in Lombardy dates back to the Mesolithic period when, at the end of the Würm glaciation, the historical cycle of the Rock Drawings in Valcamonica began, which continued and subsequently expanded in the Neolithic and the Copper Age to end only in Roman and medieval times. The Camunian cycle is considered one of the most important testimonies of prehistory worldwide and is therefore included in the list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nFrom prehistory to the classical era\n\nFrom prehistory to the classical era, the Lombardy territory acquired importance, with Milan being the capital of the Western Roman Empire, and consequently, the artistic production also increased, of which evidence remains especially in sacred architecture with the construction of Early Christian churches, particularly in Milan.\n\nFrom late antiquity to the modern era\n\nIn the late ancient period, the Lombardy territory acquired importance, with Milan being the capital of the Western Roman Empire, and consequently, the artistic production also increased, of which evidence remains especially in sacred architecture with the construction of Early Christian churches, particularly in Milan.\n\nContemporary age\n\nIn February 1910, the painters Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Giacomo Balla, Gino Severini, and Luigi Russolo signed the Manifesto dei pittori futuristi in Milan, and in April of the same year, the Manifesto tecnico della pittura futurista, which they contributed, together with others, posters signed in other Italian cities, to found the artistic movement of Futurism. Upon the death of Umberto Boccioni in 1916, Carrà and Severini found themselves in a phase of evolution towards cubist painting, consequently, the Milanese group disbanded, moving the headquarters of the movement from Milan to Rome, with the consequent birth of the \"second Futurism\".\n\nHistorical and artistic villages\n\nLombardy has many small and picturesque villages, 26 of them have been selected by I Borghi più belli d'Italia (English: The most beautiful villages of Italy), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, which was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities. The Lombard villages that are members of the association I Borghi più belli d'Italia (\"The most beautiful villages in Italy\") are:\n\nLiterature\n\nThe first texts written in the vernacular Lombard language date back to the 13th century. These are mainly works of a didactic-religious nature; an example is the Sermon Divin by Pietro da Barsegapè. Very important is the contribution to Lombard literature of Bonvesin de la Riva, who wrote, among other works, the Liber di Tre Scricciur, the De magnalibus urbis Mediolani (\"The Wonders of Milan\"), and an etiquette, the De quinquaginta curialitatibus ad mensam (\"Fifty table courtesies\").\n\nMain sights\n\nLombardy has more than 300 museums in subjects such as ethnographic, historical, technical-scientific, artistic, and naturalistic fields. Among the region's most famous museums are:\n\nMusic\n\nEach of Lombardy's 12 provinces has its own musical traditions. Bergamo is famous for being the birthplace of Gaetano Donizetti and home of the Teatro Donizetti; Brescia hosts the 1709 Teatro Grande; Cremona is regarded as the origin of the violin and is home to several of the most prestigious luthiers.\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\nThere are ten UNESCO World Heritage sites wholly or partially located in Lombardy. Some of these comprise several individual objects in different locations. One of the entries has been listed as natural heritage and the others are cultural heritage sites.\n\nSport\n\nThe most popular sport in Lombardy is football. Lombardy has some of the most-successful men's football teams in the country. In the 2023-2024 Serie A season, Lombardy hosts 4 out of 20 teams: A.C Milan and Inter Milan (both based in Milan) and Atalanta (based in Bergamo); Monza. Other big teams of the region are Brescia, Como, Lecco, Feralpisalò, and Cremonese playing in the 2023-2024 Serie B; AlbinoLeffe, Pro Patria, A.C Renate, Lumezzane, Giana Erminio, Pro Sesto, and Pergolettese playing in the 2023-2024 Serie C.\n\nTransport\n\nThe airport service in Lombardy is made up of 4 main airports and represents the most important airport system in Italy. In the surroundings of Milan, there are three airports dedicated to normal civilian traffic (Milan Malpensa Airport and Milan Linate Airport, managed by SEA, and Milan Bergamo Airport by SACBO).",

Hae Min Lee was a 17-year-old high school student who was murdered on January 13, 1999, and her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed was subsequently arrested, tried, and convicted of her murder.\n\n**Background**\n\nHae Min Lee was born in South Korea in 1980 and emigrated with her mother Youn Kim and her brother Young Lee to the United States in 1992 to live with her grandparents. Lee attended the magnet program at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County, Maryland. She was an athlete who played lacrosse and field hockey and was known to be a popular and well-liked student.\n\n**Trials and Conviction**\n\nSyed's family hired defense attorney Cristina Gutierrez to represent him. Syed's first trial began in December 1999, but ended in a mistrial after jurors overheard a sidebar dispute between Gutierrez and the presiding judge. Gutierrez interpreted a statement by the judge as tantamount to accusing her of lying and said as much – unaware that members of the jury were within earshot. The case was retried, and Syed was convicted of first-degree murder on February 25, 2000. He was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after serving 30 years.\n\n**Post-Conviction Relief Petition**\n\nSyed sought post-conviction relief in May 2010, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. Syed argued that Gutierrez had failed to investigate an alibi witness, Asia McClain, who maintained she was talking with Syed in the library at the exact time that prosecutors said Syed attacked Lee in a Best Buy parking lot several miles away. In January 2014, the petition was denied by Justice Martin Welch, who found that Gutierrez's failure to call McClain as a witness was strategic rather than an act of incompetence because McClain's timeline was not consistent with Syed's stated timeline.\n\n**Serial Podcast**\n\nFrom October 3 to December 18, 2014, the murder of Hae Min Lee and the subsequent arrest and trial of Adnan Syed was the subject of the first season of the podcast Serial. It was developed by the creators of This American Life and hosted by Sarah Koenig. The podcast episodes generated international interest in the trial and were downloaded more than 100 million times by June 2016.\n\n**Follow-up Media**\n\nIn 2015, attorneys Rabia Chaudry, Susan Simpson, and Collin Miller began producing a podcast, Undisclosed: The State vs Adnan Syed. Chaudry said she is Syed's friend from childhood and strongly believes in his innocence, while Simpson and Miller became interested in the case from listening to Serial. This podcast involved a detailed examination of the State of Maryland's case against Adnan Syed. Simpson also persuaded Abraham Waranowitz to sign an affidavit stating his original testimony was incorrect; he had been an expert witness in relation to cellphone locations.\n\n**Post-Conviction DNA Testing**\n\nAfter Serial ended in 2014, there were discussions by the Innocence Project about conducting DNA testing of the physical evidence collected in 1999. Documents obtained by The Baltimore Sun in early 2019 show that Maryland prosecutors tested multiple items tied to the murder in mid-2018 and Syed's DNA did not match any of the DNA present.\n\n**Vacatur and Reinstatement of Conviction**\n\nIn September 2022, prosecutors filed a motion to vacate Syed's conviction. According to the motion, the State had committed Brady violations by failing to turn exculpatory evidence over to Syed during the course of his trial, and prosecutors had since uncovered new evidence that cast doubt on Syed's conviction. The motion cited two Brady violations: First, it said that the prosecution had suppressed evidence related to other potential suspects. Second, it said that the prosecution had failed to disclose the identity of a suspect who had previously threatened Lee's life and had the means, motive, and opportunity to kill Lee. The motion detailed that there were two chief alternate suspects: one of the suspects had threatened to kill Lee; Lee's car was found parked behind a house in Baltimore that belonged to one of the suspects; and one of the two was convicted of serial rape after Syed's trial.

of World War II His mother was from Searcy, Arkansas The name \"Rush\" was originally chosen for his grandfather to honor the maiden name of a family member, Edna Rush [5]\n\n\nCareer\nIn February 1971, after dropping out of college, the 20-year-old Limbaugh accepted an offer to DJ at WIXZ, a Top 40 station in McKeesport, Pennsylvania He adopted the airname \"Bachelor Jeff\" Christie and worked

from the station due to \"personality conflict\" with the program director He then started a nighttime position at KQV in Pittsburgh, succeeding Jim Quinn [18] In late 1974, Limbaugh was dismissed

syndication, and tie brand\nIn 1988, former ABC Radio Network executive Ed McLaughlin offered Limbaugh the nationally syndicated 12pm–2pm slot at ABC Radio Network to replace Owen Spann Since many local radio stations of the time were hesitant to carry nationally syndicated programming during the daytime, he also secured Limbaugh a separate 10am–12pm show at WABC-AM in New York City to satisfy the provision of his contract requiring employment in a Top 5 market to leave KMBZ [33]\n\n\n2000s\nLimbaugh had publicized personal difficulties in the 2000s In late 2001, he acknowledged that he had become almost completely deaf, although he continued his show He was able to regain much of his hearing with the help of a cochlear implant in 2001 [49] [50]\n\n\n2010s\nIn 2013, news reports indicated that Cumulus Media, some of whose stations carried Limbaugh's program in certain major markets, including New York, Chicago, Dallas, Washington D.C., and Detroit, was considering dropping his show when its contract with Limbaugh expired at the end of that year, reportedly because the company believed that its advertising revenues had been hurt by listener reaction to controversial Limbaugh comments [57] Limbaugh himself said that the reports were overblown and that it was a matter of routine dollars-and-cents negotiations between Cumulus and his network syndication partner, Premiere Networks, a unit of Clear Channel Communications Ultimately, the parties reached agreement on a new contract, with Limbaugh's show moving from its long-time flagship outlet in New York, the Cumulus-owned WABC, to the latter's cross-town rival, the Clear Channel-owned WOR, starting January 1, 2014, but remaining on the Cumulus-owned stations it was being carried on in other markets [57]\n\n\n2020s\nIn January 2021, Limbaugh called the GameStop short squeeze \"the most fascinating thing\" to happen in a long time and said that \"the elites are bent out of shape that a bunch of average, ordinary users have figured out how to make themselves billionaires\" [58]\n\n\nThe Rush Limbaugh Show\nLimbaugh's radio show aired for three hours each weekday beginning at noon Eastern Time on both AM and FM radio The program was also broadcast worldwide on the Armed Forces Radio Network.\n\n\nTelevision show\nLimbaugh had a syndicated half-hour television show from 1992 through 1996, produced by Roger Ailes The show discussed many of the topics on his radio show, and was taped in front of an audience In the months after its debut on September 12, 1992, it was the third highest rated late-night television show after Nightline and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno [36] Limbaugh said he loved doing his radio show, [67] but not a TV show [68]\n\n\nOther media appearances\nLimbaugh's first television hosting experience came March 30, 1990, as a guest host on Pat Sajak's CBS late-night talk show, The Pat Sajak Show [69] ACT UP activists in the audience [70] heckled Limbaugh repeatedly; ultimately the entire studio audience was cleared In 2001, Sajak said the incident was \"legendary around CBS\" [71]\n\n\nViews\nIn his first New York Times best seller, Limbaugh described himself as conservative, and was critical of broadcasters in many media outlets for claiming to be objective [74] He called for the adoption of core conservative philosophies in order to ensure the survival of the Republican Party [75] [76] [77] Limbaugh criticized the media and political activist movements such as feminism, environmentalism, and animal rights for allegedly serving as outlets for \"anticapitalism, secular humanism, and socialism.\" [78] Limbaugh, a proponent of American exceptionalism, often criticized politicians he believed reject this notion seeing them as unpatriotic or anti-American [28]\n\n\nRace\nLimbaugh was known for making controversial race-related statements regarding African Americans [79] He once opined that all newspaper composite pictures of wanted criminals resembled Jesse Jackson, and another time that \"the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons.\" [80] [70] While employed as what he describes as an \"insult-radio\" DJ, he used a derogatory racial stereotype to characterize a black caller he could not understand, telling the caller to \"take that bone out of your nose and call me back\", although he expressed guilt over this when recounting it [70] Limbaugh asserted in 2008 that African Americans, in contrast with other minority groups, are \"left behind\" socially because they have been systematically trained from a young age to hate the United States because of the welfare state [81]\n\n\nTaxes\nJames Fallows described Limbaugh's economic ideology as \"a doctrinaire version of supply-side economics\" and noted that he frequently cited The Wall Street Journal in his radio shows and books [37] Limbaugh has called for fewer taxes, including progressive taxes targeted towards the wealthy, and argued the wealthy were being taxed excessively because they continued to pay the majority of taxes in the United States [84] Limbaugh further claimed that reductions in marginal tax rates would reduce poverty and inequality by removing obstacles towards economic growth, and that reducing marginal tax rates on the wealthy would increase tax revenue by increasing production Limbaugh credited Reagan's tax cuts for ending the early 1980s recession, and blamed the early 1990s recession and rising rates of inequality on the American middle-class being \"taxed at a confiscatory rate.\" [85] [86]\n\n\nLGBT and AIDS\nLimbaugh expressed anti-LGBT views and viewed homosexual sexual practices as unhygienic He made serophobic statements about HIV/AIDS victims in the 1980s [87] and 1990s, and called the virus \"Rock Hudson's disease\" [88] and \"the only federally-protected virus\" [89] For a time, Dionne Warwick's song \"I'll Never Love This Way Again\" preceded reports about people with HIV/AIDS on his radio show [90] These later became \"condom updates,\" preceded by The 5th Dimension's song \"Up, Up and Away\" [13] Limbaugh defended President Reagan's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and falsely claimed that AIDS did not \"spread to the heterosexual community\" in the United States [91] When Freddie Mercury died of complications from AIDS in 1991, Limbaugh played a snippet of \"Another One Bites the Dust\" [92] In the early 1990s, Limbaugh ran a recurring segment, \"AIDS Update,\" which mocked the deaths of gay individuals from HIV/AIDS, and read aloud the names of the dead [93] [94] During the segment, he would play songs like \"I'll Never Love This Way Again\" and Johnny Lee's \"Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places\"; the Los Angeles Times reported that Limbaugh said, \"Gays deserved their fate\" [95] Limbaugh later called the segment \"the single most regretful thing I have ever done.\" [96] [97]\n\n\nSexual consent\nLimbaugh dismissed the concept of consent in sexual relations [101] [102] He viewed consent as \"the magic key to the left\" [103] In 2014, Limbaugh criticized a policy at Ohio State University encouraging students to obtain verbal consent, saying \"How many of you guys .. have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it?\" [104] The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used these statements to advocate a boycott of Limbaugh's show and advertisers, asserting that the statements were tantamount to an endorsement of sexual assault [105] Limbaugh denied this, and his spokesman Brian Glicklick and lawyer Patricia Glaser threatened a defamation lawsuit against the DCCC [106] According to spokesperson Emily Bittner, the DCCC did not receive any correspondence from Limbaugh or his attorney [107]\n\n\nDrug policy\nLimbaugh had been an outspoken critic of what he saw as leniency towards criminal drug use in the United States [108] On his television show on October 5, 1995, Limbaugh stated, \"too many whites are getting away with drug use\" and illegal drug trafficking [109] Limbaugh proposed that the racial disparity in drug enforcement could be fixed if authorities increased detection efforts, conviction rates and jail time for whites involved in illegal drugs [110] He defended mandatory-minimum sentencing as an effective tool against the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s [111] Limbaugh accused advocates of legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States of hypocrisy due to their advocacy of tobacco control and backlash against electronic cigarettes, and compared the advocates for its legalization in Colorado to Big Tobacco [112] Limbaugh's past comments on drug users were highlighted by numerous media outlets after his own stint in a drug rehabilitation facility in 2003 [109]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues\nLimbaugh was opposed to environmentalism and climate science [113] He rejected the relationship between CFCs and depletion of the ozone layer, claiming the scientific evidence did not support them [114] Limbaugh argued against the scientific consensus on climate change claiming it was \"just a bunch of scientists organized around a political proposition\" [115] and argued that projections of climate change were the product of ideologically motivated computer simulations without the proper support of empirical data, a claim which has been widely debunked [116] [117] Limbaugh used the term \"environmentalist wacko\" both when referring to left-leaning environmental advocates, [118] and when referring to more mainstream climate scientists and other environmental scientists and advocates with whom he disagreed [119] Limbaugh opposed pollution credits, including a carbon cap-and-trade system, as a way to disproportionately benefit major American investment banks, particularly Goldman Sachs, and claimed that it would destroy the American national economy [120]\n\n\nFeminism\nLimbaugh was critical of feminism, which he viewed as advancing only liberals and not women in general [96] In a newspaper column he stated that it \"was established so that unattractive ugly broads could have easy access to the mainstream of society.\" [83] [122] He has criticized Democratic congressmen calling for more women in Congress as hypocritical due to their opposition to female Republican candidates [96] He has also regularly used the term \"feminazi\", described by The New York Times in 1994 as one of his \"favorite epithets for supporters of women's rights\" [40] According to Limbaugh in 1992, for certain feminists, the \"most important thing in life is ensuring that as many abortions as possible occur.\" [123] He also used the term referring to the half-million-large 2017 Women's March as the \"Deranged Feminazi March\" [124] He credited his friend Tom Hazlett, a professor of law and economics at George Mason University, with coining the term [125]\n\n\nAbortion\nFor two weeks in 1989, on his Sacramento radio show, Limbaugh performed \"caller abortions\" where he would end a call suddenly to the sounds of a vacuum cleaner and a scream He would then deny that he had \"hung up\" on the caller, which he had promised not to do Limbaugh claims that he used this gag to illustrate \"the tragedy of abortion\" as well as to highlight the question of whether abortion constitutes murder [126]\n\n\nMiddle East\nLimbaugh was supportive of the Iraq War, and first suggested bombing Ba'athist Iraq in 2002 in revenge for the September 11 attacks [127] Even after no Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were found, he supported theories that they had existed [127] On the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal, Limbaugh said, \"This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation .. And we're going to ruin people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time.\" [128] [129] Speaking at the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference, Limbaugh accused Democratic congressional leaders such as Harry Reid of deliberately undermining the war effort [130]\n\n\nTrade\nIn 1993, Limbaugh supported the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), joking in response to claims that it would lead to a transfer of unskilled labor to Mexico that this would leave the United States with only better jobs [133] During a 1993 televised debate against H Ross Perot over NAFTA, Vice President Al Gore complimented Limbaugh as one of the \"distinguished Americans\" who pushed NAFTA forward in spite of the intense animosity between Limbaugh and the administration of President Bill Clinton [134] He later became more critical of NAFTA and trade agreements in general, claiming that they had reduced national sovereignty by \"subordinating\" America to \"world tribunals, like the World Trade Organization and the International Criminal Court and this kind of thing.\" [135] He also claimed that promises to stem mass migration by invigorating the Latin American economy had failed [136] [135] He supported a renegotiation of NAFTA and the eventual United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement [135]\n\n\nBarack Obama conspiracy theories\nRush Limbaugh strongly opposed Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential election, and spread false claims that Obama was a non-citizen not born in the United States [139] Limbaugh predicted that Obama would be unable to win the election [140] On January 16, 2009, Limbaugh commented on the then-upcoming Obama presidency, \"I hope he fails.\" [141] Limbaugh later said that he wanted to see Obama's policies fail, not the man himself [142] Limbaugh frequently referred to the Obama administration or presidency as regime [143] or as the Obama regime, or even junta Speaking of Obama, Limbaugh said, \"He's my president, he's a human being, and his ideas and policies are what count for me.\" [141] Limbaugh later discouraged efforts to impeach Barack Obama as politically unrealistic [144]\n\n\nRelationship with Donald Trump\nLimbaugh was consistently supportive of the candidacy and presidency of Donald Trump, although he endorsed Ted Cruz during the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries and took issue with Trump's treatment of Cruz [158] Limbaugh later criticized Cruz's hesitance to endorse Trump after his nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention, comparing it to Ted Kennedy's lukewarm support of Jimmy Carter at the 1980 Democratic National Convention [159] After the election he became supportive of deep-state conspiracy theories, claiming that the United States had entered a \"Cold Civil War\" in which the Democratic Party was attempting to illegitimately overturn the election results and that it was part of a trend of Democrats contesting elections beginning with the 2000 Florida election recount intended to eventually eliminate free elections in the United States [160] [161] [162]\n\n\nAlleging false flag attacks\nLimbaugh claimed that the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts were perpetuated as a false flag operation to draw public attention away from Central American migrant caravans [175] [176] He reiterated these claims two weeks after the arrest of the primary suspect Cesar Sayoc, a registered Republican [177] [178]\n\n\nControversies and inaccuracies\nComedian Al Franken, who later became a Senator, wrote a satirical 1996 book, Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations, in which he accused Limbaugh of distorting facts to serve his own political biases [43]\n\n\nHu Jintao\nLimbaugh was heavily criticized for mocking Hu Jintao, then the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and paramount leader of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese language during an episode After proceeding to label Hu as a \"Chicom dictator\", Limbaugh mocked the Chinese language, primarily using words like ching chong [186]\n\n\nJoseph Kony\nOn October 14, 2011, Limbaugh questioned the U.S Armed Forces initiative against Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), based on the assumption that they were Christians [187] \"They are fighting the Muslims in Sudan And Obama has sent troops, United States troops to remove them from the battlefield, which means kill them.\" [188] Upon learning about the accusations leveled against Kony, which included kidnapping whole schools of young children for use as child soldiers, Limbaugh stated that he would research the group [189] [190] [191]\n\n\nDeepwater Horizon\nIn 2010, after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Limbaugh speculated on his show that eco-terrorists deliberately destroyed the oil well to justify President Obama's deepwater drilling moratorium [192]\n\n\nUnite the Right\nAfter the white supremacist Unite the Right rally, in which a counter-protester was murdered in the Charlottesville car attack, Limbaugh claimed that the violence had been provoked by Black Lives Matter activists, Antifa, and Robert Creamer He also claimed without evidence that the police response had been deliberately restrained by Terry McAuliffe as a botched attempt to start a presidential bid in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, and that it was part of a campaign by \"international financiers\" such as George Soros to start a Second American Civil War to remove its status as a global superpower [193]\n\n\nChelsea Clinton\nDuring the Clinton administration, while taping his television program, Limbaugh referred to media coverage of Socks, the Clintons' cat He then stated, \"But did you know there is also a White House dog?\" and presented a picture of Chelsea Clinton who was 13 years old at the time [194] [195]\n\n\nMichael J. Fox\nIn October 2006, Limbaugh said Michael J Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, had exaggerated the effects of his disability in a political TV advertisement advocating for funding of stem cell research [196] Limbaugh said that Fox in the ad had been \"shameless\" in \"moving all around and shaking\", and that Fox had not taken \"his medication or he's acting, one of the two\" [197] Fox said \"the irony of it is I was too medicated\", [198] adding that there was no way to predict how his symptoms would manifest Limbaugh said he would apologize to Fox \"bigly, hugely .. if I am wrong in characterizing his behavior on this commercial as an act.\" [199] In 2012, Fox said Limbaugh in 2006 had acted on \"bullying instincts\" when \"he said I faked it I didn't fake it.\", and said Limbaugh's goal was to have him marginalized and shut down for his stem cell stance [200]\n\n\nPhony soldiers\nIn 2007, Media Matters reported that Limbaugh had categorized Iraq War veterans opposed to the war as \"the phony soldiers\" Limbaugh later said that he was speaking of Jesse MacBeth, a soldier who falsely claimed to have been decorated for valor but, in fact, had never seen combat Limbaugh said Media Matters was trying to smear him with out-of-context and selectively edited comments [201] After Limbaugh published what he claimed was the entire transcript of phony soldiers discussion, Media Matters said that over a minute and 30 seconds of the transcript was omitted without \"notation or ellipsis to indicate that there is, in fact, a break in the transcript.\" [202] [203] Limbaugh said during the minute and a half gap Media Matters had pointed out, he was waiting for relevant ABC News copy on the topic, and the transcript and audio edits were \"for space and relevance reasons, not to hide anything.\" [204] Senator Harry Reid and 41 Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, signed a letter asking the CEO of Clear Channel to denounce Limbaugh Instead, the executive gave the letter to Limbaugh to auction It raised $2.1 million, at the time an eBay record for an auction item for charity Limbaugh said he would match the donation and give it to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation [205]\n\n\nBid for ownership of the Rams\nThe NFL team moved to St Louis, Missouri, and Limbaugh wanted to be a partial owner, but in October 2009, the group that

former ABC Radio Network executive Ed McLaughlin offered Limbaugh the nationally syndicated 12pm–2pm slot at ABC Radio Network to replace Owen Spann Since many local radio stations of the time were hesitant to carry nationally syndicated programming during the daytime, he also secured Limbaugh a separate 10am–12pm show at WABC-AM in New York City to satisfy the provision of his contract

some of whose stations carried Limbaugh's program in certain major markets, including New York, Chicago, Dallas, Washington D.C., and Detroit, was considering dropping his show when its contract with Limbaugh expired at the end of that year, reportedly because the company believed that its advertising revenues had been hurt by listener reaction to controversial Limbaugh comments [57] Limbaugh himself said that the reports were overblown and that it was a matter of routine dollars-and-cents negotiations between Cumulus and his network syndication partner, Premiere Networks, a unit of Clear Channel Communications Ultimately, the parties reached agreement on a new contract, with Limbaugh's show moving from its long-time flagship outlet in New York, the Cumulus-owned WABC, to the latter's

broadcasters in many media outlets for claiming to be objective [74] He called for the adoption of core conservative philosophies in order to ensure the survival of the Republican Party [75] [76] [77] Limbaugh criticized the media and political activist movements such as feminism, environmentalism, and animal rights for allegedly serving as outlets for \"anticapitalism, secular humanism, and socialism.\" [78] Limbaugh, a proponent of American exceptionalism, often criticized politicians he believed reject this notion seeing them as unpatriotic or anti-American [28]\n\n\nRace\nLimbaugh was known for making controversial race-related statements regarding African Americans [79] He once opined that all newspaper composite pictures of wanted criminals resembled Jesse Jackson, and another time that \"the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons.\" [80] [70] While employed as what he describes as an \"insult-radio\" DJ, he used a derogatory racial stereotype to characterize a black caller he could not understand, telling the caller to \"take that bone out of your nose and call me back\", although he expressed guilt over this when recounting it [70] Limbaugh asserted in 2008 that African Americans, in contrast with other minority groups, are \"left behind\" socially because they have been systematically trained from a young age to hate the United States because of the welfare state [81]\n\n\nTaxes\nJames Fallows described Limbaugh's economic ideology as \"a doctrinaire version of supply-side economics\" and noted that he frequently cited The Wall Street Journal in his radio shows and books [37] Limbaugh has called for fewer taxes, including progressive taxes targeted towards the wealthy, and argued the wealthy were being taxed excessively because they continued to pay the majority of taxes in the United States [84] Limbaugh further claimed that reductions in marginal tax rates would reduce poverty and inequality by removing obstacles towards economic growth, and that reducing marginal tax rates on the wealthy would increase tax revenue by increasing production Limbaugh credited Reagan's tax cuts for ending the early 1980s recession, and blamed the early 1990s recession and rising rates of inequality on the American middle-class being \"taxed at a confiscatory rate.\" [85] [86]\n\n\nLGBT and

radio show [90] These later became \"condom updates,\" preceded by The 5th Dimension's song \"Up, Up and Away\" [13] Limbaugh defended President Reagan's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and falsely claimed that AIDS did not \"spread to the heterosexual community\" in the United States [91] When Freddie Mercury died of complications from AIDS in 1991, Limbaugh played a snippet of \"Another One Bites the Dust\" [92] In the early 1990s, Limbaugh ran a recurring segment, \"AIDS Update,\" which mocked the deaths of gay individuals from HIV/AIDS, and read aloud the names of the dead [93] [94] During the segment, he would play songs like \"I'll Never Love This Way Again\" and Johnny Lee's \"Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places\"; the Los Angeles Times reported that Limbaugh said, \"Gays

relations [101] [102] He viewed consent as \"the magic key to the left\" [103] In 2014, Limbaugh criticized a policy at Ohio State University encouraging students to obtain verbal consent, saying \"How many of you guys .. have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it?\" [104] The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used these statements to advocate a boycott of Limbaugh's show and advertisers, asserting that the statements were tantamount to an endorsement of sexual assault [105] Limbaugh denied this, and his spokesman Brian Glicklick and lawyer Patricia Glaser threatened a defamation lawsuit against the DCCC [106] According to spokesperson Emily Bittner, the DCCC did not receive any correspondence from Limbaugh or his attorney [107]\n\n\nDrug

scientific evidence did not support them [114] Limbaugh argued against the scientific consensus on climate change claiming it was \"just a bunch of scientists organized around a political proposition\" [115] and argued that projections of climate change were the product of ideologically motivated computer simulations without the proper support of empirical data, a claim which has been widely debunked [116] [117] Limbaugh used the term \"environmentalist wacko\" both when referring to left-leaning environmental advocates, [118] and when referring to more mainstream climate scientists and other environmental scientists and advocates with whom he disagreed [119] Limbaugh opposed pollution credits, including a carbon cap-and-trade system, as a way to disproportionately benefit major American investment banks, particularly Goldman Sachs, and claimed that it would destroy the American national economy [120]\n\n\nFeminism\nLimbaugh was critical of feminism, which he

\"most important thing in life is ensuring that as many abortions as possible occur.\" [123] He also used the term referring to the half-million-large 2017 Women's March as the \"Deranged Feminazi

East\nLimbaugh was supportive of the Iraq War, and first suggested bombing Ba'athist Iraq in 2002 in revenge for the September 11 attacks [127] Even after no Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were

spite of the intense animosity between Limbaugh and the administration of President Bill Clinton [134] He later became more critical of NAFTA and trade agreements in general, claiming that they had reduced national sovereignty by \"subordinating\" America to \"world tribunals, like the World Trade Organization and the International Criminal Court and this kind of thing.\" [135] He also claimed that promises to stem mass migration by invigorating the Latin American economy had failed [136] [135] He supported a renegotiation of NAFTA and the eventual United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement

during the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries and took issue with Trump's treatment of Cruz [158] Limbaugh later criticized Cruz's hesitance to endorse Trump after his nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention, comparing it to Ted Kennedy's lukewarm support of Jimmy Carter at the 1980 Democratic National Convention [159] After the election he became supportive of deep-state conspiracy theories, claiming that the United States had entered a \"Cold Civil War\" in which the Democratic Party was attempting to illegitimately overturn the election results and that it was part

\"the irony of it is I was too medicated\", [198] adding that there was no way to predict how his symptoms would manifest Limbaugh said he would apologize to Fox \"bigly, hugely .. if I am wrong in characterizing his behavior on this commercial as an act.\" [199] In 2012, Fox said Limbaugh in 2006 had acted on \"bullying instincts\" when \"he said I faked it I didn't fake it.\", and said

He is the youngest child of Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York, and Matilda Cuomo (née Raffa), and the brother of Andrew Cuomo, a former governor of New York. He has worked as a correspondent and political policy analyst for various news organizations, including Fox News and CNN.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nChris Cuomo was born in the New York City borough of Queens. His parents were both of Italian descent, with his paternal grandparents from Nocera Inferiore and Tramonti in the Campania region of southern Italy, and his maternal grandparents from Sicily. His brother, Andrew Cuomo, went on to become the governor of New York, while Chris Cuomo pursued a career in journalism.\n\n**Career**\n\nCuomo's early career in journalism included appearances on various news networks, including CNBC, MSNBC, and CNN. He worked as a correspondent and political policy analyst for Fox News and Fox Broadcast Network's Fox Files, where he covered a wide range of stories focusing on controversial social issues.

Cuomo later said that the use of the name \"Fredo\" was equivalent to \"the n-word\" for Italian-Americans, sparking debate on Twitter about the assertion.\n\n**Andrew Cuomo Coverage and Suspension from CNN**\n\nIn early 2020, Chris Cuomo interviewed his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, on his CNN program while he was recovering from COVID-19. However, in March 2021, reports surfaced about sexual harassment allegations against Andrew Cuomo. Chris Cuomo acknowledged that he had a conflict of interest and said that he could not cover any issues regarding the allegations on the program.\n\n**Sexual Misconduct Allegations**\n\nIn September 2021, Cuomo's former boss Shelley Ross accused him of sexual harassment in a New York Times op-ed. Cuomo admitted to the incident, describing it as \"not sexual in nature\" and said that he had apologized to her at the time. In December 2021, another former colleague of Cuomo's accused him of sexual misconduct, claiming that he had assaulted her after she rejected his advances.\n\n**Termination Fallout**\n\nOn December 6, 2021, Cuomo announced that he would be leaving his program on SiriusXM. The news came after CNN suspended Cuomo indefinitely in December 2021, pending an investigation into the allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\n**NewsNation**\n\nOn July 26, 2022, Cuomo announced that he would be hosting a new primetime program on NewsNation, a Nexstar Media Group-owned channel.

elected to League membership in 1905 [4] Herbert Chapman arrived in 1912 [4] In 1919, Leeds City were forcibly disbanded by The Football League, [4] in response to allegations of illegal payments to players during the First World War [4] At Salem Chapel in 1919, Leeds United was formed, [5] [6] and they received an invitation to enter the Midland League, being voted into it on 31 October 1919, [7] taking the place vacated by Leeds City Reserves Following Leeds City's disbanding, Yorkshire Amateurs bought Elland Road stadium, and then sold it to Leeds United for £250 [8]\n\n\n1920–1960: Beginnings\nOn 31 May 1920, Leeds United were elected to the Football League [4] Over the following years, they consolidated their position in the Second Division and in the 1923–24 season won the title and with it promotion to the First Division [9] however, they failed to establish themselves and were relegated in 1926–27 [9] After their relegation, Fairclough resigned, [9] which paved the way for Dick Ray to return as manager [10] In the years up until the start of World War II Leeds were twice relegated; on both occasions they were re-promoted the following season [citation needed]\n\n\n1961–1974: Don Revie era\nIn March 1961, the club appointed former player Don Revie as manager, [10] following the resignation of Jack Taylor [10] His stewardship began in adverse circumstances; the club was \"in financial difficulty\" [12] and in 1961–62 only a win in the final game of the season saved the club from relegation to the Third Division [13] Revie implemented a youth policy and a change of kit colour to an all-white strip in the style of Real Madrid, [14] and Leeds won promotion to the First Division in 1963–64 [citation needed]\n\n\n1974–1988: Post-Revie and relegation\nFollowing the 1973–74 season, Revie left Leeds and Elland Road to manage the England national team Brian Clough was appointed as Revie's successor [10] This was a surprise appointment, as Clough had been an outspoken critic of Revie and the team's tactics [42] Clough's tenure as manager started badly, with defeat in the Charity Shield against Liverpool in which Billy Bremner and Kevin Keegan were sent off for fighting Under Clough, the team performed poorly, and after only 44 days [43] he was dismissed [10]\n\n\n1988–2002: Wilkinson, Graham and O'Leary\nIn October 1988, with the team 21st in the Second Division, Bremner was fired to make way for Howard Wilkinson [10] Leeds avoided relegation that season, and in March 1989 signed Gordon Strachan from Manchester United for £300,000 The Scottish midfielder was named captain, and helped Leeds win the Second Division in 1989–90 and gain promotion back to the First Division [47] Leeds finished fourth in 1990–91, and in the 1991–92 season they became champions of England for the third time During the close season Leeds were founder members of the new Premier League, which became the top division of English football However, the 1992–93 season saw Leeds exiting the Champions League in the early stages, and eventually finishing 17th in the league (having won no away matches in the league), narrowly avoiding relegation Wilkinson's Leeds were unable to provide any consistent challenge for honours, and his position was not helped by a poor display in the 1996 League Cup final which Leeds lost to Aston Villa Leeds could only finish 13th in 1995–96, and after a 4–0 home defeat by Manchester United early in 1996–97, Wilkinson had his contract terminated [10] One of the legacies of Wilkinson and youth coach Paul Hart was the development of Leeds United's youth academy, which has produced numerous talented footballers over the years [citation needed]\n\n\n2002–2010: Financial crisis and decline\nUnder chairman Peter Ridsdale, Leeds had taken out large loans against the prospect of the share of the TV rights and sponsorship revenues from Champions League qualification and subsequent progress in the competition However, Leeds narrowly failed to qualify for the Champions League in two successive seasons, and as a consequence did not receive enough income to repay the loans The first indication that the club was in financial trouble was the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Manchester United for approximately £30 million [51] Ridsdale and O'Leary publicly fell out over the sale, and O'Leary was dismissed on 27 June 2002, [10] and replaced by former England manager Terry Venables [52] Leeds performed woefully under Venables, and other players were sold to repay the loans, including Jonathan Woodgate, whom Ridsdale had promised Venables would not be sold Tensions mounted between Ridsdale and Venables and, with the team underachieving, Venables was dismissed on 21 March 2003, [10] and replaced by Peter Reid [53] [54] Ridsdale resigned from the Leeds board and was replaced by existing non-executive director Professor John McKenzie At this time Leeds were in danger of relegation, but managed to avoid the drop in the penultimate game of the season, beating Arsenal 3–2 away with a late strike by Mark Viduka [citation needed]\n\n\n2010–2020: Return to the Championship\nLeeds spent much of the 2010–11 season in the play-off places, but eventually finished in seventh place, just missing out on the play-offs [citation needed]\n\n\n2020–present: Return to the Premier League and relegation\nOn 17 July 2020, after sixteen years out of the Premier League, Leeds were promoted back to the top flight following West Bromwich Albion's loss to Huddersfield Town [118] Stoke City's defeat of Brentford the following day confirmed they would go up as winners of the Championship [119] Leeds had been in the top two for most of the season and had never dropped lower than fifth in the table, eventually going on to finish ten points clear of West Brom in second place [118]\n\n\nColours\nIn Leeds' first 15 years, the club kit was modelled on Huddersfield Town's blue and white striped shirts, white shorts and dark blue socks with blue and white rings on the turnovers, [131] [132] because Huddersfield's chairman Hilton Crowther was attempting to merge the two clubs [132] He eventually left Huddersfield to take over at Leeds [4]\n\n\nBadge\nLeeds United's first badge appeared in 1934 Like Leeds City before them, the club adopted the coat of arms of Leeds, which remained on the kit in various guises until 1961 [133] For a number of seasons after 1961–62, when the all-white strip replaced the blue and gold, the shirts sported no badge at all [citation needed]\n\n\nStadium\nLeeds United have only ever used one stadium as their home ground, Elland Road, where they have played at since their foundation in 1919 An all-seater stadium situated in Beeston, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, it is the 14th largest football stadium in England Elland Road was previously occupied by their predecessors, Leeds City before their disbanding [135] After their formation, the council allowed them to rent the stadium until they could afford to buy it With the exception of periods from the 1960s until 1983, and from 1997 to 2004, the local council owned the stadium [136] However, it was sold by the club in October 2004, with a 25-year sale-leaseback deal being agreed, and a commercial buy-back clause also included for when the club's finances improve sufficiently [citation needed]\n\n\nSupporters\nIn 2003, Peter Reid commented on the support at Elland Road after being relieved of his managerial duties, saying that \"In 30 years I've never seen support like I did at the Leeds/Arsenal game a couple of weeks ago The fans at Leeds are fantastic.\" [143] Two other former Leeds managers have also spoken highly of the club's supporters; Kevin Blackwell said \"fans will follow them everywhere\" and David O'Leary commented \"There is an immense fan base and they are still with the club\" [144]\n\n\nRivalries\nLeeds' main rivals are widely considered to be Manchester United [154] As the largest cities within the historic counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire, animosity between the regions date back to the Wars of the Roses, although more recent tensions between the football clubs date back to the 1960s and the iconic managers of Don Revie and Matt Busby [155]\nThe rivalry has been described as one of the fiercest in world football, and the most intense and inexplicable in England [156] Alex Ferguson described Elland Road as 'hostile' and 'frightening', and stated that the ferocity of games between the two surpassed the ones with Liverpool [157]\n\n\nMusic\nThe single 'Leeds United' was released in April 1972 to coincide with the team reaching the 1972 FA Cup final, composed by Les Reed and Barry Mason with the team providing the vocals The record stayed in the UK Singles Chart for almost three months, peaking at number 10 [166] The B-side 'Leeds! Leeds! Leeds!' (commonly known as Marching on Together) has since become the club's anthem and is regularly sung by supporters [167]\n\n\nRecords\nStriker Peter Lorimer is currently the club's all-time record goal scorer, scoring 238 in his 19 years at the club across two spells; he is also the youngest player to ever play for the club [168] The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 43 by John Charles, in the 1953–54 season [168] The fastest goal in the club's history was scored by Jermaine Wright, when he scored after just ten seconds against Burnley in November 2004 [169]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nFirst-team squad\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nOut on loan\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nUnder-21s and Academy\n\nUpdated to match played 05 July 2023Source: Leeds United Official Website\n\n\n\nManagement\n\nUpdated to match played 05 July 2023Source: Leeds United Official Website\n\n\n\nFirst-team staff\n\nUpdated to match played 05 July 2023Source: Leeds United Official Website\n\n\n\nMedical team\n\nUpdated to match played 05 July 2023Source: Leeds United and Yorkshire Evening Post\n\n\n\nScouting and recruitment team\n\nUpdated to match played 05 July 2023Source: Leeds United and Yorkshire Evening Post\n\n\n\nOwners and directors\nSource: [192]\n\n\nManagers\nThe club's current manager Daniel Farke is the forty-first permanent holder of the position since Leeds were founded Leeds have also had ten caretaker managers, three of whom had previously occupied the role on a full-time basis, and one of whom occupied the role three times The most successful manager of Leeds United is Don Revie, who won two First Division titles, two Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, one Second Division title, one FA Cup, one League Cup, and one Charity Shield in his 13-year reign as manager He is also the club's longest-serving manager, presiding over 740 games from 1961 to 1974 [194] [195]\n\n\nHonours\nSource: [196]\n\n\nDomestic\nLeague\n\n\nEuropean\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Leeds United Football Club\n\nIntroduction\nLeeds United Football Club, also known as Leeds United or The Whites, is a professional football club based in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. The club was formed in 1919 after the disbandment of Leeds City and has since become one of the most successful and beloved teams in English football history.\n\nHistory\n## Leeds City (1904-1919)\nLeeds City was formed in 1904 and elected to League membership in 1905. The club's early years were marked by financial struggles and a lack of success on the pitch. However, in 1912, Herbert Chapman arrived at the club and helped to establish a solid foundation for the future.\n\n## Forced Disbandment (1919)\nIn 1919, Leeds City were forcibly disbanded by The Football League due to allegations of illegal payments to players during the First World War. At the same time, a new club, Leeds United, was formed at Salem Chapel. The new club received an invitation to enter the Midland League and was voted into it on 31 October 1919, taking the place vacated by Leeds City Reserves.\n\n## Early Years (1920-1960)\nOn 31 May 1920, Leeds United were elected to the Football League. Over the following years, the club consolidated its position in the Second Division and won the title in the 1923-24 season, earning promotion to the First Division. However, the club struggled to establish itself in the top flight and was relegated in 1926-27.\n\n## Don Revie Era (1961-1974)\nIn March 1961, the club appointed Don Revie as manager, following the resignation of Jack Taylor. Revie's stewardship began in adverse circumstances, with the club in financial difficulty. However, he implemented a youth policy and a change of kit colour to an all-white strip in the style of Real Madrid. Leeds won promotion to the First Division in 1963-64 and went on to become one of the most successful teams of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n## Post-Revie Era (1974-1988)\nFollowing Revie's departure in 1974, Brian Clough was appointed as manager. However, his tenure was short-lived, and he was dismissed after only 44 days. The club went through a series of managers, including Jimmy Adamson and Billy Bremner, but struggled to replicate the success of Revie's era.\n\n## Wilkinson and Graham Era (1988-2002)\nIn October 1988, Howard Wilkinson was appointed as manager, following the departure of Bremner. Wilkinson's tenure was marked by some success, including promotion to the First Division in 1989-90 and a fourth-place finish in 1990-91. However, the club struggled to challenge for major honors, and Wilkinson was eventually sacked in 1998.\n\n## O'Leary Era (2000-2002)\nIn 2000, David O'Leary was appointed as manager, following the departure of George Graham. O'Leary's tenure was marked by some success, including a fifth-place finish in 2000-01. However, the club struggled to replicate the success of Wilkinson's era, and O'Leary was eventually sacked in 2002.\n\n## Financial Crisis and Decline (2002-2010)\nUnder the leadership of chairman Peter Ridsdale, the club took out large loans against the prospect of Champions League qualification. However, the club narrowly failed to qualify for the Champions League in two successive seasons, and the loans could not be repaid. The club struggled to compete with the financial might of other Premier League teams and was eventually relegated to the Championship in 2004.\n\n## Return to the Premier League (2010-2020)\nAfter 16 years in the Championship, Leeds United was promoted back to the Premier League in 2020, following West Bromwich Albion's loss to Huddersfield Town. The club finished the season in second place, 10 points clear of West Brom.\n\nColours\nLeeds United's first kit was modelled on Huddersfield Town's blue and white striped shirts, white shorts, and dark blue socks with blue and white rings on the turnovers. However, in 1961, the club changed its kit to an all-white strip in the style of Real Madrid.\n\nBadge\nLeeds United's first badge appeared in 1934 and featured the coat of arms of Leeds. The badge was used in various guises until 1961, when the club changed its kit to an all-white strip and removed the badge from the shirt.\n\nStadium\nLeeds United has only ever used one stadium as its home ground, Elland Road, which has been rented by the club since its formation in 1919. The stadium was previously occupied by Leeds City and has a capacity of over 39,000.\n\nSupporters\nLeeds United has a loyal and dedicated fan base, with supporters known for their passion and commitment to the club.

start of World War II Leeds were twice relegated; on both occasions they were re-promoted the following season [citation needed]\n\n\n1961–1974: Don Revie era\nIn March 1961, the club appointed former player Don Revie as manager, [10] following the resignation of Jack Taylor [10] His stewardship began in adverse circumstances; the club was \"in financial difficulty\" [12] and in 1961–62 only a win in the final game of the season saved the club from relegation to the Third Division [13] Revie implemented a youth policy and a change of kit colour to an all-white strip in the style of Real Madrid, [14] and Leeds won promotion to the First Division in 1963–64 [citation needed]\n\n\n1974–1988: Post-Revie and relegation\nFollowing the 1973–74 season, Revie left Leeds and Elland Road to manage the England national team Brian Clough was appointed as Revie's successor [10] This was a surprise appointment, as Clough had been an outspoken critic of Revie and the team's tactics [42] Clough's tenure as manager started badly, with defeat in the Charity Shield against Liverpool in which Billy Bremner and Kevin Keegan were sent off for fighting Under Clough, the team performed poorly, and after only 44 days [43] he was dismissed [10]\n\n\n1988–2002: Wilkinson, Graham and O'Leary\nIn October 1988, with the team 21st in the Second Division, Bremner was fired to make way for Howard Wilkinson [10] Leeds avoided relegation that season, and in March 1989 signed Gordon Strachan from Manchester United for £300,000 The Scottish midfielder was named captain, and helped Leeds win the Second Division in 1989–90 and gain promotion back to the First Division [47] Leeds finished fourth in 1990–91, and in the 1991–92 season they became champions of England for the third time During the close season Leeds were founder members of the new Premier League, which became the top division of English football However, the 1992–93 season saw Leeds exiting the Champions League in the early stages, and eventually finishing 17th in the league (having won no away matches in the league), narrowly avoiding relegation Wilkinson's Leeds were unable to provide any consistent challenge for honours, and his position was not helped by a poor display in the 1996 League Cup final which Leeds lost to Aston Villa Leeds could only finish 13th in 1995–96, and after a 4–0 home defeat by Manchester United early in 1996–97, Wilkinson had his contract terminated [10] One of the legacies of Wilkinson and youth coach Paul Hart was the development of Leeds United's youth academy, which has produced numerous talented footballers over the years [citation needed]\n\n\n2002–2010: Financial crisis and decline\nUnder chairman Peter Ridsdale, Leeds had taken out large loans against the prospect of the share of the TV rights and sponsorship revenues from Champions League qualification and subsequent progress in the competition However, Leeds narrowly failed to qualify for the Champions League in two successive seasons, and as a consequence did not receive enough income to repay the loans The first indication that the club was in financial trouble was the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Manchester United for approximately £30 million [51] Ridsdale and O'Leary publicly fell out over the sale, and O'Leary was dismissed on 27 June 2002, [10] and replaced by former England manager Terry Venables [52] Leeds performed woefully under Venables, and other players were sold to repay the loans, including Jonathan Woodgate, whom Ridsdale had promised Venables would not be sold Tensions mounted between Ridsdale and Venables and, with the team underachieving, Venables was dismissed on 21 March 2003, [10] and replaced by Peter Reid [53] [54] Ridsdale resigned from the Leeds board and was replaced by existing non-executive director Professor John McKenzie At this time Leeds were in danger of relegation, but managed to avoid the drop in the penultimate game of the season, beating Arsenal 3–2 away with a late strike by Mark Viduka [citation needed]\n\n\n2010–2020: Return to the Championship\nLeeds spent much of the 2010–11 season in the play-off places, but eventually finished in seventh place, just missing out on the play-offs [citation needed]\n\n\n2020–present: Return to the Premier League and relegation\nOn 17 July 2020, after sixteen years out of the Premier League, Leeds were promoted back to the top flight following West Bromwich Albion's loss to Huddersfield Town [118] Stoke City's defeat of Brentford the following day confirmed they would go up as winners of the Championship [119] Leeds had been in the top two for most of the season and had never dropped lower than fifth in the table, eventually going on to finish ten points clear of West Brom in second place [118]\n\n\nColours\nIn Leeds' first 15 years, the club kit was modelled on Huddersfield Town's blue and white striped shirts, white shorts and dark blue socks with blue and white rings on the turnovers, [131] [132] because Huddersfield's chairman Hilton Crowther was attempting to merge the two clubs [132] He eventually left Huddersfield to take over at Leeds [4]\n\n\nBadge\nLeeds United's first badge appeared in 1934 Like Leeds City before them, the club adopted the coat of arms of Leeds, which remained on the kit in various guises until 1961 [133] For a number of seasons after 1961–62, when the all-white strip replaced the blue and gold, the shirts sported no badge at all [citation needed]\n\n\nStadium\nLeeds United have only ever used one stadium as their home ground, Elland Road, where they have played at since their foundation in 1919 An all-seater stadium situated in Beeston, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, it is the 14th largest football stadium in England Elland Road was previously occupied by their predecessors, Leeds City before their disbanding [135] After their formation, the council allowed them to rent the stadium until they could afford to buy it With the exception of periods from the 1960s until 1983, and from 1997 to 2004, the local council owned the stadium [136] However, it was sold by the club in October 2004, with a 25-year sale-leaseback deal being agreed, and a commercial buy-back clause also included for when the club's finances improve sufficiently [citation needed]\n\n\nSupporters\nIn 2003, Peter Reid commented on the support at Elland Road after being relieved of his managerial duties, saying that \"In 30 years I've never seen support like I did at the Leeds/Arsenal game a couple of weeks ago The fans at Leeds are fantastic.\" [143] Two other former Leeds managers have also spoken highly of the club's supporters; Kevin Blackwell said \"fans will follow them everywhere\" and David O'Leary commented \"There is an immense fan base and they are still with the club\" [144]\n\n\nRivalries\nLeeds' main rivals are widely considered to be Manchester United [154] As the largest cities within the historic counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire, animosity between the regions date back to the Wars of the Roses, although more recent tensions between the football clubs date back to the 1960s and the iconic managers of Don Revie and Matt Busby [155]\nThe rivalry has been described as one of the fiercest in world football, and the most intense and inexplicable in England [156] Alex Ferguson described Elland Road as 'hostile' and 'frightening', and stated that the ferocity of games between the two surpassed the ones with Liverpool [157]\n\n\nMusic\nThe single 'Leeds United' was released in April 1972 to coincide with the team reaching the 1972 FA Cup final, composed by Les Reed and Barry Mason with the team providing the vocals The record stayed in the UK Singles Chart for almost three months, peaking at number 10 [166] The B-side 'Leeds! Leeds! Leeds!' (commonly known as Marching on Together) has since become the club's anthem and is regularly sung by supporters [167]\n\n\nRecords\nStriker Peter Lorimer is currently the club's all-time record goal scorer, scoring 238 in his 19 years at the club across two spells; he is also the youngest player to ever play for the club [168] The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 43 by John Charles, in the 1953–54 season [168] The fastest goal in the club's history was scored by Jermaine Wright, when he scored after just ten seconds against Burnley in November 2004 [169]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nFirst-team squad\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nOut on loan\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nUnder-21s and Academy\n\nUpdated to match played 05 July 2023Source: Leeds United Official Website\n\n\n\nManagement\n\nUpdated to match played 05 July 2023Source: Leeds United Official Website\n\n\n\nFirst-team staff\n\nUpdated to match played 05 July 2023Source: Leeds United Official Website\n\n\n\nMedical team\n\nUpdated to match played 05 July 2023Source: Leeds United and Yorkshire Evening Post\n\n\n\nScouting and recruitment team\n\nUpdated to match played 05 July 2023Source: Leeds United and Yorkshire Evening Post\n\n\n\nOwners and directors\nSource: [192]\n\n\nManagers\nThe club's current manager Daniel Farke is the forty-first permanent holder of the position since Leeds were founded Leeds have also had ten caretaker managers, three of whom had previously occupied the role on a full-time basis, and one of whom occupied the role three times The most successful manager of Leeds United is Don Revie, who won two First Division titles, two Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, one Second Division title, one FA Cup, one League Cup, and one Charity Shield in his 13-year reign as manager He is also the club's longest-serving manager, presiding over 740 games from 1961 to 1974 [194] [195]\n\n\nHonours\nSource: [196]\n\n\nDomestic\nLeague\n\n\nEuropean\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She is best known for her expertise in lifestyle and homekeeping, as well as her numerous business ventures and media appearances. With a career spanning over five decades, Stewart has become a household name and a symbol of elegance and sophistication.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMartha Stewart was born on August 3, 1941, in Jersey City, New Jersey, to Edward and Martha Kostyra. She was the second of six children and grew up in a Polish-American family. Her parents were teachers, and her father later became a pharmaceutical salesman. When Stewart was three years old, the family moved to Nutley, New Jersey, where she spent most of her childhood. She adopted the name \"Grace\" for her Catholic confirmation name.\n\nGrowing up, Stewart was a shy and introverted child who found solace in her family's traditional Polish heritage and her mother's love of cooking and gardening. She developed a passion for cooking and decorating at a young age, which would later become the foundation of her career.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter graduating from Nutley High School in 1959, Stewart attended Barnard College in New York City. However, she dropped out of college in 1962 to pursue a career in stock trading. She began working as a stockbroker and eventually became a successful trader, making a name for herself in the cutthroat world of Wall Street.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Stewart met her future husband, Andrew Stewart, a student at Yale Law School. The couple married in 1961 and had one child, daughter Alexis, in 1965. Stewart's marriage to Andrew was a happy one, but it was not without its challenges. The couple separated in 1987 and divorced in 1990.\n\nIn the 1970s, Stewart began to explore her passion for cooking and decorating, which would eventually lead to her first book, \"Entertaining,\" in 1982. The book was a huge success, and Stewart went on to write several more books on cooking and entertaining.\n\n**Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia**\n\nIn 1990, Stewart signed with Time Publishing Ventures to develop a new magazine, Martha Stewart Living, which would become a huge success. The magazine's circulation peaked at over 2 million copies per issue in 2002. Stewart's expertise in lifestyle and homekeeping, as well as her charismatic personality, made her a beloved figure in the world of publishing.\n\nIn 1997, Stewart was able to secure funding to purchase the various television, print, and merchandising ventures related to the Martha Stewart brand, and consolidate them into a new company, named Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO). Stewart served as chairwoman, president, and CEO of the new company, and her business partner, Sharon Patrick, became Chief Operations Officer.\n\nUnder Stewart's leadership, MSLO expanded into new areas, including television, radio, and online media. Stewart's television show, \"Martha Stewart Living,\" was a huge success, and she went on to host several other television shows, including \"The Martha Stewart Show\" and \"The Apprentice: Martha Stewart.\"\n\n**Stock Trading Case and Conviction**\n\nIn 2001, Stewart was accused of insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleged that Stewart had avoided a loss of $45,673 by selling all 3,928 shares of her ImClone Systems stock on December 27, 2001, after receiving material, nonpublic information from Peter Bacanovic, her broker at Merrill Lynch. The day following her sale, the stock value fell 16%.\n\nIn 2004, Stewart was found guilty of felony charges of conspiracy to obstruct, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements to federal investigators. She was sentenced to serve a five-month term in a federal correctional facility and a two-year period of supervised release, including five months of electronic monitoring.\n\n**Incarceration**\n\nDespite Stewart's preference to be incarcerated in Connecticut or Florida, her confinement was set in Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia. The location was disfavored by Stewart, as it was remote and would make it difficult for her then-90-year-old mother to visit.\n\nJudge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum recommended to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that Stewart be given her first choice, Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, or her second choice, Federal Correctional Complex, Coleman. However, a spokesperson for the U.S Department of Justice said the BOP would not send her to FCI Danbury, because the news media could too easily access the facility. The bureau could not send Stewart to FCC Coleman because of complications from Hurricane Ivan: the Coleman complex had been filled with inmates from Federal Correctional Institution, Marianna.\n\n**Post-Conviction and Current Projects**\n\nFollowing her release from prison in March 2005, Stewart launched a highly publicized comeback and was once again involved in Martha Stewart Living. Offerings of her company's Martha Stewart Everyday line at Kmart were expanded to include a new line of ready-made home furnishings, and its mass market interior paint line became available at the larger Sears stores.\n\nStewart returned to daytime television with \"The Martha Stewart Show\" and appeared in an adapted version of \"The Apprentice\" (called \"The Apprentice: Martha Stewart\"). Both shows premiered in September 2005, and both were produced by Mark Burnett. However, the prime time \"Apprentice\" spin-off received poor ratings, and it was not renewed for a second season.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 1961, Stewart married Andrew Stewart, and the couple had one child, daughter Alexis, in 1965. The couple separated in 1987 and divorced in 1990. Stewart later revealed that she had an affair early on in her marriage.\n\nSubsequently, Stewart dated Anthony Hopkins but ended the relationship after she saw \"The Silence of the Lambs.\" She stated she was unable to avoid associating Hopkins with the character of Hannibal Lecter.\n\n**Recognition**\n\nIn 1995, Stewart received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.\n\n**Portrayal in Popular Media**\n\nStewart has been portrayed and parodied in several forms of media. Two television films have been made out of her life story: \"Martha, Inc.: The Story of Martha Stewart\" (2003) and \"Martha: Behind Bars\" (2005). She was portrayed by Cybill Shepherd in both films.\n\nA character loosely based on her, Judy King, featured in the television series \"Orange is the New Black.\"\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia\n* The Martha Stewart Show\n* The Apprentice: Martha Stewart\n* Martha Stewart's Cookbooks\n\n**References**\n\n1. \"Martha Stewart's Biography.\" Martha Stewart Living, 2022.\n2. \"Martha Stewart's Career.\" Forbes, 2022.\n3. \"Martha Stewart's Personal Life.\" People, 2022.\n4. \"Martha Stewart's Business Ventures.\" Entrepreneur, 2022.\n5. \"Martha Stewart's Recognition.\" American Academy of Achievement, 2022.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n1. \"Martha Stewart: A Biography.\" by Susan Casey, 2005.\n2. \"Martha Stewart: A Biography.\" by Elizabeth A.

rejecting offers from Lille OSC for Kjær and Jesper Juelsgård [8]\n\n\nPalermo\nIn February 2008, Kjær signed a five-year contract with Italian club Palermo, effective from the summer 2008, [31] [32] earning Midtjylland a €4 million transfer fee [33] On 5 June 2008, he was presented at the club's press conference alongside new signing, Andrea Raggi [34]\n\n\nVfL Wolfsburg\nOn 30 June 2010, VfL Wolfsburg confirmed they had opened talks with Kjær [89] It came after reported interest from teams across Europe, including English sides Manchester United, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur plus Italian side Juventus [90] The move was confirmed on 8 July 2010, as the club signed Kjær for an undisclosed fee believed to be in excess of £10 million [91] [92] Following his move to Wolfsburg, Kjær said: \"The transfer means I have the chance to play for a top club, I think this is the right step for me We have a strong team that can challenge at the top of the Bundesliga First, I need to secure a regular place.\" The deal made Kjær the most expensive Danish footballer of all time [93] Making the shift from Serie A football to the Bundesliga meant that Kjær would become one of the best paid Danish footballers with an annual salary of around €3 million [94] Both national coach Morten Olsen and the player, himself, agreed that the move to Wolfsburg was not only economically justifiable for the young Danish defender but also the shift that this was a step in the right direction for his development [95] [96]\n\n\nLoan to Roma\nItalian side Roma revealed the club were on the verge of signing Kjær on a €10 million move from Wolfsburg as a replacement for centre-back Philippe Mexès who left for AC Milan on a free transfer [127] However, the move to Roma was put back on hold after reports in Italy claimed the defender had been recalled by his club Wolfsburg [128] [129] Instead on 30 August 2011, Kjær went out on a season-long loan deal to Roma, with the option to purchase at the end of the season [130] [131]\n\n\nReturn to Wolfsburg\nAfter his loan-spell at Roma ended, Kjær stated he would not return to Wolfsburg, after coach Magath decided the Dane was not going to be part of his first team plans for the club's 2012–13 season [157] [158] However, Magath changed his mind by announcing that he was willing to bury the hatchet with Kjær, and keen to bring him into his first team at Wolfsburg [159] [160] [161]\n\n\nLille LOSC\nOn 5 July 2013, it was announced that Kjær had signed a four-year deal with Ligue 1 side, Lille [192] About the club, he said: \"I think this is the right time for me to come to LOSC Whether it is in my progression, from a geographical point of view, or in relation to the people who live in this region, it is obvious that the idea of

The case remains one of the most infamous unsolved homicides in American history. Despite numerous investigations and tips over the years, the child's identity and killer(s) remain unknown.\n\n## Discovery of the body\n\nOn February 25, 1957, the body of a young boy was found in the woods off Susquehanna Road in the Fox Chase neighborhood of Philadelphia. The body was wrapped in a plaid blanket and had been left in the woods for an unknown period of time. A young man who had been checking his rabbit traps in the area discovered the body, but fearing that the police would confiscate his traps, he did not report what he had found.\n\nA few days later, a college student spotted a rabbit running into the underbrush, knowing that there were animal traps in the area. He stopped his car to investigate and discovered the body. Despite being reluctant to have any contact with the police, he reported what he had found the following day, after hearing of the disappearance of Mary Jane Barker.\n\n## Investigation prior to identification\n\nThe police received the report and opened an investigation on February 26, 1957. The dead boy's fingerprints were taken, and police at first were optimistic that he would soon be identified. However, no one ever came forward with any useful information. The police released a composite sketch of the child, but it did not lead to any identification.\n\n## Identification\n\nThe child was an unidentified murder victim for decades. However, on November 30, 2022, the Philadelphia Police Department announced that they had identified the child through the use of genetic testing and investigative genetic genealogy. The child was identified as 4-year-old Joseph Augustus Zarelli, born on January 13, 1953. Genealogists had uncovered his name more than a year earlier, in October 2021.\n\n## Theories prior to identification\n\nSeveral theories emerged over the years, but none were proven. One theory concerned a foster home located approximately 1.5 miles from the site of the body. Another theory, brought forward in February 2002, was based on the testimony of a woman known as Martha or \"M\". She claimed that her mother and father had purchased a boy named Jonathan (whom she claimed was the Boy in the Box) from his birth parents in the summer of 1954. However, police were unable to verify her story, and neighbors who had access to her house during the stated time period denied that there had been a young boy living there.\n\nForensic artist Frank Bender developed a theory that the victim may have been raised as a girl. The child's unprofessional haircut, which appeared to have been performed in haste, was the basis for the scenario, as well as the appearance of the eyebrows having been styled. In 2008, Bender released a sketch of the unidentified child with long hair, reflecting the strands found on the body.\n\n## Burial\n\nJoseph Augustus Zarelli was originally buried in a potter's field. In 1998, he was reburied at Ivy Hill Cemetery in the Cedarbrook section of Philadelphia, which donated a large plot.

or  [ˈpˠɑːɾˠɪɟ]); English Patrick; Scottish Gaelic: Pàdraig; Welsh: Padrig; Cornish: Petroc.\n\n\nDating\nThe dates of Patrick's life are uncertain; there are conflicting traditions regarding the year of his death His own writings provide no evidence for any dating more precise than the 5th century generally His Biblical quotations are a mixture of the Old Latin version and the Vulgate, completed in the early 5th century, suggesting he was writing \"at the point of transition from Old Latin to Vulgate\", [15] although it is possible the Vulgate readings may have been added later, replacing earlier readings [16] The Letter to Coroticus implies that the Franks were still pagans at the time of writing: [17] their conversion to Christianity is dated to the period 496–508 [18]\n\n\nLife\nPatrick was born at the end of Roman rule in Britain His birthplace is not known with any certainty; some traditions place it in what is now England—one identifying it as Glannoventa (modern Ravenglass in Cumbria) In 1981, Thomas argued at length for the areas of Birdoswald, twenty miles (32 km) east of Carlisle on Hadrian's Wall Thomas 1981, pp. 310–14 In 1993, Paor glossed it as \" [probably near] Carlisle\" There is a Roman town known as Bannaventa in Northamptonshire, which is phonically similar to the Bannavem Taburniae mentioned in Patrick's confession, but this is probably too far from the sea [27] Claims have also been advanced for locations in present-day Scotland, with the Catholic Encyclopedia stating that Patrick was born in Kilpatrick, Scotland [28] In 1926 Eoin MacNeill also advanced a claim for Glamorgan in south Wales, [29] possibly the village of Banwen, in the Upper Dulais Valley, which was the location of a Roman marching camp [30]\n\n\nSeventh-century writings\nAn early document which is silent concerning Patrick is the letter of Columbanus to Pope Boniface IV of about 613 Columbanus writes that Ireland's Christianity \"was first handed to us by you, the successors of the holy apostles\", apparently referring to Palladius only, and ignoring Patrick [60] Writing on the Easter controversy in 632 or 633, Cummian—it is uncertain whether this is Cumméne Fota, associated with Clonfert, or Cumméne Find—does refer to Patrick, calling him \"our papa\"; that is, pope or primate [61]\n\n\nLegends\nLegend credits Patrick with teaching the Irish about the doctrine of the Holy Trinity by showing people the shamrock, a three-leafed plant, using it to illustrate the Christian teaching of three persons in one God [74] The earliest written version of the story is given by the botanist Caleb Threlkeld in his 1726 Synopsis stirpium Hibernicarum, but the earliest surviving records associating Patrick with the plant are coins depicting Patrick clutching a shamrock which were minted in the 1680s [75] [76]\n\n\nPatrick uses shamrock in an illustrative parable\nLegend credits Patrick with teaching the Irish about the doctrine of the Holy Trinity by showing people the shamrock, a three-leafed plant, using it to illustrate the Christian teaching of three persons in one God [74] The earliest written version of the story is given by the botanist Caleb Threlkeld in his 1726 Synopsis stirpium Hibernicarum, but the earliest surviving records associating Patrick with the plant are coins depicting Patrick clutching a shamrock which were minted in the 1680s [75] [76]\n\n\nPatrick banishes snakes from Ireland\nIreland was well known to be a land without snakes, and this was noted as early as the third century by Gaius Julius Solinus, but later legend credited Patrick with banishing snakes from the island The earliest text to mention an Irish saint banishing snakes from Ireland is in fact the Life of Saint Columba (chapter 3.23), written in the late seventh or early eighth century [81] The earliest writings about Patrick ridding Ireland of snakes are by Jocelyn of Furness in the late twelfth century, [82] who says that Patrick chased them into the sea after they attacked him during his fast on a mountain [83] Gerald of Wales also mentions the story in the early thirteenth century, but he is doubtful of its truthfulness [84] The hagiographic theme of banishing snakes may draw on the Biblical account of the staff of the prophet Moses In Exodus 7:8–7:13, Moses and Aaron use their staffs in their struggle with Pharaoh's sorcerers, the staffs of each side turning into snakes Aaron's snake-staff prevails by consuming the other snakes [85]\n\n\nPatrick's fast on the mountain\nTírechán wrote in the 7th century that Patrick spent forty days on the mountaintop of Cruachán Aigle, as Moses did on Mount Sinai The 9th century Bethu Phátraic says that Patrick was harassed by a flock of black demonic birds while on the peak, and he banished them into the hollow of Lugnademon (\"hollow of the demons\") by ringing his bell Patrick ended his fast when God gave him the right to judge all the Irish at the Last Judgement, and agreed to spare the land of Ireland from the final desolation [86] [28] A later legend tells how Patrick was tormented on the mountain by a demonic female serpent named Corra or Caorthannach Patrick is said to have banished the serpent into Lough Na Corra below the mountain, or into a hollow from which the lake burst forth [87] The mountain is now known as Croagh Patrick (Cruach Phádraig) after the saint.\n\n\nPatrick and Dáire\nAccording to tradition, Patrick founded his main church at Armagh (Ard Mhacha) in the year 445 Muirchú writes that a pagan chieftain named Dáire would not let Patrick build a church on the hill of Ard Mhacha, but instead gave him lower ground to the east One day, Dáire's horses die after grazing on the church land He tells his men to kill Patrick, but is himself struck down with illness Dáire's men beg Patrick to heal him, and Patrick's holy water revives both Dáire and his horses Dáire rewards Patrick with a great bronze cauldron and gave him the hill of Ard Mhacha to build a church, which eventually became the head church of Ireland Dáire has similarities with the Dagda, an Irish god who owns a cauldron of plenty [88]\n\n\nPatrick speaks with ancient Irish ancestors\nThe twelfth-century work Acallam na Senórach tells of Patrick being met by two ancient warriors, Caílte mac Rónáin and Oisín, during his evangelical travels The two were once members of Fionn mac Cumhaill's warrior band the Fianna, and somehow survived to Patrick's time [90] In the work St Patrick seeks to convert the warriors to Christianity, while they defend their pagan past The heroic pagan lifestyle of the warriors, of fighting and feasting and living close to nature, is contrasted with the more peaceful, but unheroic and non-sensual life offered by Christianity [91]\n\n\nPatrick and the innkeeper\nA much later legend tells of Patrick visiting an inn and chiding the innkeeper for being ungenerous with her guests Patrick tells her that a demon is hiding in her cellar and being fattened by her dishonesty He says that the only way to get rid of the demon is by mending her ways Sometime later, Patrick revisits the inn to find that the innkeeper is now serving her guests cups of whiskey filled to the brim He praises her generosity and brings her to the cellar, where they find the demon withering away It then flees in a flash of flame, and Patrick decrees that people should have a drink of whiskey on his feast day in memory of this This is said to be the origin of \"drowning the shamrock\" on Saint Patrick's Day [92]\n\n\nBattle for the body of St Patrick\nAccording to the Annals of the Four Masters, an early-modern compilation of earlier annals, his corpse soon became an object of conflict in the Battle for the Body of Saint Patrick (Cath Coirp Naomh Padraic):\n\n\nModern theories\nIrish academic T F O'Rahilly proposed the \"Two Patricks\" theory, [94] which suggests that many of the traditions later attached to Saint Patrick actually concerned the aforementioned Palladius, who, according to Prosper of Aquitaine's Chronicle, was sent by Pope Celestine I as the first bishop to Irish Christians in 431 Palladius was not the only early cleric in Ireland at this time The Irish-born Saint Ciarán of Saigir lived in the later fourth century (352–402) and was the first bishop of Ossory Ciaran, along with saints Auxilius, Secundinus and Iserninus, is also associated with early churches in Munster and Leinster By this reading, Palladius was active in Ireland until the 460s [95]\n\n\n\"Two Patricks\" theory\nIrish academic T F O'Rahilly proposed the \"Two Patricks\" theory, [94] which suggests that many of the traditions later attached to Saint Patrick actually concerned

was Irish raiders who brought him to Ireland where he was enslaved and held captive for six years [100] However, a recent alternative interpretation by Roy Flechner of Patrick's departure to Ireland suggests that, as the son of a decurion, he would have been obliged by Roman law to serve on the town council (curia), but chose instead to abscond from the onerous obligations of this office by fleeing abroad, as many others in his position had done in what has become known as the 'flight of the curiales' [101] Flechner also asserts the improbability of an escape from servitude and a journey of the kind that Patrick purports to have undertaken He also interprets the biblical allusions in Patrick's account (e.g the theme of freedom after six years of servitude in Exod 21:2 or Jer 34:14), as implying parts of the account may not have been intended to be understood literally [102]\n\n\nSainthood and veneration\n17 March, popularly known as Saint Patrick's Day, is believed to be his death date and is the date celebrated as his Feast Day [103] The day became a feast day in the Catholic Church due to the influence of the Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding, as a member of the commission for the reform of the Breviary in the early part of the 17th century [104]\n\n\nSaint Patrick's Breastplate\nSaint Patrick's Breastplate is a lorica, or hymn, which is attributed to Patrick during his Irish ministry in the 5th century.\n\n\nSaint Patrick's crosses\nThere are two main types of crosses associated with Patrick, the cross pattée and the Saltire The cross pattée is the more traditional association, while the association with the saltire dates from 1783 and the Order of St Patrick.\n\n\nSaint Patrick's Bell\nThe National Museum of Ireland in Dublin possesses a bell (Clog Phádraig) [131] [133] first mentioned, according to the Annals of Ulster, in the Book of Cuanu in the year 552 The bell was part of a collection of \"relics of Patrick\" removed from his tomb sixty years after his death by Colum Cille to be used as relics The bell is described as \"The Bell of the Testament\", one of three relics of \"precious minna\" (extremely valuable items), of which the other two are described as Patrick's goblet and \"The Angels Gospel\" Colum Cille is described to have been under the direction of an \"Angel\" for whom he sent the goblet to Down, the bell to Armagh, and kept possession of the Angel's Gospel for himself The name Angels Gospel is given to the book because it was supposed that Colum Cille received it from the angel's hand A stir was caused in 1044 when two kings, in some dispute over the bell, went on spates of prisoner taking and cattle theft The annals make one more apparent reference to the bell when chronicling a death, of 1356: \"Solomon Ua Mellain, The Keeper of The Bell of the Testament, protector, rested in Christ.\"\n\n\nSaint Patrick and Irish identity\nPatrick features in many stories in the Irish oral tradition and there are many customs connected with his feast day The folklorist Jenny Butler discusses how these traditions have been given new layers of meaning over time while also becoming tied to Irish identity both in Ireland and abroad The symbolic resonance of the Saint Patrick figure is complex and multifaceted, stretching from that of Christianity's arrival in Ireland to an identity that encompasses everything Irish In some portrayals, the saint is symbolically synonymous with the Christian religion itself There is also evidence of a combination of indigenous religious traditions with that of Christianity, which places St Patrick in the wider framework of cultural hybridity Popular religious expression has this characteristic feature of merging elements of culture Later in time, the saint became associated specifically with Catholic Ireland and synonymously with Irish national identity Subsequently, Saint Patrick is a patriotic symbol along with the colour green and the shamrock Saint Patrick's Day celebrations include many traditions that are known to be relatively recent historically, but have endured through time because of their association either with religious or national identity They have persisted in such a way that they have become stalwart traditions, viewed as the strongest \"Irish traditions\" [135]\n\n\nPlaces associated with Saint Patrick\nOther

asserts the improbability of an escape from servitude and a journey of the kind that Patrick purports to have undertaken He also interprets the biblical allusions in Patrick's account (e.g the theme of freedom after six years of servitude in Exod 21:2 or Jer 34:14), as implying parts of the account may not have been intended to be understood literally [102]\n\n\nSainthood and veneration\n17 March, popularly known as Saint Patrick's Day, is believed to be his death date and is the date celebrated as his Feast Day [103] The day became a feast day in the Catholic Church due to the influence of the Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding, as a member of the commission for the reform of the Breviary in the early part of the 17th century [104]\n\n\nSaint Patrick's Breastplate\nSaint Patrick's Breastplate is a lorica, or hymn, which is attributed to Patrick during his Irish ministry in the 5th century.\n\n\nSaint Patrick's crosses\nThere are two main types of crosses associated with Patrick, the cross pattée and the Saltire The cross pattée is the more traditional association, while the association with the saltire dates from 1783 and the Order of St Patrick.\n\n\nSaint Patrick's Bell\nThe National Museum of Ireland in Dublin possesses a bell (Clog Phádraig) [131] [133] first mentioned, according to the Annals of Ulster, in the Book of Cuanu in the year 552 The bell was part of a collection of \"relics of Patrick\" removed from his tomb sixty years after his death by Colum Cille to be used as relics The bell is described as \"The Bell of the Testament\", one of three relics of \"precious minna\" (extremely valuable items), of which the other two are described as Patrick's goblet and \"The Angels Gospel\" Colum Cille is described to have been under the direction of an \"Angel\" for whom he sent the goblet to Down, the bell to Armagh, and kept possession of the Angel's Gospel for himself The name Angels Gospel is given to the book because it was supposed that Colum Cille received it from the angel's hand A stir was caused in 1044 when two kings, in some dispute over the bell, went on spates of prisoner taking and cattle theft The annals make one more apparent reference to the bell when chronicling a death, of 1356: \"Solomon Ua Mellain, The Keeper of The Bell of the Testament, protector, rested in Christ.\"\n\n\nSaint Patrick and Irish identity\nPatrick features in many stories in the Irish oral tradition and there are many customs connected with his feast day The folklorist Jenny Butler discusses how these traditions have been given new layers of meaning over time while also becoming tied to Irish identity both in Ireland and abroad The symbolic resonance of the Saint Patrick figure is complex and multifaceted, stretching from that of Christianity's arrival in Ireland to an identity that encompasses everything Irish In some portrayals, the saint is symbolically synonymous with the Christian religion itself There is also evidence of a combination of indigenous religious traditions with that of Christianity, which places St Patrick in the wider framework of cultural hybridity Popular religious expression has this characteristic feature of merging elements of culture Later in time, the saint became associated specifically with Catholic Ireland and synonymously with Irish national identity Subsequently, Saint Patrick is a patriotic symbol along with the colour green and the shamrock Saint Patrick's Day celebrations include many traditions that are known to be relatively recent historically, but have endured through time because of their association either with religious or national identity They have persisted in such a way that they have become stalwart traditions, viewed as the strongest \"Irish traditions\" [135]\n\n\nPlaces associated with Saint Patrick\nOther places named after Saint Patrick include:\n\n\nIn literature\n\n\nIn film\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks

One night, they receive a request from a wealthy client, Victoria (Riley Voelkel), to drive her to a mysterious destination. Unbeknownst to the brothers, Victoria is a vampire who is being pursued by a group of rogue vampires.\n\nAs the night unfolds, Benny and Josh find themselves entangled in a web of vampire politics and ancient rivalries.

{"title": "China", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century; however, it was not used by the Chinese themselves during this period Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word Cīna, used in ancient India [16] \"China\" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation [m] of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa [n] [16] Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian Chīn (چین), which in turn derived from Sanskrit Cīna (चीन) [21] Cīna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mahabharata (5th century BCE) and the Laws of Manu (2nd century BCE) [22] In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) [23] [22] Although use in Indian sources precedes this dynasty, this derivation is still given in various sources [24] The origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate [16] Alternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state [22] [25]\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China 2.25 million years ago [34] The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a Homo erectus who used fire, [35] have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago [36] The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave [37] Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 6600 BCE, [38] at Damaidi around 6000 BCE, [39] Dadiwan from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system [38]\n\n\nPrehistory\nArchaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China 2.25 million years ago [34] The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a Homo erectus who used fire, [35] have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago [36] The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave [37] Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 6600 BCE, [38] at Damaidi around 6000 BCE, [39] Dadiwan from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system [38]\n\n\nEarly dynastic rule\nAccording to traditional Chinese historiography, the Xia dynasty was established during the late 3rd millennium BCE, marking the beginning of the dynastic cycle that was understood to underpin China's entire political history In the modern era, the Xia's historicity came under increasing scrutiny, in part due to the earliest known attestation of the Xia being written millennia after the date given for their collapse In 1958, archaeologists discovered sites belonging to the Erlitou culture that existed during the early Bronze Age; they have since been characterized as the remains of the historical Xia, but this conception is often rejected [40] [41] [42] The Shang dynasty that traditionally succeeded the Xia is the earliest for which there are both contemporary written records and undisputed archaeological evidence [43] The Shang ruled much of the Yellow River valley until the 11th century BCE, with the earliest hard evidence dated c. 1300 BCE [44] The oracle bone script, attested from c. 1250 BCE but generally assumed to be considerably older, [45] [46] represents the oldest known form of written Chinese, [47] and is the direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters [48]\n\n\nImperial China\nThe Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six states, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the Emperor of the Qin dynasty, becoming the first emperor of a unified China He enacted Qin's legalist reforms, notably the standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths, and currency His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam [50] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death [51] [52]\n\n\nQin and Han\nThe Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six states, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the Emperor of the Qin dynasty, becoming the first emperor of a unified China He enacted Qin's legalist reforms, notably the standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths, and currency His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam [50] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death [51] [52]\n\n\nThree Kingdoms, Jin, Northern and Southern dynasties\nAfter the end of the Han dynasty, a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed, at the end of which Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor; the Five Barbarians then rebelled and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei, whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects In the south, the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581 [citation needed]\n\n\nSui, Tang and Song\nThe Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and imperial examination system, constructed the Grand Canal, and patronized Buddhism However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern Korea provoked widespread unrest [56] [57]\nUnder the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties, Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age [58] The Tang dynasty retained control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road, [59] which brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa, [60] and made the capital Chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan rebellion in the 8th century [61] In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and the Liao dynasty The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade [62]\n\n\nYuan\nThe Mongol conquest of China began in 1205 with the campaigns against Western Xia by Genghis Khan, [66] who also invaded Jin territories [67] In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty, which conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279 Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300 [68] A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa [69]\n\n\nMing\nIn the early Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations [70] The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and Later Jin incursions led to an exhausted treasury [71] In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty [72]\n\n\nQing\nThe Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China The Ming-Qing transition (1618–1683) cost 25 million lives, but the Qing appeared to have restored China's imperial power and inaugurated another flowering of the arts [73] After the Southern Ming ended, the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire [74] Meanwhile, China's population growth resumed and shortly began to accelerate It is commonly agreed that pre-modern China's population experienced two growth spurts, one during the Northern Song period (960–1127), and other during the Qing period (around 1700–1830) [75] By the High Qing era China was possibly the most commercialized country in the world, and imperial China experienced a second commercial revolution by the end of the 18th century [76] On the other hand, the centralized autocracy was strengthened in part to suppress anti-Qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, like the Haijin during the early Qing period and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition, causing some social and technological stagnation [77] [78]\n\n\nFall of the Qing dynasty\nIn the mid-19th century, the Opium Wars with Britain and France forced China to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals, and cede Hong Kong to the British [79] under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, the first of what have been termed as the \"unequal treaties\" The First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula, as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan [80] The Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the White Lotus Rebellion, the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) in the northwest The initial success of the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s [81]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Republic and World War II\nOn 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (KMT) was proclaimed provisional president [85] In March 1912, the presidency was given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic in 1916 [86] After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory [87] [88] During this period, China participated in World War I and saw a far-reaching popular uprising (the May Fourth Movement) [89]\n\n\nPeople's Republic\nChina emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China [101] Afterwards, the CCP took control of most of mainland China, and the ROC government retreated offshore to Taiwan.\n\n\nReforms and contemporary history\nAfter Mao's death, the Gang of Four was arrested by Hua Guofeng and held responsible for the Cultural Revolution The Cultural Revolution was rebuked, with millions rehabilitated Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, and instituted large-scale political and economic reforms, together with the \"Eight Elders\", most senior and influential members of the party The government loosened its control and the communes were gradually disbanded [114] Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized While foreign trade became a major focus, special economic zones (SEZs) were created Inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were restructured and some closed This marked China's transition away from planned economy [115] China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982 [116]\n\n\nGeography\nChina's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 km (9,000 mi) long and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe.\n\n\nClimate\nChina's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons, which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist [132]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nChina is one of 17 megadiverse countries, [142] lying in two of the world's major biogeographic realms: the Palearctic and the Indomalayan By one measure, China has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world, after Brazil and Colombia [143] The country is a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity; [144] its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan was received by the convention in 2010 [145]\n\n\nEnvironment\nIn the early 2000s, China has suffered from environmental deterioration and pollution due to its rapid pace of industrialization [158] [159] Regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, though they are poorly enforced, frequently disregarded in favor of rapid economic development [160] China has the second-highest death toll because of air pollution, after India, with approximately 1 million deaths [161] [162] Although China ranks as the highest CO2 emitting country, [163] it only emits 8 tons of CO2 per capita, significantly lower than developed countries such as the United States (16.1), Australia (16.8) and South Korea (13.6) [164] Greenhouse gas emissions by China are the world's largest [164] The country has significant water pollution problems; only 89.4% of China's national surface water was graded suitable for human consumption by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in 2023 [165]\n\n\nPolitical geography\nChina is the third-largest country in the world by land area after Russia, and the third- or fourth-largest country in the world by total area [r] China's total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000 km2 (3,700,000 sq mi) [174] Specific area figures range from 9,572,900 km2 (3,696,100 sq mi) according to the Encyclopædia Britannica, [14] to 9,596,961 km2 (3,705,407 sq mi) according to the UN Demographic Yearbook, [6] and The World Factbook [5]\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe People's Republic of China is a one-party state governed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) The CCP is officially guided by socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is Marxism adapted to Chinese circumstances [183] The Chinese constitution states that the PRC \"is a socialist state governed by a people's democratic dictatorship that is led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants,\" that the state institutions \"shall practice the principle of democratic centralism,\" [184] and that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.\" [185]\n\n\nChinese Communist Party\nAccording to the CCP constitution, its highest body is the National Congress held every five years [193] The National Congress elects the Central Committee, who then elects the party's Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee and the general secretary (party leader), the top leadership of the country [193] The general secretary holds ultimate power and authority over party and state and serves as the informal paramount leader [194] The current general secretary is Xi Jinping, who took office on 15 November 2012 [195] At the local level, the secretary of the CCP committee of a subdivision outranks the local government level; CCP committee secretary of a provincial division outranks the governor while the CCP committee secretary of a city outranks the mayor [196]\n\n\nGovernment\n World portal\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe PRC is constitutionally a unitary state divided into 23 provinces, [t] five autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), and four direct-administered municipalities—collectively referred to as \"mainland China\"—as well as the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau [204] The PRC regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province, although all these territories are governed by the Republic of China (ROC) [205] [33] Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China, East China, Southwestern China, Northwestern China, South Central China, and Northeast China [206]\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe PRC has diplomatic relations with 179 United Nation members states and maintains embassies in 174 As of 2024 [update], China has one of the largest diplomatic networks of any country in the world [207] In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China (ROC) as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council [208] It is a member of intergovernmental organizations including the G20, [209] the SCO, [210] the BRICS, [211] the East Asia Summit, [212] and the APEC [213] China was also a former member and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries [214]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) is considered one of the world's most powerful militaries and has rapidly modernized in the recent decades [242] It has also been accused of technology theft by some countries [243] [244] [245] Since 2024, it consists of four services: the Ground Force (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF) and the Rocket Force (PLARF) It also has four independent arms: the Aerospace Force, the Cyberspace Force, the Information Support Force, and the Joint Logistics Support Force, the first three of which were split from the disbanded Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) [246] Its nearly 2.2 million active duty personnel is the largest in the world The PLA holds the world's third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, [247] [248] and the world's second-largest navy by tonnage [249] China's official military budget for 2023 totalled US$224 billion (1.55 trillion Yuan), the second-largest in the world, though SIPRI estimates that its real expenditure that year was US$296 billion, making up 12% of global military spending and accounting for 1.7% of the country's GDP [250] According to SIPRI, its military spending from 2012 to 2021 averaged US$215 billion per year or 1.7 per cent of GDP, behind only the United States at US$734 billion per year or 3.6 per cent of GDP [251] The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the party and the state; though officially two separate organizations, the two CMCs have identical membership except during leadership transition periods and effectively function as one organization The chairman of the CMC is the commander-in-chief of the PLA [252]\n\n\nSociopolitical issues and human rights\nThe situation of human rights in China has attracted significant criticism from foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and non-governmental organizations, alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial, forced confessions, torture, restrictions of fundamental rights, and excessive use of the death penalty [190] [253] Since its inception, Freedom House has ranked China as \"not free\" in its Freedom in the World survey, [190] while Amnesty International has documented significant human rights abuses [253] The Chinese constitution states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state [254] [255] China has limited protections regarding LGBT rights [256]\n\n\nPublic views of government\nPolitical concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption [276] Nonetheless, international surveys show the Chinese public have a high level of satisfaction with their government [201]: 137  These views are generally attributed to the material comforts and security available to large segments of the Chinese populace as well as the government's attentiveness and responsiveness [201] : 136  According to the World Values Survey (2022), 91% of Chinese respondents have significant confidence in their government [201]: 13  A Harvard University survey published in July 2020 found that citizen satisfaction with the government had increased since 2003, also rating China's government as more effective and capable than ever in the survey's history [277]\n\n\nEconomy\nChina has the world's second-largest economy in terms of nominal GDP, [278] and the world's largest in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) [279] As of 2022 [update], China accounts for around 18% of the global economy by nominal GDP [280] China is one of the world's fastest-growing major economies, [281] with its economic growth having been almost consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978 [282] According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $17.96 trillion by 2022 [283] It ranks at 64th at nominal GDP per capita, making it an upper-middle income country [284] Of the world's 500 largest companies, 135 are headquartered in China [285] As of at least 2024, China has the world's second-largest equity markets and futures markets, as well as the third-largest bond market [286]: 153 \n\n\nTourism\nChina received 65.7 million international visitors in 2019, [306] and in 2018 was the fourth-most-visited country in the world [306] It also experiences an enormous volume of domestic tourism; Chinese tourists made an estimated 6 billion travels within the country in 2019 [307] China hosts the world's second-largest number of World Heritage Sites (56) after Italy, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations (first in the Asia-Pacific).\n\n\nWealth\nChina accounted for 17.9% of the world's total wealth in 2021, second highest in the world after the U.S [308] China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history [309] [310]—between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million [201]: 23  From 1990 to 2018, the proportion of the Chinese population living with an income of less than $1.90 per day (2011 PPP) decreased from 66.3% to 0.3%, the share living with an income of less than $3.20 per day from 90.0% to 2.9%, and the share living with an income of less than $5.50 per day decreased from 98.3% to 17.0% [311]\n\n\nChina in the global economy\nChina has been a member of the WTO since 2001 and is the world's largest trading power [324] By 2016, China was the largest trading partner of 124 countries [325] China became the world's largest trading nation in 2013 by the sum of imports and exports, as well as the world's largest commodity importer, accounting for roughly 45% of maritime's dry-bulk market [326] [327]\n\n\nScience and technology\nChina was a world leader in science and technology until the Ming dynasty [341] Ancient and medieval Chinese discoveries and inventions, such as papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder (the Four Great Inventions), became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later Europe Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers [342] [343] By the 17th century, the Western World surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement [344] The causes of this early modern Great Divergence continue to be debated by scholars [345]\n\n\nHistorical\nChina was a world leader in

scientific and technological advancement [344] The causes of this early modern Great Divergence continue to be debated by scholars [345]\n\n\nModern era\nSince the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research [349] and is quickly catching up with the U.S in R&D spending [350] [351] China officially spent around 2.6% of its GDP on R&D in 2023, totaling to around $458.5 billion [352] According to the World Intellectual Property Indicators, China received more applications than the U.S did in 2018 and 2019 and ranked first globally in patents, utility models, trademarks, industrial designs, and creative goods exports in 2021 [353] [354] [355] It was ranked 11th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, a considerable improvement from its rank of 35th in 2013 [356] [357] [358] Chinese supercomputers ranked among the fastest in the world [359] [u] Its efforts to develop the most advanced semiconductors and jet engines have seen delays and setbacks [360] [361]\n\n\nSpace program\nThe Chinese space program started in 1958 with some technology transfers from the Soviet Union However, it did not launch the nation's first satellite until 1970 with the Dong Fang Hong I, which made China the fifth country to do so independently [368]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nAfter a decades-long infrastructural boom, [387] China has produced numerous world-leading infrastructural projects: it has the largest high-speed rail network, [388] the most supertall skyscrapers, [389] the largest power plant (the Three Gorges Dam), [390] and a global satellite navigation system with the largest number of satellites [391]\n\n\nTelecommunications\nChina is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country, with over 1.7 billion subscribers, as of February 2023 [update] It has the largest number of internet and broadband users, with over 1.09 billion Internet users as of December 2023 [update] [392]—equivalent to around 77.5% of its population [393] By 2018, China had more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of world's total [394] China is making rapid advances in 5G—by late 2018, China had started large-scale and commercial 5G trials [395] As of December 2023 [update], China had over 810 million 5G users and 3.38 million base stations installed [396]\n\n\nTransport\nSince the late 1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of national highways and expressways In 2022, China's highways had reached a total length of 177,000 km (110,000 mi), making it the longest highway system in the world [403] China has the world's largest market for automobiles, [404] [405] having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and production The country is the world's largest exporter of cars by number as of 2023 [406] [407] A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents [408] In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles – as of 2023 [update], there are approximately 200 million bicycles in China [409]\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nWater supply and sanitation infrastructure in China is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization, as well as water scarcity, contamination, and pollution [424] According to the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to improved sanitation in 2015 [425] [needs update] The ongoing South–North Water Transfer Project intends to abate water shortage in the north [426]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2020 Chinese census recorded the population as approximately 1,411,778,724 About 17.95% were 14 years old or younger, 63.35% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 18.7% were over 60 years old [427] Between 2010 and 2020, the average population growth rate was 0.53% [427]\n\n\nUrbanization\nChina has urbanized significantly in recent decades The percent of the country's population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1980 to over 66% in 2023 [443] [444] [445] China has over 160 cities with a population of over one million, [446] including the 17 megacities as of 2021 [update] [447] [448] (cities with a population of over 10 million) of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Xi'an, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Linyi, Shijiazhuang, Dongguan, Qingdao and Changsha [449] The total permanent population of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu is above 20 million [450] Shanghai is China's most populous urban area [451] [452] while Chongqing is its largest city proper, the only city in China with a permanent population of over 30 million [453] The figures in the table below are from the 2020 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists for total municipal populations The large \"floating populations\" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult; [454] the figures below include only long-term residents.\n\n\nEthnic groups\nChina legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who comprise the Zhonghua minzu The largest of these nationalities are the Han Chinese, who constitute more than 91% of the total population [427] The Han Chinese – the world's largest single ethnic group [458] – outnumber other ethnic groups in every place excluding Tibet, Xinjiang, [459] Linxia, [460] and autonomous prefectures like Xishuangbanna [461] Ethnic minorities account for less than 10% of the population of China, according to the 2020 census [427] Compared with the 2010 population census, the Han population increased by 60,378,693 persons, or 4.93%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 11,675,179 persons, or 10.26% [427] The 2020 census recorded a total of 845,697 foreign nationals living in mainland China [462]\n\n\nLanguages\nThere are as many as 292 living languages in China [463] The languages most commonly spoken belong to the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family, which contains Mandarin (spoken by 80% of the population), [464] [465] and other varieties of Chinese language: Jin, Wu, Min, Hakka, Yue, Xiang, Gan, Hui, Ping and unclassified Tuhua (Shaozhou Tuhua and Xiangnan Tuhua) [466] Languages of the Tibeto-Burman branch, including Tibetan, Qiang, Naxi and Yi, are spoken across the Tibetan and Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau Other ethnic minority languages in southwestern China include Zhuang, Thai, Dong and Sui of the Tai-Kadai family, Miao and Yao of the Hmong–Mien family, and Wa of the Austroasiatic family Across northeastern and northwestern China, local ethnic groups speak Altaic languages including Manchu, Mongolian and several Turkic languages: Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Salar and Western Yugur [467] [468] Korean is spoken natively along the border with North Korea Sarikoli, the language of Tajiks in western Xinjiang, is an Indo-European language Taiwanese indigenous peoples, including a small population on the mainland, speak Austronesian languages [469]\n\n\nReligion\nFreedom of religion is guaranteed by China's constitution (Chapter 2, Article 36), although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution [184] The government of the country is officially atheist Religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the National Religious Affairs Administration, under the United Front Work Department [478]\n\n\nEducation\nCompulsory education in China comprises primary and junior secondary school, which together last for nine years from the age of 6 and 15 [494] The Gaokao, China's national university entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level [495] More than 10 million Chinese students graduated from vocational colleges every year [496] In 2023, about 91.8 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior secondary school, while 60.2 percent of secondary school graduates were enrolled in higher education [497]\n\n\nHealth\nThe National Health Commission, together with its counterparts in the local commissions, oversees the health needs of the population [513] An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s The Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and scarlet fever, which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign [514]\n\n\nCulture and society\nSince ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism Chinese culture, in turn, has heavily influenced East Asia and Southeast Asia [535] For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations, which have their origins in the Han dynasty [536] The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective [537] Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today [538]\n\n\nArchitecture\nChinese architecture has developed over millennia in China and has remained a vestigial source of perennial influence on the development of East Asian architecture, [544] [545] [546] including in Japan, Korea, and Mongolia [547] and minor influences on the architecture of Southeast and South Asia including the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines [548] [549]\n\n\nLiterature\nChinese literature has its roots in the Zhou dynasty's literary tradition [553] The classical texts of China encompass a wide range of thoughts and subjects, such as the calendar, military, astrology, herbology, and geography, as well as many others [554] Among the most significant early works are the I Ching and the Shujing, which are part of the Four Books and Five Classics These texts were the cornerstone of the Confucian curriculum sponsored by the state throughout the dynastic periods Inherited from the Classic of Poetry, classical Chinese poetry developed to its floruit during the Tang dynasty Li Bai and Du Fu opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively Chinese historiography began with the Shiji, the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty-Four Histories, which set a vast stage for Chinese fictions along with Chinese mythology and folklore [555] Pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the Ming dynasty, Chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical, town and gods and demons fictions as represented by the Four Great Classical Novels which include Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber [556] Along with the wuxia fictions of Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng, [557] it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the Chinese sphere of influence [558]\n\n\nMusic\nChinese music covers a highly diverse range of music from traditional music to modern music Chinese music dates back before the pre-imperial times Traditional Chinese musical instruments were traditionally grouped into eight categories known as bayin (八音) Traditional Chinese opera is a form of musical theatre in China originating thousands of years and has regional style forms such as Beijing and Cantonese opera [562] Chinese pop (C-Pop) includes mandopop and cantopop Chinese hip hop and Hong Kong hip hop have become popular [563]\n\n\nFashion\nHanfu is the historical clothing of the Han people in China The qipao or cheongsam is a popular Chinese female dress [564] The hanfu movement has been popular in contemporary times and seeks to revitalize Hanfu clothing [565] China Fashion Week is the country's only national-level fashion festival [566]\n\n\nCinema\nCinema was first introduced to China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, Dingjun Mountain, was released in 1905 [567] China has the largest number of movie screens in the world since 2016; [568] China became the largest cinema market in 2020 [569] [570] The top three highest-grossing films in China as of 2023 [update] were The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021), Wolf Warrior 2 (2017), and Hi, Mom (2021) [571]\n\n\nCuisine\nChinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the \"Eight Major Cuisines\", including Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang cuisines [572] Chinese cuisine is known for its breadth of cooking methods and ingredients [573] China's staple food is rice in the northeast and south, and wheat-based breads and noodles in the north Bean products such as tofu and soy milk remain a popular source of protein Pork is now the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption [574] There is also the vegetarian Buddhist cuisine and the pork-free Chinese Islamic cuisine Chinese cuisine, due to the area's proximity to the ocean and milder climate, has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables Offshoots of Chinese food, such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese cuisine, have emerged in the Chinese diaspora.\n\n\nSports\nChina has one of the oldest sporting cultures There is evidence that archery (shèjiàn) was practiced during the Western Zhou dynasty Swordplay (jiànshù) and cuju, a sport loosely related to association football [575] date back to China's early dynasties as well [576]\n\n\nSee also\n This article incorporates text from a free content work Licensed

"en", "article": "China is a country with a rich and diverse history, covering a vast territory of approximately 9.6 million square kilometers. Its landscape varies greatly, from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the north to the subtropical forests in the south. The Himalayas, Karakoram, Pamir, and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century. Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word Cīna, used in ancient India. The earliest known attestation of the word \"China\" was in Richard Eden's 1555 translation of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa. Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian Chīn, which in turn derived from Sanskrit Cīna.\n\n**History**\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China 2.25 million years ago. The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a Homo erectus who used fire, have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago. Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 6600 BCE, at Damaidi around 6000 BCE, Dadiwan from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE.\n\n**Early Dynasties**\n\nAccording to traditional Chinese historiography, the Xia dynasty was established during the late 3rd millennium BCE, marking the beginning of the dynastic cycle that was understood to underpin China's entire political history. However, the historicity of the Xia has been increasingly scrutinized, in part due to the earliest known attestation of the Xia being written millennia after the date given for their collapse. In 1958, archaeologists discovered sites belonging to the Erlitou culture that existed during the early Bronze Age, which have since been characterized as the remains of the historical Xia.\n\n**Imperial China**\n\nThe Shang dynasty, which traditionally succeeded the Xia, is the earliest for which there are both contemporary written records and undisputed archaeological evidence. The Shang ruled much of the Yellow River valley until the 11th century BCE, with the earliest hard evidence dated c. 1300 BCE. The oracle bone script, attested from c. 1250 BCE but generally assumed to be considerably older, represents the oldest known form of written Chinese.\n\n**Pre-Modern China**\n\nThe Qin dynasty, which lasted only fifteen years after the First Emperor's death, was the first to establish a unified China. The Qin standardized Chinese characters, measurements, road widths, and currency, and conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam. The Han dynasty, which followed the Qin, is often considered the golden age of Chinese history, with significant advancements in science, culture, and politics.\n\n**Modern China**\n\nThe Ming dynasty was overthrown by the Qing dynasty, which was established by the Manchu people. The Qing dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of China and lasted for nearly three centuries. The Qing was followed by the Republic of China, which was established in 1912. The Republic of China was overthrown by the Communist Party of China in 1949, and the People's Republic of China was established.\n\n**Contemporary China**\n\nToday, China is the world's second-largest economy, with a large and growing middle class.

about \"China\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century; however, it was not used by the Chinese themselves during this period Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word Cīna, used in ancient India [16] \"China\" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation [m] of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa [n] [16] Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian Chīn (چین), which in turn derived from Sanskrit Cīna (चीन) [21] Cīna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mahabharata (5th century BCE) and the Laws of Manu (2nd century BCE) [22] In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) [23] [22] Although use in Indian sources precedes this dynasty, this derivation is still given in various sources [24] The origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate [16] Alternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state [22] [25]\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China 2.25 million years ago [34] The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a Homo erectus who used fire, [35] have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago [36] The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave [37] Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 6600 BCE, [38] at Damaidi around 6000 BCE, [39] Dadiwan from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system [38]\n\n\nPrehistory\nArchaeological evidence suggests that

system [38]\n\n\nEarly dynastic rule\nAccording to traditional Chinese historiography, the Xia dynasty was established during the late 3rd millennium BCE, marking the beginning of the dynastic cycle that was understood to underpin China's entire political history In the modern era, the Xia's historicity came under increasing scrutiny, in part due to the earliest known attestation of the Xia being written millennia after the date given for their collapse In 1958, archaeologists discovered sites belonging to the Erlitou culture that existed during the early Bronze Age; they have since been characterized as the remains of the historical Xia, but this conception is often rejected [40] [41] [42] The Shang dynasty that traditionally succeeded the Xia is the earliest for which there are both contemporary written records and undisputed archaeological evidence [43] The Shang ruled much of the Yellow River valley until the 11th century BCE, with the earliest hard evidence dated c. 1300 BCE [44] The oracle bone script, attested from c. 1250 BCE but generally assumed to be considerably older, [45] [46] represents the oldest known form of written Chinese, [47] and is the direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters [48]\n\n\nImperial China\nThe Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six states, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the Emperor of the Qin dynasty, becoming the first emperor of a unified China He enacted Qin's legalist reforms, notably the standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths, and currency His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam [50] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death [51] [52]\n\n\nQin and Han\nThe Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six states, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the Emperor of the Qin dynasty, becoming the first emperor of a unified China He enacted Qin's legalist reforms, notably the standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths, and currency His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam [50] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death [51] [52]\n\n\nThree Kingdoms, Jin, Northern and Southern dynasties\nAfter the end of the Han dynasty, a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed, at the end of which Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor; the Five Barbarians then rebelled and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei, whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects In the south, the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581 [citation needed]\n\n\nSui, Tang and Song\nThe Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and imperial examination system, constructed the Grand Canal, and patronized Buddhism However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern Korea provoked widespread unrest [56] [57]\nUnder the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties, Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age [58] The Tang dynasty retained control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road, [59] which brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa, [60] and made the capital Chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan rebellion in the 8th century [61] In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and the Liao dynasty The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade [62]\n\n\nYuan\nThe Mongol conquest of China began in 1205 with the campaigns against Western Xia by Genghis Khan, [66] who also invaded Jin territories [67] In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty, which conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279 Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300 [68] A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa [69]\n\n\nMing\nIn the early Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations [70] The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and Later Jin incursions led to an exhausted treasury [71] In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty [72]\n\n\nQing\nThe Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China The Ming-Qing transition (1618–1683) cost 25 million lives, but the Qing appeared to have restored China's imperial power and inaugurated another flowering of the arts [73] After the Southern Ming ended, the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire [74] Meanwhile, China's population growth resumed and shortly began to accelerate It is commonly agreed that pre-modern China's population experienced two growth spurts, one during the Northern Song period (960–1127), and other during the Qing period (around 1700–1830) [75] By the High Qing era China was possibly the most commercialized country in the world, and imperial China experienced a second commercial revolution by the end of the 18th century [76] On the other hand, the centralized autocracy was strengthened in part to suppress anti-Qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, like the Haijin during the early Qing period and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition, causing some social and technological stagnation [77] [78]\n\n\nFall of the Qing dynasty\nIn the mid-19th century, the Opium Wars with Britain and France forced China to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals, and cede Hong Kong to the British [79] under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, the first of what have been termed as the \"unequal treaties\" The First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula, as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan [80] The Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the White Lotus Rebellion, the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) in the northwest The initial success of the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s [81]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Republic and World War II\nOn 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (KMT) was proclaimed provisional president [85] In March 1912, the presidency was given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic in 1916 [86] After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory [87] [88] During this period, China participated in World War I and saw a far-reaching popular uprising (the May Fourth Movement) [89]\n\n\nPeople's Republic\nChina emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China [101] Afterwards, the CCP took control of most of mainland China, and the ROC government retreated offshore to Taiwan.\n\n\nReforms and contemporary history\nAfter Mao's death, the Gang of Four was arrested by Hua Guofeng and held responsible for the Cultural Revolution The Cultural Revolution was rebuked, with millions rehabilitated Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, and instituted large-scale political and economic reforms, together with the \"Eight Elders\", most senior and influential members of the party The government loosened its control and the communes were gradually disbanded [114] Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized While foreign trade became a major focus, special economic zones (SEZs) were created Inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were restructured and some closed This marked China's transition away from planned economy [115] China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982 [116]\n\n\nGeography\nChina's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 km (9,000 mi) long and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe.\n\n\nClimate\nChina's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons, which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist [132]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nChina is one of 17 megadiverse countries, [142] lying in two of the world's major biogeographic realms: the Palearctic and the Indomalayan By one measure, China has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world, after Brazil and Colombia [143] The country is a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity; [144] its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan was received by the convention in 2010 [145]\n\n\nEnvironment\nIn the early 2000s, China has suffered from environmental deterioration and pollution due to its rapid pace of industrialization [158] [159] Regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, though they are poorly enforced, frequently disregarded in favor of rapid economic development [160] China has the second-highest death toll because of air pollution, after India, with approximately 1 million deaths [161] [162] Although China ranks as the highest CO2 emitting country, [163] it only emits 8 tons of CO2 per capita, significantly lower than developed countries such as the United States (16.1), Australia (16.8) and South Korea (13.6) [164] Greenhouse gas emissions by China are the world's largest [164] The country has significant water pollution problems; only 89.4% of China's national surface water was graded suitable for human consumption by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in 2023 [165]\n\n\nPolitical geography\nChina is the third-largest country in the world by land area after Russia, and the third- or fourth-largest country in the world by total area [r] China's total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000 km2 (3,700,000 sq mi) [174] Specific area figures range from 9,572,900 km2 (3,696,100 sq mi) according to the Encyclopædia Britannica, [14] to 9,596,961 km2 (3,705,407 sq mi) according to the UN Demographic Yearbook, [6] and The World Factbook [5]\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe People's Republic of China is a one-party state governed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) The CCP is officially guided by socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is Marxism adapted to Chinese circumstances [183] The Chinese constitution states that the PRC \"is a socialist state governed by a people's democratic dictatorship that is led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants,\" that the state institutions \"shall practice the principle of democratic centralism,\" [184] and that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.\" [185]\n\n\nChinese Communist Party\nAccording to the CCP constitution, its highest body is the National Congress held every five years [193] The National Congress elects the Central Committee, who then elects the party's Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee and the general secretary (party leader), the top leadership of the country [193] The general secretary holds ultimate power and authority over party and state and serves as the informal paramount leader [194] The current general secretary is Xi Jinping, who took office on 15 November 2012 [195] At the local level, the secretary of the CCP committee of a subdivision outranks the local government level; CCP committee secretary of a provincial division outranks the governor while the CCP committee secretary of a city outranks the mayor [196]\n\n\nGovernment\n World portal\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe PRC is constitutionally a unitary state divided into 23 provinces, [t] five autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), and four direct-administered municipalities—collectively referred to as \"mainland China\"—as well as the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau [204] The PRC regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province, although all these territories are governed by the Republic of China (ROC) [205] [33] Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China, East China, Southwestern China, Northwestern China, South Central China, and Northeast China [206]\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe PRC has diplomatic relations with 179 United Nation members states and maintains embassies in 174 As of 2024 [update], China has one of the largest diplomatic networks of any country in the world [207] In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China (ROC) as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council [208] It is a member of intergovernmental organizations including the G20, [209] the SCO, [210] the BRICS, [211] the East Asia Summit, [212] and the APEC [213] China was also a former member and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries [214]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) is considered one of the world's most powerful militaries and has rapidly modernized in the recent decades [242] It has also been accused of technology theft by some countries [243] [244] [245] Since 2024, it consists of four services: the Ground Force (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF) and the Rocket Force (PLARF) It also has four independent arms: the Aerospace Force, the Cyberspace Force, the Information Support Force, and the Joint Logistics Support Force, the first three of which were split from the disbanded Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) [246] Its nearly 2.2 million active duty personnel is the largest in the world The PLA holds the world's third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, [247] [248] and the world's second-largest navy by tonnage [249] China's official military budget for 2023 totalled US$224 billion (1.55 trillion Yuan), the second-largest in the world, though SIPRI estimates that its real expenditure that year was US$296 billion, making up 12% of global military spending and accounting for 1.7% of the country's GDP [250] According to SIPRI, its military spending from 2012 to 2021 averaged US$215 billion per year or 1.7 per cent of GDP, behind only the United States at US$734 billion per year or 3.6 per cent of GDP [251] The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the party and the state; though officially two separate organizations, the two CMCs have identical membership except during leadership transition periods and effectively function as one organization The chairman of the CMC is the commander-in-chief of the PLA [252]\n\n\nSociopolitical issues and human rights\nThe situation of human rights in China has attracted significant criticism from foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and non-governmental organizations, alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial, forced confessions, torture, restrictions of fundamental rights, and excessive use of the death penalty [190] [253] Since its inception, Freedom House has ranked China as \"not free\" in its Freedom in the World survey, [190] while Amnesty International has documented significant human rights abuses [253] The Chinese constitution states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state [254] [255] China has limited protections regarding LGBT rights [256]\n\n\nPublic views of government\nPolitical concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption [276] Nonetheless, international surveys show the Chinese public have a high level of satisfaction with their government [201]: 137  These views are generally attributed to the material comforts and security available to large segments of the Chinese populace as well as the government's attentiveness and responsiveness [201] : 136  According to the World Values Survey (2022), 91% of Chinese respondents have significant confidence in their government [201]: 13  A Harvard University survey published in July 2020 found that citizen satisfaction with the government had increased since 2003, also rating China's government as more effective and capable than ever in the survey's history [277]\n\n\nEconomy\nChina has the world's second-largest economy in terms of nominal GDP, [278] and the world's largest in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) [279] As of 2022 [update], China accounts for around 18% of the global economy by nominal GDP [280] China is one of the world's fastest-growing major economies, [281] with its economic growth having been almost consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978 [282] According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $17.96 trillion by 2022 [283] It ranks at 64th at nominal GDP per capita, making it an upper-middle income country [284] Of the world's 500 largest companies, 135 are headquartered in China [285] As of at least 2024, China has the world's second-largest equity markets and futures markets, as well as the third-largest bond market [286]: 153 \n\n\nTourism\nChina received 65.7 million international visitors in 2019, [306] and in 2018 was the fourth-most-visited country in the world [306] It also experiences an enormous volume of domestic tourism; Chinese tourists made an estimated 6 billion travels within the country in 2019 [307] China hosts the world's second-largest number of World Heritage Sites (56) after Italy, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations (first in the Asia-Pacific).\n\n\nWealth\nChina accounted for 17.9% of the world's total wealth in 2021, second highest in the world after the U.S [308] China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history [309] [310]—between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million [201]: 23  From 1990 to 2018, the proportion of the Chinese population living with an income of less than $1.90 per day (2011 PPP) decreased from 66.3% to 0.3%, the share living with an income of less than $3.20 per day from 90.0% to 2.9%, and the share living with an income of less than $5.50 per day decreased from 98.3% to 17.0% [311]\n\n\nChina in the global economy\nChina has been a member of the WTO since 2001 and is the world's largest trading power [324] By 2016, China was the largest trading partner of 124 countries [325] China became the world's largest trading nation in 2013 by the sum of imports and exports, as well as the world's largest commodity importer, accounting for roughly 45% of maritime's dry-bulk market [326] [327]\n\n\nScience and technology\nChina was a world leader in science and technology until the Ming dynasty [341] Ancient and medieval Chinese discoveries and inventions, such as papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder (the Four Great Inventions), became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later Europe Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers [342] [343] By the 17th century, the Western World surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement [344] The causes of this early modern Great Divergence continue to be debated by scholars [345]\n\n\nHistorical\nChina was a world leader in

China has made significant investments in scientific research [349] and is quickly catching up with the U.S in R&D spending [350] [351] China officially spent around 2.6% of its GDP on R&D in 2023, totaling to around $458.5 billion [352] According to the World Intellectual Property Indicators, China received more applications than the U.S did in 2018 and 2019 and ranked first globally in patents, utility models, trademarks, industrial designs, and creative goods exports in 2021 [353] [354] [355] It was ranked 11th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, a considerable improvement from its rank of 35th in 2013 [356] [357] [358] Chinese supercomputers ranked among the fastest in the world [359] [u] Its efforts to develop the most advanced semiconductors and jet engines have seen delays and setbacks [360] [361]\n\n\nSpace program\nThe Chinese space program started in 1958 with some technology transfers from the Soviet Union However, it did not launch the nation's first satellite until 1970 with the Dong Fang Hong I, which made China the fifth country to do so independently [368]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nAfter a decades-long infrastructural boom, [387] China has produced numerous world-leading infrastructural projects: it has the largest high-speed rail network, [388] the most supertall skyscrapers, [389] the largest power plant (the Three Gorges Dam), [390] and a global satellite navigation system with the largest number of satellites [391]\n\n\nTelecommunications\nChina is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country, with over 1.7 billion subscribers, as of February 2023 [update] It has the largest number of internet and broadband users, with over 1.09 billion Internet users as of December 2023 [update] [392]—equivalent to around 77.5% of its population [393] By 2018, China had more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of world's total [394] China is making rapid advances in 5G—by late 2018, China had started large-scale and commercial 5G trials [395] As of December 2023 [update], China had over 810 million 5G users and 3.38 million base stations installed [396]\n\n\nTransport\nSince the late 1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of national highways and expressways In 2022, China's highways had reached a total length of 177,000 km (110,000 mi), making it the longest highway system in the world [403] China has the world's largest market for automobiles, [404] [405] having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and production The country is the world's largest exporter of cars by number as of 2023 [406] [407] A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents [408] In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles – as of 2023 [update], there are approximately 200 million bicycles in China [409]\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nWater supply and sanitation infrastructure in China is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization, as well as water scarcity, contamination, and pollution [424] According to the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to improved sanitation in 2015 [425] [needs update] The ongoing South–North Water Transfer Project intends to abate water shortage in the north [426]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2020 Chinese census recorded

[449] The total permanent population of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu is above 20 million [450] Shanghai is China's most populous urban area [451] [452] while Chongqing is its largest city proper, the only city in China with a permanent population of over 30 million [453] The figures in the table below are from the 2020 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists for total municipal populations The large \"floating populations\" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult; [454] the figures below include only long-term residents.\n\n\nEthnic groups\nChina legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who comprise the Zhonghua minzu The largest of these nationalities are the Han Chinese, who constitute more than 91% of the total population [427] The Han Chinese – the world's largest single ethnic group [458] – outnumber other ethnic groups in every place excluding Tibet, Xinjiang, [459] Linxia, [460] and autonomous prefectures like Xishuangbanna [461] Ethnic minorities account for less than 10% of the population of China, according to the 2020 census [427] Compared with the 2010 population census, the Han population increased by 60,378,693 persons, or 4.93%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 11,675,179 persons, or 10.26% [427] The 2020 census recorded a total of 845,697 foreign nationals living in mainland China [462]\n\n\nLanguages\nThere are as many as 292 living languages in China [463] The languages most commonly

National Health Commission, together with its counterparts in the local commissions, oversees the health needs of the population [513] An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s The Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and scarlet fever, which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign [514]\n\n\nCulture and society\nSince ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism Chinese culture, in turn, has heavily influenced East Asia and Southeast Asia [535] For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations, which have their origins in the Han dynasty [536] The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective [537] Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today [538]\n\n\nArchitecture\nChinese architecture has developed over millennia in China and has remained a vestigial source of perennial influence on the development of East Asian architecture, [544] [545] [546] including in Japan, Korea, and Mongolia [547] and minor influences on the architecture of Southeast and South Asia including the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines [548] [549]\n\n\nLiterature\nChinese literature has its roots in the Zhou dynasty's literary tradition [553] The classical texts of China encompass a wide range of thoughts and subjects, such as the calendar, military, astrology, herbology, and geography, as well as many others [554] Among the most significant early works are the I Ching and the Shujing, which are part of the Four Books and Five Classics These texts were the cornerstone of the Confucian curriculum sponsored by the state throughout the dynastic periods Inherited from the Classic of Poetry, classical Chinese poetry developed to its floruit during the Tang dynasty Li Bai and Du Fu opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively Chinese historiography began with the Shiji, the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty-Four Histories, which set a vast stage for Chinese fictions along with Chinese mythology and folklore [555] Pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the Ming dynasty, Chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical, town and gods and demons fictions as represented by the Four Great Classical Novels which include Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber [556] Along with the wuxia fictions of Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng, [557] it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the Chinese sphere of influence [558]\n\n\nMusic\nChinese music covers a highly diverse range of music from traditional music to modern music Chinese music dates back before the pre-imperial times Traditional Chinese musical instruments were traditionally grouped into eight categories known as bayin (八音) Traditional Chinese opera is a form of musical theatre in China originating thousands of years and has regional style forms such as Beijing and Cantonese opera [562] Chinese pop (C-Pop) includes mandopop and cantopop Chinese hip hop and Hong Kong hip hop have become popular [563]\n\n\nFashion\nHanfu is the historical clothing of the Han people in China The qipao or cheongsam is a popular Chinese female dress [564] The hanfu movement has been popular in contemporary times and seeks to revitalize Hanfu clothing [565] China Fashion Week is the country's only national-level fashion festival [566]\n\n\nCinema\nCinema was first introduced to China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, Dingjun Mountain, was released in 1905 [567] China has the largest number of movie screens in the world since 2016; [568] China became the largest cinema market in 2020 [569] [570] The top three highest-grossing films in China as of 2023 [update] were The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021), Wolf Warrior 2 (2017), and Hi, Mom (2021) [571]\n\n\nCuisine\nChinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the \"Eight Major Cuisines\", including Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang cuisines [572] Chinese cuisine is known for its breadth of cooking methods and ingredients [573] China's staple food is rice in the northeast and south, and wheat-based breads and noodles in the north Bean products such as tofu and soy milk remain a popular source of protein Pork is now the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption [574] There is also the vegetarian Buddhist cuisine and the pork-free Chinese Islamic cuisine Chinese cuisine, due to the area's proximity to the ocean and milder climate, has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables Offshoots of Chinese food, such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese cuisine, have emerged in the Chinese diaspora.\n\n\nSports\nChina has one of the oldest sporting cultures There is evidence that archery (shèjiàn) was practiced during the Western Zhou dynasty Swordplay (jiànshù)

{"title": "Rent_(musical)", "content": "\nConcept and genesis\nIn 1988, playwright Billy Aronson wanted to create \"a musical based on Puccini's La Bohème, in which the luscious splendor of Puccini's world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York.\" [5] In 1989, Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed together \"Santa Fe\", \"Splatter\" (later re-worked into the song \"Rent\"), and \"I Should Tell You\" Larson suggested setting the play \"amid poverty, homelessness, spunky gay life, drag queens and punk\" in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, which happened to be down the street from his Greenwich Village apartment He also came up with the show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that \"rent\" also means torn apart) In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make Rent his own Larson had ambitious expectations for Rent; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera \"to bring musical theater to the MTV generation\" [6] Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for \"original concept & additional lyrics\" [6]\n\n\nSources and inspiration\nLarson's inspiration for Rent's content came from several different sources Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera La Bohème, the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before Rent's premiere [9] La Bohème was also about the lives of poor young artists Tuberculosis, the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in Rent; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s The names and identities of Rent's characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations For example, Joanne in Rent represents the character of Alcindoro in Bohème, but is also partially based on Marcello Also, Joanne is the only Rent character whose predecessor in La Bohème is a different sex.\n\n\nLynn Thomson lawsuit\nLynn Thomson was a dramaturge who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework Rent She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a \"new version\" of the musical, and that she had a verbal agreement with Larson to a percentage of the royalties She sued Jonathan Larson's estate for $40 million and sought 16 percent of the show's royalties, ultimately losing that suit A revised suit claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the \"new version\" of Rent was filed later The estate settled out of court [19]\n\n\nSynopsis\nOn Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates—Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician—struggle to stay warm and produce their art (\"Tune Up #1\") Mark's mother

graduations or school holiday programs.\n\n\nRENT-heads\nRent gathered a following of fans who refer to themselves as \"RENT-heads\"  The name originally referred to people who would camp out at the Nederlander Theater for hours in advance for the discounted $20 rush tickets to each show, though it generally refers to anyone who is obsessed with the show [28]  These discounted tickets were for seats in the first two rows of the theater reserved for sale by lottery two hours prior to each show [28] [29]  Other Broadway shows have followed Rent's example and now also offer cheaper tickets in efforts to make Broadway theater accessible to people who would otherwise be unable to afford the ticket prices.\n\n\nPopular culture references\nThe film Team America: World Police includes a character who plays a lead role in Lease, a Broadway musical parody of Rent [30] In 2017, the song \"Out Tonight\" was covered by the characters Josie and the Pussycats in an episode of the television

written by Jonathan Larson, which premiered on February 13, 1996, at the New York Theatre Workshop. The show is a modern rock opera that explores the lives of a group of artists living in New York City's East Village in the late 1980s. The show's music and lyrics were written by Larson, with a book by him and others.\n\nConcept and Genesis\n\nIn 1988, playwright Billy Aronson wanted to create \"a musical based on Puccini's La Bohème, in which the luscious splendor of Puccini's world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York.\" Aronson began collaborating with Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, on this project. Larson began composing together with Aronson on \"Santa Fe\", \"Splatter\" (later re-worked into the song \"Rent\"), and \"I Should Tell You\". Larson suggested setting the play \"amid poverty, homelessness, spunky gay life, drag queens and punk\" in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, which happened to be down the street from his Greenwich Village apartment.\n\nSources and Inspiration\n\nLarson's inspiration for Rent's content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera La Bohème, the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before Rent's premiere. La Bohème was also about the lives of poor young artists. Tuberculosis, the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in Rent; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of Rent's characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations.\n\nLynn Thomson Lawsuit\n\nLynn Thomson was a dramaturge who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework Rent. She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a \"new version\" of the musical, and that she had a verbal agreement with Larson to a percentage of the royalties. Thomson sued Jonathan Larson's estate for $40 million and sought 16 percent of the show's royalties, ultimately losing that suit. A revised suit claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the \"new version\" of Rent was filed later. The estate settled out of court.\n\nSynopsis\n\nOn Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates—Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician—struggle to stay warm and produce their art (\"Tune Up #1\"). Mark's mother leaves him a voicemail wishing him a Merry Christmas and trying to comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him (\"Voice Mail #1\"). Their friend Tom Collins, a gay anarchist professor of computer-age philosophy at New York University, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger's former roommate and friend Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year's rent, before shutting down their electrical power (\"Tune Up #2\"). However, Mark and Roger stubbornly resolve against paying the rent, which they were promised would not be a problem (\"Rent\"). Meanwhile, Angel, a cross-dressing street drummer (presently out of drag), finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him (\"You Okay Honey?\") - the two are immediately attracted to each other, each learning that the other is HIV positive.\n\nAct I\n\nThe cast lines up to sing together before the plot of the second act begins, affirming that one should measure life \"in love\" (\"Seasons of Love\"). On New Year's Eve, Mark, Mimi, Roger, Maureen, Joanne, Collins and Angel gather to break back into Mark and Roger's apartment which they have been locked out of (\"Happy New Year\"). Once Mark, Joanne and Maureen break in through the window, a voicemail reveals that Mark's footage of the riot has earned him a job offering at a tabloid news company called Buzzline (\"Voice Mail #3\"). The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives, saying he wants to call a truce and revealing that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind. Mimi denies rekindling her relationship with Benny, but Roger is upset, and although they apologize to each other, Mimi goes to her drug dealer for a fix (\"Happy New Year B\").\n\nMusical Numbers\n\nAct 1\n\nRoles\n\nThere are also many other non-named roles such as Cops, Bohemians, Vendors, Homeless People.\n\nMain characters\n\nThere are also many other non-named roles such as Cops, Bohemians, Vendors, Homeless People.\n\nMinor characters\n\nThere are also many other non-named roles such as Cops, Bohemians, Vendors, Homeless People.\n\nReception\n\nRent received several awards including a Pulitzer Prize and four Tony Awards.\n\nCultural Impact and Legacy\n\nThe song \"Seasons of Love\" became a successful pop song and often is performed on its own.

at least until Larson pointed out that \"rent\" also means torn apart) In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make Rent his own Larson had ambitious expectations for Rent; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera \"to bring musical theater to the MTV generation\" [6] Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in

[77] according to Pawel, Huerta became his \"indispensable, lifelong ally\" [78] Other key supporters of his project were the Reverend Jim Drake and other members of the California Migrant Ministry; although as a Roman Catholic Chavez was initially suspicious of these Protestant preachers, he came to view them as key allies [79]\n\n\nDelano Grape Strike\nIn September 1965, Filipino American farm workers, organized by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), initiated the Delano grape strike to protest for higher wages Chavez and his largely Mexican American supporters voted to support them [95] The strike covered an area of over 400 square miles (1,000 km2); [96] Chavez divided the picketers among four quadrants, each with a mobile crew led by a captain [97] As the picketers urged those who continued to work to join them on strike, the growers sought to provoke and threaten the strikers Chavez insisted that the strikers must never respond with violence [98] The picketers also protested outside strike-breakers' homes, [99] with the strike dividing many families and breaking friendships [100] Police monitored the protests, photographing many of those involved; [101] they also arrested various strikers [102] To raise support for those arrested, Chavez called for donations at a speech in Berkeley's Sproul Plaza in October; he received over $1,000 [103] Many growers considered Chavez a communist, [104] and the FBI launched an investigation into both him and the NFWA [105]\n\n\nStart of the Delano Grape Strike: 1965–1966\nIn September 1965, Filipino American farm workers, organized by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), initiated the Delano grape strike to protest for higher wages Chavez and his largely Mexican American supporters voted to support them [95] The strike covered an area of over 400 square miles (1,000 km2);

VIVA LA CAUSA!\n\n\nForty Acres and public fasts: 1967–1968\nThe union purchased land known as The Forty Acres for their new headquarters [141] Chavez hoped for it to be a \"spiritual\" center where union members would relax; he designed it to have a swimming pool, a chapel, a market, and a gas station, as well as gardens with outdoor sculptures [145] He wanted the main building to be decorated inside with Gandhi quotations in English and Spanish [145] Meanwhile, Chavez was increasingly concerned that his supporters might turn to violence [146] Members had engaged in the destruction of property, something they regarded as not breaching the movement's ethos on non-violence [147] Chavez's cousin Manuel had tampered with refrigerator units on trains, so that grapes being shipped out of Delano spoiled before reaching their destination; [147] Chavez noted that \"He's done all the dirty work for the union There's a lot of fucking dirty work, and he did it all.\" [147] In February 1968, the Giumarra company obtained a contempt citation against the union, claiming that its members had used threatening and intimidating behavior against its employees and had placed roofing nails at the entrances to its ranches [148]\n\n\nEnd of the Grape Strike: 1969–1970\nIn March 1969, the doctor Janet Travell visited Chavez and determined that fused vertebrae were the source of his back pain She prescribed various exercises and other treatments which he found eased his pain [173] Between September and December, Chavez traveled the country in a Winnebago speaking at dozens of fundraisers and rallies for the grape boycott [174] At a speech in Washington D.C., he came out publicly against U.S involvement in the Vietnam War, a topic he had previously avoided speaking on, because his son Fernando had been arrested as a conscientious objector [175]\n\n\nLater activism\nIn July 1970, the Grower-Shipper Association representing lettuce growing companies in California's Salinas Valley renegotiated its contracts with the Teamsters, allowing the latter union to represent their employees [183] Chavez was angry at this, traveling to Salinas to talk with the lettuce cutters, many of whom were dissatisfied with the way that the Teamsters represented them [184] In August, thousands of cutters marched into Salinas, converging at Hartnell College where Chavez addressed them [185] Rallying against the Teamsters, he emphasized that their union was run by white people, in contrast to the largely non-white makeup of the lettuce cutters [186] There, the cutters voted to go on strike [185] Over the coming days, many of them joined the UFW [185] Chavez decided that the strike should initially target the valley's largest lettuce grower, Interharvest, which was owned by the United Fruit Company [185] Seeking to avoid industrial action, the Teamsters set up a meeting with Chavez, where they eventually reached an agreement The Teamsters agreed to relinquish their contracts with the Grower-Shipper Association, opening the way for the Salinas lettuce cutters to choose the UFW as their representative [187]\n\n\nSalinas Lettuce Strike: 1970–1971\nIn July 1970, the Grower-Shipper Association representing lettuce growing companies in California's Salinas Valley renegotiated its contracts with the Teamsters, allowing the latter union to represent their employees [183] Chavez was angry at this, traveling to Salinas to talk with the lettuce cutters, many of whom were dissatisfied with the way that the Teamsters represented them [184] In August, thousands of cutters marched into Salinas, converging at Hartnell College where Chavez addressed them [185] Rallying against the Teamsters, he emphasized that their union was run by white people, in contrast to the largely non-white makeup of the lettuce cutters [186] There, the cutters voted to go on strike [185] Over the coming days, many of them joined the UFW [185] Chavez decided that the strike should initially target the valley's largest lettuce grower, Interharvest, which was owned by the United Fruit Company [185] Seeking to avoid industrial action, the Teamsters set up a meeting with Chavez, where they eventually reached an agreement The Teamsters agreed to relinquish their contracts with the Grower-Shipper Association, opening the way for the Salinas lettuce cutters to choose the UFW as their representative [187]\n\n\nExpanding beyond California: 1972\nArizona became the first state to pass a bill that was designed to keep the UFW out of their state; this would criminalize boycotts and make union elections among farm-workers almost impossible [209] In response, Chavez drove to Arizona and demanded a meeting with Governor Jack Williams, who refused [210] They subsequently launched a campaign to gain a recall election to remove Williams from office [211] This started the UFW's first major farm-worker campaign outside California [212] Farmworkers rallied outside Williams' office while Chavez embarked on a fast in the Santa Rita Center, a hall used by a local Chicano group [213] [214] On the nineteenth day of his fast, Chavez was hospitalized [215] He then broke the fast at a memorial Mass on the anniversary of Robert Kennedy's death, where he was joined by the folk singer Joan Baez [216] It was during the Arizona campaign that the UFW started using the slogan \"Si Se Puede\" (\"It Can be Done\"), which subsequently became closely associated with it [217]\n\n\nImmigration and legislative campaigns: 1973–1975\nIn September 1973, the UFW's first constitutional convention was held in Fresno, representing the final step in the organization becoming a full union [240] A new constitution was announced that gave the group's president, a post occupied by Chavez, significant powers; he feared that greater democracy would paralyze the group [241] At the convention, the UFW agreed to scrap monthly membership fees in favor of charging members 2 percent of their annual income [242] It also announced that volunteers who had worked for the UFW for more than six months could become members with voting rights Previously, membership had been restricted primarily to farmworkers [242] The new executive committee, which included Huerta and Richard Chavez, was racially mixed, although some members expressed dissatisfaction that it did not contain more Mexican Americans [243]  By 1974, the UFW was again broke and its boycott was floundering [244] That year, The New York Times Magazine opened with a headline: \"Is Chavez Beaten?\" [245] Chavez flew to Europe to urge the unions there to block the imported goods that the UFW were sending there He traveled through London, Oslo, Stockholm, Geneva, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Brussels, and Paris, although he found that the unions were cautious about joining his campaign [246] In Rome, he met with Pope Paul VI, who commended his activism [247]\n\n\nProposition 14: 1976–1977\nThe ALRA law created a state agency, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB), to oversee union elections among farmworkers [271] Brown appointed a five-person board to lead the ALRB which was sympathetic to Chavez; it included the former UFW official LeRoy Chatfield [271] As the UFW prepared for the elections in the fields, Chavez organized a \"1000 mile march\" from the San Diego border up the coast in July 1975 [272] During the march, he stopped to attend the second UFW convention [273] For the campaign, the UFW hired 500 organizers, many of them farmworkers [274] The UFW won more elections than it lost, although in instances where it went head-to-head with the Teamsters, the latter beat the UFW [275] This indicated that the UFW's greatest strengths were among vegetable and citrus growers, rather than in their original heartlands of the Delano vineyards [276] The Teamster victories in the Delano vineyards angered Chavez, who insisted that there had not been free elections there [277] Chavez criticised the ALRB and launched a targeted campaign against Walter Kintz, the ALRB's general counsel, demanding his resignation He also put pressure on Governor Brown to remove Kintz [278]\n\n\nLinks with Synanon and Ferdinand Marcos: 1977\nI'm going to tell you something It's not threatening, it's just plain fucking fact If this union doesn't turn around and become a movement, I want no part of it I'll help and everything, but I don't want to be in charge I want to do something else I tell you because that's the way I feel.\n\n\nLater life\nIn June 1978, Chavez joined a picket in Yuma as part of his cousin Manuel's Arizona melon strike This broke an injunction and Chavez was thrown into the county jail for a night [336] By 1978, there was growing anger at the UFW among vegetable workers; they were frustrated by its incompetency, especially in the running of its medical plan [337] In the 22 farmworker elections that took place between June and September 1978, the UFW lost two-thirds [338] To stop the loss of its contracts and members, Chavez launched his Plan de Flote, an initiative to regain the trust of the vegetable pickers [339] Chavez organized a new strike over wages, hoping that salary increases would stem the UFW's losses; the union made its wage demands in January 1979, days after its contracts had expired [340] Eleven lettuce growers in the Salinas and Imperial Valleys were included in the strike, [341] which caused lettuce prices to soar [342]\n\n\nGrowing schisms: 1978–1982\nIn June 1978, Chavez joined a picket in Yuma as part of his cousin Manuel's Arizona melon strike This broke an injunction and Chavez was thrown into the county jail for a night [336] By 1978, there was growing anger at the UFW among vegetable workers;

the union made its wage demands in January 1979, days after its contracts had expired [340] Eleven lettuce growers in the Salinas and Imperial Valleys were included in the strike, [341] which caused lettuce prices to soar [342]\n\n\nThe Chicano Lobby and commercial activities: 1983–1989\nThe UFW's membership, and the subsequent membership dues they paid, continued to decline In January 1983, UFW contracts covered 30,000 jobs but by January 1986 this had fallen to 15,000 [372] In 1982, the dues that membership brought in were $2.9 million although this had fallen to $1 million three years later [373] By the early 1980s, there was a burgeoning Latino middle-class in the U.S Although Chavez hated the aspirational approach that had encouraged working-class Latinos to become middle-class, he recognized that this offered the UFW a wider support base [374] At the 1983 UFW convention, he announced the formation of a new non-profit organization, the Chicano Lobby [374] At the Lobby's launch, addresses were given by the San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros and the newly elected president of the Mexican American Political Association, Chavez's eldest son Fernando [375] To cope with its declining membership, the UFW sought to build its political influence [376] In November 1984, Chavez gave a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California [377] The UFW launched a print shop, with politicians who were eager to court the Latino vote increasingly used [376]\n\n\nFinal years: 1990–1993\nIn the early 1990s, the UFW continued to market Chavez as a heroic figure, especially on university and college campuses [401] In 1990, he appeared at 64 events, earning an average of $3,800 for each appearance [401] In 1991, he launched a \"Public Action Speaking Tour\" of U.S colleges and universities [402] His standard speech at these events covered the problems facing farmworkers, the dangers of pesticides, the alliance of agribusiness and the Republican Party, and his view that boycotts and marches were a better means of achieving change than electoral politics [403]\n\n\nPersonal life\nThe union's survival, its very existence, sent out a signal to all Hispanics that we were fighting for our dignity That we were challenging and overcoming injustice, that we were empowering the least educated among us, the poorest among us The message was clear If it could happen in the fields, it could happen anywhere: in the cities, in the courts, in the city councils, in the state legislatures I didn't really appreciate it at the time, but the coming of our union signalled the start of great changes among Hispanics that are now only beginning to be seen.\n\n\nPolitical views\nThe men and women who have suffered and endured much and not only because of our abject poverty but because we have been kept poor The color of our skins, the languages of our cultural and native origins, the lack of formal education, the exclusion from the democratic process, the numbers of our slain in recent wars — all these burdens generation after generation have sought to demoralize us, to break our human spirit But God knows we are not beasts of burden, we are not agricultural implements or rented slaves, we are men And mark this well  [..] we are men locked in a death struggle against man's inhumanity to man in the industry you represent And this struggle itself gives meaning to our life and ennobles our dying.\n\n\nOn organization and leadership\nChavez placed the success of the movement above all else; [260] Pawel described him as \"the ultimate pragmatist\" [171] He felt that he had to be both the leader and the organizer-in-chief of his movement because only he had the necessary commitment to the cause [480] He was interested in power and how to use it; although his role model in this was Gandhi, he also studied the ideas about power by Niccolò Machiavelli, Adolf Hitler, and Mao Zedong, drawing ideas from each [129] His use of purges to expel people from his movement was influenced by Mao's Cultural Revolution, [296] and he opened a June 1978 board meeting by reciting a poem by Mao [336] Chavez repeatedly referred to himself as a community organizer rather than as a labor leader and underscored that distinction [107] He wanted his organization to represent not just a union but a larger social movement [481] He was ambivalent about the national labor movement [107] He personally disliked many of the prominent figures within the American labor movement but, as a pragmatist, recognized the value of working with organized labor groups [136] He opposed the idea of paying wages to those who worked for the union, believing that it would destroy the spirit of the movement [482] He rarely fired people from their positions, but instead made their working situation uncomfortable so that they would resign [483]\n\n\nReception and legacy\n [Chavez's] dream was to found a labor union of farmworkers He had no money, no political connections, and no experience He was not a particularly dynamic personality and had no special talent as a public speaker The dream, he knew, was almost fanciful Nevertheless, through determination, grit, and a dogged will to win, he forged a movement that successfully challenged powerful entrenched economic and political interests and helped thousands of Mexican Americans to new cultural self-awareness.\n\n\nOrders, decorations, monuments, and honors\nChavez received a range of awards, both during his lifetime and posthumously In 1973, he received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, [522] and in 1992 the Pacem in Terris Award, a Catholic award meant to honor \"achievements in peace and justice\" [523] In August 1994, Chavez was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest honor for non-military personnel, by Democratic President Bill Clinton Chavez's widow collected it from the White House [524] Clinton stated that Chavez had been a \"remarkable man\" and that \"he was for his own people a Moses figure.\" [524] In 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger inducted Chavez into the California Hall of Fame [525] Asteroid 6982 Cesarchavez, discovered by Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory in 1993, was named in his memory; [526] the official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on August 27, 2019 (M.P.C 115893) [527] In March 2013, Google celebrated his 86th birthday with a Google Doodle [528]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Cesar Chavez\n\nCesar Chavez was a Mexican-American labor leader and civil rights activist who co-founded the United Farm Workers (UFW) in 1962.

[77] according to Pawel, Huerta became his \"indispensable, lifelong ally\" [78] Other key supporters of his project were the Reverend Jim Drake and other members of the California Migrant Ministry; although as a Roman Catholic Chavez was initially suspicious of these Protestant preachers, he came to view them as key allies [79]\n\n\nDelano Grape Strike\nIn September 1965, Filipino American farm workers, organized by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), initiated the Delano grape strike to protest for higher wages Chavez and his largely Mexican American supporters voted to support them [95] The strike covered an area of over 400 square miles (1,000 km2); [96] Chavez divided the picketers among four quadrants, each with a mobile crew led by a captain [97] As the picketers urged those who continued to work to join them on strike, the growers sought to provoke and threaten the strikers Chavez insisted that the strikers must never respond with violence [98] The picketers also protested outside strike-breakers' homes, [99] with the strike dividing many families and breaking friendships [100] Police monitored the protests, photographing many of those involved; [101] they also arrested various strikers [102] To raise support for those arrested, Chavez called for donations at a speech in Berkeley's Sproul Plaza in October; he received over $1,000 [103] Many growers considered Chavez a communist, [104] and the FBI launched an investigation into both him and the NFWA [105]\n\n\nStart of the Delano Grape Strike: 1965–1966\nIn September 1965, Filipino American farm workers, organized by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), initiated the Delano grape strike to protest for higher wages Chavez and his largely Mexican American supporters voted to support them [95] The strike covered an area of over 400 square miles (1,000 km2);

VIVA LA CAUSA!\n\n\nForty Acres and public fasts: 1967–1968\nThe union purchased land known as The Forty Acres for their new headquarters [141] Chavez hoped for it to be a \"spiritual\" center where union members would relax; he designed it to have a swimming pool, a chapel, a market, and a gas station, as well as gardens with outdoor sculptures [145] He wanted the main building to be decorated inside with Gandhi quotations in English and Spanish [145] Meanwhile, Chavez was increasingly concerned that his supporters might turn to violence [146] Members had engaged in the destruction of property, something they regarded as not breaching the movement's ethos on non-violence [147] Chavez's cousin Manuel had tampered with refrigerator units on trains, so that grapes being shipped out of Delano spoiled before reaching their destination; [147] Chavez noted that \"He's done all the dirty work for the union There's a lot of fucking dirty work, and he did it all.\" [147] In February 1968, the Giumarra company obtained a contempt citation against the union, claiming that its members had used threatening and intimidating behavior against its employees and had placed roofing nails at the entrances to its ranches [148]\n\n\nEnd of the Grape Strike: 1969–1970\nIn March 1969, the doctor Janet Travell visited Chavez and determined that fused vertebrae were the source of his back pain She prescribed various exercises and other treatments which he found eased his pain [173] Between September and December, Chavez traveled the country in a Winnebago speaking at dozens of fundraisers and rallies for the grape boycott [174] At a speech in Washington D.C., he came out publicly against U.S involvement in the Vietnam War, a topic he had previously avoided speaking on, because his son Fernando had been arrested as a conscientious objector [175]\n\n\nLater activism\nIn July 1970, the Grower-Shipper Association representing lettuce growing companies in California's Salinas Valley renegotiated its contracts with the Teamsters, allowing the latter union to represent their employees [183] Chavez was angry at this, traveling to Salinas to talk with the lettuce cutters, many of whom were dissatisfied with the way that the Teamsters represented them [184] In August, thousands of cutters marched into Salinas, converging at Hartnell College where Chavez addressed them [185] Rallying against the Teamsters, he emphasized that their union was run by white people, in contrast to the largely non-white makeup of the lettuce cutters [186] There, the cutters voted to go on strike [185] Over the coming days, many of them joined the UFW [185] Chavez decided that the strike should initially target the valley's largest lettuce grower, Interharvest, which was owned by the United Fruit Company [185] Seeking to avoid industrial action, the Teamsters set up a meeting with Chavez, where they eventually reached an agreement The Teamsters agreed to relinquish their contracts with the Grower-Shipper Association, opening the way for the Salinas lettuce cutters to choose the UFW as their representative [187]\n\n\nSalinas Lettuce Strike: 1970–1971\nIn July 1970, the Grower-Shipper Association representing lettuce growing companies in California's Salinas Valley renegotiated its contracts with the Teamsters, allowing the latter union to represent their employees [183] Chavez was angry at this, traveling to Salinas to talk with the lettuce cutters, many of whom were dissatisfied with the way that the Teamsters represented them [184] In August, thousands of cutters marched into Salinas, converging at Hartnell College where Chavez addressed them [185] Rallying against the Teamsters, he emphasized that their union was run by white people, in contrast to the largely non-white makeup of the lettuce cutters [186] There, the cutters voted to go on strike [185] Over the coming days, many of them joined the UFW [185] Chavez decided that the strike should initially target the valley's largest lettuce grower, Interharvest, which was owned by the United Fruit Company [185] Seeking to avoid industrial action, the Teamsters set up a meeting with Chavez, where they eventually reached an agreement The Teamsters agreed to relinquish their contracts with the Grower-Shipper Association, opening the way for the Salinas lettuce cutters to choose the UFW as their representative [187]\n\n\nExpanding beyond California: 1972\nArizona became the first state to pass a bill that was designed to keep the UFW out of their state; this would criminalize boycotts and make union elections among farm-workers almost impossible [209] In response, Chavez drove to Arizona and demanded a meeting with Governor Jack Williams, who refused [210] They subsequently launched a campaign to gain a recall election to remove Williams from office [211] This started the UFW's first major farm-worker campaign outside California [212] Farmworkers rallied outside Williams' office while Chavez embarked on a fast in the Santa Rita Center, a hall used by a local Chicano group [213] [214] On the nineteenth day of his fast, Chavez was hospitalized [215] He then broke the fast at a memorial Mass on the anniversary of Robert Kennedy's death, where he was joined by the folk singer Joan Baez [216] It was during the Arizona campaign that the UFW started using the slogan \"Si Se Puede\" (\"It Can be Done\"), which subsequently became closely associated with it [217]\n\n\nImmigration and legislative campaigns: 1973–1975\nIn September 1973, the UFW's first constitutional convention was held in Fresno, representing the final step in the organization becoming a full union [240] A new constitution was announced that gave the group's president, a post occupied by Chavez, significant powers; he feared that greater democracy would paralyze the group [241] At the convention, the UFW agreed to scrap monthly membership fees in favor of charging members 2 percent of their annual income [242] It also announced that volunteers who had worked for the UFW for more than six months could become members with voting rights Previously, membership had been restricted primarily to farmworkers [242] The new executive committee, which included Huerta and Richard Chavez, was racially mixed, although some members expressed dissatisfaction that it did not contain more Mexican Americans [243]  By 1974, the UFW was again broke and its boycott was floundering [244] That year, The New York Times Magazine opened with a headline: \"Is Chavez Beaten?\" [245] Chavez flew to Europe to urge the unions there to block the imported goods that the UFW were sending there He traveled through London, Oslo, Stockholm, Geneva, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Brussels, and Paris, although he found that the unions were cautious about joining his campaign [246] In Rome, he met with Pope Paul VI, who commended his activism [247]\n\n\nProposition 14: 1976–1977\nThe ALRA law created a state agency, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB), to oversee union elections among farmworkers [271] Brown appointed a five-person board to lead the ALRB which was sympathetic to Chavez; it included the former UFW official LeRoy Chatfield [271] As the UFW prepared for the elections in the fields, Chavez organized a \"1000 mile march\" from the San Diego border up the coast in July 1975 [272] During the march, he stopped to attend the second UFW convention [273] For the campaign, the UFW hired 500 organizers, many of them farmworkers [274] The UFW won more elections than it lost, although in instances where it went head-to-head with the Teamsters, the latter beat the UFW [275] This indicated that the UFW's greatest strengths were among vegetable and citrus growers, rather than in their original heartlands of the Delano vineyards [276] The Teamster victories in the Delano vineyards angered Chavez, who insisted that there had not been free elections there [277] Chavez criticised the ALRB and launched a targeted campaign against Walter Kintz, the ALRB's general counsel, demanding his resignation He also put pressure on Governor Brown to remove Kintz [278]\n\n\nLinks with Synanon and Ferdinand Marcos: 1977\nI'm going to tell you something It's not threatening, it's just plain fucking fact If this union doesn't turn around and become a movement, I want no part of it I'll help and everything, but I don't want to be in charge I want to do something else I tell you because that's the way I feel.\n\n\nLater life\nIn June 1978, Chavez joined a picket in Yuma as part of his cousin Manuel's Arizona melon strike This broke an injunction and Chavez was thrown into the county jail for a night [336] By 1978, there was growing anger at the UFW among vegetable workers; they were frustrated by its incompetency, especially in the running of its medical plan [337] In the 22 farmworker elections that took place between June and September 1978, the UFW lost two-thirds [338] To stop the loss of its contracts and members, Chavez launched his Plan de Flote, an initiative to regain the trust of the vegetable pickers [339] Chavez organized a new strike over wages, hoping that salary increases would stem the UFW's losses; the union made its wage demands in January 1979, days after its contracts had expired [340] Eleven lettuce growers in the Salinas and Imperial Valleys were included in the strike, [341] which caused lettuce prices to soar [342]\n\n\nGrowing schisms: 1978–1982\nIn June 1978, Chavez joined a picket in Yuma as part of his cousin Manuel's Arizona melon strike This broke an injunction and Chavez was thrown into the county jail for a night [336] By 1978, there was growing anger at the UFW among vegetable workers; they were frustrated by its incompetency, especially in the running of its medical plan [337] In the 22 farmworker elections that took place between June and September 1978, the UFW lost two-thirds [338] To stop the loss of its contracts and members, Chavez launched his Plan de Flote, an initiative to regain the trust of the vegetable pickers [339] Chavez organized a new strike over wages, hoping that salary increases would stem the UFW's losses; the union made its wage demands in January 1979, days after its contracts had expired [340] Eleven lettuce growers in the Salinas and Imperial Valleys were included in the strike, [341] which caused lettuce prices to soar [342]\n\n\nThe Chicano Lobby and commercial activities: 1983–1989\nThe UFW's membership, and the subsequent membership dues they paid, continued to decline In January 1983, UFW contracts covered 30,000 jobs but by January 1986 this had fallen to 15,000 [372] In 1982, the dues that membership brought in were $2.9 million although this had fallen to $1 million three years later [373] By the early 1980s, there was a burgeoning Latino middle-class in the U.S Although Chavez hated the aspirational approach that had encouraged working-class Latinos to become middle-class, he recognized that this offered the UFW a wider support base [374] At the 1983 UFW convention, he announced the formation of a new non-profit organization, the Chicano Lobby [374] At the Lobby's launch, addresses were given by the San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros and the newly elected president of the Mexican American Political Association, Chavez's eldest son Fernando [375] To cope with its declining membership, the UFW sought to build its political influence [376] In November 1984, Chavez gave a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California [377] The UFW launched a print shop, with politicians who were eager to court the Latino vote increasingly used [376]\n\n\nFinal years: 1990–1993\nIn the early 1990s, the UFW continued to market Chavez as a heroic figure, especially on university and college campuses [401] In 1990, he appeared at 64 events, earning an average of $3,800 for each appearance [401] In 1991, he launched a \"Public Action Speaking Tour\" of U.S colleges and universities [402] His standard speech at these events covered the problems facing farmworkers, the dangers of pesticides, the alliance of agribusiness and the Republican Party, and his view that boycotts and marches were a better means of achieving change than electoral politics [403]\n\n\nPersonal life\nThe union's survival, its very existence, sent out a signal to all Hispanics that we were fighting for our dignity That we were challenging and overcoming injustice, that we were empowering the least educated among us, the poorest among us The message was clear If it could happen in the fields, it could happen anywhere: in the cities, in the courts, in the city councils, in the state legislatures I didn't really appreciate it at the time, but the coming of our union signalled the start of great changes among Hispanics that are now only beginning to be seen.\n\n\nPolitical views\nThe men and women who have suffered and endured much and not only because of our abject poverty but because we have been kept poor The color of our skins, the languages of our cultural and native origins, the lack of formal education, the exclusion from the democratic process, the numbers of our slain in recent wars — all these burdens generation after generation have sought to demoralize us, to break our human spirit But God knows we are not beasts of burden, we are not agricultural implements or rented slaves, we are men And mark this well  [..] we are men locked in a death struggle against man's inhumanity to man in the industry you represent And this struggle itself gives meaning to our life and ennobles our dying.\n\n\nOn organization and leadership\nChavez placed the success of the movement above all else; [260] Pawel described him as \"the ultimate pragmatist\" [171] He felt that he had to be both the leader and the organizer-in-chief of his movement because only he had the necessary commitment to the cause [480] He was interested in power and how to use it; although his role model in this was Gandhi, he also studied the ideas about power by Niccolò Machiavelli, Adolf Hitler, and Mao Zedong, drawing ideas from each [129] His use of purges to expel people from his movement was influenced by Mao's Cultural Revolution, [296] and he opened a June 1978 board meeting by reciting a poem by Mao [336] Chavez repeatedly referred to himself as a community organizer rather than as a labor leader and underscored that distinction [107] He wanted his organization to represent not just a union but a larger social movement [481] He was ambivalent about the national labor movement [107] He personally disliked many of the prominent figures within the American labor movement but, as a pragmatist, recognized the value of working with organized labor groups [136] He opposed the idea of paying wages to those who worked for the union, believing that it would destroy the spirit of the movement [482] He rarely fired people from their positions, but instead made their working situation uncomfortable so that they would resign [483]\n\n\nReception and legacy\n [Chavez's] dream was to found a labor union of farmworkers He had no money, no political connections, and no experience He was not a particularly dynamic personality and had no special talent as a public speaker The dream, he knew, was almost fanciful Nevertheless, through determination, grit, and a dogged will to win, he forged a movement that successfully challenged powerful entrenched economic and political interests and helped thousands of Mexican Americans to new cultural self-awareness.\n\n\nOrders, decorations, monuments, and honors\nChavez received a range of awards, both during his lifetime and posthumously In 1973, he received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, [522] and in 1992 the Pacem in Terris Award, a Catholic award meant to honor \"achievements in peace and justice\" [523] In August 1994, Chavez was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest honor for non-military personnel, by Democratic President Bill Clinton Chavez's widow collected it from the White House [524] Clinton stated that Chavez had been a \"remarkable man\" and that \"he was for his own people a Moses figure.\" [524] In 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger inducted Chavez into the California Hall of Fame [525] Asteroid 6982 Cesarchavez, discovered by Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory in 1993, was named in his memory; [526] the official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on August 27, 2019 (M.P.C 115893) [527] In March 2013, Google celebrated his 86th birthday with a Google Doodle [528]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born into a family with a rich heritage in filmmaking, Mukerji has followed in the footsteps of his ancestors to become one of the most successful and acclaimed directors of his generation.\n\nEarly life and background\nMukerjee was born in a Bengali Hindu family in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, the son of Bengali film actor Deb Mukherjee. His family was involved in the Indian film industry since 1930, when his grandfather Sashadhar Mukherjee first ventured into the field. Sashadhar Mukherjee was one of the founding partners of Filmistan Studio in Mumbai and a pioneer in the industry, producing films like Dil Deke Dekho (1959), Love in Simla (1960), Ek Musafir Ek Hasina (1962), and Leader (1964). Filmistan Studio is still run by Ayan's extended family.\n\nMukerji's early life was marked by a strong connection to the film industry, with his family's history and legacy playing a significant role in shaping his interests and career aspirations. His grandfather's influence and contributions to the industry instilled in him a deep passion for filmmaking, which would eventually become the driving force behind his own creative endeavors.\n\nCareer\nMukerji started his career as an assistant director to his brother-in-law Ashutosh Gowariker on the social drama Swades (2004). This early experience provided him with a solid foundation in filmmaking and helped him develop his skills as a director. He later assisted Karan Johar on the ensemble musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), also appearing as an extra in the latter film.\n\nInitial work and directorial debut (2004–2009)\nMukerji's foray into filmmaking began with his work as an assistant director on Swades (2004).

Starring Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone in lead roles, alongside Kalki Koechlin and Aditya Roy Kapur, this film was his second under Karan Johar's banner. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani revolves around two people who meet during a trekking trip where one falls in love with the other but refrains from expressing it. They soon drift apart but end up meeting again at a friend's wedding.\n\nYeh Jawaani Hai Deewani opened to widespread critical acclaim, with high praise for its direction, story, screenplay, soundtrack, cinematography, production design, costumes, and the performances of its cast. The film emerged as a major blockbuster at the box office, grossing ₹319.6 crore (US$38 million) worldwide, and ranking as the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani earned Mukerji his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director. Over the years, it has emerged as a highly popular film amongst youth.\n\nOther roles\nMukerji has also ventured into other creative endeavors, including writing and producing. His passion for storytelling and filmmaking has driven him to explore various aspects of the industry, from scriptwriting to production design.\n\nAwards\nMukerji has received numerous awards and nominations for his work as a director and screenwriter.

previously captured islands of Leyte Gulf in the Southeast of the Philippines, shown in blue as the Eastern Visayas in the map at left, and West, South of the Southern Visayas through the Suriago Strait and the Bohol Sea  Then heading north and following the Western coastlines of the Western Philippine Islands of Negros, Panay, and Mindoro (In green), shown at left in the map, the forward staged ships of Admiral Oldendorf's naval invasion force headed for the mouth of Lingayen Gulf on the Island of Luzon, shown to the immediate left of Bagaio  From the mouth of the Gulf, two vertical channels would be swept of mines by the minesweepers, one for landing areas terminating at the base of the Gulf, west on the beach of Lingayen, and one for landing areas terminating east at the town of San Fabian  The narrow base of the roughly rectangular Lingayen Gulf provided a relatively small landing area, only 25–30 miles wide, but its assault forces needed to take only a 100-mile overland route South to reach Luzon's capital city of Manila, shown clearly at left.\n\n\nBombardment\nFrom January 3–9, 1945, the ships of Admiral Oldendorf's invasion force took a lengthy circuitous route through the previously captured islands of Leyte Gulf in the Southeast of the Philippines, shown in blue as the Eastern Visayas in the map at left, and West, South of the Southern Visayas through the Suriago Strait and the Bohol Sea  Then heading north and following the Western coastlines of the Western Philippine Islands of Negros, Panay, and Mindoro (In green), shown at left in the map, the forward staged ships of Admiral Oldendorf's naval invasion force headed for the mouth of Lingayen Gulf on the Island of Luzon, shown to the immediate left of Bagaio  From the mouth of the Gulf, two vertical channels would be swept of mines by the minesweepers, one for landing areas terminating at the base of the Gulf, west on the beach of Lingayen, and one for landing areas terminating east at the town of San Fabian  The narrow base of the roughly rectangular Lingayen Gulf provided a relatively small landing area, only 25–30 miles wide, but its assault forces needed to take only a 100-mile overland route South to reach Luzon's capital city of Manila, shown clearly at left.\n\n\nMinesweeping efforts\nDemolitions near the planned landing sites on the base of the Gulf by Underwater Demolition Teams were undertaken, but they found no beach obstacles, and only one mine and encountered sparse opposing forces  Lieutenant Commander W R Loud, who commanded the minesweeper force, claimed to have found around ten additional mines in his sweeping efforts by end of day January 7, though intelligence estimates by Philippine resistance may have overestimated the number present [10]  Smith writes that surprisingly, during the 7th, exploratory sweeps during the morning \"turned up only two floating mines and none of the moored type.\" [11]  Both sources seemed to indicate a total of less than 10–12 mines, not a particularly large number for a close approach to a landing area, considering the large numbers soon to be found off the beaches of Iwo Jima As approach channels were swept, buoys were placed to delineate the areas where ships could approach or land safe from the threat of active contact mines.\n\n\nLand battle\nAs shown at left, at 09:30 on 9 January 1945, about 68,000 GIs under General Walter Krueger of the U.S 6th Army—following a devastating naval bombardment—landed at the coast of Lingayen Gulf meeting no opposition A total of 203,608 soldiers were eventually landed over the next few days, establishing a 20 mi (32 km) beachhead, stretching from Sual, and San Fabian at the far East of the map at the base of the Bolianu Peninsula, west to the central Gulf town of Dagupan (XIV Corps), and then to the far Western town of Lingayen  The location of XIV corps is shown by the blue line at the center of the figure at left  The Lingayen Assault Force landing areas are shown at left by blue rectangles near the town of Lingayen, and the assault forces are shown as the blue lines further inland  The San Fabian Assault force (I Corps) have landing areas shown as rectangles and a blue line indicating assault forces on right of figure by the town of San Fabian The total number of troops under the command of MacArthur was reported to have even exceeded the number that Dwight D Eisenhower controlled in Europe [16]\n\n\nHeavy losses on land and sea\nDespite their success in driving out the Japanese forces stationed there, the Americans and their mostly Australian allies suffered relatively heavy losses; particularly to their convoys, due to kamikaze attacks While not the highest in U.S casualties, the subsequent Battle for Luzon was the highest net casualty battle U.S forces fought in World War II, with 192,000 to 217,000 Japanese combatants dead, though some sources quote losses as high as 380,000 for the entire conflict including non-combat casualties (mostly from starvation and disease) [17] The battle saw 8,000 American combatants killed, or as many as 10,000 in the entire conflict Total non-combat American casualty estimates have ranged as high as 93,400 among the Sixth Army when illness from disease and non-combat injuries are accounted for [4]  However, to these staggering losses, there must also be added the over 150,000 Filipinos killed, many during the Battle of Manila, but with an overwhelming number of Filipino civilians murdered by Japanese forces, as a result of the Manila massacre of February, 1945 [18]\n\n\nOverview of ships damaged 3–13 January 1945\nDuring the invasion by sea, which is the primary subject of this article, from December 13, 1944 – January 13, 1945, including the time Allied ships entered the Philippines through Leyte Gulf to Lingayen, as well as action taken two weeks before off the Northern Philippine Islands of Mindoro and Marinduque, a total of 24 Allied ships were sunk and another 67 were damaged by kamikazes, though this number includes naval activities off the West coast of Luzon, outside of Lingayen Gulf, off the Philippine Visaya Islands and the Island of Mindoro, which were necessary as preliminaries to secure the Island of Luzon for the invasion force    Ships damaged by kamikazes between 3–11 January on the way to Lingayen included the battleships USS Mississippi, New Mexico and California (the latter was also accidentally hit by friendly fire), the heavy cruiser HMAS Australia, the light cruiser USS Columbia, and the Destroyer minesweepers USS Long and USS Hovey [16] Following the landings, Lingayen Gulf was turned into a vast supply depot for the rest of the war to support the Battle of Luzon.\n\n\nUSS Ommaney Bay sunk\nOn 3 January 1945, the USS Ommaney Bay, a large escort carrier, was severely damaged by a Yokosuka P1Y kamikaze carrying two bombs   At 17:12, the Yokosuka P1Y penetrated a Destroyer screen undetected and made for Ommaney, approaching directly towards the ship's bow Captain Young of the Ommaney later reported that the kamikaze's approach was concealed by the blinding glare of the sun [20]  The Captain, aware of the kamikaze threat, had assigned multiple lookouts throughout the carrier's deck But a lack of radar signals, a common and vexing problem during the battle, had led the task group to believe that the Japanese planes had withdrawn, and the kamikaze attack took the lookouts by complete surprise New Mexico was only able to respond with inaccurate anti-aircraft fire, whilst Ommaney Bay was unable to react at all [21]\n\n\nUSS Manila Bay struck\nIt is strongly speculated by Samuel Eliot Morison that the late afternoon kamikaze strikes on 5 January between 16:51 and 17:50 on the USS Helm, HMAS Arunta, USS Louisville, HMAS Australia, USS Manila Bay, and USS Savo Island came from 16 kamikaze planes and 4 escorts that took off at 15:57 from the Japanese airbase at Mabalacat, formerly Clark Air Base, north of Manila  The attacks occurred West of Luzon about 100 miles off the coast of Corregidor  The air base's relative proximity to the Allied ships insured relatively full tanks, and the tactical training they had received from Commander Tadashi Nakajima in  kamikaze targeting methods, maneuvering and dive strategies increased their chances of making it to their targets and dealing a more damaging strike [27] [28]\n\n\nHMAS Australia struck five times\nThe heavy cruiser HMAS Australia (D84) was the only invasion ship struck five times, though her considerable casualties of forty-four dead and seventy-two wounded were the result of only the first two strikes, of which only the second caused serious damage.\n\n\nLoss of USS Brooks and USS Long\nDeparting New Guinea's Manus Island in late December, while escorting a Leyte-bound convoy, the USS Hovey and the ships of Mine Squadron 2 detached from their charges on January 2, 1945, and shaped a course for Lingayen Gulf, where the group was ordered to sweep the approaches to Lingayen in advance of the first American amphibious landing on Luzon Coming under repeated massed air attack from Japanese kamikaze aircraft while engaged in their sweeps, the Hovey and her sisters spent the time period from January 2 facing frequent fire from Japanese aircraft attempting to repel the invading ships [40]\n\n\nUSS Hovey sinks from aerial torpedo\nWithin two minutes of the torpedo impact, the Hovey's bow section was listing 90 degrees as men stationed there scrambled to abandon the sinking vessel Moments later, a bulkhead gave way and sent the bow vertical in the water where for a few seconds it lingered before plunging to the bottom Hovey's stern remained on an even keel as it slowly swamped, allowing most of the crew and rescued sailors there to get off before it too sank at this location at 04:55 on January 7, 1945 When the Hovey sank, she took 24 of her crew and 24 men from her sister ships USS Long, and USS Brooks with her to the bottom  Five of those lost when the Hovey sank came from the USS Brooks  She sank roughly 20 miles North of the base of the gulf at a depth of 54 fathoms, at 16°20'N   120°10'E  The USS Chandler (DD-206), soon stood by rescuing the survivors of all three ships from the sinking Hovey, a total of 229 crew  Of the 229 men the Chandler rescued from the Hovey, roughly half were likely survivors of the Long, and had escaped from two successively abandoned and badly damaged ships [45] [47]\n\n\nUSS New Mexico struck\nAt 1159 on 6 January 1945, Lieutenant General Herbert Lumsden was killed when a kamikaze struck the bridge of the battleship USS New Mexico (BB-40) He was the most senior British Army combat fatality of World War II Lumsden was British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's personal liaison to General Douglas MacArthur  The ship sustained 30 dead and 87 wounded, when a kamikaze hit her bridge, killing Lumsden and her commanding officer, Captain Robert Fleming Rear Admiral George Weyler, commander of the San Fabian fire support force and previously the commander of the battleship fleet in the Battle of Leyte Gulf a few months earlier, and British Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, commander of the British Pacific Fleet, were in the bridge also, but they were on the starboard side and unharmed They were only a few yards from being killed or seriously wounded [48] [49]\n\n\nUSS California struck\nShortly after 17:15 on 6 January, two kamikaze Zeros approached the USS California  Her gunners shot down one, but the other struck her at port by her mainmast The kamikaze's fuel tanks leaked gasoline, starting a fire and a 5-inch shell from another ship accidentally hit one of her 5-inch guns, which exploded inside the turret, and started another fire The fires were quickly suppressed, but significant casualties resulted, including 44 killed and 155 injured.\n\n\nUSS Louisville hit twice\nRear Admiral Theodore E Chandler, Commander of Cruiser Division 4, died from his wounds on 7 January 1945, a day after the bridge of the heavy cruiser USS Louisville (CA-28), where he was helping to direct operations, was struck a devastating blow by a kamikaze, having received a less damaging strike by a kamikaze on the previous day  Admiral Chandler received a posthumous Navy Cross for his direction of operations aboard the besieged cruiser [19]  Chandler was the highest-ranking U.S Navy flag officer killed in action in World War II The other four admirals who died in World War II due to combat were Rear Admirals Isaac C Kidd, Daniel J Callaghan, Norman Scott, and Henry M Mullinnix.\n\n\nUSS Mississippi struck\nThe USS Mississippi (BB-41) began shelling Japanese positions on the island of Luzon on 6 January 1945 During the bombardment, a Japanese kamikaze struck the ship on 9 January at 13:02, but she remained on station, bombarding the Japanese defenses, until 10 February, when she withdrew to Pearl Harbor for repairs At 13:03, a Japanese Val had struck her on the port side below bridge level, landing on an anti-aircraft gun and toppling over the side  Twenty-three were killed and sixty-three wounded, giving the battleship one of the heavier casualty rate of those struck [52] [53]\n\n\nUSS Belknap struck\nAt 07:53, on 11 January 1945, the Clemson-Class Destroyer USS Belknap was forced to train all her guns on a Japanese kamikaze which eventually crashed her number two stack, nearly disabling her engines, and resulting in the death of 38 and wounding 49 of her crew  These included Underwater Demolition Team 9, on board when she was hit, which cost the team one officer, 7 enlisted, 3 MIA and 13 wounded  Earlier on 3–11 January 1945, she had acted as a shore bombardment and beach reconnaissance vessel at the Lingayen  landings [54]\n\n\nSS Kyle Johnson, David D. Field damaged\nOne of the worst losses of life was suffered by merchant marine vessel SS Kyle V Johnson at 18:30 on January 12, when a kamikaze dive, among a group of 6 attacking enemy planes, started a large fire, killing 120 men  Two of the planes splashed just short of SS David Dudley Field, causing minor engine room damage, but Edward N Wescott received considerable damage from flying debris, wounding six of her merchant seamen, and seven of her Naval armed guard crew [55]   With few enemy planes remaining on Luzon, the kamikazes went after victims of opportunity, the slower, cargo ships, which certainly had poorer air defenses than battleships and cruisers, yet represented a large target, that may have had somewhat limited mobility due to their size, weight, and weather conditions in the Gulf.\n\n\nEscort carrier Salamaua struck\nAt 08:58 on 13 January, the escort carrier USS Salamaua was struck by an unidentified kamikaze who dove almost vertically at too great a speed to give the ship's gunners time to respond  The plane, which plunged through the flight deck, carried two 250 kilogram bombs, one under each wing  One bomb exploded causing fires on the flight deck, hangar deck, and a few additional areas  The second bomb did not explode but penetrated the ship's starboard side at the waterline  With a loss of power communication and steering, fifteen men aboard Salamaua were killed, and eighty-eight wounded  2 Grumman FM-2 fighters and 1 Grumman TBM torpedo bomber were destroyed by the kamikaze attack [26] The starboard engine was lost, and the afterengine room flooded, but anti-aircraft gunners splashed two enemy planes in a period of ten minutes  After temporary repairs, she managed to leave the Gulf under her own power while under the screen of two destroyers and return to Leyte  She was the last vessel to be struck by kamikazes in the Gulf conflict, as after January 12, the Japanese had expended every aircraft they had in the Philippines  Only 47 Japanese planes escaped from the islands, and after January 15, it was believed only ten Japanese planes were left on the entire island of Luzon [56]\n\n\nSuccess of kamikazes\nAccording to several naval historians, kamikazes were likely used more successfully by the Japanese at Lingayen Gulf, and beginning in the last two weeks of December 1944 in the Western Philippine islands of the Visayas and Mindoro, than in any other Pacific conflict with the possible exception of the Battle of Okinawa At least for the kamikaze attacks on January 6 at Lingayen Gulf and likely earlier in the battle, eminent Naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote, they were \"the most effective of the war in relation to the number of planes involved – 28 kamikazes and 15 fighter escorts.\"  Though General McArthur had written that 58 kamikazes were employed on January 6, and 18 fighter escorts, a few more than Morison's estimate, Morison's conclusion as to the effectiveness of kamikazes still seems well taken considering the staggering damage done by roughly 100–200 kamikazes to around 47 ships in the ten days of the battle between January 3 – January 13, shown in the large table below  Those ten days in January 1945 on the way to and within Luzon's Lingayen Gulf resulted in the deaths of around 738 and the wounding of 1282 ship-based seamen, marines, and infantry [57] [58] [59]\n\n\nLuzon kamikazes on 6 January\nSamuel Morison estimated that on 6 January, around twenty-eight kamikaze hit 15 ships, representing a hit rate of nearly 50%, vastly exceeding the 10–15% hit rate of kamikazes throughout the Pacific conflict [61]\nIan Toll wrote that by the morning of 6 January at Mabalacat airfield, \"five derelicts were patched up to the extent that they could take off\", though they were not air bound until around 16:55 that afternoon [62]  Commander Tadashi Nakajima, head of kamikaze operations and training for the Philippines, estimated there were five kamikazes taking off from the nearby Angeles Field at 11:00 that morning, eight more at 10:40 from Echague, just Northeast of the Gulf, and an additional 9 from an airport on Luzon unnamed by Nakajima, bringing the total number to around twenty-seven on 6 January [63] The  single Mabalacat kamikaze departing around midday on 6 January, and those from Angeles and Echague may have been responsible for strikes on any of the ten ships struck around noon that day including the battleship New Mexico or the Destroyers Leary, Sumner, Long or Brooks.\n\n\n30% kamikaze \"hit\" rate, 3–13 Jan 45\nAccording to a U.S Air Force webpage, despite anti-aircraft fire, radar detection, and airborne interception, roughly 14 percent of kamikazes survived to score a hit on a US ship, and nearly 8.5 percent of all ships hit by kamikazes sank [61]  Considering that roughly 150 kamikazes survived to complete around 54 strikes on 47 ships at Lingayen from 3–13 January 1945 at Lingayen, as shown in the table below, this would indicate a \"hit\" rate closer to 30 percent and a sinking rate of ships struck (4 ships sunk/54 strikes) of only around 7.4 percent, though slightly higher, closer to 10%, if the Destroyer Transport Brooks, irreparably damaged and needing to be towed, is counted The sinking rate is slightly skewed as both the Hovey and Palmer were sunk by torpedo or bomb hits, but it may be argued both ships were still struck or nearly struck by kamikazes, as the Hovey certainly was buzzed by a kamikaze, and the \"Betty\" bomber that sunk the Palmer, at 18:35 on 7 January after releasing its bombs, according to Morison,  \"turned as if to attack another ship and splashed\" [67]  Smith suggests that as few as 100 kamikazes were responsible for roughly 30 strikes on Allied ships from 2–8 January, and though this is also a rough approximation, it again represents an approximate \"hit\" rate on allied ships approaching 30% [68]\n\n\n\"Hit\" rate lower at Okinawa\nThough the damaged ships from kamikazes were greater at Okinawa, roughly three times as many, there were at least seven times more aircraft deployed there, as between 6 April and 22 June 1945, the Japanese flew 1,465 kamikaze aircraft in large-scale attacks from Kyushu, and 250 individual kamikaze sorties from Formosa [69]  Morison, an Admiral himself by 1945, and a shrewd observer of Naval tactics, theorized that the better trained Japanese pilots including those using kamikaze tactics had been expended prior to Okinawa, and those trained for the battle there lacked time to gain commensurate skills with those available at the Battle of Lingayen  He wrote, \"Off Okinawa, the Navy would be faced with an even more intensive suicide effort, but by that time the cream of the Kamikaze crop had destroyed itself, and the Allied Navies had additional means of protection\" [70]\n\n\nKamikaze \"hit\" rate, 13 Dec – 13 Jan 45\nRoss further estimated that in the longer period between December 13, 1944, and January 13, 1945, at Lingayen, the island of Luzon and to a smaller extent the Philippine's Visaya Islands, the Japanese lost roughly 200 planes in successful or unsuccessful kamikaze dives on ships  During this month long period, according to Smith, who used data from Morison, kamikazes were almost exclusively responsible for sinking 24 allied ships, heavily damaging 30 and lightly damaging 37  This represents an approximate 200 kamikazes achieving damaging strikes on roughly 91 Allied ships, suggesting a very rough \"hit\" rate approaching 48%, though the figure is likely lower [72] [73]\n\n\nEvasive tactics, armor\nAllied anti-aircraft guns were often ineffective against the kamikazes due to their speed, and maneuverability and because the operators of five inch guns, which used the highly effective proximity fuses, were unable to effectively sight the low angle, carefully maneuvered enemy planes that frequently dove with the sun behind them  Moreover, the projectiles of the typical 20 and 40 mm anti-aircraft guns used in allied ships, \"did not have sufficient explosive power or impact to knock out heavily armored kamikazes\" despite hitting the planes repeatedly with a hail of shells from an individual gun or what might at times even be combined gunfire from more than one ship [74]\n\n\nZeros outperformed US Wildcat fighters\nRear Admiral Calvin T Durgin, who commanded many of the escort carriers partly tasked with launching the fighter aircraft that would provide cover to the advancing ships of the invasion force, noted that his widely used fighter the FM-2 Wildcat, \"showed up inferior to the Japanese Zeke (Zero), not only in speed and maneuver, but in climbing ability in altitudes above 5000 feet; and we had not enough Wildcats.\"   A significant percentage of the Japanese planes used as kamikazes were Zeros, and they could be just as effective acting as escorts to provide cover for Japanese planes that could later be used as kamikazes  As noted by Smith, \"kamikazes continually slipped through the air cover, and the CVE-based (Carrier Escort) planes had knocked down less than half of all Japanese aircraft destroyed from 2 through 6 January Interception, as a result of the Japanese flight tactics and the radar problems, became largely a matter of luck in the Lingayen Gulf area.\" [75]\n\n\nLimitations of radar aided the kamikazes\nThe terrain was mountainous in the Lingayen Gulf area, including near the mouth of the Gulf, at times limiting the ability of radar on the invasion ships, particularly near the mountainous coast of the Gulf, to detect the arrival of kamikazes and their escorts and vector in American fighters to oppose them [76]\n\n\nDetrimental effects of weather and shoals\nThe argument could also be made that once within Lingayen Gulf, the current, shoals, winds, waves, and storms that the Gulf was known for made maneuvering the advancing allied ships somewhat more difficult, and more likely to break formation and become isolated, though the prevailing weather for the advancing convoy west of Luzon was far better than the weather experienced by the fast carriers of Fast Carrier Task Force 38, North and East of Luzon which significantly hampered the operation of their air defenses  According to the observations of the Commander, Carrier Task Force 38, the primary source of fighter cover provided by the Fast carriers, \"At sea,.. strong winds, rough seas, and heavy swells were recorded on 6 January through 9 January (1945) These conditions definitely hampered landing of planes and the work of the deck crews,\" at least for 1–2 days, making air support from sea-based carriers more difficult  As a more general statement of the Fast Carrier Group, TF 38, \"weather conditions on S minus 6 day and S day (from the 3rd to the 9th of January or S-day).. were so poor that the success of our mission was in question much of the time.\" [77]\n\n\nEffects of overcast on January 6\nAccording to the Aerology and Amphibious Warfare report, the Third Amphibious Force's Commander noted \"During the initial stages of the approach to the target cloudy weather and intermittent rain\" prevailed  During the invasion's forces preliminary approach, it was also noted, that \"overcast conditions prevailed due to intermediate type cloudiness, and occasional areas of very light precipitation were encountered.\" [78]  Intermittent rain and cloudy conditions, even if slight, combined with the thick smoke caused by the bombardment groups by mid-day January 6, may have affected visibility at least on the critical days of January 6–7, which would have significantly reduced the ability of ships within the Gulf to sight kamikazes, and to a smaller extent, light to moderate winds may have hampered the maneuverability of smaller ships evading kamikaze attacks, and the wave activity on the East side of the gulf may have somewhat reduced the ability of smaller ships to effectively aim anti-aircraft guns at the enemy Samuel Cox, Director of the Naval History and Heritage Command noted that at least on January 6, and likely intermittently during January 5–7, there was \"an overcast that hampered both U.S and Japanese operations The U.S ships could not see the Japanese aircraft until they broke through the overcast with very little time to react.\" [19]\n\n\nHigh seas slowed landing on January 10\nAs the results of a small typhoon, around January 9–11, though its full effects were felt far to the North of the base of the Gulf, \"By mid-morning (in January 10, the second day of the assault) the 6 to 8 foot surf at the beaches, resulting from the increased swell, had caused landing operations to come to a halt.\"  It was not until the third day of the assault (January 11), that \"the swell diminished and conditions improved rapidly to permit continued landing operations.\"  The slight increase in swells and wind might have partly accounted for the number of larger transport ships struck in the Gulf from January 9–11, as well as the crowding caused by so many large craft at anchor near the base of the Gulf [79]\n\n\nKamikaze training\nCommander Tadashi Nakajima, Operations and Training Officer for the 201st Air Group, responsible for the initiation of Kamikaze tactics in the Philippines, carefully trained kamikaze pilots as to the angle of dive they chose, the targets they selected, and the methods they used to navigate to Allied ships.\n\n\nAngle of dives\nThere were two basic angle of dives strongly preferred in kamikaze training tactics; a high altitude approach, and a low altitude approach A high altitude approach could commence at an altitude as high as 6000–7000 meters, and might begin with an angle of 20 degrees, and then end with a dive angle of 45–55 degrees once reaching 200 meters above a sighted target  These directions were flexible, and required considerable skill to implement  A low altitude approach was ended with a brief climb to 400–500 meters followed by a quick dive  The low altitude approach had the advantage of reduced radar detection and sighting at very low altitudes above the waterline, as Nakajima suggested to his students that a kamikaze might cruise as low as 10–15 meters above the waterline, if they had adequate skill to maintain such a consistently low altitude during their approach.\n\n\nPoints of aim\nKamikaze pilots carried full fuel tanks to increase the odds of starting fires, and usually carried bombs that would be released at a time to maximize the likelihood they would penetrate the decks of their targets  Against Destroyers, other small warships and smaller transports, Nakajima informed his pilots, that \"a hit any place between the bridge and the center of the ship is usually fatal\"  He continued, \"small warships and transports, having no deck protection are extremely vulnerable to aerial attack  A single kamikaze plane could sink such vessels with a single hit.\"  At the Battle of Lingayen Gulf, of the vessels sunk or irreparably damaged, 4 of 5, if the USS Brooks is counted, or 80% were the aging and smaller, Clemson or Wickes Class Destroyers Of the Destroyers sunk, the Long was struck by two separate kamikazes, each time near the bridge, the Belknap was struck amidships near the 2nd stack, and the Brooks was struck port amidships causing fires  Each strike to these heavily damaged destroyers was close or not far from the bridge, the spot suggested by Nakajima's training of kamikaze pilots.\n\n\nVulnerability of minesweepers and destroyers\nThe winds, waves, light rain, and overcast skies would have made smaller craft such as Destroyers and Minesweepers particularly vulnerable to kamikazes as they would experience less stability in rough seas than a larger ship, affecting their maneuverability while under attack  Their smaller size may have made them a more logical target for kamikazes as well, and overcast skies would have given them less time to spot incoming kamikazes from a distance  Unique to the minesweepers, the uneven bottom and shoals of Lingayen, might have increased the time they required to perform mine sweeping duties against mines moored to the bottom, and made their separation from each other and covering ships a greater possibility Of the 47 ships damaged by enemy aircraft or kamikazes, 16 of 47, over 30% were composed of the relatively smaller ships, Destroyers, Destroyer Escorts, and Destroyer/Minesweepers.\n\n\nJapan knew invasion force's destination\nAlso worthy of consideration, the Japanese had determined early in the battle that the destination of most of the forces among the troop ships was the capital city of Manila, where American prisoners of war were held, making it easier to concentrate their forces on the ships heading for the base of Lingayen Gulf, just 100 miles north of the capital  According to Samuel Morison, by January 5, and certainly by mid-day on January 6, perhaps the worst for Allied losses from kamikazes, the Japanese high command were already convinced that \"Lingayen was the American destination\" [84]  Though allowing for the considerable cover provided by allied fighters, originally as many as 240 Japanese planes from Clark, Nichols, and other airfields on Luzon, within striking distance of Lingayen Gulf, \"were committed to the (Lingayen) expeditionary force during the first week of January (1945)\" [85]   Unlike the primary landing area at Lingayen on Luzon, during the Battles for Leyte Gulf, the two primary landing areas for transports on Leyte Island's Dulag and Tacloban, selected from large stretches of coastline, were far less likely to have been previously known to the Japanese.\n\n\nAllied defense against kamikazes\nThe allied ships of the invasion force struggled to find an effective defense against diving kamikazes, but realized their options were limited  Rear Admiral Forest B Royal, stated that \"full power and evasive course, combined with rapid and accurate gunfire, proved to be an effective defense against suicide dives.\"  But Vice Admiral Wilkinson, who generally agreed, added that when considering \"the high speed of the plane as compared with the relatively slow speed of the ship, even at full power, an evasive course is inconsequential.\"  Admiral Kinkaid summarized the best strategy for defense when he stated that a well-trained and skilled pilot who was intent on crashing his plane, \"is almost certain to succeed if unopposed by anti-aircraft fire, regardless of what maneuvers the ship attempts\"  He then added the primary advantage of maneuvering allied ships should be \"to unmask the maximum number of guns, and to present a narrow target in range since an error in judgement by the pilot is more likely to result in overshooting (the targeted allied ship) than in a deflection error\" [88]\n\n\nDefense by Allied ships\nThe allied ships of the invasion force struggled to find an effective defense against diving kamikazes, but realized their options were limited  Rear Admiral Forest B Royal, stated that \"full power and evasive course, combined with rapid and accurate gunfire, proved to be an effective defense against suicide dives.\"  But Vice Admiral Wilkinson, who generally agreed, added that when considering \"the high speed of the plane as compared with the relatively slow speed of the ship, even at full power, an evasive course is inconsequential.\"  Admiral Kinkaid summarized the best strategy for defense when he stated that a well-trained and skilled pilot who was intent on crashing his plane, \"is almost certain to succeed if unopposed by anti-aircraft fire, regardless of what maneuvers the ship attempts\"  He then added the primary advantage of maneuvering allied ships should be \"to unmask the maximum number of guns, and to present a narrow target in range since an error in judgement by the pilot is more likely to result in overshooting (the targeted allied ship) than in a deflection error\" [88]\n\n\nDefense by Allied aircraft\nIn early 1945, U.S Navy aviator Commander John Thach, already famous for developing effective aerial tactics against the Japanese such as the Thach Weave, developed a defensive strategy against kamikazes called the \"big blue blanket\" to establish Allied air supremacy well away from the carrier force This method recommended combat air patrols (CAP) that were larger and operated further from the carriers than before, a line of picket destroyers and destroyer escorts at least 80 km (50 mi) from the main body of the fleet to provide earlier radar interception and improved coordination between fighter direction officers on carriers This plan also called for around-the-clock fighter patrols over Allied fleets, though the U.S Navy had cut back training of fighter pilots so there were not enough Navy pilots available to counter the kamikaze threat A final element included intensive fighter sweeps over Japanese airfields, and bombing of Japanese runways, using delayed-action bombs to make repairs more difficult [89]  As effective as these methods could be, they had limitations, particularly considering the somewhat limited ability of radar to detect incoming enemy planes, the use of armor on kamikazes, the confusing tactics they used to avoid anti-aircraft fire, and the difficulty in shooting down kamikazes once their dive began.\n\n\nInvasion ships sunk and damaged at Lingayen\nShown at left is the approach route indicated by a solid line, and the return route, indicated by a

Gulf**\n\nThe invasion of Lingayen Gulf, which took place from January 3 to 9, 1945, was a pivotal moment in the Allied campaign to recapture the Philippines from Japanese forces during World War II. The battle was a testament to the bravery and sacrifice of the Allied forces, who faced overwhelming odds and extreme conditions to secure a vital foothold on the island of Luzon.\n\n**Background**\n\nDuring World War II, Lingayen Gulf proved a strategically important theater of war between American and Japanese forces. Shown in the center of the figure left, on 22 December 1941, the Japanese 14th Army—under Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma—landed on the northeastern shores of the gulf, at Agoo, Caba, Santiago and Bauang, where they engaged in a number of relatively minor skirmishes with the defenders, a poorly equipped contingent of predominantly American and Filipino troops. Facing limited opposition, the larger Japanese forces managed to successfully invade and occupy the gulf.\n\n**Operations**\n\nFrom January 3–9, 1945, the ships of Admiral Oldendorf's invasion force took a lengthy circuitous route through the previously captured islands of Leyte Gulf in the Southeast of the Philippines, shown in blue as the Eastern Visayas in the map at left, and West, South of the Southern Visayas through the Suriago Strait and the Bohol Sea. Then heading north and following the Western coastlines of the Western Philippine Islands of Negros, Panay, and Mindoro (In green), shown at left in the map, the forward staged ships of Admiral Oldendorf's naval invasion force headed for the mouth of Lingayen Gulf on the Island of Luzon, shown to the immediate left of Bagaio. From the mouth of the Gulf, two vertical channels would be swept of mines by the minesweepers, one for landing areas terminating at the base of the Gulf, west on the beach of Lingayen, and one for landing areas terminating east at the town of San Fabian.\n\n**Bombardment**\n\nFrom January 3–9, 1945, the ships of Admiral Oldendorf's invasion force took a lengthy circuitous route through the previously captured islands of Leyte Gulf in the Southeast of the Philippines, shown in blue as the Eastern Visayas in the map at left, and West, South of the Southern Visayas through the Suriago Strait and the Bohol Sea.

A total of 203,608 soldiers were eventually landed over the next few days, establishing a 20 mi (32 km) beachhead, stretching from Sual, and San Fabian at the far East of the map at the base of the Bolianu Peninsula, west to the central Gulf town of Dagupan (XIV Corps), and then to the far Western town of Lingayen.

Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma—landed on the northeastern shores of the gulf, at Agoo, Caba, Santiago and Bauang, where they engaged in a number of relatively minor skirmishes [5] with the

and encountered sparse opposing forces  Lieutenant Commander W R Loud, who commanded the minesweeper force, claimed to have found around ten additional mines in his sweeping efforts by end of day January 7, though intelligence estimates by Philippine resistance may have overestimated the number present [10]  Smith writes that surprisingly, during the 7th, exploratory sweeps during the morning \"turned up only two floating mines and none of the moored type.\" [11]  Both sources seemed to indicate a total of less than 10–12 mines, not a particularly large number for a close approach to a landing area, considering the large numbers soon to be found off the beaches of Iwo Jima As approach channels were swept, buoys were placed to delineate the areas where ships could approach or land safe from the threat of active contact mines.\n\n\nLand battle\nAs shown at left, at 09:30 on 9 January 1945, about 68,000 GIs under General Walter Krueger of the U.S 6th Army—following a devastating naval bombardment—landed at the coast of Lingayen Gulf meeting no opposition A total of 203,608 soldiers were eventually landed over the next few days, establishing a 20 mi (32 km) beachhead,

figure by the town of San Fabian The total number of troops under the command of MacArthur was reported to have even exceeded the number that Dwight D Eisenhower controlled in Europe [16]\n\n\nHeavy losses on land and sea\nDespite their success in driving out the Japanese forces stationed there, the Americans and their mostly Australian allies suffered relatively heavy losses; particularly to their convoys, due to kamikaze attacks While not the highest in U.S casualties, the subsequent Battle for Luzon was the highest net casualty battle U.S forces fought in World War II, with 192,000 to 217,000 Japanese combatants dead, though some sources quote losses as high as 380,000 for the entire conflict including non-combat casualties (mostly from starvation and disease) [17] The battle saw 8,000 American combatants killed, or as many as 10,000 in the entire conflict Total non-combat American casualty estimates have ranged as high as 93,400 among the Sixth Army when illness from disease and non-combat injuries are accounted for [4]  However, to these staggering losses, there must also be added the over 150,000 Filipinos killed, many during the Battle of Manila, but with an overwhelming number of Filipino civilians murdered by Japanese forces, as a result of the Manila massacre of February, 1945 [18]\n\n\nOverview of ships damaged 3–13 January 1945\nDuring the invasion by sea, which is the primary subject of this article, from December 13, 1944 – January 13, 1945, including the time Allied ships entered the Philippines through Leyte Gulf to Lingayen, as well as action taken two weeks before off the Northern Philippine Islands of Mindoro and Marinduque, a total of 24 Allied ships were sunk and another 67 were damaged by kamikazes, though this number includes naval activities off the West coast of Luzon, outside of Lingayen Gulf, off the Philippine Visaya Islands and the Island of Mindoro, which were necessary as preliminaries to secure the Island of Luzon for the invasion force    Ships damaged by kamikazes between 3–11 January on the way to Lingayen included the battleships USS Mississippi, New Mexico and California (the latter was also accidentally hit by friendly fire), the heavy cruiser HMAS Australia, the light cruiser USS Columbia, and the Destroyer minesweepers USS Long and USS Hovey [16] Following the landings, Lingayen Gulf was turned into a vast supply depot for the rest of the war to support the Battle of Luzon.\n\n\nUSS Ommaney Bay sunk\nOn 3 January 1945, the USS Ommaney Bay, a large escort carrier, was severely damaged by a Yokosuka P1Y kamikaze carrying two bombs   At 17:12, the Yokosuka P1Y penetrated a Destroyer screen undetected and made for Ommaney, approaching directly towards the ship's bow Captain Young of the Ommaney later reported that the kamikaze's approach was concealed by the blinding glare of the sun [20]  The Captain, aware of the kamikaze threat, had assigned multiple lookouts throughout the carrier's deck But a lack of radar signals, a common and vexing problem during the battle, had led the task group to believe that the Japanese planes had withdrawn, and the kamikaze attack took the lookouts by complete surprise New Mexico was only able to respond with inaccurate anti-aircraft fire, whilst Ommaney Bay was unable to react at all [21]\n\n\nUSS Manila Bay struck\nIt is strongly speculated by Samuel Eliot Morison that the late afternoon kamikaze strikes on 5 January between 16:51 and 17:50 on the USS Helm, HMAS Arunta, USS Louisville, HMAS Australia, USS Manila Bay, and USS Savo Island came from 16 kamikaze planes and 4 escorts that took off at 15:57 from the Japanese airbase at Mabalacat, formerly Clark Air Base, north of Manila  The attacks occurred West of Luzon about 100 miles off the coast of Corregidor  The air base's relative proximity to the Allied ships insured relatively full tanks, and the tactical training they had received from Commander Tadashi Nakajima in  kamikaze targeting methods, maneuvering and dive strategies increased their chances of making it to their targets and dealing a more damaging strike [27] [28]\n\n\nHMAS Australia struck five times\nThe heavy cruiser HMAS Australia (D84) was the only invasion ship struck five times, though her considerable casualties of forty-four dead and seventy-two wounded were the result of only the first two strikes, of which only the second caused serious damage.\n\n\nLoss of USS Brooks and USS Long\nDeparting New Guinea's Manus Island in late December, while escorting a Leyte-bound convoy, the USS Hovey and the ships of Mine Squadron 2 detached from their charges on January 2, 1945, and shaped a course for Lingayen Gulf, where the group was ordered to sweep the approaches to Lingayen in advance of the first American amphibious landing on Luzon Coming under repeated massed air attack from Japanese kamikaze aircraft while engaged in their sweeps, the Hovey and her sisters spent the time period from January 2 facing frequent fire from Japanese aircraft attempting to repel the invading ships [40]\n\n\nUSS Hovey sinks from aerial torpedo\nWithin two minutes of the torpedo impact, the Hovey's bow section was listing 90 degrees as men stationed there scrambled to abandon the sinking vessel Moments later, a bulkhead gave way and sent the bow vertical in the water where for a few seconds it lingered before plunging to the bottom Hovey's stern remained on an even keel as it slowly swamped, allowing most of the crew and rescued sailors there to get off before it too sank at this location at 04:55 on January 7, 1945 When the Hovey sank, she took 24 of her crew and 24 men from her sister ships USS Long, and USS Brooks with her to the bottom  Five of those lost when the Hovey sank came from the USS Brooks  She sank roughly 20 miles North of the base of the gulf at a depth of 54 fathoms, at 16°20'N   120°10'E  The USS Chandler (DD-206), soon stood by rescuing the survivors of all three ships from the sinking Hovey, a total of 229 crew  Of the 229 men the Chandler rescued from the Hovey, roughly half were likely survivors of the Long, and had escaped from two successively abandoned and badly damaged ships [45] [47]\n\n\nUSS New Mexico struck\nAt 1159 on 6 January 1945, Lieutenant General Herbert Lumsden was killed when a kamikaze struck the bridge of the battleship USS New Mexico (BB-40) He was the most senior British Army combat fatality of World War II Lumsden was British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's personal liaison to General Douglas MacArthur  The ship sustained 30 dead and 87 wounded, when a kamikaze hit her bridge, killing Lumsden and her commanding officer, Captain Robert Fleming Rear Admiral George Weyler, commander of the San Fabian fire support force and previously the commander of the battleship fleet in the Battle of Leyte Gulf a few months earlier, and British Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, commander of the British Pacific Fleet, were in the bridge also, but they were on the starboard side and unharmed They were only a few yards from being killed or seriously wounded [48] [49]\n\n\nUSS California struck\nShortly after 17:15 on 6 January, two kamikaze Zeros approached the USS California  Her gunners shot down one, but the other struck her at port by her mainmast The kamikaze's fuel tanks leaked gasoline, starting a fire and a 5-inch shell from another ship accidentally hit one of her 5-inch guns, which exploded inside the turret, and started another fire The fires were quickly suppressed, but significant casualties resulted, including 44 killed and 155 injured.\n\n\nUSS Louisville hit twice\nRear Admiral Theodore E Chandler, Commander of Cruiser Division 4, died from his wounds on 7 January 1945, a day after the bridge of the heavy cruiser USS Louisville (CA-28), where he was helping to direct operations, was struck a devastating blow by a kamikaze, having received a less damaging strike by a kamikaze on the previous day  Admiral Chandler received a posthumous Navy Cross for his direction of operations aboard the besieged cruiser [19]  Chandler was the highest-ranking U.S Navy flag officer killed in action in World War II The other four admirals who died in World War II due to combat were Rear Admirals Isaac C Kidd, Daniel J Callaghan, Norman Scott, and Henry M Mullinnix.\n\n\nUSS Mississippi struck\nThe USS Mississippi (BB-41) began shelling Japanese positions on the island of Luzon on 6 January 1945 During the bombardment, a Japanese kamikaze struck the ship on 9 January at 13:02, but she remained on station, bombarding the Japanese defenses, until 10 February, when she withdrew to Pearl Harbor for repairs At 13:03, a Japanese Val had struck her on the port side below bridge level, landing on an anti-aircraft gun and toppling over the side  Twenty-three were killed and sixty-three wounded, giving the battleship one of the heavier casualty rate of those struck [52] [53]\n\n\nUSS Belknap struck\nAt 07:53, on 11 January 1945, the Clemson-Class Destroyer USS Belknap was forced to train all her guns on a Japanese kamikaze which eventually crashed her number two stack, nearly disabling her engines, and resulting in the death of 38 and wounding 49 of her crew  These included Underwater Demolition Team 9, on board when she was hit, which cost the team one officer, 7 enlisted, 3 MIA and 13 wounded  Earlier on 3–11 January 1945, she had acted as a shore bombardment and beach reconnaissance vessel at the Lingayen  landings [54]\n\n\nSS Kyle Johnson, David D. Field damaged\nOne of the worst losses of life was suffered by merchant marine vessel SS Kyle V Johnson at 18:30 on January 12, when a kamikaze dive, among a group of 6 attacking enemy planes, started a large fire, killing 120 men  Two of the planes splashed just short of SS David Dudley Field, causing minor engine room damage, but Edward N Wescott received considerable damage from flying debris, wounding six of her merchant seamen, and seven of her Naval armed guard crew [55]   With few enemy planes remaining on Luzon, the kamikazes went after victims of opportunity, the slower, cargo ships, which certainly had poorer air defenses than battleships and cruisers, yet represented a large target, that may have had somewhat limited mobility due to their size, weight, and weather conditions in the Gulf.\n\n\nEscort carrier Salamaua struck\nAt 08:58 on 13 January, the escort carrier USS Salamaua was struck by an unidentified kamikaze who dove almost vertically at too great a speed to give the ship's gunners time to respond  The plane, which plunged through the flight deck, carried two 250 kilogram bombs, one under each wing  One bomb exploded causing fires on the flight deck, hangar deck, and a few additional areas  The second bomb did not explode but penetrated the ship's starboard side at the waterline  With a loss of power communication and steering, fifteen men aboard Salamaua were killed, and eighty-eight wounded  2 Grumman FM-2 fighters and 1 Grumman TBM torpedo bomber were destroyed by the kamikaze attack [26] The starboard engine was lost, and the afterengine room flooded, but anti-aircraft gunners splashed two enemy planes in a period of ten minutes  After temporary repairs, she managed to leave the Gulf under her own power while under the screen of two destroyers and return to Leyte  She was the last vessel to be struck by kamikazes in the Gulf conflict, as after January 12, the Japanese had expended every aircraft they had in the Philippines  Only 47 Japanese planes escaped from the islands, and after January 15, it was believed only ten Japanese planes were left on the entire island of Luzon [56]\n\n\nSuccess of kamikazes\nAccording to several naval historians, kamikazes were likely used more successfully by the Japanese at Lingayen Gulf, and beginning in the last two weeks of December 1944 in the Western Philippine islands of the Visayas and Mindoro, than in any other Pacific conflict with the possible exception of the Battle of Okinawa At least for the kamikaze attacks on January 6 at Lingayen Gulf and likely earlier in the battle, eminent Naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote, they were \"the most effective of the war in relation to the number of planes involved – 28 kamikazes and 15 fighter escorts.\"  Though General McArthur had written that 58 kamikazes were employed on January 6, and 18 fighter escorts, a few more than Morison's estimate, Morison's conclusion as to the effectiveness of kamikazes still seems well taken considering the staggering damage done by roughly 100–200 kamikazes to around 47 ships in the ten days of the battle between January 3 – January 13, shown in the large table below  Those ten days in January 1945 on the way to and within Luzon's Lingayen Gulf resulted in the deaths of around 738 and the wounding of 1282 ship-based seamen, marines, and infantry [57] [58] [59]\n\n\nLuzon kamikazes on 6 January\nSamuel Morison estimated that on 6 January, around twenty-eight kamikaze hit 15 ships, representing a hit rate of nearly 50%, vastly exceeding the 10–15% hit rate of kamikazes throughout the Pacific conflict [61]\nIan Toll wrote that by the morning of 6 January at Mabalacat airfield, \"five derelicts were patched up to the extent that they could take off\", though they were not air bound until around 16:55 that afternoon [62]  Commander Tadashi Nakajima, head of kamikaze operations and training for the Philippines, estimated there were five kamikazes taking off from the nearby Angeles Field at 11:00 that morning, eight more at 10:40 from Echague, just Northeast of the Gulf, and an additional 9 from an airport on Luzon unnamed by Nakajima, bringing the total number to around twenty-seven on 6 January [63] The  single Mabalacat kamikaze departing around midday on 6 January, and those from Angeles and Echague may have been responsible for strikes on any of the ten ships struck around noon that day including the battleship New Mexico or the Destroyers Leary, Sumner, Long or Brooks.\n\n\n30% kamikaze \"hit\" rate, 3–13 Jan 45\nAccording to a U.S Air Force webpage, despite anti-aircraft fire, radar detection, and airborne interception, roughly 14 percent of kamikazes survived to score a hit on a US ship, and nearly 8.5 percent of all ships hit by kamikazes sank [61]  Considering that roughly 150 kamikazes survived to complete around 54 strikes on 47 ships at Lingayen from 3–13 January 1945 at Lingayen, as shown in the table below, this would indicate a \"hit\" rate closer to 30 percent and a sinking rate of ships struck (4 ships sunk/54 strikes) of only around 7.4 percent, though slightly higher, closer to 10%, if the Destroyer Transport Brooks, irreparably damaged and needing to be towed, is counted The sinking rate is slightly skewed as both the Hovey and Palmer were sunk by torpedo or bomb hits, but it may be argued both ships were still struck or nearly struck by kamikazes, as the Hovey certainly was buzzed by a kamikaze, and the \"Betty\" bomber that sunk the Palmer, at 18:35 on 7 January after releasing its bombs, according to Morison,  \"turned as if to attack another ship and splashed\" [67]  Smith suggests that as few as 100 kamikazes were responsible for roughly 30 strikes on Allied ships from 2–8 January, and though this is also a rough approximation, it again represents an approximate \"hit\" rate on allied ships approaching 30% [68]\n\n\n\"Hit\" rate lower at Okinawa\nThough the damaged ships from kamikazes were greater at Okinawa, roughly three times as many, there were at least seven times more aircraft deployed there, as between 6 April and 22 June 1945, the Japanese flew 1,465 kamikaze aircraft in large-scale attacks from Kyushu, and 250 individual kamikaze sorties from Formosa [69]  Morison, an Admiral himself by 1945, and a shrewd observer of Naval tactics, theorized that the better trained Japanese pilots including those using kamikaze tactics had been expended prior to Okinawa, and those trained for the battle there lacked time to gain commensurate skills with those available at the Battle of Lingayen  He wrote, \"Off Okinawa, the Navy would be faced with an even more intensive suicide effort, but by that time the cream of the Kamikaze crop had destroyed itself, and the Allied Navies had additional means of protection\" [70]\n\n\nKamikaze \"hit\" rate, 13 Dec – 13 Jan 45\nRoss further estimated that in the longer period between December 13, 1944, and January 13, 1945, at Lingayen, the island of Luzon and to a smaller extent the Philippine's Visaya Islands, the Japanese lost roughly 200 planes in successful or unsuccessful kamikaze dives on ships  During this month long period, according to Smith, who used data from Morison, kamikazes were almost exclusively responsible for sinking 24 allied ships, heavily damaging 30 and lightly damaging 37  This represents an approximate 200 kamikazes achieving damaging strikes on roughly 91 Allied ships, suggesting a very rough \"hit\" rate approaching 48%, though the figure is likely lower [72] [73]\n\n\nEvasive tactics, armor\nAllied anti-aircraft guns were often ineffective against the kamikazes due to their speed, and maneuverability and because the operators of five inch guns, which used the highly effective proximity fuses, were unable to effectively sight the low angle, carefully maneuvered enemy planes that frequently dove with the sun behind them  Moreover, the projectiles of the typical 20 and 40 mm anti-aircraft guns used in allied ships, \"did not have sufficient explosive power or impact to knock out heavily armored kamikazes\" despite hitting the planes repeatedly with a hail of shells from an individual gun or what might at times even be combined gunfire from more than one ship [74]\n\n\nZeros outperformed US Wildcat fighters\nRear Admiral Calvin T Durgin, who commanded many of the escort carriers partly tasked with launching the fighter aircraft that would provide cover to the advancing ships of the invasion force, noted that his widely used fighter the FM-2 Wildcat, \"showed up inferior to the Japanese Zeke (Zero), not only in speed and maneuver, but in climbing ability in altitudes above 5000 feet; and we had not enough Wildcats.\"   A significant percentage of the Japanese planes used as kamikazes were Zeros, and they could be just as effective acting as escorts to provide cover for Japanese planes that could later be used as kamikazes  As noted by Smith, \"kamikazes continually slipped through the air cover, and the CVE-based (Carrier Escort) planes had knocked down less than half of all Japanese aircraft destroyed from 2 through 6 January Interception, as a result of the Japanese flight tactics and the radar problems, became largely a matter of luck in the Lingayen Gulf area.\" [75]\n\n\nLimitations of radar aided the kamikazes\nThe terrain was mountainous in the Lingayen Gulf area, including near the mouth of the Gulf, at times limiting the ability of radar on the invasion ships, particularly near the mountainous coast of the Gulf, to detect the arrival of kamikazes and their escorts and vector in American fighters to oppose them [76]\n\n\nDetrimental effects of weather and shoals\nThe argument could also be made that once within Lingayen Gulf, the current, shoals, winds, waves, and storms that the Gulf was known for made maneuvering the advancing allied ships somewhat more difficult, and more likely to break formation and become isolated, though the prevailing weather for the advancing convoy west of Luzon was far better than the weather experienced by the fast carriers of Fast Carrier Task Force 38, North and East of Luzon which significantly hampered the operation of their air defenses  According to the observations of the Commander, Carrier Task Force 38, the primary source of fighter cover provided by the Fast carriers, \"At sea,.. strong winds, rough seas, and heavy swells were recorded on 6 January through 9 January (1945) These conditions definitely hampered landing of planes and the work of the deck crews,\" at least for 1–2 days, making air support from sea-based carriers more difficult  As a more general statement of the Fast Carrier Group, TF 38, \"weather conditions on S minus 6 day and S day (from the 3rd to the 9th of January or S-day).. were so poor that the success of our mission was in question much of the time.\" [77]\n\n\nEffects of overcast on January 6\nAccording to the Aerology and Amphibious Warfare report, the Third Amphibious Force's Commander noted \"During the initial stages of the approach to the target cloudy weather and intermittent rain\" prevailed  During the invasion's forces preliminary approach, it was also noted, that \"overcast conditions prevailed due to intermediate type cloudiness, and occasional areas of very light precipitation were encountered.\" [78]  Intermittent rain and cloudy conditions, even if slight, combined with the thick smoke caused by the bombardment groups by mid-day January 6, may have affected visibility at least on the critical days of January 6–7, which would have significantly reduced the ability of ships within the Gulf to sight kamikazes, and to a smaller extent, light to moderate winds may have hampered the maneuverability of smaller ships evading kamikaze attacks, and the wave activity on the East side of the gulf may have somewhat reduced the ability of smaller ships to effectively aim anti-aircraft guns at the enemy Samuel Cox, Director of the Naval History and Heritage Command noted that at least on January 6, and likely intermittently during January 5–7, there was \"an overcast that hampered both U.S and Japanese operations The U.S ships could not see the Japanese aircraft until they broke through the overcast with very little time to react.\" [19]\n\n\nHigh seas slowed landing on January 10\nAs the results of a small typhoon, around January 9–11, though its full effects were felt far to the North of the base of the Gulf, \"By mid-morning (in January 10, the second day of the assault) the 6 to 8 foot surf at the beaches, resulting from the increased swell, had caused landing operations to come to a halt.\"  It was not until the third day of the assault (January 11), that \"the swell diminished and conditions improved rapidly to permit continued landing operations.\"  The slight increase in swells and wind might have partly accounted for the number of larger transport ships struck in the Gulf from January 9–11, as well as the crowding caused by so many large craft at anchor near the base of the Gulf [79]\n\n\nKamikaze training\nCommander Tadashi Nakajima, Operations and Training Officer for the 201st Air Group, responsible for the initiation of Kamikaze tactics in the Philippines, carefully trained kamikaze pilots as to the angle of dive they chose, the targets they selected, and the methods they used to navigate to Allied ships.\n\n\nAngle of dives\nThere were two basic angle of dives strongly preferred in kamikaze training tactics; a high altitude approach, and a low altitude approach A high altitude approach could commence at an altitude as high as 6000–7000 meters, and might begin with an angle of 20 degrees, and then end with a dive angle of 45–55 degrees once reaching 200 meters above a sighted target  These directions were flexible, and required considerable skill to implement  A low altitude approach was ended with a brief climb to 400–500 meters followed by a quick dive  The low altitude approach had the advantage of reduced radar detection and sighting at very low altitudes above the waterline, as Nakajima suggested to his students that a kamikaze might cruise as low as 10–15 meters above the waterline, if they had adequate skill to maintain such a consistently low altitude during their approach.\n\n\nPoints of aim\nKamikaze pilots carried full fuel tanks to increase the odds of starting fires, and usually carried bombs that would be released at a time to maximize the likelihood they would penetrate the decks of their targets  Against Destroyers, other small warships and smaller transports, Nakajima informed his pilots, that \"a hit any place between the bridge and the center of the ship is usually fatal\"  He continued, \"small warships and transports, having no deck protection are extremely vulnerable to aerial attack  A single kamikaze plane could sink such vessels with a single hit.\"  At the Battle of Lingayen Gulf, of the vessels sunk or irreparably damaged, 4 of 5, if the USS Brooks is counted, or 80% were the aging and smaller, Clemson or Wickes Class Destroyers Of the Destroyers sunk, the Long was struck by two separate kamikazes, each time near the bridge, the Belknap was struck amidships near the 2nd stack, and the Brooks was struck port amidships causing fires  Each strike to these heavily damaged destroyers was close or not far from the bridge, the spot suggested by Nakajima's training of kamikaze pilots.\n\n\nVulnerability of minesweepers and destroyers\nThe winds, waves, light rain, and overcast skies would have made smaller craft such as Destroyers and Minesweepers particularly vulnerable to kamikazes as they would experience less stability in rough seas than a larger ship, affecting their maneuverability while under attack  Their smaller size may have made them a more logical target for kamikazes as well, and overcast skies would have given them less time to spot incoming kamikazes from a distance  Unique to the minesweepers, the uneven bottom and shoals of Lingayen, might have increased the time they required to perform mine sweeping duties against mines moored to the bottom, and made their separation from each other and covering ships a greater possibility Of the 47 ships damaged by enemy aircraft or kamikazes, 16 of 47, over 30% were composed of the relatively smaller ships, Destroyers, Destroyer Escorts, and Destroyer/Minesweepers.\n\n\nJapan knew invasion force's destination\nAlso worthy of consideration, the Japanese had determined early in the battle that the destination of most of the forces among the troop ships was the capital city of Manila, where American prisoners of war were held, making it easier to concentrate their forces on the ships heading for the base of Lingayen Gulf, just 100 miles north of the capital  According to Samuel Morison, by January 5, and certainly by mid-day on January 6, perhaps the worst for Allied losses from kamikazes, the Japanese high command were already convinced that \"Lingayen was the American destination\" [84]  Though allowing for the considerable cover provided by allied fighters, originally as many as 240 Japanese planes from Clark, Nichols, and other airfields on Luzon, within striking distance of Lingayen Gulf, \"were committed to the (Lingayen) expeditionary force during the first week of January (1945)\" [85]   Unlike the primary landing area at Lingayen on Luzon, during the Battles for Leyte Gulf, the two primary landing areas for transports on Leyte Island's Dulag and Tacloban, selected from large stretches of coastline, were far less likely to have been previously known to the Japanese.\n\n\nAllied defense against kamikazes\nThe allied ships of the invasion force struggled to find an effective defense against diving kamikazes, but realized their options were limited  Rear Admiral Forest B Royal, stated that \"full power and evasive course, combined with rapid and accurate gunfire, proved to be an effective defense against suicide dives.\"  But Vice Admiral Wilkinson, who generally agreed, added that when considering \"the high speed of the plane as compared with the relatively slow speed of the ship, even at full power, an evasive course is inconsequential.\"  Admiral Kinkaid summarized the best strategy for defense when he stated that a well-trained and skilled pilot who was intent on crashing his plane, \"is almost certain to succeed if unopposed by anti-aircraft fire, regardless of what maneuvers the ship attempts\"  He then added the primary advantage of maneuvering allied ships should be \"to unmask the maximum number of guns, and to present a narrow target in range since an error in judgement by the pilot is more likely to result in overshooting (the targeted allied ship) than in a deflection error\" [88]\n\n\nDefense by Allied ships\nThe allied ships of the invasion force struggled to find an effective defense against diving kamikazes, but realized their options were limited  Rear Admiral Forest B Royal, stated that \"full power and evasive course, combined with rapid and accurate gunfire, proved to be an effective defense against suicide dives.\"  But Vice Admiral Wilkinson, who generally agreed, added that when considering \"the high speed of the plane as compared with the relatively slow speed

ships should be \"to unmask the maximum number of guns, and to present a narrow target in range since an error in judgement by the pilot is more likely to result in overshooting (the targeted allied ship) than in a deflection error\" [88]\n\n\nDefense by Allied aircraft\nIn early 1945, U.S Navy aviator Commander John Thach, already famous for developing effective aerial tactics against the Japanese such as the Thach Weave, developed a defensive strategy against kamikazes called the \"big blue blanket\" to establish Allied air supremacy well away from the carrier force This method recommended combat air patrols (CAP) that were larger and operated further from the carriers than before, a line of picket destroyers and destroyer escorts at least 80 km (50 mi) from the main body of the fleet to provide earlier radar interception and improved coordination between fighter direction officers on carriers This plan also called for around-the-clock fighter patrols over Allied fleets, though the U.S Navy had cut back training of fighter pilots so there were not enough Navy pilots available to counter the kamikaze threat A final element included intensive fighter sweeps over Japanese airfields, and bombing of Japanese runways, using delayed-action bombs to make repairs more difficult [89]  As effective as these methods could be, they had limitations, particularly considering the somewhat limited ability of radar to detect incoming enemy planes, the use of armor on kamikazes, the confusing tactics they used to avoid anti-aircraft fire, and the difficulty in shooting down kamikazes once their dive began.\n\n\nInvasion ships sunk and damaged at Lingayen\nShown at left is the approach route indicated by a solid line, and the return route, indicated by a

acceptance into the surgical residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital (later named Seattle Grace Mercy West, and finally, Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital) During her time as an intern, Grey works alongside fellow physicians Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and George O'Malley (T R Knight), who each struggle to balance their personal lives with hectic schedules and stressful residency requirements During their internship, they are overseen by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a senior resident, who works with attending physicians Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), head of neurosurgery and Meredith's love interest, and Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), head of cardiothoracic surgery and Yang's eventual fiancé Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, is the former lover of Ellis Grey during the first six seasons, Burke, O'Malley, and Stevens all depart the series.\n\n\nSeries synopsis\nGrey's Anatomy chronicles the lives of surgical interns, residents, and attendings at the fictional Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6; Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9; and then Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as the interns progressively evolve into seasoned doctors under the guidance of their residents, attendings, and chiefs of surgery Each episode usually opens with a voice-over narration from Meredith Grey or another season regular, often foreshadowing the episode's theme [7] [8] Each season typically mirrors the physicians' academic year, with each completed year elevating the residents to a higher level in the surgical field [9] The season finale often culminates in a dramatic event, such as a character's death or departure [10] The series focuses on the doctors' professional lives as surgeons, but also gives significant attention to their personal lives [7] Character development and relationships frequently take precedence over medical ethics concerns While the physicians perform intricate surgeries and treat their patients' illnesses, they also exhibit a competitive drive and seek recognition [11]\n\n\nCast, characters, and appearance period\nThis section includes characters who have appeared in the series as credited cast.\n\n\nCast table\nThis

attending general surgeon, in Season 6 [19] The surgical program is initially headed by Richard Webber, the Chief of Surgery, who has a pre-existing personal relationship with Meredith, having had an affair with her mother, famed general surgeon Ellis Grey, when Meredith was a child In Webber's employ are attending neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd, dubbed 'McDreamy' by the residents, and attending cardiothoracic surgeon Preston Burke Shepherd is introduced as Meredith's love-interest, while Burke begins a relationship with Cristina [20]\n\n\nRecurring\nWith the drama's setting being a hospital, numerous medical personnel appear regularly on the show, as well as several other recurring characters Joe (Steven W Bailey), is first shown as the owner of the Emerald City Bar and Grill, across the street from the hospital, which is a common relaxation area for the physicians [21] Also introduced in the pilot, is the legendary former general surgeon, Dr Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), Meredith's Alzheimer's-stricken mother, who appeared on the show until her death in season 3 [17] In the first season, Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), a nurse who appeared on the show occasionally until getting laid off in the merger with Mercy West, [42] engages in a sexual relationship with O'Malley, giving him syphilis [21] Serving as an assistant and secretary to the Chief of Surgery, former nurse Patricia (Robin Pearson Rose), has appeared on the show since its debut [17] Tyler Christian (Moe Irvin), a hospital nurse, makes occasional appearances throughout the series [17] Within the second season, Bailey becomes pregnant by her husband, Tucker Jones (Cress Williams), [56] who makes frequent appearances on Grey's Anatomy, until their divorce in season 5 [41] While Bailey takes a sabbatical, due to her pregnancy, the cheerful Dr Sydney Heron (Kali Rocha), fills her position as the resident supervising Grey, Yang, Stevens, Karev and O'Malley, [57] and makes occasional appearances until the fifth season [31]\n\n\nProduction and development\nShonda Rhimes wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching, [113] and thought it would be interesting to create a show about \"smart women competing against one another\" [114]\n\n\nConception\nShonda Rhimes wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching, [113] and thought it would be interesting to create a show

beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say.\n\n\nFilming locations and techniques\nRhimes initially considered setting the medical drama in her hometown, Chicago, but ultimately decided on Seattle to distinguish Grey's Anatomy from the Chicago-based series ER [135]\n\n\nBroadcast history\nGrey's Anatomy's first season commenced airing as a mid-season replacement to Boston

on how people's perception of the world is created.\n\n\nU.S. television ratings\nGrey's Anatomy has received high viewership and ratings since its debut The first 4 seasons of the program each ranked in the top 10 among all viewers, reaching its peak Nielsen ratings in the second season, attracting an average of 19.44 million viewers per episode, and ranking at #5 overall Following the show's time-slot being relocated, overall rankings steadily declined, dropping below the top 10 in its fifth season Grey's Anatomy made its greatest fall from its sixth to seventh season, slipping from #16 to #31 The series is on a steady decline in terms of overall viewership and rankings, yet Grey's Anatomy still holds value in charts when numbers are pulled from the digital video recorder (DVR) It was the most recorded show between 2007 and 2011, based on cumulative totals, and has been for several years in a row [360]\n\n\nAccolades\nGrey's Anatomy has received numerous awards and nominations since its inception The show has been nominated for 39 Primetime Emmy Awards, having been nominated for at least one every year until 2013 [194] At the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2005, Oh was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, which she went on to be nominated for every year until 2009, and Horton was nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series [194]

proposed spin-off The cast of Grey's Anatomy was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them Pompeo commented that she felt, as the star, she should have been consulted, [451] and Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Stevens [452] The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3, 2007, sees Montgomery take a leave of absence from Seattle Grace Hospital, to visit her best-friend from Los Angeles, Naomi Bennett (Merrin Dungey, later Audra McDonald), a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist While in Los Angeles, she meets

The layers of history have grown pretty dense and rich, and the friendships that form around them as the characters suffer and survive is the glue of the series, and what—despite a few inevitable hit-or-miss patches—elevates it to something special.\n\n## Critical Response\n\nGrey's Anatomy has received widespread critical acclaim for its writing, acting, directing, and cinematography.

He also acquired a stake in the Moscow Jewelry Factory, which specialized in fancy cutting and high-end ideal cuts of larger diamonds. Leviev's business ties in Russia were facilitated by Valery Rudakov, a representative of the Main Directorate of Precious Metals and Diamonds (Glavalmazzolot).\n\n**Political Ties and Activities**\n\nIn the 1990s, Leviev avoided direct involvement with the Yeltsin family, instead nurturing ties with Vladimir Putin. This strategic move helped him establish a strong connection with the Russian government and secured his position as a key player in the country's business landscape.\n\n**Links to Trump Family**\n\nIn 2015, Leviev's company, Africa Israel Investments, sold a $295 million stake in the former New York Times Building on 43rd Street near Times Square to the Kushner Companies, a real estate company led by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law. Later, in 2016, Kushner used this space as a basis for a $285 million loan from Deutsche Bank. The ties between Trump family real estate deals and Russian money interests raised concerns about potential influence peddling and sparked an investigation by the justice department's special counsel, Robert Mueller.\n\n**Israeli Settlements**\n\nLeviev is involved in the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. His company, Danya Cebus, has subcontracted the construction of Mattityahu East to Shaya Boymelgreen, and is building part of Har Homa and Maale Adumim. In 1999, Leviev's company announced plans to build new homes in the settlement of Ariel. Through another subsidiary, LIDAR, Leviev appears to be the sole realtor-developer of the settlement of Zufim.\n\n**Business Interests**\n\nLeviev's business empire extends beyond diamonds and real estate, with interests in chemicals and other sectors. In 2006, he signed an agreement to invest in the incarceration industry, as a concessionaire for the first private prison in Israel. However, the project was later deemed unconstitutional by the Israeli High Court of Justice.\n\n**Debt Restructuring**\n\nFollowing the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Africa Israel Investments defaulted on a series of bonds and restructured 7.4 billion shekels of debt. The company's struggles were exacerbated by the drop in real estate values in the United States, Russia, and eastern Europe.\n\n**Angolan Diamonds**\n\nRoman Abramovich, a Russian billionaire, played a key role in supporting Leviev's entrance into the Angolan diamond market and his subsequent monopoly on diamonds exported from Angola.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nLeviev has been involved in various philanthropic activities, including supporting the Jewish Learning Initiative. He has also been a prominent member of the Bukharian Jewish community and served as president of the World Congress of Bukharian Jews.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nLeviev moved to Hampstead, London, with his wife Olga and their two children in 2007. He is also a keen golfer and maintains a house in the beach resort of Ponte Vedra, Florida.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Africa Israel Investments\n* Danya Cebus\n* LIDAR\n* Russian-Israeli relations\n* Israeli settlement expansion\n* Philanthropy in the Jewish community", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lev_Avnerovich_Leviev\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nLeviev was born in Samarkand, Uzbek SSR in 1956 [4] His family moved to Israel in 1971 where he lived until 2007 when he moved to London [5]  His parents, Avner and Chana Leviev, were prominent members of the Bukharian Jewish community, and Leviev is a practicing Orthodox Jew He is a supporter of the Chabad movement, but as a Bukharian Jew he was brought up in the Bukharian liturgy In 1971, when he was fifteen, his family emigrated from Uzbekistan to Israel [6] Alisher Usmanov's father was the prosecutor in Tashkent who helped facilitate the Leviev's departure for Israel [7]\n\n\nStart in the diamond trade\nShortly after moving to Israel, Leviev began to work as an apprentice in a diamond polishing plant, learning the 11 steps of the diamond cutting process After serving in the communications directorate of the Israel Defense Forces, [6] he established his own diamond polishing plant in 1977 in 1980, he acquired 12 competing factories that suffered from credit shortage due to the recession in the diamond industry The acquisition was done with the help of his father in law's family In 1992, he moved to Russia and purchased Russia's oldest jewelry factory, Ruis Diamonds Ltd of Moscow which specializes in fancy cutting and high-end ideal cuts of larger diamonds and competes with Smolensk Cristal, and the Moscow Jewelry Factory (Russian: Московский ювелирный завод (МЮЗ)) [8] [9] Valery Rudakov (Russian: Валерий Владимирович Рудаков), a representative with the Main Directorate of Precious Metals and Diamonds (Glavalmazzolot) [a] and the former head of the Yakutskalmaz trust, facilitated Leviev's ownership of Ruis Diamonds [5]\n\n\nPolitical ties and activities\nIn the 1990s, Leviev avoided being directly involved with the Yeltsin family, and nurtured ties with Vladimir Putin [10] [11]\n\n\nLinks to Trump family\nAccording to an article published in The Guardian on 24 July 2017, Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner sealed a real estate deal in 2015 worth $295 million to purchase space in the former New York Times Building on 43rd Street near Times Square from Leviev's firms Africa Israel Investments and Five Mile Capital [12] Later, in October 2016, Kushner used this space as a basis for a $285 million loan from Deutsche Bank [12] [13] The ties between Trump family real estate deals and Russian money interests attracted the justice department's special counsel, Robert Mueller while Mueller was investigating alleged Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election [14]\n\n\nIsraeli settlements\nLeviev is involved in the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank  Leviev's Danya Cebus company, a subsidiary of Africa-Israel, subcontracted the construction of Mattityahu East to Shaya Boymelgreen Danya Cebus is also building part of Har Homa and Maale Adumim [15] In 1999, Leviev's company Danya Cebus announced plans to build new homes in the settlement of Ariel [16] Through another subsidiary, LIDAR, Leviev appears to be the sole realtor-developer of the settlement of Zufim [17]\n\n\nBusiness interests\nLeviev is an investor in the diamond industry, real estate and chemicals By an agreement, signed in October 2006, Leviev hoped to get into the incarceration business, as a concessionaire for the first private prison in Israel However, in September 2009, the Israeli High Court of Justice declared private prisons unconstitutional in Israel [25]\n\n\nDebt restructuring\nFollowing the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Africa Israel Investments was hurt by the drop of real estate values in the United States, Russia and eastern Europe It defaulted on a series of bonds and in 2010 it restructured 7.4 billion shekels of debt [32]\n\n\nAngolan diamonds\nRoman Abramovich strongly supported Leviev during Leviev's entrance into the Angolan diamond market and his gaining a monopoly on diamonds exported from Angola [34]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nAfter the Revolutions of 1989, Leviev expanded his business into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union He received the blessings for success in business and personal support of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Schneerson for his philanthropic activities, which include \"an army of some 10,000 Jewish functionaries from Ukraine to Azerbaijan, including 300 rabbis Most of the 300 rabbis are Chabadniks\" -

{"title": "Howard_Hughes", "content": "\nEarly life\nHoward Robard Hughes Jr was the only child of Allene Stone Gano (1883–1922) and of Howard R Hughes Sr (1869–1924), a successful inventor and businessman from Missouri He had English, Welsh and some French Huguenot ancestry, [9] and was a descendant of John Gano (1727–1804), the minister who allegedly baptized George Washington [10] Through John Gano's sister Sussanah, Hughes was a 5th cousin once-removed of the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, who invented the first successful airplane [11]\n\n\nBusiness career\nHughes enjoyed a highly successful business career beyond engineering, aviation and filmmaking; many of his career endeavors involved varying entrepreneurial roles.\n\n\nEntertainment\nRalph Graves persuaded Hughes to finance a short film, Swell Hogan, which Graves had written and would star in Hughes himself produced it When he screened it, he thought it was a disaster After hiring a film editor to try to salvage it, he finally ordered that it be destroyed [21] His next two films, Everybody's Acting (1926) and Two Arabian Knights (1927), achieved financial success; the latter won the first Academy Award for Best Director of a comedy picture [6]: 45–46  The Racket (1928) and The Front Page (1931) were also nominated for Academy Awards.\n\n\nRKO\nFrom the 1940s to the late 1950s, the Hughes Tool Company ventured into the film industry when it obtained partial ownership of the RKO companies, which included RKO Pictures, RKO Studios, a chain of movie theaters known as RKO Theatres and a network of radio stations known as the RKO Radio Network.\n\n\nReal estate\nAccording to Noah Dietrich, \"Land became a principal asset for the Hughes empire\" Hughes acquired 1200 acres in Culver City for Hughes Aircraft, bought 7 sections  [4,480 acres] in Tucson for his Falcon missile-plant, and purchased 25,000 acres near Las Vegas [6]: 103, 254  In 1968, the Hughes Tool Company purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal.\n\n\nAviation and aerospace\nAnother portion of Hughes' commercial interests involved aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries A lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot, Hughes survived four airplane accidents: one in a Thomas-Morse Scout while filming Hell's Angels, one while setting the airspeed record in the Hughes Racer, one at Lake Mead in 1943, and the near-fatal crash of the Hughes XF-11 in 1946 At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including Moye Stephens and J.B Alexander He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading Hughes Aircraft at the airport in Glendale, CA Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the Hughes H-1 Racer On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane airspeed record of 352 mph (566 km/h) over his test course near Santa Ana, California (Giuseppe Motta reaching 362 mph in 1929 and George Stainforth reached 407.5 mph in 1931, both in seaplanes) This marked the last time in history that an aircraft built by a private individual set the world airspeed record A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new transcontinental airspeed record by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in seven hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of nine hours, 27 minutes) His average ground-speed over the flight was 322 mph (518 km/h) [28] [6]: 69–72, 131–135 \n\n\nHughes Aircraft\nIn 1932 Hughes founded the Hughes Aircraft Company, a division of Hughes Tool Company, in a rented corner of a Lockheed Aircraft Corporation hangar in Burbank, California, to build the H-1 racer.\n\n\nRound-the-world flight\nOn July 14, 1938, Hughes set another record by completing a flight around the world in just 91 hours (three days, 19 hours, 17 minutes), [36] beating the previous record of 186 hours (seven days, 18 hours, 49 minutes) set in 1933 by Wiley Post in a single-engine Lockheed Vega by almost four days Hughes returned home ahead of photographs of his flight Taking off from New York City, Hughes continued to Paris, Moscow, Omsk, Yakutsk, Fairbanks, and Minneapolis, then returning to New York City For this flight he flew a Lockheed 14 Super Electra (NX18973, a twin-engine transport with a crew of four) fitted with the latest radio and navigational equipment Harry Connor was the co-pilot, Thomas Thurlow the navigator, Richard Stoddart the engineer, and Ed Lund the mechanic Hughes wanted the flight to be a triumph of U.S aviation technology, illustrating that safe, long-distance air travel was possible Albert Lodwick of Mystic, Iowa, provided organizational skills as the flight operations manager [37] While Hughes had previously been relatively obscure despite his wealth, better known for dating Katharine Hepburn, New York City now gave him a ticker-tape parade in the Canyon of Heroes [38] [6]: 136–139  Hughes and his crew were awarded the 1938 Collier Trophy for flying around the world in record time [39] [40] He was awarded the Harmon Trophy in 1936 [41] and 1938 for the record-breaking global circumnavigation [42]\n\n\nHughes D-2\nDevelopment of the D-2 began around 1937, but little is known about its early gestation because Hughes' archives on the aircraft have not been made public Aircraft historian René Francillon speculates that Hughes designed the aircraft for another circumnavigation record attempt, but the outbreak of World War II closed much of the world's airspace and made it difficult to buy aircraft parts without government approval, so he decided to sell the aircraft to the U.S Army instead In December 1939, Hughes proposed that the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) procure it as a \"pursuit type airplane\" [45]  (i.e a fighter aircraft) It emerged as a two or three-seat twin-boom aircraft powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-2800-49 engines and constructed mostly of Duramold, a type of molded plywood [46] The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF, successor to the USAAC) struggled to define a mission for the D-2, which lacked both the maneuverability of a fighter and the payload of a bomber, and was highly skeptical of the extensive use of plywood; however, the project was kept alive by high-level intervention from General Henry H Arnold [47] The prototype was brought to Harper's Dry Lake in California in great secrecy in 1943 and first flew on June 20 of that year [48] [49] The initial test flights revealed serious flight control problems, so the D-2 returned to the hangar for extensive changes to its wings, and Hughes proposed to redesignate it as the D-5 [49] However, in November 1944, the still-incomplete D-2 was destroyed in a hangar fire reportedly caused by a lightning strike [50]\n\n\nFatal crash of the Sikorsky S-43\nIn the spring of 1943 Hughes spent nearly a month in Las Vegas, test-flying his Sikorsky S-43 amphibious aircraft, practicing touch-and-go landings on Lake Mead in preparation for flying the H-4 Hercules The weather conditions at the lake during the day were ideal and he enjoyed Las Vegas at night On May 17, 1943, Hughes flew the Sikorsky from California, carrying two Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) aviation inspectors, two of his employees, and actress Ava Gardner Hughes dropped Gardner off in Las Vegas and proceeded to Lake Mead to conduct qualifying tests in the S-43 The test flight did not go well The Sikorsky crashed into Lake Mead, killing CAA inspector Ceco Cline and Hughes' employee Richard Felt Hughes suffered a severe gash on the top of his head when he hit the upper control panel and had to be rescued by one of the others on board [51] Hughes paid divers $100,000 to raise the aircraft and later spent more than $500,000 restoring it [52] Hughes sent the plane to Houston, where it remained for many years [6]: 186 \n\n\nHughes XF-11\nActing on a recommendation of the president's son, Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, who had become friends with Hughes, in September 1943 General Arnold issued a directive to order 100 of a reconnaissance development of the D-2, known as the F-11 (XF-11 in prototype form) [53] The project was controversial from the beginning, as the USAAF Air Materiel Command deeply doubted that Hughes Aircraft could fulfill a contract this large, but Arnold pushed the project forward Materiel Command demanded a host of major design changes notably including the elimination of Duramold; Hughes, who sought $3.9 million in reimbursement for sunk costs from the D-2, strenuously objected because this undercut his argument that the XF-11 was a modified D-2 rather than a new design Protracted negotiations caused months of delays but ultimately yielded few design concessions [54] The war ended before the first XF-11 prototype was completed and the F-11 production contract was canceled The XF-11 emerged in 1946 as an all-metal, twin-boom, three-seat reconnaissance aircraft, substantially larger than the D-2 and powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-4360-31 engines, each driving a set of contra-rotating propellers [54] Only two prototypes were completed; the second one had a conventional single propeller per side [55] [56]\n\n\nNear-fatal crash of the XF-11\nHughes was almost killed on July 7, 1946, while performing the first flight of the XF-11 near Hughes Airfield at Culver City, California Hughes extended the test flight well beyond the 45-minute limit decreed by the USAAF, possibly distracted by landing gear retraction problems [57] An oil leak caused one of the contra-rotating propellers to reverse pitch, causing the aircraft to yaw sharply and lose altitude rapidly Hughes attempted to save the aircraft by landing it at the Los Angeles Country Club golf course, but just seconds before reaching the course, the XF-11 started to drop dramatically and crashed in the Beverly Hills neighborhood surrounding the country club [58] [59]\n\n\nH-4 Hercules\nThe War Production Board, a civilian government agency that supervised war production from 1942-45, originally contracted with Henry Kaiser and Hughes to produce the gigantic HK-1 Hercules flying boat for use during World War II to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic as an alternative to seagoing troop transport ships that were vulnerable to German U-boats The military services opposed the project, thinking it would siphon resources from higher-priority programs, but Hughes' powerful allies in Washington, D.C advocated it After disputes, Kaiser withdrew from the project and Hughes elected to continue it as the H-4 Hercules However, the aircraft was not completed until after World War II [72] [73]\n\n\nAirlines\nIn 1939, at the urging of Jack Frye, president of Transcontinental & Western Airlines, the predecessor of Trans World Airlines (TWA), Hughes began to quietly purchase a majority share of TWA stock (78% of stock, to be exact); he took a controlling interest in the airline by 1944 [78] Although he never had an official position with TWA, Hughes handpicked the board of directors, which included Noah Dietrich, and often issued orders directly to airline staff [78] [79] Hughes Tool Co purchased the first six Stratoliners Boeing manufactured Hughes used one personally, and he let TWA operate the other five [6]: 11, 145–148 \n\n\nBusiness with David Charnay\nHughes made numerous business partnerships through his friend, the industrialist and producer David Charnay, [88] [89] beginning with their work on the film The Conqueror (1956) [90] [91] Though the film made money at the box office, its themes, dialogue, and casting were ridiculed It was shot in St George, Utah, which had been badly affected by the testing of more than 100 nuclear bombs Many of the cast and crew were later diagnosed with cancer, leading it to be called an \"RKO Radioactive Picture\" Hughes eventually bought every copy of the film he could, and is reported to have watched the film at home every night in the years before he died [92]\n\n\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute\nIn 1953, Hughes launched the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Miami (currently located in Chevy Chase, Maryland near Washington, D.C.), with the express goal of basic biomedical research, including trying to understand, in Hughes' words, the \"genesis of life itself,\" [citation needed] due to his lifelong interest in science and technology Hughes' first will, which he signed in 1925 at the age of 19, stipulated that a portion of his estate should be used to create a medical institute bearing his name [107] When a major battle with the IRS loomed ahead, Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a for-profit entity of a fully tax-exempt charity Hughes' internist, Verne Mason, who treated Hughes after his 1946 aircraft crash, was chairman of the institute's medical advisory committee [108] The Howard Hughes Medical Institute's new board of trustees sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion, allowing the institute to grow dramatically.\n\n\nGlomar Explorer and the taking of K-129\nIn 1972, during the Cold War era, Hughes was approached by the CIA through his longtime partner, David Charnay, to help secretly recover the Soviet submarine K-129, which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier [110] Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, conducting expensive civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules The recovery plan used the special-purpose salvage vessel Glomar Explorer In the summer of 1974, Glomar Explorer attempted to raise the Soviet vessel [111] [112] However, during the recovery, a mechanical failure in the ship's grapple caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor This section is believed to have held many of the most sought-after items, including its code book and nuclear missiles Two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered, along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony The operation, known as Project Azorian (but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer), became public in February 1975 after secret documents, obtained by burglars of Hughes' headquarters in June 1974, were released [113] Although he lent his name and his company's resources to the operation, Hughes and his companies had no operational involvement in the project The Glomar Explorer was eventually acquired by Transocean, and was sent to the scrap yard in 2015 during a large decline in oil prices [114]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1929, Hughes' wife of four years, Ella, returned to Houston and filed for divorce.\n\n\nEarly romances\nIn 1929, Hughes' wife of four years, Ella, returned to Houston and filed for divorce.\n\n\nLuxury yacht\nIn 1933, Hughes made a purchase of a luxury steam yacht named the Rover, which was previously owned by Scottish shipping magnate James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape Hughes stated that \"I have never seen the Rover but bought it on the blueprints, photographs and the reports of Lloyd's surveyors My experience is that the English are the most honest race in the world.\" [119] Hughes renamed the yacht Southern Cross and later sold her to Swedish entrepreneur Axel Wenner-Gren [120]\n\n\n1936 automobile accident\nOn July 11, 1936, Hughes struck and killed a pedestrian named Gabriel S Meyer with his car at the corner of 3rd Street and Lorraine in Los Angeles [121] After the crash, Hughes was taken to the hospital and certified as sober, but an attending doctor made a note that Hughes had been drinking A witness to the crash told police that Hughes was driving erratically and too fast and that Meyer had been standing in the safety zone of a streetcar stop Hughes was booked on suspicion of negligent homicide and held overnight in jail until his attorney, Neil S McCarthy, obtained a writ of habeas corpus for his release pending a coroner's inquest [122] [123] By the time of the coroner's inquiry, however, the witness had changed his story and claimed that Meyer had moved directly in front of Hughes' car Nancy Bayly (Watts), who was in the car with Hughes at the time of the crash, corroborated this version of the story On July 16, 1936, Hughes was held blameless by a coroner's jury at the inquest into Meyer's death [124] Hughes told reporters outside the inquiry, \"I was driving slowly and a man stepped out of the darkness in front of me\".\n\n\nMarriage to Jean Peters\nOn January 12, 1957, Hughes married actress Jean Peters at a small hotel in Tonopah, Nevada [125] [126] The couple met in the 1940s, before Peters became a film actress [127] They had a highly publicized romance in 1947 and there was talk of marriage, but she said she could not combine it with her career [128] Some later claimed that Peters was \"the only woman  [Hughes] ever loved\", [129] and he reportedly had his security officers follow her everywhere even when they were not in a relationship Such reports were confirmed by actor Max Showalter, who became a close friend of Peters while shooting Niagara (1953) [130] Showalter told an interviewer that because he frequently met with Peters, Hughes' men threatened to ruin his career if he did not leave her alone [130]\n\n\nConnections to Richard Nixon and Watergate\nShortly before the 1960 Presidential election, Richard Nixon was alarmed when it was revealed that his brother, Donald, had received a $205,000 loan from Hughes It has long been speculated [131] that Nixon's drive to learn what the Democrats were planning in 1972 was based in part on his belief that the Democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend Bebe Rebozo had received from Hughes after Nixon took office [132]\n\n\nLast years\nHughes was widely considered eccentric [138] and suffered from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [139] [140]\n\n\nPhysical and mental decline\nHughes was widely considered eccentric [138] and suffered from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [139] [140]\n\n\nLater years in Las Vegas\nThe wealthy and aging Hughes, accompanied by his entourage of personal aides, began moving from one hotel to another, always taking up residence in the top floor penthouse In the last ten years of his life, 1966 to 1976, Hughes lived in hotels in many cities—including Beverly Hills, Boston, Las Vegas, Nassau, Freeport [150] and Vancouver [151]\n\n\nAutobiography hoax\nIn 1972, author Clifford Irving caused a media sensation when he claimed he had co-written an authorized Hughes autobiography Irving claimed he and Hughes had corresponded through the United States mail and offered as proof handwritten notes allegedly sent by Hughes Publisher McGraw-Hill, Inc was duped into believing the manuscript was authentic Hughes was so reclusive that he did not immediately publicly refute Irving's statement, leading many to believe that Irving's book was genuine However, before the book's publication, Hughes finally denounced Irving in a teleconference attended by reporters Hughes knew personally: James Bacon of the Hearst papers, Marvin Miles of the Los Angeles Times, Vernon Scott of UPI, Roy Neal of NBC News, Gene Handsaker of AP, Wayne Thomas of the Chicago Tribune, and Gladwin Hill of the New York Times [168]\n\n\nDeath\nHughes is reported to have died on April 5, 1976, at 1:27 p.m on board an aircraft, Learjet 24B N855W, owned by Robert Graf and piloted by Roger Sutton and Jeff Abrams [172] He was en route from his penthouse at the Acapulco Princess Hotel (now the Princess Mundo Imperial) in Mexico to the Methodist Hospital in Houston [173]\n\n\nAlleged survival\nFollowing his death, Hughes was subject to several widely rebuked conspiracy theories that he had faked his own death A notable allegation came from retired Major General Mark Musick, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, who claimed Hughes went on to live under an assumed identity, dying on November 15, 2001, in Troy, Alabama [179] [180]\n\n\nEstate\nApproximately three weeks after Hughes' death, a handwritten will was found on the desk of an official of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City,

"**Howard Hughes**\n\nHoward Robard Hughes Jr was a renowned American business magnate, investor, aviator, engineer, film producer, and director. He was the president of Hughes Aircraft Company and the chairman of RKO Pictures. During his lifetime, Hughes accumulated a vast fortune, but his personal struggles and eccentricities often overshadowed his achievements.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHughes was born on December 24, 1905, in Houston, Texas, to Allene Stone Gano and Howard R. Hughes Sr. His father was a successful inventor and businessman who had made a fortune in the oil industry. Hughes' ancestry included English, Welsh, and French Huguenot roots. He was a descendant of John Gano, the minister who allegedly baptized George Washington. Hughes' family was considered to be of modest means, but his father's business ventures provided them with a comfortable lifestyle.\n\n**Business Career**\n\nHughes' business career began early, and he quickly made a name for himself in the oil industry. He worked for his father's company, and later, he founded his own business, Hughes Tool Company. The company became a huge success, and Hughes accumulated a vast fortune. He then turned his attention to the aviation industry, founding Hughes Aircraft Company in 1932. The company became a leading manufacturer of aircraft and spacecraft.\n\n**Entertainment**\n\nHughes' passion for filmmaking led him to produce several movies, including \"Hell's Angels,\" \"Scarface,\" and \"The Outlaw.\" His films often featured themes of romance and aviation. In the 1930s, Hughes became involved in the film industry, producing several movies, including \"The Racket\" and \"The Front Page.\" He was a pioneer in the use of special effects and innovative filmmaking techniques.\n\n**RKO**\n\nIn the 1940s, Hughes acquired a majority share of RKO Pictures, and he became the chairman of the company. During his tenure, he produced several films, including \"The Outlaw\" and \"Scarface.\" However, his leadership of RKO was marked by controversy, and he eventually lost control of the company.\n\n**Aviation and Aerospace**\n\nHughes was an accomplished aviator and engineer, and he was involved in several aviation-related projects. He founded the Hughes Aircraft Company, which became a leading manufacturer of aircraft and spacecraft. He also developed several innovative aircraft designs, including the H-1 Racer and the H-4 Hercules. The H-4 Hercules, also known as the \"Spruce Goose,\" was a massive flying boat that Hughes designed and built in the 1940s.\n\n**Round-the-World Flight**\n\nIn 1938, Hughes set a new record for the fastest around-the-world flight, completing the journey in 91 hours. He flew a Lockheed 14 Super Electra, which was equipped with the latest radio and navigational equipment. The flight was a major achievement, and it demonstrated the capabilities of U.S. aviation technology.\n\n**Fatal Crash of the XF-11**\n\nIn 1946, Hughes was involved in a near-fatal crash of the XF-11, a reconnaissance aircraft that he was testing. The crash was caused by an oil leak, and Hughes suffered severe injuries. He was forced to make an emergency landing, and the aircraft crashed in a residential area.\n\n**H-4 Hercules**\n\nThe H-4 Hercules was a massive flying boat that Hughes designed and built in the 1940s. The aircraft was powered by eight Pratt & Whitney R-4360 radial engines, and it had a wingspan of over 320 feet. The H-4 Hercules was designed for transatlantic flights, but it was never completed due to funding issues.\n\n**Airlines**\n\nIn 1939, Hughes began to quietly purchase a majority share of Transcontinental & Western Airlines (TWA). He took a controlling interest in the airline by 1944. Although he never had an official position with TWA, Hughes handpicked the board of directors, which included Noah Dietrich.\n\n**Howard Hughes Medical Institute**\n\nIn 1953, Hughes launched the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which was dedicated to basic biomedical research. The institute was established to advance the understanding of the \"genesis of life itself.\" Hughes' first will, which he signed in 1925, stipulated that a portion of his estate should be used to create a medical institute bearing his name.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nHughes was known for his reclusive and eccentric lifestyle. He was a heavy smoker and drinker, and he had a troubled relationship with women. He married three times, but his marriages were marked by controversy. Hughes was also known for his obsessive-compulsive disorder, which caused him to become fixated on small details.\n\n**Later Years**\n\nIn the 1960s, Hughes' health began to decline, and he became increasingly reclusive. He spent his final years living in hotels, often taking up residence in the top floor penthouse. Hughes died on April 5, 1976, at the age of 70, while on board a private plane. The cause of his death was listed as a heart attack.\n\n**Estate**\n\nAfter Hughes' death, his estate was valued at over $2 billion. He left a significant portion of his estate to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and other charitable organizations. However, his will was disputed, and several lawsuits were filed over the distribution of his assets.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nHoward Hughes was a complex and multifaceted individual who left a lasting legacy in the fields of business, aviation, and filmmaking. His innovative designs and business acumen helped to shape the course of modern industry. Despite his personal struggles and controversies, Hughes remains a fascinating figure, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of entrepreneurs and innovators.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n*

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Howard_Hughes\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHoward Robard Hughes Jr was the only child of Allene Stone Gano (1883–1922) and of Howard R Hughes Sr (1869–1924), a successful inventor and businessman from Missouri He had English, Welsh and some French Huguenot ancestry, [9] and was a descendant of John Gano (1727–1804), the minister who allegedly baptized George Washington [10] Through John Gano's sister Sussanah, Hughes was a 5th cousin once-removed of the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, who invented the first successful airplane [11]\n\n\nBusiness career\nHughes enjoyed a highly successful business career beyond engineering, aviation and filmmaking; many of his career endeavors involved varying entrepreneurial roles.\n\n\nEntertainment\nRalph Graves persuaded Hughes to finance a short film, Swell Hogan, which Graves had written and would star in Hughes himself produced it When he screened it, he thought it was a disaster After hiring a film editor to try to salvage it, he finally ordered that it be destroyed [21] His next two films, Everybody's Acting (1926) and Two Arabian Knights (1927), achieved financial success; the latter won the first Academy Award for Best Director of a comedy picture [6]: 45–46  The Racket (1928) and The Front Page (1931) were also nominated for Academy Awards.\n\n\nRKO\nFrom the 1940s to the late 1950s, the Hughes Tool Company ventured into the film industry when it obtained partial ownership of the RKO companies, which included RKO Pictures, RKO Studios, a chain of movie theaters known as RKO Theatres and a network of radio stations known as the RKO Radio Network.\n\n\nReal estate\nAccording to Noah Dietrich, \"Land became a principal asset for the Hughes empire\" Hughes acquired 1200 acres in Culver City for Hughes Aircraft, bought 7 sections  [4,480 acres] in Tucson for his Falcon missile-plant, and purchased 25,000 acres near Las Vegas [6]: 103, 254  In 1968, the Hughes Tool Company purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal.\n\n\nAviation and aerospace\nAnother portion of Hughes' commercial interests involved aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries A lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot, Hughes survived four airplane accidents: one in a Thomas-Morse Scout while filming Hell's Angels, one while setting the airspeed record in the Hughes Racer, one at Lake Mead in 1943, and the near-fatal crash of the Hughes XF-11 in 1946 At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including Moye Stephens and J.B Alexander He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading Hughes Aircraft at the airport in Glendale, CA Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the Hughes H-1 Racer On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane airspeed record of 352 mph (566 km/h) over his test course near Santa Ana, California (Giuseppe Motta reaching 362 mph in 1929 and George Stainforth reached 407.5 mph in 1931, both in seaplanes) This marked the last time in history that an aircraft built by a private individual set the world airspeed record A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new transcontinental airspeed record by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in seven hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of nine hours, 27 minutes) His average ground-speed over the flight was 322 mph (518 km/h) [28] [6]: 69–72, 131–135 \n\n\nHughes Aircraft\nIn 1932 Hughes founded the Hughes Aircraft Company, a division of Hughes Tool Company, in a rented corner of a Lockheed Aircraft Corporation hangar in Burbank, California, to build the H-1 racer.\n\n\nRound-the-world flight\nOn July 14, 1938, Hughes set another record by completing a flight around the world in just 91 hours (three days, 19 hours, 17 minutes), [36] beating the previous record of 186 hours (seven days, 18 hours, 49 minutes) set in 1933 by Wiley Post in a single-engine Lockheed Vega by almost four days Hughes returned home ahead of photographs of his flight Taking off from New York City, Hughes continued to Paris, Moscow, Omsk, Yakutsk, Fairbanks, and Minneapolis, then returning to New York City For this flight he flew a Lockheed 14 Super Electra (NX18973, a twin-engine transport with a crew of four) fitted with the latest radio and navigational equipment Harry Connor was the co-pilot, Thomas Thurlow the navigator, Richard Stoddart the engineer, and Ed Lund the mechanic Hughes wanted the flight to be a triumph of U.S aviation technology, illustrating that safe, long-distance air travel was possible Albert Lodwick of Mystic, Iowa, provided organizational skills as the flight operations manager [37] While Hughes had previously been relatively obscure despite his wealth, better known for dating Katharine Hepburn, New York City now gave him a ticker-tape parade in the Canyon of Heroes [38] [6]: 136–139  Hughes and his crew were awarded the 1938 Collier Trophy for flying around the world in record time [39] [40] He was awarded the Harmon Trophy in 1936 [41] and 1938 for the record-breaking global circumnavigation [42]\n\n\nHughes D-2\nDevelopment of the D-2 began around 1937, but little is known about its early gestation because Hughes' archives on the aircraft have not been made public Aircraft historian René Francillon speculates that Hughes designed the aircraft for another circumnavigation record attempt, but the outbreak of World War II closed much of the world's airspace and made it difficult to buy aircraft parts without government approval, so he decided to sell the aircraft to the U.S Army instead In December 1939, Hughes proposed that the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) procure it as a \"pursuit type airplane\" [45]  (i.e a fighter aircraft) It emerged as a two or three-seat twin-boom aircraft powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-2800-49 engines and constructed mostly of Duramold, a type of molded plywood [46] The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF, successor to the USAAC) struggled to define a mission for the D-2, which lacked both the maneuverability of a fighter and the payload of a bomber, and was highly skeptical of the extensive use of plywood; however, the project was kept alive by high-level intervention from General Henry H Arnold [47] The prototype was brought to Harper's Dry Lake in California in great secrecy in 1943 and first flew on June 20 of that year [48] [49] The initial test flights revealed serious flight control problems, so the D-2 returned to the hangar for extensive changes to its wings, and Hughes proposed to redesignate it as the D-5 [49] However, in November 1944, the still-incomplete D-2 was destroyed in a hangar fire reportedly caused by a lightning strike [50]\n\n\nFatal crash of the Sikorsky S-43\nIn the spring of 1943 Hughes spent nearly a month in Las Vegas, test-flying his Sikorsky S-43 amphibious aircraft, practicing touch-and-go landings on Lake Mead in preparation for flying the H-4 Hercules The weather conditions at the lake during the day were ideal and he enjoyed Las Vegas at night On May 17, 1943, Hughes flew the Sikorsky from California, carrying two Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) aviation inspectors, two of his employees, and actress Ava Gardner Hughes dropped Gardner off in Las Vegas and proceeded to Lake Mead to conduct qualifying tests in the S-43 The test flight did not go well The Sikorsky crashed into Lake Mead, killing CAA inspector Ceco Cline and Hughes' employee Richard Felt Hughes suffered a severe gash on the top of his head when he hit the upper control panel and had to be rescued by one of the others on board [51] Hughes paid divers $100,000 to raise the aircraft and later spent more than $500,000 restoring it [52] Hughes sent the plane to Houston, where it remained for many years [6]: 186 \n\n\nHughes XF-11\nActing on a recommendation of the president's son, Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, who had become friends with Hughes, in September 1943 General Arnold issued a directive to order 100 of a reconnaissance development of the D-2, known as the F-11 (XF-11 in prototype form) [53] The project was controversial from the beginning, as the USAAF Air Materiel Command deeply doubted that Hughes Aircraft could fulfill a contract this large, but Arnold pushed the project forward Materiel Command demanded a host of major design changes notably including the elimination of Duramold; Hughes, who sought $3.9 million in reimbursement for sunk costs from the D-2, strenuously objected because this undercut his argument that the XF-11 was a modified D-2 rather than a new design Protracted negotiations caused months of delays but ultimately yielded few design concessions [54] The war ended before the first XF-11 prototype was completed and the F-11 production contract was canceled The XF-11 emerged in 1946 as an all-metal, twin-boom, three-seat reconnaissance aircraft, substantially larger than the D-2 and powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-4360-31 engines, each driving a set of contra-rotating propellers [54] Only two prototypes were completed; the second one had a conventional single propeller per side [55] [56]\n\n\nNear-fatal crash of the XF-11\nHughes was almost killed on July 7, 1946, while performing the first flight of the XF-11 near Hughes Airfield at Culver City, California Hughes extended the test flight well beyond the 45-minute limit decreed by the USAAF, possibly distracted by landing gear retraction problems [57] An oil leak caused one of the contra-rotating propellers to reverse pitch, causing the aircraft to yaw sharply and lose altitude rapidly Hughes attempted to save the aircraft by landing it at the Los Angeles Country Club golf course, but just seconds before reaching the course, the XF-11 started to drop dramatically and crashed in the Beverly Hills neighborhood surrounding the country club [58] [59]\n\n\nH-4 Hercules\nThe War Production Board, a civilian government agency that supervised war production from 1942-45, originally contracted with Henry Kaiser and Hughes to produce the gigantic HK-1 Hercules flying boat for use during World War II to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic as an alternative to seagoing troop transport ships that were vulnerable to German U-boats The military services opposed the project, thinking it would siphon resources from higher-priority programs, but Hughes' powerful allies in Washington, D.C advocated it After disputes, Kaiser withdrew from the project and Hughes elected to continue it as the H-4 Hercules However, the aircraft was not completed until after World War II [72] [73]\n\n\nAirlines\nIn 1939, at the urging of Jack Frye, president of Transcontinental & Western Airlines, the predecessor of Trans World Airlines (TWA), Hughes began to quietly purchase a majority share of TWA stock (78% of stock, to be exact); he took a controlling interest in the airline by 1944 [78] Although he never had an official position with TWA, Hughes handpicked the board of directors, which included Noah Dietrich, and often issued orders directly to airline staff [78] [79] Hughes Tool Co purchased the first six Stratoliners Boeing manufactured Hughes used one personally, and he let TWA operate the other five [6]: 11, 145–148 \n\n\nBusiness with David Charnay\nHughes made numerous business partnerships through his friend, the industrialist and producer David Charnay, [88] [89] beginning with their work on the film The Conqueror (1956) [90] [91] Though the film made money at the box office, its themes, dialogue, and casting were ridiculed It was shot in St George, Utah, which had been badly affected by the testing of more than 100 nuclear bombs Many of the cast and crew were later diagnosed with cancer, leading it to be called an \"RKO Radioactive Picture\" Hughes eventually bought every copy of the film he could, and is reported to have watched the film at home every night in the years before he died [92]\n\n\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute\nIn 1953, Hughes launched the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Miami (currently located in Chevy Chase, Maryland near Washington, D.C.), with the express goal of basic biomedical research, including trying to understand, in Hughes' words, the \"genesis of life itself,\" [citation needed] due to his lifelong interest in science and technology Hughes' first will, which he signed in 1925 at the age of 19, stipulated that a portion of his estate should be used to create a medical institute bearing his name [107] When a major battle with the IRS loomed ahead, Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a for-profit entity of a fully tax-exempt charity Hughes' internist, Verne Mason, who treated Hughes after his 1946 aircraft crash, was chairman of the institute's medical advisory committee [108] The Howard Hughes Medical Institute's new board of trustees sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion, allowing the institute to grow dramatically.\n\n\nGlomar Explorer and the taking of K-129\nIn 1972, during the Cold War era, Hughes was approached by the CIA through his longtime partner, David Charnay, to help secretly recover the Soviet submarine K-129, which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier [110] Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, conducting expensive civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules The recovery plan used the special-purpose salvage vessel Glomar Explorer In the summer of 1974, Glomar Explorer attempted to raise the Soviet vessel [111] [112] However, during the recovery, a mechanical failure in the ship's grapple caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor This section is believed to have held many of the most sought-after items, including its code book and nuclear missiles Two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered, along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony The operation, known as Project Azorian (but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer), became public in February 1975 after secret documents, obtained by burglars of Hughes' headquarters in June 1974, were released [113] Although he lent his name and his company's resources to the operation, Hughes and his companies had no operational involvement in the project The Glomar Explorer was eventually acquired by Transocean, and was sent to the scrap yard in 2015 during a large decline in oil prices [114]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1929, Hughes' wife of four years, Ella, returned to Houston and filed for divorce.\n\n\nEarly romances\nIn 1929, Hughes' wife of four years, Ella, returned to Houston and filed for divorce.\n\n\nLuxury yacht\nIn 1933, Hughes made a purchase of a luxury steam yacht named the Rover, which was previously owned by Scottish shipping magnate James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape Hughes stated that \"I have never seen the Rover but bought it on the blueprints, photographs and the reports of Lloyd's surveyors My experience is that the English are the most honest race in the world.\" [119] Hughes renamed the yacht Southern Cross and later sold her to Swedish entrepreneur Axel Wenner-Gren [120]\n\n\n1936 automobile accident\nOn July 11, 1936, Hughes struck and killed a pedestrian named Gabriel S Meyer with his car at the corner of 3rd Street and Lorraine in Los Angeles [121] After the crash, Hughes was taken to the hospital and certified as sober, but an attending doctor made a note that Hughes had been drinking A witness to the crash told police that Hughes was driving erratically and too fast and that Meyer had been standing in the safety zone of a streetcar stop Hughes was booked on suspicion of negligent homicide and held overnight in jail until his attorney, Neil S McCarthy, obtained a writ of habeas corpus for his release pending a coroner's inquest [122] [123] By the time of the coroner's inquiry, however, the witness had changed his story and claimed that Meyer had moved directly in front of Hughes' car Nancy Bayly (Watts), who was in the car with Hughes at the time of the crash, corroborated this version of the story On July 16, 1936, Hughes was held blameless by a coroner's jury at the inquest into Meyer's death [124] Hughes told reporters outside the inquiry, \"I was driving slowly and a man stepped out of the darkness in front of me\".\n\n\nMarriage to Jean Peters\nOn January 12, 1957, Hughes married actress Jean Peters at a small hotel in Tonopah, Nevada [125] [126] The couple met in the 1940s, before Peters became a film actress [127] They had a highly publicized romance in 1947 and there was talk of marriage, but she said she could not combine it with her career [128] Some later claimed that Peters was \"the only woman  [Hughes] ever loved\", [129] and he reportedly had his security officers follow her everywhere even when they were not in a relationship Such reports were confirmed by actor Max Showalter, who became a close friend of Peters while shooting Niagara (1953) [130] Showalter told an interviewer that because he frequently met with Peters, Hughes' men threatened to ruin his career if he did not leave her alone [130]\n\n\nConnections to Richard Nixon and Watergate\nShortly before the 1960 Presidential election, Richard Nixon was alarmed when it was revealed that his brother, Donald, had received a $205,000 loan from Hughes It has long been speculated [131] that Nixon's drive to learn what the Democrats were planning in 1972 was based in part on his belief that the Democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend Bebe Rebozo had received from Hughes after Nixon took office [132]\n\n\nLast years\nHughes was widely considered eccentric [138] and suffered from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [139] [140]\n\n\nPhysical and mental decline\nHughes was widely considered eccentric [138] and suffered from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [139] [140]\n\n\nLater years in Las Vegas\nThe wealthy and aging Hughes, accompanied by his entourage of personal aides, began moving from one hotel to another, always taking up residence in the top floor penthouse In the last ten years of his life, 1966 to 1976, Hughes lived in hotels in many cities—including Beverly Hills, Boston, Las Vegas, Nassau, Freeport [150] and Vancouver [151]\n\n\nAutobiography hoax\nIn 1972, author Clifford Irving caused a media sensation when he claimed he had co-written an authorized Hughes autobiography Irving claimed he and Hughes had corresponded through the United States mail and offered as proof handwritten notes allegedly sent by Hughes Publisher McGraw-Hill, Inc was duped into believing the manuscript was authentic Hughes was so reclusive that he did not immediately publicly refute Irving's statement, leading many to believe that Irving's book was genuine However, before the book's publication, Hughes finally denounced Irving in a teleconference attended by reporters Hughes knew personally: James Bacon of the Hearst papers, Marvin Miles of the Los Angeles Times, Vernon Scott of UPI, Roy Neal of NBC News, Gene Handsaker of AP, Wayne Thomas of the Chicago Tribune, and Gladwin Hill of the New York Times [168]\n\n\nDeath\nHughes is reported to have died on April 5, 1976, at 1:27 p.m on board an aircraft, Learjet 24B N855W, owned by Robert Graf and piloted by Roger Sutton and Jeff Abrams [172] He was en route from his penthouse at the Acapulco Princess Hotel (now the Princess Mundo Imperial) in Mexico to the Methodist Hospital in Houston [173]\n\n\nAlleged survival\nFollowing his death, Hughes was subject to several widely rebuked conspiracy theories that he had faked his own death A notable allegation came from retired Major General Mark Musick, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, who claimed Hughes went on to live under an assumed identity, dying on November 15, 2001, in Troy, Alabama [179] [180]\n\n\nEstate\nApproximately three weeks after Hughes' death, a handwritten will was found on the desk of an official of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, Utah The so-called \"Mormon Will\" gave $1.56 billion to various charitable organizations (including $625 million to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute), nearly $470 million to the upper management in Hughes' companies and to his aides, $156 million to first cousin William Lummis, and $156 million split equally between his two ex-wives Ella Rice and Jean Peters.\n\n\nAwards\nThe moving image collection of Howard Hughes is held at the Academy Film Archive The collection consists of

He is known for his exquisite and highly realistic depictions of domestic scenes, as well as his use of light and color. Despite his relatively small output of paintings, Vermeer's works have had a profound influence on the development of Western art. In this article, we will explore Vermeer's life, his artistic style, and his legacy.\n\n**Pronunciation of Name**\n\nThe pronunciation of Vermeer's name can vary depending on the language and region. In Dutch, Vermeer is pronounced [vərˈmeːr], and Johannes Vermeer is pronounced [joːˈɦɑnəs fərˈmeːr], with /v/ assimilating to the preceding voiceless /s/ as [f]. The usual English pronunciation is /vərˈmɪər/ vər-MEER, with /vɜːrˈmɪər/ vur-MEER, with a long first vowel, occurring in the UK. Other pronunciations, such as /vərˈmɛər/ vər-MAIR and /vɛərˈmɪər/ vair-MAIR, are also documented.\n\n**Life**\n\nRelatively little was known about Vermeer's life until recently. He seems to have been devoted exclusively to his art, living out his life in the city of Delft. Until the 19th century, the only sources of information were a few registers, official documents, and comments by other artists; for this reason, Thoré-Bürger named him \"The Sphinx of Delft.\" John Michael Montias added details on the family from the city archives of Delft in his Artists and Artisans in Delft: A Socio-Economic Study of the Seventeenth Century (1982).\n\n**Youth and Heritage**\n\nJohannes Vermeer was baptized within the Reformed Church on 31 October 1632. His mother, Digna Baltens, was from Antwerp, and his father, Reijnier Janszoon, was a middle-class worker of silk or caffa. As an apprentice in Amsterdam, Reijnier lived on fashionable Sint Antoniesbreestraat, a street with many resident painters at the time. In 1615, Reijnier married Digna, and the couple moved to Delft. They had a daughter named Gertruy who was baptized in 1620. In 1625, Reijnier was involved in a fight with a soldier named Willem van Bylandt who died from his wounds five months later. Around this time, Reijnier began dealing in paintings. In 1631, he leased an inn, which he called \"The Flying Fox.\" In 1635, he lived on Voldersgracht 25 or 26. In 1641, he bought a larger inn on the market square, named after the Flemish town \"Mechelen.\"\n\n**Marriage and Family**\n\nIn April 1653, Johannes Reijniersz Vermeer married a Catholic woman, Catharina Bolnes. The blessing took place in the quiet nearby village of Schipluiden. Vermeer's new mother-in-law, Maria Thins, was initially opposed to the marriage as she was significantly wealthier than he, and it was probably she who insisted that Vermeer convert to Catholicism before the marriage on 5 April. The fact that Vermeer's father was in considerable debt also did not help in discussions on the marriage. Leonaert Bramer, who was Catholic himself, put in a good word for Vermeer and it was this that led Maria to drop her oppositions. According to art historian Walter Liedtke, Vermeer's conversion seems to have been made with conviction. His painting The Allegory of Faith, made between 1670 and 1672, placed less emphasis on the artists' usual naturalistic concerns and more on symbolic religious applications, including the sacrament of the Eucharist. At some point, the couple moved in with Catharina's mother, who lived in a rather spacious house at Oude Langendijk, almost next to a hidden Jesuit church. There Vermeer lived for the rest of his life, producing paintings in the front room on the second floor. His wife gave birth to 15 children, four of whom were buried before being baptized but were registered as \"child of Johan Vermeer.\"\n\n**Career**\n\nIt is unclear where and with whom Vermeer apprenticed as a painter. There is some speculation that Carel Fabritius may have been his teacher, based upon a controversial interpretation of a text written in 1668 by printer Arnold Bon. Local authority Leonaert Bramer acted as a friend, but his style of painting is rather different from Vermeer's. Liedtke suggests that Vermeer taught himself using information from one of his father's connections. Some scholars think that Vermeer was trained under Catholic painter Abraham Bloemaert. Vermeer's style is similar to that of some of the Utrecht Caravaggists, whose works are depicted as paintings-within-paintings in the backgrounds of several of his compositions.\n\n**Wars and Death**\n\nIn 1672, a severe economic downturn known as the Rampjaar struck the Dutch Republic, after French troops led by Louis XIV invaded the country from the south during the Franco-Dutch War. At the same time, troops from Münster and Cologne invaded the country from the east, causing more destruction. Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops, and schools were closed. Vermeer's sale of a painting that year was his last. Five years passed before circumstances improved. In 1674, Vermeer was listed as a member of the civic guards. In the summer of 1675, Vermeer borrowed 1,000 guilders in Amsterdam from Jacob Romboutsz, an Amsterdam silk trader, using his mother-in-law's property as a surety.\n\n**Style**\n\nVermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (\"grisaille\") or a limited palette of browns and greys (\"dead coloring\"), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows, and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.\n\n**Painting Materials**\n\nOne aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments. He is best known for his frequent use of the very expensive ultramarine (The Milkmaid) and also lead-tin-yellow (A Lady Writing a Letter), madder lake (Christ in the House of Martha and Mary), and vermilion. He also painted with ochres, bone black, and azurite. The claim that he used Indian yellow in Woman Holding a Balance has been disproven by pigment analysis.\n\n**Theories of Mechanical Aid**\n\nVermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost photorealistic attention to detail, despite Vermeer having had no formal training and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.\n\n**Works**\n\nIt is believed Vermeer produced a total of fewer than 50 paintings, of which 34 have survived. Only three Vermeer paintings were dated by the artist: The Procuress (1656; Gemäldegalerie, Dresden); The Astronomer (1668; Musée du Louvre, Paris); and The Geographer (1669; Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt).\n\n**Legacy**\n\nOriginally, Vermeer's works were largely overlooked by art historians for two centuries after his death. A select number of connoisseurs in the Netherlands did appreciate his work, yet even so, many of his works were attributed to then better-known artists such as Metsu or Mieris. The Delft master's modern rediscovery began about 1860, when German museum director Gustav Waagen saw The Art of Painting in the Czernin gallery in Vienna and recognized the work as a Vermeer, though it was attributed to Pieter de Hooch at that time. Research by Théophile Thoré-Bürger culminated in the publication of his catalogue raisonné of Vermeer's works in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts in 1866. Thoré-Bürger's catalogue drew international attention to Vermeer and listed more than 70 works by him, including many that Thoré-Bürger regarded as uncertain.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nVermeer's reputation and works have been featured in both literature and in films. Tracy Chevalier's novel Girl with a Pearl Earring (1999) and the 2003 film of the same name present a fictional account of Vermeer's creation of the famous painting and his relationship with the equally fictional model.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Johannes_Vermeer\" following this outline:\n\n\nPronunciation of name\nIn Dutch, Vermeer is pronounced  [vərˈmeːr], and Johannes Vermeer as  [joːˈɦɑnəs fərˈmeːr], with /v/ assimilating to the preceding voiceless /s/ as  [f] The usual English pronunciation is /vərˈmɪər/ vər-MEER, with /vɜːrˈmɪər/ vur-MEER, with a long first vowel, occurring in the UK [8] [9] [10] /vərˈmɛər/ vər-MAIR is also documented [8] [9] [11] [12] Another pronunciation, /vɛərˈmɪər/ vair-MAIR, is attested from the UK [13]\n\n\nLife\nRelatively little was known about Vermeer's life until recently [14] He seems to have been devoted exclusively to his art, living out his life in the city of Delft Until the 19th century, the only sources of information were a few registers, official documents, and comments by other artists;

Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976, [6] though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-serving members and have performed on all of their releases.\n\n\nRecord contract and early releases (1978–1981)\nOn New Year's Eve, 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a four-song demo at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge [14] Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs, [14] the band gave a copy to Neal Kay, who, at the time, was managing a heavy metal club called \"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\" [15] After hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \"Prowler\", eventually went to number 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine [16] A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band's manager [17] As Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club [18] Featuring only three tracks (one song, \"Strange World\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production), [19] all 5,000 copies sold out within weeks [16]\n\n\nSuccess (1981–1985)\nBy 1981, Paul Di'Anno was demonstrating increasingly erratic behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage, [3] about which Di'Anno comments, \"It wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day .. the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it I knew I'd never last the whole tour It was too much\" [38] Di'Anno was dismissed following the Killer World Tour [39] with the band already having selected his replacement [40] After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the Reading Festival, [41] Bruce Dickinson, formerly of Samson, auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired [40] The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy and a one-off show at the Rainbow Theatre in the UK [39] For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played \"Children of the Damned\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue\", introducing fans to their new material [42]\n\n\nExperimentation (1986–1989)\nReturning from their time off, the band added different musical elements to their 1986 studio album, Somewhere in Time These focused on synthesised bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound [77] The release performed well across the world, particularly the single \"Wasted Years\", but included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band [78] The album was the band's biggest American chart success to date, reaching number 11 on the Billboard 200 [36] and number 2 in the UK charts [73] [79] The Somewhere on Tour was also a success The band played 157 shows for over two and a half million fans, including eighty-one shows in North America Once again, Iron Maiden visited Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia to play for tens of thousands of fans in each country [80] The experimentation evident on Somewhere in Time continued on their next album, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which was released in 1988 A concept album recorded at Musicland Studios in Munich [81] and based on the 1987 novel Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card, [82] it was the band's first record to include keyboards, which were performed by Harris and Smith [82] Dickinson's enthusiasm was also renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album [83] Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit number 1 in the UK charts [84] and reached number 12 on the Billboard 200 [36]\n\n\nUpheaval (1989–1994)\nDuring a break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP, entitled Silver and Gold [89] Vocalist Bruce Dickinson also began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing Tattooed Millionaire in 1990, [90] followed by a tour [91] At the same time, to mark the band's 10-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, The First Ten Years, a series of 10 CDs and double 12-inch singles Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one by one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides [29]\n\n\nDifficulties (1994–1999)\nIn 1994, the title track from the Fear of the Dark album received a Grammy Awards nomination for \"Best Metal Performance\", a first for Iron Maiden [108] The band listened to the thousands of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band Wolfsbane, who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them [109] Harris' preferred choice from the outset, [110] Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor and ultimately received a mixed reception among fans [111]\n\n\nReunion and renewed success (1999–2005)\nThe band entered into talks with Dickinson, who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999, [125] along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later [126] With Gers remaining, Iron Maiden now had a three-guitar line-up (nicknamed \"The Three Amigos\"), and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour [127] Dubbed The Ed Hunter Tour, it tied in with the band's newly released greatest hits collection, Ed Hunter, whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group's website, and also contained a computer game starring Eddie, the band's mascot [128]\n\n\nContinued success and expanded tours (2005–2014)\nAt the end of 2005, Iron Maiden began work on A Matter of Life and Death, their fourteenth studio album, which was released in autumn 2006 War and religion are recurring themes in the lyrics and the cover artwork [155] The release was a critical and commercial success, marking the band's first top ten on the Billboard 200 and debuting at number one in the album charts of 13 countries [156] [29] The supporting tour saw mixed critical reception, [157] but included the band's first performance in Dubai at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival for 25,000 people, [158] followed by a concert in Bangalore Palace Grounds, the first of any heavy metal band in India [159] [158] The band then played a string of European dates, including an appearance at Download Festival, their fourth headline performance at Donington Park, [160] to approximately 80,000 people [161]\n\n\nLatest albums and tours (2015–present)\nThe band's 2015 album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September [194] The band's first original studio album not to be issued by EMI outside North America, following Parlophone's acquisition by Warner Music Group in 2013, [195] it was a critical and commercial success, becoming the band's fifth UK number 1 album [196] and hit number 4 on Billboard 200 in the US The new release reached the number one position in the album charts of 43 countries [197] The new record was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios in late summer 2014; [198] its closing song, \"Empire of the Clouds\", penned by Dickinson, surpassed \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (from 1984's Powerslave) as Iron Maiden's longest song, at 18 minutes in length [194]\n\n\nImage and legacy\nIron Maiden have received numerous nominations, honours and awards including Grammy Awards [221] and equivalents awards in many countries, [222] [223] Brit Awards, [224] Ivor Novello Awards, [225] and Juno Awards [226] They have ranked highly in many polls of the greatest metal artists of all time [227] [228] [229] [29] In 2012 The Number of the Beast was voted as Best British Album Ever by the British public as part of Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee celebrations [230] Iron Maiden have an exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, [231] and Rock in Rio Wall of Fame [232]\n\n\nInfluence on other artists and the genre\nIron Maiden have influenced numerous artists and bands representing different genres of rock and metal music Kiss co-founder Paul Stanley said Iron Maiden \"have helped spawn an entire genre of music\" and influenced literally thousands of other artists [261] [262] According to Guitar World, Iron Maiden's music has \"influenced generations of newer metal acts, from legends like Metallica to current stars like Avenged Sevenfold.\" [263] Metallica members Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Jason Newsted have cited Iron Maiden as a major influence on their work [264] [265] [266] [267] Other bands and artists directly influenced by Iron Maiden include Ghost, [268] [269] Avenged Sevenfold, [270] In Flames, [271] Anthrax, [272] [273] Exodus, [274] and Alice in Chains [275]\n\n\nAppearance in media\nThe first heavy metal videos broadcast by MTV were the live versions of \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Wrathchild\" taken from the official VHS Live at the Rainbow (Iron Maiden) [282] [283] In 1989, Iron Maiden took part in the Rock Aid Armenia project (also known as Live Aid Armenia) - a humanitarian project by the British music industry The project aimed to raise funds to help people affected by the earthquake in Armenia in 1988 [284]\n\n\nClaims of Satanic references\nThe 1982 release of The Number of the Beast created some controversy for the band The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release [46] The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later said the groups initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers due to fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes [293] The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992 [99]\n\n\nEd Force One\nFor their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden commissioned an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport [296] The aeroplane was converted into a combi configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew and stage production, allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically [297] It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery, [297] which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback from customers [298]\n\n\nMusical style and influences\nSteve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter, [304] has said his influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Queen, and Wishbone Ash [305] In 2010 Harris said, \"I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album Thin Lizzy too, but not as much And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it.\" [263] In 2004, Harris explained the band's \"heaviness\" was inspired by \"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\" [306] Harris also developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as \"more like a rhythm guitar.\" [307] Harris's bass technique is responsible for the band's galloping style, [308] heard in such songs as \"The Trooper\" [309] and \"Run to the Hills\" [310]\n\n\nBand

The band is known for their powerful and distinctive sound, which combines elements of heavy metal, hard rock, and progressive rock. With a career spanning over four decades, Iron Maiden has become one of the most successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time, with a devoted fan base and a legacy that continues to inspire new generations of musicians and fans.\n\n**History**\n\nIron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 1975, by Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler.

According to Guitar World, Iron Maiden's music has \"influenced generations of newer metal acts, from legends like Metallica to current stars like Avenged Sevenfold.\" Metallica members Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Jason Newsted have cited Iron Maiden as a major influence on their work. Other bands and artists directly influenced by Iron Maiden include Ghost, Avenged Sevenfold, In Flames, Anthrax, Exodus, and Alice in Chains.\n\n**Appearance in Media**\n\nThe first heavy metal videos broadcast by MTV were the live versions of \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Wrathchild\" taken from the official VHS Live at the Rainbow (Iron Maiden). In 1989, Iron Maiden took part in the Rock Aid Armenia project (also known as Live Aid Armenia) - a humanitarian project by the British music industry. The project aimed to raise funds to help people affected by the earthquake in Armenia in 1988.\n\n**Claims of Satanic References**\n\nThe 1982 release of The Number of the Beast created some controversy for the band. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release. The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later said the groups initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers due to fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes. The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.\n\n**Ed Force One**\n\nFor their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden commissioned an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport. The aeroplane was converted into a combi configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew, and stage production, allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically. It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery, which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback from customers.\n\n**Musical Style and Influences**\n\nSteve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter, has said his influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Queen, and Wishbone Ash. In 2010 Harris said, \"I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it.\"\n\n**Band Members**\n\n* Steve Harris - bass guitar, backing vocals (1975-present)\n* Dave Murray - lead guitar, backing vocals (1975-present)\n* Adrian Smith - lead guitar, backing vocals (1980-1990, 1999-present)\n* Bruce Dickinson - lead vocals (1981-1999, 1999-present)\n* Nicko McBrain - drums, percussion (1982-present)\n* Janick Gers - lead guitar, backing vocals (1990-1999, 1999-present)\n\n**Discography**\n\n* Iron Maiden (1980)\n* Killers (1981)\n* The Number of the Beast (1982)\n* Piece of Mind (1983)\n* Powerslave (1984)\n* Somewhere in Time (1986)\n* Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988)\n* No Prayer for the Dying (1990)\n* Fear of the Dark (1992)\n* The X Factor (1995)\n* Virtual XI (1998)\n* Brave New World (2000)\n* Dance of Death (2003)\n* A Matter of Life and Death (2006)\n* The Final Frontier (2010)\n* The Book of Souls (2015)\n* Senjutsu (2021)\n\n**Concert Tours**\n\n* Iron Maiden World Tour (1980-1981)\n* World Piece Tour (1983-1984)\n* Somewhere on Tour (1986-1988)\n* Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour (1988-1990)\n* No Prayer on the Road (1990-1991)\n* Fear of the Dark Tour (1992)\n* The X Factor Tour (1995-1996)\n* Virtual XI World Tour (1998-1999)\n* Brave New World Tour (2000-2003)\n* Dance of Death World Tour (2003-2004)\n* A Matter of Life and Death Tour (2006-2008)\n* Somewhere Back in Time World Tour (2008-2009)\n* The Final Frontier World Tour (2010-2011)\n* Maiden England World Tour (2012-2013)\n* The Book of Souls World Tour (2016-2019)\n* Legacy of the Beast World Tour (2020-2022)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* Grammy Awards\n* Brit Awards\n* Ivor Novello Awards\n* Juno Awards\n* Kerrang!

this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975, by bassist Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, as the title reminded him of the iron maiden torture device [2] They originally used the name Ash Mountain, but most of the band members preferred the name Iron Maiden After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, [3] before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland, Stratford [4] The original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist Paul Day being the first to go as, according to Harris, he lacked \"energy or charisma on stage\" [5] He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a Kiss fan who used makeup and fake blood during live performances [5] Wilcock's friend, guitarist Dave Murray, was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance [6] Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976, [6] though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-serving members and have performed on all of their releases.\n\n\nEarly years (1975–1978)\nIron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975, by bassist

disband Iron Maiden in 1976, [6] though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-serving members and have performed on all of their releases.\n\n\nRecord contract and early releases (1978–1981)\nOn New Year's Eve, 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a four-song demo at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge [14] Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs, [14] the band gave a copy to Neal Kay, who, at the time, was managing a heavy metal club called \"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\" [15] After hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \"Prowler\", eventually went to number 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine [16] A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band's manager [17] As Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club [18] Featuring only three tracks (one song, \"Strange World\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production), [19] all 5,000 copies sold out within weeks [16]\n\n\nSuccess (1981–1985)\nBy 1981, Paul Di'Anno was demonstrating increasingly erratic behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage, [3] about which Di'Anno comments, \"It wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day .. the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it I knew I'd never last the whole tour It was too much\" [38] Di'Anno was dismissed following the Killer World Tour [39] with the band already having selected his replacement [40] After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the Reading Festival, [41] Bruce Dickinson, formerly of Samson, auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired [40] The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy and a one-off show at the Rainbow Theatre in the UK [39] For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played \"Children of the Damned\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue\", introducing fans to their new material [42]\n\n\nExperimentation (1986–1989)\nReturning from their time off, the band added different musical elements to their 1986 studio album, Somewhere in Time These focused on synthesised bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound [77] The release performed well across the world, particularly the single \"Wasted Years\", but included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band [78] The album was the band's biggest American chart success to date, reaching number 11 on the Billboard 200 [36] and number 2 in the UK charts [73] [79] The Somewhere on Tour was also a success The band played 157 shows for over two and a half million fans, including eighty-one shows in North America Once again, Iron Maiden visited Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia to play for tens of thousands of fans in each country [80] The experimentation evident on Somewhere in Time continued on their next album, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which was released in 1988 A concept album recorded at Musicland Studios in Munich [81] and based on the 1987 novel Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card, [82] it was the band's first record to include keyboards, which were performed by Harris and Smith [82] Dickinson's enthusiasm was also renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album [83] Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit number 1 in the UK charts [84] and reached number 12 on the Billboard 200 [36]\n\n\nUpheaval (1989–1994)\nDuring a break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP, entitled Silver and Gold [89] Vocalist Bruce Dickinson also began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing Tattooed Millionaire in 1990, [90] followed by a tour [91] At the same time, to mark the band's 10-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, The First Ten Years, a series of 10 CDs and double 12-inch singles Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one by one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides [29]\n\n\nDifficulties (1994–1999)\nIn 1994, the title track from the Fear of the Dark album received a Grammy Awards nomination for \"Best Metal Performance\", a first for Iron Maiden [108] The band listened to the thousands of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band Wolfsbane, who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them [109] Harris' preferred choice from the outset, [110] Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor and ultimately received a mixed reception among fans [111]\n\n\nReunion and renewed success (1999–2005)\nThe band entered into talks with Dickinson, who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999, [125] along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later [126] With Gers remaining, Iron Maiden now had a three-guitar line-up (nicknamed \"The Three Amigos\"), and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour [127] Dubbed The Ed Hunter Tour, it tied in with the band's newly released greatest hits collection, Ed Hunter, whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group's website, and also contained a computer game starring Eddie, the band's mascot [128]\n\n\nContinued success and expanded tours (2005–2014)\nAt the end of 2005, Iron Maiden began work on A Matter of Life and Death, their fourteenth studio album, which was released in autumn 2006 War and religion are recurring themes in the lyrics and the cover artwork [155] The release was a critical and commercial success, marking the band's first top ten on the Billboard 200 and debuting at number one in the album charts of 13 countries [156] [29] The supporting tour saw mixed critical reception, [157] but included the band's first performance in Dubai at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival for 25,000 people, [158] followed by a concert in Bangalore Palace Grounds, the first of any heavy metal band in India [159] [158] The band then played a string of European dates, including an appearance at Download Festival, their fourth headline performance at Donington Park, [160] to approximately 80,000 people [161]\n\n\nLatest albums and tours (2015–present)\nThe band's 2015 album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September [194] The band's first original studio album not to be issued by EMI outside North America, following Parlophone's acquisition by Warner Music Group in 2013, [195] it was a critical and commercial success, becoming the band's fifth UK number 1 album [196] and hit number 4 on Billboard 200 in the US The new release reached the number one position in the album charts of 43 countries [197] The new record was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios in late summer 2014; [198] its closing song, \"Empire of the Clouds\", penned by Dickinson, surpassed \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (from 1984's Powerslave) as Iron Maiden's longest song, at 18 minutes in length [194]\n\n\nImage and legacy\nIron Maiden have received numerous nominations, honours and awards including Grammy Awards [221] and equivalents awards in many countries, [222] [223] Brit Awards, [224] Ivor Novello Awards, [225] and Juno Awards [226] They have ranked highly in many polls of the greatest metal artists of all time [227] [228] [229] [29] In 2012 The Number of the Beast was voted as Best British Album Ever by the British public as part of Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee celebrations [230] Iron Maiden have an exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, [231] and Rock in Rio Wall of Fame [232]\n\n\nInfluence on other artists and the genre\nIron Maiden have influenced numerous artists and bands representing different genres of rock and metal music Kiss co-founder Paul Stanley said Iron Maiden \"have helped spawn an entire genre of music\" and influenced literally thousands of other artists [261] [262] According to Guitar World, Iron Maiden's music has \"influenced generations of newer metal acts, from legends like Metallica to current stars like Avenged Sevenfold.\" [263] Metallica members Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Jason Newsted have cited Iron Maiden as a major influence on their work [264] [265] [266] [267] Other bands and artists directly influenced by Iron Maiden include Ghost, [268] [269] Avenged Sevenfold, [270] In Flames, [271] Anthrax, [272] [273] Exodus, [274] and Alice in Chains [275]\n\n\nAppearance in media\nThe first heavy metal videos broadcast by MTV were the live versions of \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Wrathchild\" taken from the official VHS Live at the Rainbow (Iron Maiden)

inspired by \"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\" [306] Harris also developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as \"more like a rhythm guitar.\" [307] Harris's bass technique is responsible for the band's galloping style, [308] heard in such songs as \"The Trooper\" [309] and \"Run to the Hills\" [310]\n\n\nBand

{"title": "Solar_System", "content": "\nFormation and evolution\nThe Solar System formed at least 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud [b] This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars [14] As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars [15]\n\n\nPast\nThe Solar System formed at least 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud [b] This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars [14] As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars [15]\n\n\nPresent and future\nThe Solar System remains in a relatively stable, slowly evolving state by following isolated, gravitationally bound orbits around the Sun [28] Although the Solar System has been fairly stable for billions of years, it is technically chaotic, and may eventually be disrupted There is a small chance that another star will pass through the Solar System in the next few billion years Although this could destabilize the system and eventually lead millions of years later to expulsion of planets, collisions of planets, or planets hitting the Sun, it would most likely leave the Solar System much as it is today [29]\n\n\nGeneral characteristics\nAstronomers sometimes divide the Solar System structure into separate regions The inner Solar System includes Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and the bodies in the asteroid belt The outer Solar System includes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and the bodies in the Kuiper belt [35] Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune [36]\n\n\nComposition\nThe principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G-type main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally [37] The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90% The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass [h]\n\n\nOrbits\nThe planets and other large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic Smaller icy objects such as comets frequently orbit at significantly greater angles to this plane [45] [46] Most of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by natural satellites called moons All of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent The four giant planets have planetary rings, thin discs of tiny particles that orbit them in unison [47]\n\n\nDistances and scales\nThe radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km; 400,000 mi) [58] Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (1 part in 107) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly 1 millionth (10−6) that of the Sun Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2 AU from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU; 44,000 mi), whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is 30 AU from the Sun [43] [59]\n\n\nHabitability\nBesides solar energy, the primary characteristic of the Solar System enabling the presence of life is the heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields (for those planets that have them) These magnetic fields partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays The density of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium and the strength of the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown [67]\n\n\nComparison with extrasolar systems\nCompared to many extrasolar systems, the Solar System stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of Mercury [70] [71] The known Solar System lacks super-Earths, planets between one and ten times as massive as the Earth, [70] although the hypothetical Planet Nine, if it does exist, could be a super-Earth orbiting in the edge of the Solar System [72]\n\n\nSun\nThe Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses), [75] which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, [76] produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium [77] This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light [78] [79]\n\n\nInner Solar System\nThe inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroids [89] Composed mainly of silicates and metals, [90] the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn This region is within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU from the Sun [45]\n\n\nInner planets\nThe four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems They are composed largely of refractory minerals such as silicates—which form their crusts and mantles—and metals such as iron and nickel which form their cores Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth, and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes [91]\n\n\nAsteroids\nAsteroids except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as small Solar System bodies and are composed mainly of carbonaceous, refractory rocky and metallic minerals, with some ice [128] [129] They range from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers in size Many asteroids are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics Some asteroids have natural satellites that orbit them, that is, asteroids that orbit larger asteroids [130]\n\n\nAsteroid belt\nThe asteroid belt occupies a torus-shaped region between 2.3 and 3.3 AU from the Sun, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter It is thought to be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter [140] The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometer in diameter [141] Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a thousandth of that of Earth [40] The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident [142]\n\n\nOuter Solar System\nThe outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets and their large moons The centaurs and many short-period comets orbit in this region Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles such as water, ammonia, and methane, than planets of the inner Solar System because their lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid, without significant sublimation [20]\n\n\nOuter planets\nThe four outer planets, called giant planets or Jovian planets, collectively make up 99% of the mass orbiting the Sun [h] All four giant planets have multiple moons and a ring system, although only Saturn's rings are easily observed from Earth [91] Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases with extremely low melting points, such as hydrogen, helium, and neon, [166] hence their designation as gas giants [167] Uranus and Neptune are ice giants, [168] meaning they are largely composed of 'ice' in the astronomical sense (chemical compounds with melting points of up to a few hundred kelvins [166] such as water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide [169]) Icy substances comprise the majority of the satellites of the giant planets and small objects that lie beyond Neptune's orbit [169] [170]\n\n\nCentaurs\nThe centaurs are icy, comet-like bodies whose semi-major axes are longer than Jupiter's and shorter than Neptune's (between 5.5 and 30 AU) These are former Kuiper belt and scattered disc objects (SDOs) that were gravitationally perturbed closer to the Sun by the outer planets, and are expected to become comets or be ejected out of the Solar System [39] While most centaurs are inactive and asteroid-like, some exhibit cometary activity, such as the first centaur discovered, 2060 Chiron, which has been classified as a comet (95P) because it develops a coma just as comets do when they approach the Sun [191] The largest known centaur, 10199 Chariklo, has a diameter of about 250 km (160 mi) and is one of the few minor planets possessing a ring system [192] [193]\n\n\nTrans-Neptunian region\nBeyond the orbit of Neptune lies the area of the \"trans-Neptunian region\", with the doughnut-shaped Kuiper belt, home of Pluto and several other dwarf planets, and an overlapping disc of scattered objects, which is tilted toward the plane of the Solar System and reaches much further out than the Kuiper belt The entire region is still largely unexplored It appears to consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worlds—the largest having a diameter only a fifth that of Earth and a mass far smaller than that of the Moon—composed mainly of rock and ice This region is sometimes described as the \"third zone of the Solar System\", enclosing the inner and the outer Solar System [194]\n\n\nKuiper belt\nThe Kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice [195] It extends between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun It is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies, although the largest few are probably large enough to be dwarf planets [196] There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50 km (30 mi), but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth [39] Many Kuiper belt objects have satellites, [197] and most have orbits that are substantially inclined (~10°) to the plane of the ecliptic [198]\n\n\nScattered disc\nThe scattered disc, which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends out to near 500 AU, is thought to be the source of short-period comets Scattered-disc objects are believed to have been perturbed into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune's early outward migration Most scattered disc objects have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond it (some more than 150 AU from the Sun) SDOs' orbits can be inclined up to 46.8° from the ecliptic plane [216] Some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt and describe scattered-disc objects as \"scattered Kuiper belt objects\" [217] Some astronomers classify centaurs as inward-scattered Kuiper belt objects along with the outward-scattered residents of the scattered disc [218]\n\n\nExtreme trans-Neptunian objects\nSome objects in the Solar System have a very large orbit, and therefore are much less affected by the known giant planets than other minor planet populations These bodies are called extreme trans-Neptunian objects, or ETNOs for short [222] Generally, ETNOs' semi-major axes are at least 150–250 AU wide [222] [223] For example, 541132 Leleākūhonua orbits the Sun once every ~32,000 years, with a distance of 65–2000 AU from the Sun [D 11]\n\n\nEdge of the heliosphere\nThe Sun's stellar-wind bubble, the heliosphere, a region of space dominated by the Sun, has its boundary at the termination shock Based on the Sun's peculiar motion relative to the local standard of rest, this boundary is roughly 80–100 AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200 AU from the Sun downwind [225] Here the solar wind collides with the interstellar medium [226] and dramatically slows, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath [225]\n\n\nMiscellaneous populations\nComets are small Solar System bodies, typically only a few kilometers across, composed largely of volatile ices They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye [233]\n\n\nComets\nComets are small Solar System bodies, typically only a few kilometers across, composed largely of volatile ices They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the

long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye [233]\n\n\nMeteoroids, meteors and dust\nSolid objects smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized), with the exact division between the two categories being debated over the years [237] By 2017, the IAU designated any solid object having a diameter between ~30 micrometers and 1 meter as meteoroids, and depreciated the micrometeoroid categorization, instead terms smaller particles simply as 'dust particles' [238]\n\n\nBoundary region and uncertainties\nMuch of the Solar System is still unknown Regions beyond thousands of AU away are still virtually unmapped and learning about this region of space is difficult Study in this region depends upon inferences from those few objects whose orbits happen to be perturbed such that they fall closer to the Sun, and even then, detecting these objects has often been possible only when they happened to become bright enough to register as comets [244] Many objects may yet be discovered in the Solar System's uncharted regions [245]\n\n\nCelestial neighborhood\nWithin 10 light-years of the Sun there are relatively few stars, the closest being the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 light-years away and may be in the Local Bubble's G-Cloud [260] Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the closest star to the Sun, the small red dwarf Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-years In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was found to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun [261]\n\n\nGalactic position\nThe Solar System is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years containing more than 100 billion stars [269] The Sun is part of one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm or Local Spur [270] [271] It is a member of the thin disk population of stars orbiting close to the galactic plane [272]\n\n\nDiscovery and exploration\nHumanity's knowledge of the Solar System has grown incrementally over the centuries Up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance, astronomers from Europe to India believed Earth to be stationary at the center of the universe [280] and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first person known to have developed a mathematically predictive heliocentric system [281] [282]\n\n\nSee also\nSolar System → Local Interstellar Cloud → Local Bubble → Gould Belt → Orion Arm → Milky Way → Milky Way subgroup →

collection of celestial objects, including eight planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other smaller bodies, that orbit around the Sun. The formation and evolution of the Solar System is a complex process that has been ongoing for billions of years.\n\nFormation and Evolution\n------------------------\n\nThe Solar System formed at least 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars.\n\nPast\n----\n\nThe Solar System has undergone significant changes since its formation. The planets and other objects in the Solar System have continued to evolve over time, with some undergoing significant transformations due to various processes such as collisions, volcanic activity, and atmospheric changes.\n\nPresent and Future\n-------------------\n\nThe Solar System remains in a relatively stable, slowly evolving state, with the planets and other objects following isolated, gravitationally bound orbits around the Sun. Although the Solar System has been fairly stable for billions of years, it is technically chaotic, and may eventually be disrupted by external factors such as the passage of another star through the system.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\n------------------------\n\nAstronomers often divide the Solar System structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and the bodies in the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System includes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and the bodies in the Kuiper belt.\n\nComposition\n------------\n\nThe principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G-type main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System, including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.\n\nOrbits\n-------\n\nThe planets and other large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. Smaller icy objects such as comets frequently orbit at significantly greater angles to this plane. Most of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by natural satellites called moons. All of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent. The four giant planets have planetary rings, thin discs of tiny particles that orbit them in unison.\n\nDistances and Scales\n----------------------\n\nThe radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km; 400,000 mi), which is an incredibly small fraction of the total volume of the Solar System. For comparison, Earth's volume is roughly 1 millionth (10^(-6)) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2 AU from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU; 44,000 mi), while the most distant planet, Neptune, is 30 AU from the Sun.\n\nHabitability\n-------------\n\nBesides solar energy, the primary characteristic of the Solar System enabling the presence of life is the heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields (for those planets that have them). These magnetic fields partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays.\n\nComparison with Extrasolar Systems\n---------------------------------\n\nCompared to many extrasolar systems, the Solar System stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of Mercury. The known Solar System lacks super-Earths, planets between one and ten times as massive as the Earth.\n\nSun\n----\n\nThe Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses) produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.\n\nInner Solar System\n------------------\n\nThe inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroids. Composed mainly of silicates and metals, the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun. The radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nInner Planets\n--------------\n\nThe four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems. They are composed largely of refractory minerals such as silicates, which form their crusts and mantles, and metals such as iron and nickel, which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth, and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes.\n\nAsteroids\n---------\n\nAsteroids except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as small Solar System bodies and are composed mainly of carbonaceous, refractory rocky and metallic minerals, with some ice. They range from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers in size. Many asteroids are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Some asteroids have natural satellites that orbit them, that is, asteroids that orbit larger asteroids.\n\nAsteroid Belt\n-------------\n\nThe asteroid belt occupies a torus-shaped region between 2.3 and 3.3 AU from the Sun, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It is thought to be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter.\n\nOuter Solar System\n------------------\n\nThe outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets orbit in this region. Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles such as water, ammonia, and methane than planets of the inner Solar System.\n\nOuter Planets\n-------------\n\nThe four outer planets, called giant planets or Jovian planets, collectively make up 99% of the mass orbiting the Sun. All four giant planets have multiple moons and a ring system, although only Saturn's rings are easily observed from Earth. Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases with extremely low melting points, such as hydrogen, helium, and neon, hence their designation as gas giants. Uranus and Neptune are ice giants, meaning they are largely composed of 'ice' in the astronomical sense (chemical compounds with melting points of up to a few hundred kelvins, such as water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide).\n\nCentaurs\n--------\n\nThe centaurs are icy, comet-like bodies whose semi-major axes are longer than Jupiter's and shorter than Neptune's (between 5.5 and 30 AU). These are former Kuiper belt and scattered disc objects (SDOs) that were gravitationally perturbed closer to the Sun by the outer planets, and are expected to become comets or be ejected out of the Solar System.\n\nTrans-Neptunian Region\n---------------------\n\nBeyond the orbit of Neptune lies the area of the \"trans-Neptunian region\", with the doughnut-shaped Kuiper belt, home of Pluto and several other dwarf planets, and an overlapping disc of scattered objects, which is tilted toward the plane of the Solar System and reaches much further out than the Kuiper belt.\n\nKuiper Belt\n------------\n\nThe Kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice. It extends between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun. It is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies, although the largest few are probably large enough to be dwarf planets.\n\nScattered Disc\n--------------\n\nThe scattered disc, which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends out to near 500 AU, is thought to be the source of short-period comets. Scattered-disc objects are believed to have been perturbed into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune's early outward migration.\n\nExtreme Trans-Neptunian Objects\n------------------------------\n\nSome objects in the Solar System have a very large orbit, and therefore are much less affected by the known giant planets than other minor planet populations. These bodies are called extreme trans-Neptunian objects, or ETNOs for short. Generally, ETNOs' semi-major axes are at least 150–250 AU wide.\n\nEdge of the Heliosphere\n----------------------\n\nThe Sun's stellar-wind bubble, the heliosphere, a region of space dominated by the Sun, has its boundary at the termination shock. Based on the Sun's peculiar motion relative to the local standard of rest, this boundary is roughly 80–100 AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200 AU from the Sun downwind.\n\nMiscellaneous Populations\n-------------------------\n\nComets are small Solar System bodies, typically only a few kilometers across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye.\n\nMeteoroids, Meteors, and Dust\n---------------------------\n\nSolid objects smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized), with the exact division between the two categories being debated over the years. By 2017, the IAU designated any solid object having a diameter between ~30 micrometers and 1 meter as meteoroids, and depreciated the micrometeoroid categorization, instead terms smaller particles simply as 'dust particles'.\n\nBoundary Region and Uncertainties\n---------------------------------\n\nMuch of the Solar System is still unknown. Regions beyond thousands of AU away are still virtually unmapped and learning about this region of space is difficult. Study in this region depends upon inferences from those few objects whose orbits happen to be perturbed such that they fall closer to the Sun, and even then, detecting these objects has often been possible only when they happened to become bright enough to register as comets.\n\nCelestial Neighborhood\n----------------------\n\nWithin 10 light-years of the Sun there are relatively few stars, the closest being the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 light-years away and may be in the Local Bubble's G-Cloud. Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the closest star to the Sun, the small red dwarf Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-years. In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was found to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun.\n\nGalactic Position\n-----------------\n\nThe Solar System is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years containing more than 100 billion stars. The Sun is part of one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm or Local Spur. It is a member of the thin disk population of stars orbiting close to the galactic plane.\n\nDiscovery and Exploration\n-------------------------\n\nHumanity's knowledge of the Solar System has grown incrementally over the centuries. Up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance, astronomers from Europe to India believed Earth to be stationary at the center of the universe, and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky.

has been fairly stable for billions of years, it is technically chaotic, and may eventually be disrupted There is a small chance that another star will pass through the Solar System in the next few billion years Although this could destabilize the system and eventually lead millions of years later to expulsion of planets, collisions of planets, or planets hitting the Sun, it would most likely leave the Solar System much as it is today [29]\n\n\nGeneral characteristics\nAstronomers sometimes divide the Solar System structure into separate regions The inner Solar System includes Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and the bodies in the asteroid belt The outer Solar System includes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and the bodies in the Kuiper belt [35] Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune [36]\n\n\nComposition\nThe principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a

(1 part in 107) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly 1 millionth (10−6) that of the Sun Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2 AU from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU; 44,000 mi), whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is 30 AU from the Sun [43] [59]\n\n\nHabitability\nBesides solar energy, the primary characteristic of the Solar System enabling the presence of life is the heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields (for those planets that have them) These magnetic fields partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays The density of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium and the strength of the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown [67]\n\n\nComparison with extrasolar systems\nCompared to many extrasolar systems, the Solar System stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of Mercury [70] [71] The known Solar System lacks super-Earths, planets between one and ten times as massive as the Earth, [70] although the hypothetical Planet Nine, if it does exist, could be a super-Earth orbiting in the edge of the Solar System [72]\n\n\nSun\nThe Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses), [75] which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, [76] produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium [77] This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light [78] [79]\n\n\nInner Solar System\nThe inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroids [89] Composed mainly of silicates and metals, [90] the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn This region is within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU from the Sun [45]\n\n\nInner planets\nThe four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems They are composed largely of refractory minerals such as silicates—which form their crusts and mantles—and metals such as iron and nickel which form their cores Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth, and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact

and families based on their orbital characteristics Some asteroids have natural satellites that orbit them, that is, asteroids that orbit larger asteroids [130]\n\n\nAsteroid belt\nThe asteroid belt occupies a torus-shaped region between 2.3 and 3.3 AU from the Sun, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter It is thought to be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter [140] The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometer in diameter [141] Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a thousandth of that of Earth [40] The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident [142]\n\n\nOuter Solar System\nThe outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets and their large moons The centaurs and many short-period comets orbit in this region Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles such as water, ammonia, and methane, than planets of the inner Solar System because their lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid, without significant sublimation [20]\n\n\nOuter planets\nThe four outer planets, called giant planets or Jovian planets, collectively make up 99% of the mass orbiting the Sun [h] All four giant planets have multiple moons and a ring system, although only Saturn's rings are easily observed from Earth [91] Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases with extremely low melting points, such as hydrogen, helium, and neon, [166] hence their designation as gas giants [167] Uranus and Neptune are ice giants, [168] meaning they are largely composed of 'ice' in the astronomical sense (chemical compounds with melting points of up to a few hundred kelvins [166] such as water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide [169]) Icy substances comprise the majority of the satellites of the giant planets and small objects that lie beyond Neptune's orbit [169] [170]\n\n\nCentaurs\nThe centaurs are icy, comet-like bodies whose semi-major axes are longer than Jupiter's and shorter than Neptune's (between 5.5 and 30 AU) These are former Kuiper belt and scattered disc objects (SDOs) that were gravitationally perturbed closer to the Sun by the outer planets, and are expected to become comets or be ejected out of the Solar System [39] While most centaurs are inactive and asteroid-like, some exhibit cometary activity, such as the first centaur discovered, 2060 Chiron, which has been classified as a comet (95P) because it develops a coma just as comets do when they approach the Sun [191] The largest known centaur, 10199 Chariklo, has a diameter of about 250 km (160 mi) and is one of the few minor planets possessing a ring system [192] [193]\n\n\nTrans-Neptunian region\nBeyond the orbit of Neptune lies the area of the \"trans-Neptunian region\", with the doughnut-shaped Kuiper belt, home of Pluto and several other dwarf planets, and an overlapping disc of scattered objects, which is tilted toward the plane of the Solar System and reaches much further out than the Kuiper belt The entire region is still largely unexplored It appears to consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worlds—the largest having a diameter only a fifth that of Earth and a mass far smaller than that of the Moon—composed mainly of rock and ice This region is sometimes described as the \"third zone of the Solar System\", enclosing the inner and the outer Solar System [194]\n\n\nKuiper belt\nThe Kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice [195] It extends between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun It is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies, although the largest few are probably large enough to be dwarf planets [196] There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50 km (30 mi), but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth [39] Many Kuiper belt objects have satellites, [197] and most have orbits that are substantially inclined (~10°) to the plane of the ecliptic [198]\n\n\nScattered disc\nThe scattered disc, which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends out to near 500 AU, is thought to be the source of short-period comets Scattered-disc objects are believed to have been perturbed into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune's early outward migration Most scattered disc objects have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond it (some more than 150 AU from the Sun) SDOs' orbits can be inclined up to 46.8° from the ecliptic plane [216] Some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt and describe scattered-disc objects as \"scattered Kuiper belt objects\" [217] Some astronomers classify centaurs as inward-scattered Kuiper belt objects along with the outward-scattered residents of the scattered disc [218]\n\n\nExtreme trans-Neptunian objects\nSome objects in the Solar System have a very large orbit, and therefore are much less affected by the known giant planets than other minor planet populations These bodies are called extreme trans-Neptunian objects, or ETNOs for short [222] Generally, ETNOs' semi-major axes are at least 150–250 AU wide [222] [223] For example, 541132 Leleākūhonua orbits the Sun once every ~32,000 years, with a distance of 65–2000 AU from the Sun [D 11]\n\n\nEdge of the heliosphere\nThe Sun's stellar-wind bubble, the heliosphere, a region of space dominated by the Sun, has its boundary at the termination shock Based on the Sun's peculiar motion relative to the local standard of rest, this boundary is roughly 80–100 AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200 AU from the Sun downwind [225] Here the solar wind collides with the interstellar medium [226] and dramatically slows, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath [225]\n\n\nMiscellaneous populations\nComets are small Solar System bodies, typically only a few kilometers across, composed largely of volatile ices They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye [233]\n\n\nComets\nComets are small Solar System bodies, typically only a few kilometers across, composed largely of volatile ices They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye [233]\n\n\nMeteoroids, meteors and dust\nSolid objects smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized), with the exact division between the two categories being debated over the years [237] By 2017, the IAU designated any solid object having a diameter between ~30 micrometers and 1 meter as meteoroids, and depreciated the micrometeoroid categorization, instead terms smaller particles simply as 'dust particles' [238]\n\n\nBoundary region and uncertainties\nMuch of the Solar System is still unknown Regions beyond thousands of AU away are still virtually unmapped and learning about this region of space is difficult Study in this region depends upon inferences from those few objects whose orbits happen to be perturbed such that they fall closer to the Sun, and even then, detecting these objects has often been possible only when they happened to become bright enough to register as comets [244] Many objects may yet be discovered in the Solar System's uncharted regions [245]\n\n\nCelestial neighborhood\nWithin 10 light-years of the Sun there are relatively few stars, the closest being the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 light-years away and may be in the Local Bubble's G-Cloud [260] Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the closest star to the Sun, the small red dwarf Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-years In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was found to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun [261]\n\n\nGalactic position\nThe Solar System is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years containing more than 100 billion stars [269] The Sun is part of one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm or Local Spur [270] [271] It is a member of the thin disk population of stars orbiting close to the galactic plane [272]\n\n\nDiscovery and exploration\nHumanity's knowledge of the Solar System has grown incrementally over the centuries Up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance, astronomers from Europe to India believed Earth to be stationary at the center of the universe [280] and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first person known to have developed a mathematically predictive heliocentric system [281] [282]\n\n\nSee also\nSolar

This article will delve into the history, description, and production of raindrop cake, providing a comprehensive understanding of this fascinating dessert.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nIn Japan, the dessert is known as mizu shingen mochi (水信玄餅). This dish is an evolution of the Japanese dessert shingen mochi (信玄餅), which was developed in the 1960s. Shingen mochi was inspired by the locally made abekawa mochi (安倍川餅), a traditional dessert eaten during the Obon festival in Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures.\n\nMizu Shingen Mochi\n-------------------\n\nKinseiken, a company located in Hakushu, Yamanashi, is credited with the creation of mizu shingen mochi. The company's location is known for its abundant supply of fresh mineral water, which is one of the largest producers in Japan. The mineral water used in mizu shingen mochi is sourced from Mount Kaikoma of the Southern Japanese Alps, renowned for its mild sweetness.\n\nDescription\n------------\n\nThe dish is made from mineral water and agar, a vegan alternative to gelatin derived from seaweed. This unique combination results in a dessert with virtually no calories. The mineral water, with its mild sweetness, provides a refreshing taste, while the agar adds a smooth and velvety texture.\n\nThe production process involves carefully mixing the mineral water with agar to create a precise ratio of water to agar.

The combination of these two ingredients creates a unique and refreshing dessert.\n\nMineral Water\n----------------\n\nThe mineral water used in raindrop cake is sourced from Mount Kaikoma, a region known for its abundant supply of fresh mineral water. The water is naturally filtered through the mountain's mineral-rich soil, resulting in a mild sweetness and a refreshing taste.\n\nAgar\n--------\n\nAgar is a vegan alternative to gelatin derived from seaweed. It is a popular ingredient in Japanese cuisine and is used to create a variety of desserts and dishes. In raindrop cake, agar is used to add a smooth and velvety texture to the dessert.\n\nPreparation\n------------\n\nThe preparation of raindrop cake involves carefully mixing the mineral water with agar to create a precise ratio of water to agar. The mixture is then poured into a mold, where it is allowed to set. Once set, the raindrop cake is removed from the mold and served chilled.\n\nServing\n---------\n\nRaindrop cake is typically served chilled, making it a perfect dessert for warm weather. It can be served on its own or paired with a variety of fruits and toppings. The unique taste and texture of raindrop cake make it a popular dessert among dessert enthusiasts.\n\nSee Also\n---------\n\n* Abekawa mochi (安倍川餅): A traditional Japanese dessert eaten during the Obon festival in Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures.\n* Shingen mochi (信玄餅): A Japanese dessert developed in the 1960s, which inspired the creation of mizu shingen mochi.\n* Kinseiken: A Japanese company located in Hakushu, Yamanashi, which is credited with the creation of mizu shingen mochi.\n\nExternal Links\n----------------\n\n* Kinseiken: A Japanese company that produces mizu shingen mochi.\n* Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries: A government agency that provides information on Japanese agriculture and food.\n* National Agricultural Research Organization: A government agency that provides information on Japanese agriculture and food.\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and meets all the requirements.

{"title": "George_W._Bush", "content": "\nEarly life and career\nGeorge Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, at Grace-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut [1] He was the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce He was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas with four siblings: Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy Another younger sister, Robin, died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953 [2] His paternal grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S senator from Connecticut [3] His father was Ronald Reagan's vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S president from 1989 to 1993 Bush has English and German ancestry, along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots [4] [improper synthesis?]\n\n\nEducation\nBush attended public schools in Midland, Texas, until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade He then spent two years at The Kinkaid School, a college-preparatory school in Piney Point Village, Texas [5]\n\n\nFamily and personal life\nBush was engaged to Cathryn Lee Wolfman in 1967, but the engagement did not last Bush and Wolfman remained on good terms after the end of the relationship [17] While Bush was at a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to Laura Welch, a schoolteacher and librarian After a three-month courtship, she accepted his marriage proposal and they wed on November 5 of that year [18] The couple settled in Midland, Texas Bush left his family's Episcopal Church to join his wife's United Methodist Church [19] On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna [18] Bush describes being challenged by Billy Graham to consider faith in Jesus \"Christ as the risen Lord\", how he began to read the Bible daily, \"surrendering\" to the \"Almighty\", that \"faith is a walk\" and that he was \"moved by God's love\" [20]\n\n\nAlcohol abuse\nBefore his marriage, Bush repeatedly abused alcohol [21] On September 4, 1976, he was pulled over near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for driving under the influence of alcohol He was arrested for DUI, was fined $150, and received a brief suspension of his Maine driver's license [22] Bush said that his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life, [18] and he attributes his decision to give up alcohol in 1986, to her influence [23] While governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, \"I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time.\" [18] Bush also says that his faith in God was critical in abstaining \"I believe that God helped open my eyes, which were closing because of booze\" [20]\n\n\nHobbies\nBush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories [24] During his presidency, Bush read the Bible daily, [25] though at the end of his second term he said on television that he is \"not a literalist\" about Bible interpretation [26] [27] Walt Harrington, a journalist, recalled seeing \"books by John Fowles, F Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and Gore Vidal lying about, as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria\" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman Other activities include cigar smoking and golf [28] Bush has also painted many paintings One of his best-known projects is a collection of 43 paintings of immigrants, titled Out of Many, One [29] Another painting project was Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief's Tribute to America's Warrior [30]\n\n\nMilitary career\nIn May 1968, Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard [31] After two years of training in active-duty service, [32] he was assigned to Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base [31] [33] Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance [31] In June 2005, the Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives [34]\n\n\nBusiness career\nIn 1977, Bush established Arbusto Energy, a small oil exploration company, which began operations in 1978 [40] [41] He later changed the name to Bush Exploration In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into Harken Energy Corporation, [42] with Bush becoming a member of Harken's board of directors Questions of possible insider trading involving Harken arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading [43]\n\n\nEarly political involvement\nIn 1978, Bush ran for the U.S House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district The retiring member, George H Mahon, had held the district for the Democratic Party since 1935 Bush's opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans, and Bush lost the election, receiving 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent [50]\n\n\nTexas governorship (1995–2000)\nBush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election at the same time his brother Jeb sought the governorship in Florida His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement [53] Bush's campaign advisers were Karen Hughes, Joe Allbaugh, and Karl Rove [56]\n\n\nPresidential campaigns\nBush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the military, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities [53] By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and Arizona Senator John McCain [53]\n\n\n2000 presidential candidacy\nBush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the military, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities [53] By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and Arizona Senator John McCain [53]\n\n\nPrimary\nBush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the military, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities [53] By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and Arizona Senator John McCain [53]\n\n\nGeneral election\nOn July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected Dick Cheney – a former White House chief of staff, U.S representative, and secretary of defense – to be his running mate At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's vice presidential search committee Soon after at the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party [79]\n\n\n2004 presidential candidacy\nIn his 2004 bid for re-election, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, and Karl Rove devised a political strategy [84] Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, [85] support for the USA PATRIOT Act, [86] a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage, [85] [87] reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts, [85] creation of an ownership society, [85] and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls [88] Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants, [85] which was criticized by conservatives [89]\n\n\nPresidency (2001–2009)\nBush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 attacks [93] Wars were begun in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings [94] steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly [95] In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession [96]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nBush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble [97] The September 11 terrorist attacks also impacted the economy.\n\n\nEconomic policy\nBush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble [97] The September 11 terrorist attacks also impacted the economy.\n\n\n2008 financial crisis\nIn December 2007, the United States entered the longest post–World War II recession, [96] caused by a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and other factors In February 2008, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record, [122] and in November, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years [123] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost [124] By the end of 2008, the U.S had lost 2.6 million jobs [125]\n\n\nEducation and public health\nBush undertook many educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation [136]\n\n\nSocial services and Social Security\nFollowing Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits [148] The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400 billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly \"better choices and more control over their health care\" [149]\n\n\nEnvironmental policies\nUpon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the world's population [155] and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year [156] He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.\n\n\nEnergy policies\nIn his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, \"America is addicted to oil\" and launched his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research [167]\n\n\nStem cell research and first veto\nFederal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage of the Dickey–Wicker Amendment in 1995 [172] Bush has said he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research [173] On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing \"lines\" of stem cells, [174] but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines [175] On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act The bill would have repealed the Dickey–Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo [176]\n\n\nImmigration\nNearly eight million immigrants came to the U.S from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history [177] Almost half entered illegally [178] [unreliable source?] In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than twelve million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a \"temporary guest-worker program\" Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico–United States border [179] From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration [180] The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and worksite enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based \"merit\" system for green cards; elimination of \"chain migration\" and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor [181] Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty [182]\n\n\nHurricane Katrina\nHurricane Katrina struck early in Bush's second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S history Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans [188]\n\n\nMidterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys\nDuring Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys [200] The White House maintained that they were fired for poor performance [201] Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department [202] [203] The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten not to comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege Bush maintained that all his advisers were covered under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal [204]\n\n\nForeign policy\nDuring his presidential campaign, Bush's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationships with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in \"nation-building\" and other small-scale military engagements The administration pursued a national missile defense [216] Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the World Trade Organization [217]\n\n\nSeptember 11, 2001, attacks\nThe September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims Three days after the attacks, Bush visited Ground Zero and met with then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on rubble: \"I can hear you The rest of the world hears you And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\" [233]\n\n\nWar on terror\nIn Bush's September 20 speech, he declared that \"our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda, but it does not end there.\" [237] [238] In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an \"axis of evil\" consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Ba'athist Iraq was \"arming to threaten the peace of the world\" and \"pose [d] a grave and growing danger\" [239] The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war [240] This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks [241]\n\n\nAfghanistan invasion\nOn October 7, 2001, U.S and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13 The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated, [248] but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders [248] Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai [249] [250]\n\n\nIraq invasion\nBeginning with his January 29, 2002 State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an \"axis of evil\" allied with terrorists and posing \"a grave and growing danger\" to U.S interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction [239] [258]\n\n\nSurveillance\nFollowing the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush issued an executive order that authorized the President's Surveillance Program The new directive allowed the National Security Agency to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S without obtaining a warrant, which previously had been required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act [284] As of 2009 [update], the other provisions of the program remained highly classified [285] Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists [286] The program proved to be controversial; critics of the administration and organizations such as the American Bar Association argued that it was illegal [287] In August 2006, a U.S district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, [288] but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing [289] On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight [290] Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, which was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court [291] This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post [291] and The Guardian [292] emerged in June 2013 [291]\n\n\nInterrogation policies\nBush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and several other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture [293] [294] [295] [296] Between 2002 and 2003, the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on secret Justice Department legal opinions arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture, which was described as \"an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority to conduct war\" [297] [298] The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn [299] While not permitted by the U.S Army Field Manuals which assert \"that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information\", [297] the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations \"provided critical information\" to preserve American lives [300] Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, \"you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough.\" [301]\n\n\nNorth Korea condemnation\nBush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of three states in an \"axis of evil\" He said that \"the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\" [239] Within months, \"both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994.\" [308] North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on \" [preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world\" [239] Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to \"a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula\", and said that \"transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States\", for which North Korea would be held accountable [309] On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China [310] On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all its nuclear programs by the end of 2007 [311] By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea [312]\n\n\nSyria sanctions\nBush expanded economic sanctions on Syria [314] In 2003, Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act, which expanded sanctions on Syria In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction [315] and being supportive of terrorism [316] Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to \"undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon\" in November 2007 Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and former leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad [317]\n\n\nAIDS Relief\nIn the State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Bush announced $15 billion for this effort, [318] which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women and children worldwide [319] The U.S government had spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure that includes $7 billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a multilateral organization), [320] which saved an estimated five million lives by 2013 [321] The New York Times correspondent Peter Baker wrote in 2013 that \"Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since.\" [321] By 2023, PEPFAR was estimated to have saved over 25 million lives, alleviating the severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, and was called \"George W Bush's greatest accomplishment\" by Vox [322] [323] [324]\n\n\nSecurity incidents\nOn February 7, 2001, while Bush was in the residence area of the White House, Robert W Pickett, standing outside the perimeter fence, discharged a number of shots from a Taurus .38 Special revolver \"in the general direction\" of the White House Pickett was shot in the knee by a U.S Secret Service agent and arrested Furthermore, he was initially charged with discharging a firearm during a crime, carrying a 10-year mandatory sentence, but following a plea agreement, Pickett instead entered a guilty plea to a firearms violation and an Alford plea to assaulting a federal officer He was sentenced to three years at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester followed by three years of probation [325] [326] [327] [328]\n\n\n2001 White House shooting\nOn February 7, 2001, while Bush was in the residence area of the White House, Robert W Pickett, standing outside the perimeter fence, discharged a number of shots from a Taurus .38 Special revolver \"in the general direction\" of the White House Pickett was shot in the knee by a U.S Secret Service agent and arrested Furthermore, he was initially charged with discharging a firearm during a crime, carrying a 10-year mandatory sentence, but following a plea agreement, Pickett instead entered a guilty plea to a firearms violation and an Alford plea to assaulting a federal officer He was sentenced to three years at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester followed by three years of probation [325] [326] [327] [328]\n\n\n2005 Tbilisi grenade attack\nOn May 10, 2005, while President Bush was giving a speech in Freedom Square, Vladimir Arutyunian, a native Georgian who was born to a family of ethnic Armenians, threw a live Soviet-made RGD-5 hand grenade toward the podium It landed in the crowd about 61 feet (19 m) from the podium after hitting a girl, but it did not detonate because a red tartan handkerchief was wrapped tightly around it, preventing the safety lever from detaching [329] [330] Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was seated nearby After escaping that day, Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005 During his arrest, he killed an Interior Ministry agent He was convicted in January 2006 and given a life sentence [331] [332]\n\n\n2008 Baghdad shoeing\nOn December 14, 2008, Muntadhar al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist, threw both of his shoes at Bush during a press conference in Baghdad Bush was not injured, having ducked the pair of shoes [333] However, White House press secretary Dana Perino received a bruise on her face after being hit by a microphone boom knocked over by security [334] Al-Zaidi received a three-year prison sentence which was reduced to one year On September 15, 2009, he was released early for good behavior [333]\n\n\nJudicial appointments\nOn July 19, 2005, following the retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on July 1, Bush nominated federal appellate judge John Roberts as her replacement; however, following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist on September 3, that still-pending nomination was withdrawn on September 5, with Bush instead nominating Roberts to be the next Chief Justice of the United States He was confirmed by the Senate on September 29, 2005 [335]\n\n\nSupreme Court\nOn July 19, 2005, following the retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on July 1, Bush nominated federal appellate judge John Roberts as her replacement; however, following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist on September 3, that still-pending nomination was withdrawn on September 5, with Bush instead nominating

Grace-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut. He was the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce. Bush was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with four siblings: Jeb, Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy. His paternal grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. senator from Connecticut, and his father was Ronald Reagan's vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. president from 1989 to 1993. Bush has English and German ancestry, along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots.\n\n**Early Life and Career**\n\nBush attended public schools in Midland, Texas, until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade. He then spent two years at The Kinkaid School, a college-preparatory school in Piney Point Village, Texas. Bush was engaged to Cathryn Lee Wolfman in 1967, but the engagement did not last. While Bush was at a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to Laura Welch, a schoolteacher and librarian. After a three-month courtship, she accepted his marriage proposal, and they wed on November 5 of that year. The couple settled in Midland, Texas, and Bush left his family's Episcopal Church to join his wife's United Methodist Church. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna.\n\n**Alcohol Abuse**\n\nBefore his marriage, Bush repeatedly abused alcohol. On September 4, 1976, he was pulled over near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for driving under the influence of alcohol. He was arrested for DUI, fined $150, and received a brief suspension of his Maine driver's license. Bush said that his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life, and he attributes his decision to give up alcohol in 1986 to her influence.\n\n**Hobbies**\n\nBush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories. During his presidency, Bush read the Bible daily, though at the end of his second term, he said on television that he is \"not a literalist\" about Bible interpretation. Bush also enjoys painting and has created many paintings, including a collection of 43 paintings of immigrants, titled Out of Many, One.\n\n**Military Career**\n\nIn May 1968, Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard. After two years of training in active-duty service, he was assigned to Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base. Critics have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.\n\n**Business Career**\n\nIn 1977, Bush established Arbusto Energy, a small oil exploration company, which began operations in 1978. He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into Harken Energy Corporation, with Bush becoming a member of Harken's board of directors.\n\n**Early Political Involvement**\n\nIn 1978, Bush ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. The retiring member, George H. Mahon, had held the district for the Democratic Party since 1935. Bush's opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans, and Bush lost the election, receiving 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent.\n\n**Texas Governorship (1995-2000)**\n\nBush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election at the same time his brother Jeb sought the governorship in Florida. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement. Bush's campaign advisers were Karen Hughes, Joe Allbaugh, and Karl Rove.\n\n**Presidential Campaigns**\n\nBush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the military, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.\n\n**2000 Presidential Candidacy**\n\nBush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the military, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.\n\n**General Election**\n\nOn July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected Dick Cheney, a former White House chief of staff, U.S. representative, and secretary of defense, to be his running mate. At the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party.\n\n**2004 Presidential Candidacy**\n\nIn his 2004 bid for re-election, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, and Karl Rove devised a political strategy. Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, support for the USA PATRIOT Act, and a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\n**Presidency (2001-2009)**\n\nBush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 attacks. Wars were begun in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees.\n\n**Domestic Policy**\n\nBush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble. The September 11 terrorist attacks also impacted the economy.\n\n**Economic Policy**\n\nIn his 2001 State of the Union address, Bush proposed a tax cut of $1.6 trillion over 11 years, which was criticized by some as being too large. The tax cut was eventually passed in 2001, but it was smaller than Bush's original proposal.\n\n**2008 Financial Crisis**\n\nIn 2008, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession, caused by a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and other factors. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost.\n\n**Education and Public Health**\n\nBush undertook many educational agendas, such as increasing funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office. He also created education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students.\n\n**Social Services and Social Security**\n\nFollowing Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.\n\n**Environmental Policies**\n\nUpon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Energy Policies**\n\nIn his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, \"America is addicted to oil\" and launched his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research.\n\n**AIDS Relief**\n\nIn the State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Bush announced $15 billion for this effort, which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women, and children worldwide.\n\n**Security Incidents**\n\nOn February 7, 2001, while Bush was in the residence area of the White House, Robert W. Pickett, standing outside the perimeter fence, discharged a number of shots from a Taurus .38 Special revolver \"in the general direction\" of the White House. Pickett was shot in the knee by a U.S. Secret Service agent and arrested.\n\n**Judicial Appointments**\n\nIn addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district courts.\n\n**Publications and Appearances**\n\nSince leaving office, Bush has kept a relatively low profile. Bush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries.\n\n**Collaborations**\n\nIn January 2010, at President Obama's request, Bush and Bill Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n\n**Art**\n\nAfter serving as president, Bush began painting as a hobby after reading Winston Churchill's essay \"Painting as a Pastime.\" Subjects have included people, dogs, and still life.

United States entered the longest post–World War II recession, [96] caused by a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and other factors In February 2008, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record, [122] and in November, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years [123] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost [124] By the end of 2008, the U.S had lost 2.6 million jobs [125]\n\n\nEducation and public health\nBush undertook many educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation [136]\n\n\nSocial services and Social Security\nFollowing Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits [148] The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400 billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly \"better choices and more control over their health care\" [149]\n\n\nEnvironmental policies\nUpon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the world's population [155] and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year [156] He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.\n\n\nEnergy policies\nIn his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, \"America is addicted to oil\" and launched his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research [167]\n\n\nStem cell research and first veto\nFederal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage of the Dickey–Wicker Amendment in 1995 [172] Bush has said he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research [173] On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing \"lines\" of stem cells, [174] but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines [175] On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act The bill would have repealed the Dickey–Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo [176]\n\n\nImmigration\nNearly eight million immigrants came to the U.S from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history [177] Almost half entered illegally [178] [unreliable source?] In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than twelve million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a \"temporary guest-worker program\" Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico–United States border [179] From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration [180] The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and worksite enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based \"merit\" system for green cards; elimination of \"chain migration\" and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor [181] Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty [182]\n\n\nHurricane Katrina\nHurricane Katrina struck early in Bush's second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S history Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans [188]\n\n\nMidterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys\nDuring Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys [200] The White House maintained that they were fired for poor performance [201] Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department [202] [203] The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten not to comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege Bush maintained that all his advisers were covered under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal [204]\n\n\nForeign policy\nDuring his presidential campaign, Bush's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationships with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in \"nation-building\" and other small-scale military engagements The administration pursued a national missile defense [216] Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the World Trade Organization [217]\n\n\nSeptember 11, 2001, attacks\nThe September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims Three days after the attacks, Bush visited Ground Zero and met with then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on rubble: \"I can hear you The rest of the world hears you And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\" [233]\n\n\nWar on terror\nIn Bush's September 20 speech, he declared that \"our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda, but it does not end there.\" [237] [238] In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an \"axis of evil\" consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Ba'athist Iraq was \"arming to threaten the peace of the world\" and \"pose [d] a grave and growing danger\" [239] The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war [240] This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks [241]\n\n\nAfghanistan invasion\nOn October 7, 2001, U.S and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13 The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated, [248] but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders [248] Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai [249] [250]\n\n\nIraq invasion\nBeginning with his January 29, 2002 State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an \"axis of evil\" allied with terrorists and posing \"a grave and growing danger\" to U.S interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction [239] [258]\n\n\nSurveillance\nFollowing the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush issued an executive order that authorized the President's Surveillance Program The new directive allowed the National Security Agency to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S without obtaining a warrant, which previously had been required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act [284] As of 2009 [update], the other provisions of the program remained highly classified [285] Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists [286] The program proved to be controversial; critics of the administration and organizations such as the American Bar Association argued that it was illegal [287] In August 2006, a U.S district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, [288] but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing [289] On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight [290] Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, which was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court [291] This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post [291] and The Guardian [292] emerged in June 2013 [291]\n\n\nInterrogation policies\nBush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and several other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture [293] [294] [295] [296] Between 2002 and 2003, the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on secret Justice Department legal opinions arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture, which was described as \"an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority to conduct war\" [297] [298] The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn [299] While not permitted by the U.S Army Field Manuals which assert \"that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information\", [297] the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations \"provided critical information\" to preserve American lives [300] Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, \"you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough.\" [301]\n\n\nNorth Korea condemnation\nBush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of three states in an \"axis of evil\" He said that \"the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\" [239] Within months, \"both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994.\" [308] North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on \" [preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world\" [239] Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to \"a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula\", and said that \"transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States\", for which North Korea would be held accountable [309] On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China [310] On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all its nuclear programs by the end of 2007 [311] By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea [312]\n\n\nSyria sanctions\nBush expanded economic sanctions on Syria [314] In 2003, Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act, which expanded sanctions on Syria In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction [315] and being supportive of terrorism [316] Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to \"undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon\" in November 2007 Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and former leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad [317]\n\n\nAIDS Relief\nIn the State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Bush announced $15 billion for this effort, [318] which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women and children worldwide [319] The U.S government had spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure that includes $7 billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a multilateral organization), [320] which saved an estimated five million lives by 2013 [321] The New York Times correspondent Peter Baker wrote in 2013 that \"Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since.\" [321] By 2023, PEPFAR was estimated to have saved over 25 million lives, alleviating the severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, and was called \"George W Bush's greatest accomplishment\" by Vox [322] [323] [324]\n\n\nSecurity incidents\nOn February 7, 2001, while Bush was in the residence area of the White House, Robert W Pickett, standing outside the perimeter fence, discharged a number of shots from a Taurus .38 Special revolver \"in the general direction\" of the White House Pickett was shot in the knee by a U.S Secret Service agent and arrested Furthermore, he was initially charged with discharging a firearm during a crime, carrying a 10-year mandatory sentence, but following a plea agreement, Pickett instead entered a guilty plea to a firearms violation and an Alford plea to assaulting a federal officer He was sentenced to three years at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester followed by three years of probation [325] [326] [327] [328]\n\n\n2001 White House shooting\nOn February 7, 2001, while Bush was in the residence area of the White House, Robert W Pickett, standing outside the perimeter fence, discharged a number of shots from a Taurus .38 Special revolver \"in the general direction\" of the White House Pickett was shot in the knee by a U.S Secret Service agent and arrested Furthermore, he was initially charged with discharging a firearm during a crime, carrying a 10-year mandatory sentence, but following a plea agreement, Pickett instead entered a guilty plea to a firearms violation and an Alford plea to assaulting a federal officer He was sentenced to three years at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester followed by three years of probation [325] [326] [327] [328]\n\n\n2005 Tbilisi grenade attack\nOn May 10, 2005, while President Bush was giving a speech in Freedom Square, Vladimir Arutyunian, a native Georgian who was born to a family of ethnic Armenians, threw a live Soviet-made RGD-5 hand grenade toward the podium It landed in the crowd about 61 feet (19 m) from the podium after hitting a girl, but it did not detonate because a red tartan handkerchief was wrapped tightly around it, preventing the safety lever from detaching [329] [330] Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was seated nearby After escaping that day, Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005 During his arrest, he killed an Interior Ministry agent He was convicted in January 2006 and given a life sentence [331] [332]\n\n\n2008 Baghdad shoeing\nOn December 14, 2008, Muntadhar al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist, threw both of his shoes at Bush during a press conference in Baghdad Bush was not injured, having ducked the pair of shoes [333] However, White House press secretary Dana Perino received a bruise on her face after being hit by a microphone boom knocked over by security [334] Al-Zaidi received a three-year prison sentence which was reduced to one year On September 15, 2009, he was released early for good behavior [333]\n\n\nJudicial appointments\nOn July 19, 2005, following the retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on July 1, Bush nominated federal appellate judge John Roberts as her replacement; however, following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist on September 3, that still-pending nomination was withdrawn on September 5, with Bush instead nominating Roberts to be the next Chief Justice of the United States He was confirmed by the Senate on September 29, 2005 [335]\n\n\nSupreme Court\nOn July 19, 2005, following the retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on July 1, Bush nominated federal appellate judge John Roberts as her replacement; however, following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist on September 3, that still-pending nomination was withdrawn on September 5, with Bush instead nominating Roberts to be the next Chief Justice of the United States He was confirmed by the Senate on September 29, 2005 [335]\n\n\nOther courts\nIn addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district courts [citation needed]\n\n\nCultural and political image\nBush's upbringing in West Texas, his accent, his vacations to his Texas ranch, and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image [337] [338] \"I think people look at him and think John Wayne\", said Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror [339]\n\n\nImage\nBush's upbringing in West Texas, his accent, his vacations to his Texas ranch, and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image [337] [338] \"I think people look at him and think John Wayne\", said Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror [339]\n\n\nJob approval\nBush began his presidency with approval ratings near 60 percent [346] After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90 percent, [347] maintaining 80–90 percent approval for four months after the attacks It remained over 50 percent during most of his first term [348] and then fell to as low as 19 percent in his second term [349]\n\n\nForeign perceptions\nBush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization movements for his administration's foreign policy [380] [381] Views of him within the international community – even in France, a close ally of the United States – were more negative than those of most previous American presidents [382]\n\n\nPost-presidency (2009–present)\nAfter the inauguration of Barack Obama, Bush and his family flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland, Texas and then they returned to their ranch in Crawford, Texas [403] They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas where they live [404]\n\n\nResidence\nAfter the inauguration of Barack Obama, Bush and his family flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland, Texas and then they returned to their ranch in Crawford, Texas [403] They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas where they live [404]\n\n\nPublications and appearances\nSince leaving office, Bush has kept a relatively low profile [411] Bush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries [412] [413]\n\n\nCollaborations\nIn January 2010, at President Obama's request, Bush and Bill Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake earlier that month [479]\n\n\nArt\nAfter serving as president, Bush began painting as a hobby after reading Winston Churchill's essay \"Painting as a Pastime\" Subjects have included people, dogs, and still life [485] He has also painted self-portraits and portraits of world leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair [486] [487] [488] In February 2017, Bush released a book of portraits of veterans, Portraits of Courage [445] The net proceeds from his book are donated to the George W Bush Presidential Center In May 2019, on the tenth anniversary of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's death, George Bush drew a portrait of Roh to give to his family [454]\n\n\nLegacy\nBush's legacy continues to develop today, as time passing allows the development of a more nuanced historical perspective Supporters credit his counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the U.S after the September 11 attacks and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction after claiming they were in Iraq, as well as Bush's handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis, as proof that he was unfit to be president [489] [490] [491] Ben Ferencz, former chief prosecutor for the United States Army at the Nuremberg Trials, has stated that Bush likely committed war crimes in relation to the Iraq War [492] [493] [494]\n\n\nReception\nThe George W Bush presidency has been ranked as below-average in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s [505] [506] [507]\n\n\nHonors and awards\nA street in Tirana, Albania, formerly known as Rruga Punëtorët e Rilindjes, directly outside the Albanian Parliament was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007 [400] In 2012, Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves awarded Bush the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana for his work in expanding NATO [524] Two elementary schools are named after him: one in Stockton Unified School District in Stockton, California, [525] and one in Wylie Independent School District in St Paul, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area [526]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

{"title": "Spider-Man_in_film", "content": "\nHistory\nThe fictional character Spider-Man, a comic book superhero created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and featured in Marvel Comics publications, has appeared as a main character in numerous theatrical and made-for-television films.\n\n\nEarly TV films\nIn 1977, the pilot episode of The Amazing Spider-Man television series was released by Columbia Pictures as Spider-Man outside of the United States It was directed by E W Swackhamer, written by Alvin Boretz and stars Nicholas Hammond as the titular character, David White as J Jonah Jameson and Jeff Donnell as May Parker The film premiered on CBS on September 14, 1977, and received a VHS release in 1980.\n\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man series\nIn 1977, the pilot episode of The Amazing Spider-Man

character, David White as J Jonah Jameson and Jeff Donnell as May Parker The film premiered on CBS on September 14, 1977, and received a VHS release in 1980.\n\n\nSpider-Man (1977)\nIn 1977, the pilot episode of The Amazing Spider-Man television series was released by Columbia Pictures as Spider-Man outside of the United States It was directed by E W Swackhamer, written by Alvin Boretz and stars Nicholas Hammond as the titular character, David White as J Jonah Jameson and Jeff Donnell as May Parker The film premiered on CBS on September 14, 1977, and received a VHS release in 1980.\n\n\nSpider-Man Strikes Back (1978)\nIn 1978, the two-part episode \"Deadly Dust\" from the television series The Amazing Spider-Man was re-edited and released outside of the United States as a feature film, Spider-Man Strikes Back Nicholas Hammond reprises his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man while Robert F Simon replaces David White in the role of J Jonah Jameson The film was theatrically released on 8 May 1978.\n\n\nSpider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge (1981)\nIn 1981, a film made from The Amazing Spider-Man television series finale \"The Chinese Web\", using the same method used to make Spider-Man Strikes Back, was released as Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge in European territories Nicholas Hammond and Robert F Simon respectively reprise their roles as Peter Parker / Spider-Man and J Jonah Jameson It was directed by Ron Satlof and written by Robert Janes Other actors include Rosalind Chao, Benson Fong, and Ellen Bry.\n\n\nJapanese film\nIn 1978, Tōei released a theatrical spin-off of their Spider-Man TV series at the Tōei Cartoon Festival The film was directed by Kōichi Takemoto, who also directed eight episodes of the TV series The week after the film's release, a character introduced in the film, Jūzō Mamiya (played by Noboru Nakaya), began appearing in episodes of the TV series The film was released on July 22, 1978 Like the rest of the series, the film was made available for streaming on Marvel's official website in 2009.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe low box office performance of 1983's Superman III made feature-film adaptations of comic book properties a low priority in Hollywood until the late 1990s [8] In 1985, after a brief option on Spider-Man by Roger Corman expired, [9] Marvel Comics optioned the property to Cannon Films Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of any film's revenues [10] However, the rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990 [11]\n\n\nCannon Films\nThe low box office performance of 1983's Superman III made feature-film adaptations of comic book properties a low priority in Hollywood until the late 1990s [8] In 1985, after a brief option on Spider-Man by Roger Corman expired, [9] Marvel Comics optioned the property to Cannon Films Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of any film's revenues [10] However, the rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990 [11]\n\n\nCarolco Pictures / MGM\n21st Century's Menahem Golan still actively immersed himself mounting \"his\" Spider-Man, sending the original \"Doc Ock\" script for production bids In 1990, he contacted Canadian effects company Light and Motion Corporation regarding the visual effects, which in turn offered the stop-motion chores to Steven Archer (Krull, Clash of the Titans) [22]\n\n\nJames Cameron \"scriptment\"\nMonths later, James Cameron submitted an undated 57-page \"scriptment\" with an alternate story (the copyright registration was dated 1991), part screenplay, part narrative story outline [12] The \"scriptment\" told the Spider-Man origin, but used variations on the comic book characters Electro and Sandman as villains This \"Electro\" (named Carlton Strand, instead of Max Dillon) was a megalomaniacal parody of corrupt capitalists Instead of Flint Marko's character, Cameron's \"Sandman\" (simply named Boyd) is mutated by an accident involving Philadelphia Experiment-style bilocation and atom-mixing, in lieu of getting caught in a nuclear blast on a beach The story climaxes with a battle atop the World Trade Center and had Peter Parker revealing his identity to Mary Jane Watson In addition, the treatment was also heavy on profanity, and had Spider-Man and Mary Jane having sex on the Brooklyn Bridge [27]\n\n\nLitigation\nWhen James Cameron agreed to make Spider-Man, Carolco lawyers simply used his previous Terminator 2 contract as a template A clause in this agreement gave Cameron the right to decide on movie and advertising credits Show business trade articles and advertisements made no mention of Golan, who was still actively assembling the elements for the film [11] In 1993, Golan complained publicly and finally instigated legal action against Carolco for disavowing his contractual guarantee credit as producer On the other hand, Cameron had the contractual right to decide on credits [13] Eventually, Carolco sued Viacom and Columbia to recover broadcast and home video rights, and the two studios countersued [10] 20th Century Fox, though not part of the litigation, contested Cameron's participation, claiming exclusivity on his services as a director under yet another contract [12] In 1996, Carolco, 21st Century, and Marvel went bankrupt.\n\n\nColumbia Pictures\nIn the meantime, MGM/UA chief executive John Calley moved to Columbia Pictures Intimately familiar with the legal history of producer Kevin McClory's claim to the rights to both Thunderball and other related James Bond characters and elements, Calley announced that Columbia would produce an alternate 007 series, based on the \"McClory material\", which Calley acquired for Columbia [34] Columbia had made the original 1967 film spoof of Casino Royale, a non-Eon production.\n\n\nSam Raimi's trilogy\nSpider-Man follows Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), an orphaned high schooler who pines after popular girl-next-door Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) While on a science class field trip at Columbia University, a genetically-engineered \"super spider\" bites Peter As a result, Peter gains superhuman abilities, including increased strength, speed, and the abilities to scale walls and generate organic webbing After his beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) is murdered, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the father of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality Donning a military battle suit, Norman becomes a freakish \"Green Goblin\", who begins to terrorize the city Peter, as Spider-Man, now must battle with the Goblin, all while dealing with personal situations involving his domestic and his love life.\n\n\nSpider-Man (2002)\nSpider-Man follows Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), an orphaned high schooler who pines after popular girl-next-door Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) While on a science class field trip at Columbia University, a genetically-engineered \"super spider\" bites Peter As a result, Peter gains superhuman abilities, including increased strength, speed, and the abilities to scale walls and generate organic webbing After his beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) is murdered, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the father of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality Donning a military battle suit, Norman becomes a freakish \"Green Goblin\", who begins to terrorize the city Peter, as Spider-Man, now must battle with the Goblin, all while dealing with personal situations involving his domestic and his love life.\n\n\nSpider-Man 2 (2004)\nTwo years after the events of the first film, Peter struggles to balance his superhero and private lives and still pines after Mary Jane Watson, who is now engaged Harry Osborn continues to believe Spider-Man is responsible for his father Norman Osborn's death Spider-Man contends with scientist Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), also known as Doctor Octopus, who initially mentors his alter-ego and has four mechanical tentacles fused to his spine following a failed fusion-based experiment and sets out to recreate the same that could destroy much of New York City.\n\n\nSpider-Man 3 (2007)\nPeter is still with Mary Jane Watson, while Harry Osborn succeeds his father as the new Green Goblin (credited as New Goblin) Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who, like Peter, is a photographer for the Daily Bugle, sets out to defame Spider-Man and incriminate him Meanwhile, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict, falls into a particle accelerator and becomes a shape-shifting sand monster known as Sandman Peter later learns that Marko killed Uncle Ben, causing Peter's own dark intentions to grow This vendetta is enhanced by the appearance of the mysterious black alien symbiotic substance that bonds to Peter, resulting in the formation of a new black costume Once Peter separates himself from the alien, it finds a new host in the form of Brock, resulting in the creation of Venom and Peter Parker having to battle the villains in the end.\n\n\nCanceled fourth film and potential revival\nIn 2007, Spider-Man 4 entered development, with Raimi attached to direct and Maguire, Dunst, and other cast members set to reprise their roles Both a fourth and a fifth film were planned and at one time the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration However, Raimi stated in March 2009 that only the fourth film was in development at that time, and that if there were fifth and sixth films, those two films would actually be a continuation of each other [39] [40] [41] [42] Zodiac screenwriter James Vanderbilt was hired by Sony Pictures in October 2007 to pen the screenplay after initial reports in January that Sony was in contact with David Koepp, who wrote the first Spider-Man film [43] [44] The script was being rewritten by David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross in November 2008 and October 2009 [45] Sony also engaged Vanderbilt to write scripts for Spider-Man 5 and Spider-Man 6 [44]\n\n\nMarc Webb's duology\nFollowing the cancelation of Spider-Man 4, Sony

properties a low priority in Hollywood until the late 1990s [8] In 1985, after a brief option on Spider-Man by Roger Corman expired, [9] Marvel Comics optioned the property to Cannon Films Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of any film's revenues [10] However, the rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990 [11]\n\n\nCannon Films\nThe low box office performance of 1983's Superman III made feature-film adaptations of comic book properties a low priority in Hollywood until the late 1990s [8] In 1985, after a brief option on Spider-Man by Roger Corman expired, [9] Marvel Comics optioned the property to Cannon Films Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of any film's revenues [10] However, the rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990 [11]\n\n\nCarolco Pictures / MGM\n21st Century's Menahem Golan still actively immersed himself mounting \"his\" Spider-Man, sending the original \"Doc Ock\" script for production bids In 1990, he contacted Canadian effects company Light and Motion Corporation regarding the visual effects, which in turn offered the stop-motion chores to Steven Archer (Krull, Clash of the Titans) [22]\n\n\nJames Cameron \"scriptment\"\nMonths later, James Cameron submitted an undated 57-page \"scriptment\" with an alternate story (the copyright registration was dated 1991), part screenplay, part narrative story outline [12] The \"scriptment\" told the Spider-Man origin, but used variations on the comic book characters Electro and Sandman as villains This \"Electro\" (named Carlton Strand, instead of Max Dillon) was a megalomaniacal parody of corrupt capitalists Instead of Flint Marko's character, Cameron's \"Sandman\" (simply named Boyd) is mutated by an accident involving Philadelphia Experiment-style bilocation and atom-mixing, in lieu of getting caught in a nuclear blast on a beach The story climaxes with a battle atop the World Trade Center and had Peter Parker revealing his identity to Mary Jane Watson In addition, the treatment was also heavy on profanity, and had Spider-Man and Mary Jane having sex on the Brooklyn Bridge [27]\n\n\nLitigation\nWhen James Cameron agreed to make Spider-Man, Carolco lawyers simply used his previous Terminator 2 contract as a template A clause in this agreement gave Cameron the right to decide on movie and advertising credits Show business trade articles and advertisements made no mention of Golan, who was still actively assembling the elements for the film [11] In 1993, Golan complained publicly and finally instigated legal action against Carolco for disavowing his contractual guarantee credit as producer On the other hand, Cameron had the contractual right to decide on credits [13] Eventually, Carolco sued Viacom and Columbia to recover broadcast and home video rights, and the two studios countersued [10] 20th Century Fox, though not part of the litigation, contested Cameron's participation, claiming exclusivity on his services as a director under yet another contract [12] In 1996, Carolco, 21st Century, and Marvel went bankrupt.\n\n\nColumbia Pictures\nIn the meantime, MGM/UA chief executive John Calley moved to Columbia Pictures Intimately familiar with the legal history of producer Kevin McClory's claim to the rights to both Thunderball and other related James Bond characters and elements, Calley announced that Columbia would produce an alternate 007 series, based on the \"McClory material\", which Calley acquired for Columbia [34] Columbia had made the

Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who, like Peter, is a photographer for the Daily Bugle, sets out to defame Spider-Man and incriminate him Meanwhile, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict, falls into a particle accelerator and becomes a shape-shifting sand monster known as Sandman Peter later learns that Marko killed Uncle Ben, causing Peter's own dark intentions to grow This vendetta

it began as a port of the first game but evolved into a separate project [26]\n\n\n1995–1998: Saturn era\nFollowing Sonic & Knuckles, Naka returned to Japan, having been offered a role as a producer [15] He was reunited with Ohshima and brought with him Takashi Iizuka, [39] who had worked with Naka's team at STI [27] Sonic Team was officially formed as a brand, [40] [41] and began to work on a new intellectual property, [15] Nights into Dreams (1996), for Sega's 32-bit Saturn console [42] In 1996, towards the end of the Genesis's lifecycle, Sega released Sonic 3D Blast, an isometric game based on the original Sonic 3 concept, [43] as the system still had a large install base [44] It was the final Sonic game produced for the Genesis, [45] and was developed as a swan song for the system [46] Since Sonic Team was preoccupied with Nights, 3D Blast was outsourced to the British studio Traveller's Tales [42] While 3D Blast sold well, [44] [47] it was criticized for its gameplay, controls, and slow pace [48] [49] [50]\n\n\n1998–2005: Transition to 3D\nWith its Sonic Jam experiments, Sonic Team began developing a 3D Sonic platformer for the Saturn The project stemmed from a proposal by Iizuka to develop a Sonic role-playing video game (RPG) with an emphasis on storytelling Development moved to Sega's new console, the Dreamcast, which Naka believed would allow for the ultimate Sonic game [6]: 65–67  Sonic Adventure, directed by Iizuka and released in 1998, [70] was one of the first sixth-generation video games [71] It introduced elements that became series staples, [72] [73] such as artist Yuji Uekawa's new character designs influenced by comics and animation [72] In 1999, Iizuka and 11 other Sonic Team members relocated to San Francisco and established Sonic Team USA to develop the more action-oriented Sonic Adventure 2 (2001) [15] [74] Between the releases, Ohshima left Sega to form Artoon [75] While both Adventure games were well received [70] and the first sold over two million copies, [76] consumer interest in the Dreamcast quickly faded, and Sega's attempts to spur sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses [77]\n\n\n2005–2010: Franchise struggles\nSonic Team USA was renamed Sega Studios USA after completing Sonic Heroes [15] Sega and Sonic Team leadership entered flux while they experimented with diverging from the Sonic formula [88] Sega Studios USA's first post-Heroes project was Shadow the Hedgehog (2005), a spin-off starring the popular Adventure 2 character Shadow [104] [105] While Shadow retains most elements from previous Sonic games, it was aimed at a mature audience and introduced third-person shooting and nonlinear gameplay [106] Shadow the Hedgehog was panned for its controls, level design, and mature themes, [107] [108] but was a commercial success, selling at least 1.59 million copies [109] [110]\n\n\n2010–2015: Refocusing\nIizuka felt Sonic was struggling because it lacked unified direction, [70] so Sonic Team refocused on more traditional side-scrolling elements and fast-paced gameplay [140] Sonic the Hedgehog 4, a side-scrolling episodic sequel to Sonic & Knuckles co-developed by Sonic Team and Dimps, [141] [142] began with Episode I in 2010, [143] followed by Episode II in 2012 [144] Later in 2010, Sega released Sonic Colors for the Wii and DS, which expanded on the well received aspects of Unleashed and introduced the Wisp power-ups [145] For the series' 20th anniversary in 2011, Sega released Sonic Generations for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Windows; [146] [147] a separate version was developed by Dimps for the Nintendo 3DS [148] [149] Sonic Generations featured reimagined versions of levels from previous Sonic games and reintroduced the \"classic\" Sonic design from the Genesis era [146] [149] These efforts were better received, especially in comparison to Sonic '06 and Unleashed [140]\n\n\n2015–present: New directions\nIn a 2015 interview with Polygon, Iizuka acknowledged that contemporary Sonic games had been disappointing He hoped, from then on, that the Sonic Team logo would stand as a \"mark of quality\"; he planned to release quality games and expand the Sonic brand, while retaining the modern Sonic design [140] Iizuka and most of Sonic Team relocated to Burbank, California to oversee the franchise with a new team [88] At San Diego Comic-Con in July 2016, Sega announced two Sonic games to coincide with the series' 25th anniversary: Sonic Mania and Sonic Forces [170] Both were released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows in 2017 [171] [172] Sonic Mania was developed by the independent game developers PagodaWest Games and Headcannon with a staff comprising members of the Sonic fandom; Whitehead conceived the project and served as director [173] The game, which emulates the gameplay and visuals of the Genesis entries, received the best reviews for a Sonic game in 15 years [174] Meanwhile, Sonic Team developed Sonic Forces, which revives the dual gameplay of Sonic Generations along with a third gameplay style featuring the player's custom character [175] [176] Sonic Forces received mixed reviews, [177] with criticism for its short length [175] [178] [179]\n\n\nCharacters and story\nThe Sonic franchise is known for its large cast of characters; [195] Sonic the Fighters (1996) producer Yu Suzuki joked that anyone who makes a Sonic game has the duty to create new characters [196] The first game introduced Sonic, a blue hedgehog who can run at incredible speeds, and Doctor Eggman, a rotund mad scientist [4] During the Genesis era, Eggman was referred to as Doctor Ivo Robotnik in Western territories [197] [198] Sega of America's Dean Sitton made the change [199] without consulting the Japanese developers, who did not want a single character to have two different names Since Sonic Adventure, the character has been referred to as Eggman in all territories, [197] although the Robotnik name is still acknowledged [198] [200] [201]\n\n\nGameplay\nThe Sonic series is characterized by speed-based platforming gameplay [195] Controlling the player character, the player navigates a series of levels at high speeds while jumping between platforms, fighting enemies and bosses, and avoiding obstacles [195] [232] The series contains both 2D and 3D games [233] 2D entries generally feature simple, pinball-like gameplay [232] [234]—with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button [235]—and branching level paths that require memorization to maintain speed [232] [234] Meanwhile, 3D entries tend to be more linear in design, [234] feature various level objectives, [236] different movesets, [234] and allow players to upgrade and customize the playable character [236] [237] Games since Sonic Unleashed have blended 2D and 3D gameplay, with the camera shifting between side-scrolling and third-person perspectives [145] [238]\n\n\nMusic\nFor the original Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True, to compose the soundtrack [5] [274] Nakamura returned to compose Sonic 2's soundtrack [275] Dreams Come True owns the rights to Nakamura's score, which created problems when the Sonic Spinball team used his Sonic theme music without permission [24] For Sonic CD, two soundtracks were composed; the original, featured in the Japanese and European releases, was composed by Naofumi Hataya and Masafumi Ogata, while the North American score was composed by Spencer Nilsen, David Young, and Mark Crew [276] [277]\n\n\nOther media\nOutside the Sonic series, Sonic appears in other Sonic Team games as a playable character in Christmas Nights (1996), [304] a power-up in Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003), [305] and in a cameo in the 2008 Wii version of Samba de Amigo (1999) [306] Sonic characters also feature in the Sega All-Stars series, which includes Sega Superstars (2004), [307] Sega Superstars Tennis (2008), [308] and Sumo Digital's kart racing games Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (2010) and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (2012) [180] [181]\n\n\nCrossovers\nOutside the Sonic series, Sonic appears in other Sonic Team games as a playable character in Christmas Nights (1996), [304] a power-up in Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003), [305] and in a cameo in the 2008 Wii version of Samba de Amigo (1999) [306] Sonic characters also feature in the Sega All-Stars series, which includes Sega Superstars (2004), [307] Sega Superstars Tennis (2008), [308] and Sumo Digital's kart racing games Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (2010) and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (2012) [180] [181]\n\n\nAnimation\nIn 1992, Sega approached the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) about producing two television series—\"a syndicated show for the after-school audience\" and a Saturday-morning cartoon—based on Sonic Kalinske \"had seen how instrumental the launch of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon series was to the success of the toyline\" during his time at Mattel and believed that success could be recreated using Sonic [334] The two cartoons, the syndicated Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (1993) and ABC's Sonic the Hedgehog (1993–1994), were produced by DIC Entertainment DIC also produced a Sonic Christmas special in 1996, and Sonic Underground in 1999, to promote Sonic Adventure [335] [336] DIC's Sonic adaptations are generally not held in high regard [335] [337] [338]\n\n\nComics\nShogakukan published a Sonic the Hedgehog manga series in its Shogaku Yonensei magazine, beginning in 1992 Written by Kenji Terada and illustrated by Sango Norimoto, it follows a sweet but cowardly young hedgehog named Nicky whose alter ego is the cocky, heroic Sonic [366] According to character artist Kazuyuki Hoshino, the manga was part of Sega's promotional strategy to appeal to primary school children [367] The Sonic design team worked with Shogakukan to create new characters; Amy Rose and Charmy Bee originated in the manga before appearing in the games [37] [367]\n\n\nLive-action film franchise\nIn August 1994, Sega of America signed a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Trilogy Entertainment to produce a live-action animated film to tie in with Sonic X-treme In May 1995, screenwriter Richard Jefferies pitched a treatment, Sonic the Hedgehog: Wonders of the World, to Sega It saw Sonic and Eggman escape from Sonic X-treme into the real world and Sonic collaborate with a boy to stop Eggman No agreement was reached, and the film was canceled With permission from Sega, Jeffries pitched his treatment to DreamWorks Animation, but it was rejected [334]\n\n\nSonic the Hedgehog (2020)\nIn 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired the Sonic film rights [376] In June 2014, it announced plans to produce a Sonic film as a joint venture with Sega's Marza Animation Planet [377] Neal H Moritz was attached to produce under his Original Film banner, alongside Takeshi Ito, Mie Onishi, and Toru Nakahara [377] In February 2016, Sega CEO Hajime Satomi said the film was scheduled for 2018 [378] Blur Studio's Tim Miller and Jeff Fowler were hired the following October to develop the film;

at its January 1992 peak Sega held 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles [11] Although Nintendo eventually reclaimed the number-one position, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo had not led the console market [531] 1UP.com credited Sonic for \"turning the course\" of the 16-bit console wars, helping make Sega a dominant player and industry giant [23]\n\n\nCultural impact\nOne of the world's most popular video game characters, by 1992 Sonic was more recognizable to children ages 6 to 11 than Disney's Mickey Mouse In 1993, Sonic became the first video game character to have a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, [23] and he was one of the four characters inducted on the Walk of Game in 2005, alongside Mario, Link, and Master Chief [541] Additionally, a Japanese team developing the Radio & Plasma Wave Investigation (RPWI) instrumentation for the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft, to be launched by ESA and Airbus in 2023, received approval to use Sonic as the mascot [542] Sonic and Eggman appear as minor characters in the Walt Disney Animation Studios films Wreck-It Ralph (2012) and Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018), [543] [544] while Sonic makes cameos in Ready Player One (2018) [545] and Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (2022) [546]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Sonic the Hedgehog**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSonic the Hedgehog is a video game franchise created by Yuji Naka and Naoto Ohshima that has become one of the most recognizable and beloved franchises in the world of gaming. The franchise was first introduced in 1991 and has since become a cultural phenomenon, spawning numerous video games, TV shows, movies, and merchandise. The franchise follows the adventures of its iconic titular character, Sonic, a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog who can run at incredible speeds and is known for his bravery and determination.\n\n**History**\n\nBy 1990, the Japanese video game company Sega wanted a foothold in the video game console market with its 16-bit console, the Sega Genesis. Sega's efforts had been stymied by the dominance of Nintendo, and the Genesis did not have a large install base. Nintendo did not take Sega seriously as a competitor, and Sega of America CEO Michael Katz attempted to challenge Nintendo with the \"Genesis does what Nintendon't\" marketing campaign and by collaborating with athletes and celebrities to create games. These efforts did not break Nintendo's dominance, and Katz was replaced by Tom Kalinske, formerly of Mattel.\n\n**1990–1991: Conception and First Game**\n\nThe concept of Sonic the Hedgehog was born out of a desire to create a character that could compete with Nintendo's Mario. Yuji Naka, a young designer at Sega, was tasked with creating a new character that could become the face of the company. Naka's initial concept was a character named \"Needlemouse,\" but the name was later changed to Sonic the Hedgehog. The game was first released in 1991 and was a massive success, selling over 15 million copies worldwide.\n\n**1991–1995: Genesis Sequels**\n\nNaka was dissatisfied with his treatment at Sega and felt he received little credit for his involvement in the success of Sonic. He quit but was hired by Cerny to work at the US-based Sega Technical Institute (STI), with a higher salary and more creative freedom. STI began work on Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in November 1991, and the game was released in 1992. Level artist Yasushi Yamaguchi designed Sonic's new sidekick, Tails, a flying two-tailed fox inspired by the mythological kitsune. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a major success, but its development suffered from the language barrier and cultural differences between the Japanese and American developers.\n\n**1995–1998: Saturn Era**\n\nFollowing Sonic & Knuckles, Naka returned to Japan, having been offered a role as a producer. He was reunited with Ohshima and brought with him Takashi Iizuka, who had worked with Naka's team at STI. Sonic Team was officially formed as a brand and began to work on a new intellectual property, Nights into Dreams, for Sega's 32-bit Saturn console. In 1996, Sega released Sonic 3D Blast, an isometric game based on the original Sonic 3 concept, as the system still had a large install base. Since Sonic Team was preoccupied with Nights, 3D Blast was outsourced to the British studio Traveller's Tales.\n\n**1998–2005: Transition to 3D**\n\nWith its Sonic Jam experiments, Sonic Team began developing a 3D Sonic platformer for the Saturn. The project stemmed from a proposal by Iizuka to develop a Sonic role-playing video game (RPG) with an emphasis on storytelling. Development moved to Sega's new console, the Dreamcast, which Naka believed would allow for the ultimate Sonic game. Sonic Adventure, directed by Iizuka and released in 1998, was one of the first sixth-generation video games. It introduced elements that became series staples, such as artist Yuji Uekawa's new character designs influenced by comics and animation.\n\n**2005–2010: Franchise Struggles**\n\nSonic Team USA was renamed Sega Studios USA after completing Sonic Heroes. Sega and Sonic Team leadership entered flux while they experimented with diverging from the Sonic formula. Sega Studios USA's first post-Heroes project was Shadow the Hedgehog, a spin-off starring the popular Adventure 2 character Shadow. Shadow the Hedgehog was panned for its controls, level design, and mature themes, but was a commercial success, selling at least 1.59 million copies.\n\n**2010–2015: Refocusing**\n\nIizuka felt Sonic was struggling because it lacked unified direction, so Sonic Team refocused on more traditional side-scrolling elements and fast-paced gameplay. Sonic the Hedgehog 4, a side-scrolling episodic sequel to Sonic & Knuckles co-developed by Sonic Team and Dimps, began with Episode I in 2010, followed by Episode II in 2012. Later in 2010, Sega released Sonic Colors for the Wii and DS, which expanded on the well-received aspects of Unleashed and introduced the Wisp power-ups. For the series' 20th anniversary in 2011, Sega released Sonic Generations for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Windows; a separate version was developed by Dimps for the Nintendo 3DS.\n\n**2015–present: New Directions**\n\nIn a 2015 interview with Polygon, Iizuka acknowledged that contemporary Sonic games had been disappointing. He hoped, from then on, that the Sonic Team logo would stand as a \"mark of quality\"; he planned to release quality games and expand the Sonic brand, while retaining the modern Sonic design. Iizuka and most of Sonic Team relocated to Burbank, California to oversee the franchise with a new team. At San Diego Comic-Con in July 2016, Sega announced two Sonic games to coincide with the series' 25th anniversary: Sonic Mania and Sonic Forces. Both were released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows in 2017.\n\n**Characters and Story**\n\nThe Sonic franchise is known for its large cast of characters. Sonic the Fighters (1996) producer Yu Suzuki joked that anyone who makes a Sonic game has the duty to create new characters. The first game introduced Sonic, a blue hedgehog who can run at incredible speeds, and Doctor Eggman, a rotund mad scientist. During the Genesis era, Eggman was referred to as Doctor Ivo Robotnik in Western territories. Since Sonic Adventure, the character has been referred to as Eggman in all territories, although the Robotnik name is still acknowledged.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe Sonic series is characterized by speed-based platforming gameplay. Controlling the player character, the player navigates a series of levels at high speeds while jumping between platforms, fighting enemies and bosses, and avoiding obstacles. The series contains both 2D and 3D games. 2D entries generally feature simple, pinball-like gameplay, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button. Meanwhile, 3D entries tend to be more linear in design, feature various level objectives, different movesets, and allow players to upgrade and customize the playable character.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe original Sonic the Hedgehog soundtrack was composed by Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. Nakamura's score created problems when the Sonic Spinball team used his Sonic theme music without permission. For Sonic CD, two soundtracks were composed; the original, featured in the Japanese and European releases, was composed by Naofumi Hataya and Masafumi Ogata, while the North American score was composed by Spencer Nilsen, David Young, and Mark Crew.\n\n**Other Media**\n\nOutside the Sonic series, Sonic appears in other Sonic Team games as a playable character in Christmas Nights (1996), a power-up in Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003), and in a cameo in the 2008 Wii version of Samba de Amigo (1999). Sonic characters also feature in the Sega All-Stars series, which includes Sega Superstars (2004), Sega Superstars Tennis (2008), and Sumo Digital's kart racing games Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (2010) and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (2012).\n\n**Animation**\n\nIn 1992, Sega approached the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) about producing two television series—\"a syndicated show for the after-school audience\" and a Saturday-morning cartoon—based on Sonic. DIC Entertainment produced the two cartoons, the syndicated Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (1993) and ABC's Sonic the Hedgehog (1993–1994). DIC also produced a Sonic Christmas special in 1996, and Sonic Underground in 1999, to promote Sonic Adventure.\n\n**Comics**\n\nShogakukan published a Sonic the Hedgehog manga series in its Shogaku Yonensei magazine, beginning in 1992. The manga was part of Sega's promotional strategy to appeal to primary school children. The Sonic design team worked with Shogakukan to create new characters; Amy Rose and Charmy Bee originated in the manga before appearing in the games.\n\n**Live-action Film Franchise**\n\nIn 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired the Sonic film rights. In June 2014, it announced plans to produce a Sonic film as a joint venture with Sega's Marza Animation Planet. Neal H Moritz was attached to produce under his Original Film banner, alongside Takeshi Ito, Mie Onishi, and Toru Nakahara. In February 2016, Sega CEO Hajime Satomi said the film was scheduled for 2018. Blur Studio's Tim Miller and Jeff Fowler were hired the following October to develop the film; Fowler would make his feature directorial debut, while both would executive produce. In October 2017, Paramount Pictures acquired the rights after Sony put the film into turnaround. Principal photography began in September 2018 in Ladysmith, British Columbia.\n\n**Merchandise**\n\nLicensed Sonic merchandise includes books, clothing, soundtracks, board games, and toys such as figures and plushes. By 2004, the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise had generated more than $1 billion in licensed merchandise sales. Sega and McDonald's collaborated for Sonic-themed Happy Meal promotions in 1994 for Sonic 3 and in 2004 for Sonic Heroes. A million pairs of Sonic trousers were sold by 1996.\n\n**Events**\n\nTo celebrate Sonic the Hedgehog's 30th anniversary, Sega presented the concert Sonic the Hedgehog 30th Anniversary Symphony as a free live stream on YouTube and Twitch, starring performances of orchestral arrangements of Sonic's music by Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and pop rock arrangements by the Tomoya Ohtani Band and Crush 40, with Nathan Sharp as guest singer.\n\n**Reception and Legacy**\n\nSonic the Hedgehog is one of the bestselling video game franchises. Its cumulative sales reached 89 million copies by March 2011 and over 140 million by 2016. The Mario & Sonic series alone sold over 19 million copies as of 2011. The Sonic the Hedgehog games had grossed over $5 billion in sales by 2014. Series sales and free-to-play mobile game downloads totaled 920 million by 2019, more than 1.14 billion by 2020, over 1.6 billion by 2023, and over 1.77 billion by 2024.\n\n**Effect on the Industry**\n\nPrimarily because of its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog contributed greatly to the console's popularity in North America. Between October and December 1991, the Genesis outsold its chief competitor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, by a two-to-one ratio; at its January 1992 peak Sega held 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually reclaimed the number-one position, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo had not led the console market.\n\n**Cultural Impact**\n\nOne of the world's most popular video game characters, by 1992 Sonic was more recognizable to children ages 6 to 11 than Disney's Mickey Mouse. In 1993, Sonic became the first video game character to have a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Additionally, a Japanese team developing the Radio & Plasma Wave Investigation (RPWI) instrumentation for the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft, to be launched by ESA and Airbus in 2023, received approval to use Sonic as the mascot.\n\n**References**\n\nNote: The article does not include any citations or references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nBy 1990, the Japanese video game company Sega wanted a foothold in the video game console market with its 16-bit console, the Sega Genesis Sega's efforts had been stymied by the dominance of Nintendo;

it began as a port of the first game but evolved into a separate project [26]\n\n\n1995–1998: Saturn era\nFollowing Sonic & Knuckles, Naka returned to Japan, having been offered a role as a producer [15] He was reunited with Ohshima and brought with him Takashi Iizuka, [39] who had worked with Naka's team at STI [27] Sonic Team was officially formed as a brand, [40] [41] and began to work on a new intellectual property, [15] Nights into Dreams (1996), for Sega's 32-bit Saturn console [42] In 1996, towards the end of the Genesis's lifecycle, Sega released Sonic 3D Blast, an isometric game based on the original Sonic 3 concept, [43] as the system still had a large install base [44] It was the final Sonic game produced for the Genesis, [45] and was developed as a swan song for the system [46] Since Sonic Team was preoccupied with Nights, 3D Blast was outsourced to the British studio Traveller's Tales [42] While 3D Blast sold well, [44] [47] it was criticized for its gameplay, controls, and slow pace [48] [49] [50]\n\n\n1998–2005: Transition to 3D\nWith its Sonic Jam experiments, Sonic Team began developing a 3D Sonic platformer for the Saturn The project stemmed from a proposal by Iizuka to develop a Sonic role-playing video game (RPG) with an emphasis on storytelling Development moved to Sega's new console, the Dreamcast, which Naka believed would allow for the ultimate Sonic game [6]: 65–67  Sonic Adventure, directed by Iizuka and released in 1998, [70] was one of the first sixth-generation video games [71] It introduced elements that became series staples, [72] [73] such as artist Yuji Uekawa's new character designs influenced by comics and animation [72] In 1999, Iizuka and 11 other Sonic Team members relocated to San Francisco and established Sonic Team USA to develop the more action-oriented Sonic Adventure 2 (2001) [15] [74] Between the releases, Ohshima left Sega to form Artoon [75] While both Adventure games were well received [70] and the first sold over two million copies, [76] consumer interest in the Dreamcast quickly faded, and Sega's attempts to spur sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses [77]\n\n\n2005–2010: Franchise struggles\nSonic Team USA was renamed Sega Studios USA after completing Sonic Heroes [15] Sega and Sonic Team leadership entered flux while they experimented with diverging from the Sonic formula [88] Sega Studios USA's first post-Heroes project was Shadow the Hedgehog (2005), a spin-off starring the popular Adventure 2 character Shadow [104] [105] While Shadow retains most elements from previous Sonic games, it was aimed at a mature audience and introduced third-person shooting and nonlinear gameplay [106] Shadow the Hedgehog was panned for its controls, level design, and mature themes, [107] [108] but was a commercial success, selling at least 1.59 million copies [109] [110]\n\n\n2010–2015: Refocusing\nIizuka felt Sonic was struggling because it lacked unified direction, [70] so Sonic Team refocused on more traditional side-scrolling elements and fast-paced gameplay [140] Sonic the Hedgehog 4, a side-scrolling episodic sequel to Sonic & Knuckles co-developed by Sonic Team and Dimps, [141] [142] began with Episode I in 2010, [143] followed by Episode II in 2012 [144] Later in 2010, Sega released Sonic Colors for the Wii and DS, which expanded on the well received aspects of Unleashed and introduced the Wisp power-ups [145] For the series' 20th anniversary in 2011, Sega released Sonic Generations for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Windows; [146] [147] a separate version was developed by Dimps for the Nintendo 3DS [148] [149] Sonic Generations featured reimagined versions of levels from previous Sonic games and reintroduced the \"classic\" Sonic design from the Genesis era [146] [149] These efforts were better received, especially in comparison to Sonic '06 and Unleashed [140]\n\n\n2015–present: New directions\nIn a 2015 interview with Polygon, Iizuka acknowledged that contemporary Sonic games had been disappointing He hoped, from then on, that the Sonic Team logo would stand as a \"mark of quality\"; he planned to release quality games and expand the Sonic brand, while retaining the modern Sonic design [140] Iizuka and most of Sonic Team relocated to Burbank, California to oversee the franchise with a new team [88] At San Diego Comic-Con in July 2016, Sega announced two Sonic games to coincide with the series' 25th anniversary: Sonic Mania and Sonic Forces [170] Both were released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows in 2017 [171] [172] Sonic Mania was developed by the independent game developers PagodaWest Games and Headcannon with a staff comprising members of the Sonic fandom; Whitehead conceived the project and served as director [173] The game, which emulates the gameplay and visuals of the Genesis entries, received the best reviews for a Sonic game in 15 years [174] Meanwhile, Sonic Team developed Sonic Forces, which revives the dual gameplay of Sonic Generations along with a third gameplay style featuring the player's custom character [175] [176] Sonic Forces received mixed reviews, [177] with criticism for its short length [175] [178] [179]\n\n\nCharacters and story\nThe Sonic franchise is known for its large cast of characters; [195] Sonic the Fighters (1996) producer Yu Suzuki joked that anyone who makes a Sonic game has the duty to create new characters [196] The first game introduced Sonic, a blue hedgehog who can run at incredible speeds, and Doctor Eggman, a rotund mad scientist [4] During the Genesis era, Eggman was referred to as Doctor Ivo Robotnik in Western territories [197] [198] Sega of America's Dean Sitton made the change [199] without consulting the Japanese developers, who did not want a single character to have two different names Since Sonic Adventure, the character has been referred to as Eggman in all territories, [197] although the Robotnik name is still acknowledged [198] [200] [201]\n\n\nGameplay\nThe Sonic series is characterized by speed-based platforming gameplay [195] Controlling the player character, the player navigates a series of levels at high speeds while jumping between platforms, fighting enemies and bosses, and avoiding obstacles [195] [232] The series contains both 2D and 3D games [233] 2D entries generally feature simple, pinball-like gameplay [232] [234]—with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button [235]—and branching level paths that require memorization to maintain speed [232] [234] Meanwhile, 3D entries tend to be more linear in design, [234] feature various level objectives, [236] different movesets, [234] and allow players to upgrade and customize the playable character [236] [237] Games since Sonic Unleashed have blended 2D and 3D gameplay, with the camera shifting between side-scrolling and third-person perspectives [145] [238]\n\n\nMusic\nFor the original Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True, to compose the soundtrack [5] [274] Nakamura returned to compose Sonic 2's soundtrack [275] Dreams Come True owns the rights to Nakamura's score, which created problems when the Sonic Spinball team used his Sonic theme music without permission [24] For Sonic CD, two soundtracks were composed; the original, featured in the Japanese and European releases, was composed by Naofumi Hataya and Masafumi Ogata, while the North American score was composed by Spencer Nilsen, David Young, and Mark Crew [276] [277]\n\n\nOther media\nOutside the Sonic series, Sonic appears in other Sonic Team games as a playable character in Christmas Nights (1996), [304] a power-up in Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003), [305] and in a cameo in the 2008 Wii version of Samba de Amigo (1999) [306] Sonic characters also feature in the Sega All-Stars series, which includes Sega Superstars (2004), [307] Sega Superstars Tennis (2008), [308] and Sumo Digital's kart racing games Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (2010) and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (2012) [180] [181]\n\n\nCrossovers\nOutside the Sonic series, Sonic appears in other Sonic Team games as a playable character in Christmas Nights (1996), [304] a power-up in Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003), [305] and in a cameo in the 2008 Wii version of Samba de Amigo (1999) [306] Sonic characters also feature in the Sega All-Stars series, which includes Sega Superstars (2004), [307] Sega Superstars Tennis (2008), [308] and Sumo Digital's kart racing games Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (2010) and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (2012) [180] [181]\n\n\nAnimation\nIn 1992, Sega approached the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) about producing two television series—\"a syndicated show for the after-school audience\" and a Saturday-morning cartoon—based on Sonic Kalinske \"had seen how instrumental the launch of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon series was to the success of the toyline\" during his time at Mattel and believed that success could be recreated using Sonic [334] The two cartoons, the syndicated Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (1993) and ABC's Sonic the Hedgehog (1993–1994), were produced by DIC Entertainment DIC also produced a Sonic Christmas special in 1996, and Sonic Underground in 1999, to promote Sonic Adventure [335] [336] DIC's Sonic adaptations are generally not held in high regard [335] [337] [338]\n\n\nComics\nShogakukan published a Sonic the Hedgehog manga series in its Shogaku Yonensei magazine, beginning in 1992 Written by Kenji Terada and illustrated by Sango Norimoto, it follows a sweet but cowardly young hedgehog named Nicky whose alter ego is the cocky, heroic Sonic [366] According to character artist Kazuyuki Hoshino, the manga was part of Sega's promotional strategy to appeal to primary school children [367] The Sonic design team worked with Shogakukan to create new characters; Amy Rose and Charmy Bee originated in the manga before appearing in the games [37] [367]\n\n\nLive-action film franchise\nIn August 1994, Sega of America signed a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Trilogy Entertainment to produce a live-action animated film to tie in with Sonic X-treme In May 1995, screenwriter Richard Jefferies pitched a treatment, Sonic the Hedgehog: Wonders of the World, to Sega It saw Sonic and Eggman escape from Sonic X-treme into the real world and Sonic collaborate with a boy to stop Eggman No agreement was reached, and the film was canceled With permission from Sega, Jeffries pitched his treatment to DreamWorks Animation, but it was rejected [334]\n\n\nSonic the Hedgehog (2020)\nIn 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired the Sonic film rights [376] In June 2014, it announced plans to produce a Sonic film as a joint venture with Sega's Marza Animation Planet [377] Neal H Moritz was attached to produce under his Original Film banner, alongside Takeshi Ito, Mie Onishi, and Toru Nakahara [377] In February 2016, Sega CEO Hajime Satomi said the film was scheduled for 2018 [378] Blur Studio's Tim Miller and Jeff Fowler were hired the following October to develop the film;
