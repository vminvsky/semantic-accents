{"title": "Religion_of_the_Shang_dynasty", "content": "\nBeliefs\nShang religion expressed political notions prefiguring aspects of later Chinese bureaucratic culture [16] [17] There was an image of a supreme being leading smaller spirits, including natural gods and ancestral deities, and was demonstrably composed of all of them.\n\n\nHigh god Di\nThe highest of the Shang gods was Shangdi 上帝, or simply Di 帝 [19] [20] [b] In many oracle bone inscriptions, Di is described as a being who presided over all other spirits, including former humans and nature deities, and controlled these individuals in a hierarchy [23] [24] The Shang priests did not possess scriptures with them, and the will of Di could only be known through oracle bones [25] [26]\n\n\nNatural deities\nThe Shang established a cult for the winds, which were often mentioned Winds were associated with the phoenix and the four seasons, were thought to be controlled by four gods associated with each of the cardinal directions [43] [44] [45] [c] Together, these four winds and their associated deities represented the cosmic will of Di and carried his authority to affect agriculture Rituals were conducted to appease the wind gods, and to pray for successful harvests [49] Winds could also be harmful, and there are other spirits aside from wind gods that could control winds [50]\n\n\nAncestral powers\nThe Shang dynasty established a complex ancestral cult [d] They identified six predynastic ancestral spirits which include Shang Jia 上甲, Bao Yi 報乙, Bao Bing 報丙, Bao Ding 報丁, Shi Ren 示壬, Shi Gui 示癸, and a dynastic line starting from Shi Gui's child Da Yi and progressing to the last king Di Xin [e] [70] [71] [72] These spirits seemed to influence the reigning king, and in one inscription, a particular ancestor was even addressed as the cause of the king's nightmare [73] [74] This pantheon of ancestors is described as a \"generational hierarchy\", with power increasing with seniority [75] [76] Shang Jia and the five junior Predynastic Shang spirits were the most powerful, who influenced the weather and harvests [76] [77] If not offered proper rituals, ancestors could cast poor harvests and natural catastrophes, a feature that is described as their curse [78]\n\n\nCosmology\nThe Shang believed in the divinity of an area surrounding the orbital pole, with the shape of a square associated with four stars surrounding the pole at the time of the Shang dynasty [f] In Shang script, the square pictograph denoted the modern stem ding, possibly originating from oral expressions, and was related to Shang lineal descent [92] Inscriptions reveal that the square can be interpreted in many ways These include a ritual space, a cult recipient, or a ritual itself [93]\n\n\nOther beliefs\nThe Shang perceived that Di possessed special subordinates called the 'five adjutants' 五臣; wǔchén [112] They may be identified with the five planets, which transmitted messages to the human world about Di [113]\n\n\nPractices\nThe Shang ritual services involved a hierarchy, in which rituals performed by the king would be again conducted by the newly dead ancestors to more senior spirits, who in turn passed the king's request to Di [118] Main Shang practices include divination, liturgical sacrifices, invoking prayers, and funerals There was also an \"archery ritual\" that Shang kings often conducted on the Huan River, demonstrated by an inscribed bronze turtle rewarded to the scribe Zuoce Ban [119] Oracle bones also reveal spiritual rituals such as holocaust, ale libation, exorcism, and dance rituals [120] [121] [122]\n\n\nDivination\nDivination to the Shang was a way of indirect communication with spirits [125] The Shang divined in temples, but they could also conduct it outside of the ritual centre [126] Main materials include scapulae, turtle plastrons and some others, on which the staff applied heat after cleaning and preparing [127] [128] [h] The heat produced cracks on the bones, which were interpreted as a response and given to scribes who wrote the interpretation on the bones [132] [133] The oldest example inscriptions were radiocarbon dated to c. 1250 BC, representing the state religion of the Shang dynasty [i] [11] [135] Typically, an inscription includes a preface, the charge, and occasionally prognostication along with verification [j] [137] [138] [139] It is common for multiple pairs of the same charge to appear on a single bone, in which case the date records help establish their sequence [140] Signs of proto-divination with trigrams and hexagrams also appear on inscriptions [141]\n\n\nLiturgical sacrifices\nThe Shang religion is a typical example of a sacrificial system, in which violence was ritualised, and which was aimed at obtaining divine appeasement [155] [156] By the 11th century BC, the king had to perform sacrifices to ancestors every day, with many objects for that purpose [157] [158] The demand for such sacrificial materials spurred technological innovations for late Shang society [159]\n\n\nSacrificial terminology\nInscriptions contain a rich number of words related to sacrifice Such lexicon includes  xisheng 'animal sacrifice', rensheng 'human sacrifice', nu 'females', qi 'dependent women', and qie 'servants', all of which referred to subjects of sacrifice [185] The Shang also sacrificed xiaochen, who otherwise served as minor royal officers receiving tax revenues [186]\n\n\nCycle of sacrifice\nSacrificial schedules evolved into a liturgical calendar for the first time with the Chu-diviner group inscriptions [188] Modern research establishes the calendrical system from a series of inscriptions during the reign of the last three kings [189] The cycle was filled with five sacrificial rituals: ji, zai, xie, yong, and yi [190] [191] At the beginning of each sacrificial round, a ceremony honouring all recipients called gongdian was held, and in every weekend, priests would make an inscription announcing the sacrifices for the next day [192] [190] Some academics argue that ji was the opening ritual [190]\n\n\nShamanism\nMany oracle bone inscriptions suggest that the Shang often engaged in communicating with the spiritual world through the 'hosting' (賓; bīn) ritual [198] [199] This type of communication may be considered non-shamanic, as the ritual never involved ecstatic communion or commingling within the king's body [200] [201] However, interpreters of Shang ritual bronzes such as Kwang-chih Chang assert that this perception is not satisfactory, and that the Shang dynasty's religion must have embraced shamanism [202] According to Chang et al., the Shang king acted as a shaman himself to connect with the spirits [203] [204]\n\n\nFunerary practices\nDuring the Shang dynasty, the largest burial area for the elites was the Royal Cemetery, located in what is now Xibeigang, Anyang The cemetery was split into two zones, apparently for Wu Ding's own political purposes [214] There are nine tombs for kings, with seven in the cemetery's western zone [215] [216] Fu Hao's tomb was not in the cemetery but located 150 meters from the western palace complex [217] Due to tomb looting, little remained in these tombs, so there is uncertainty with identifying the tombs with late Shang kings [215] However, the cemetery structure probably was designed to align with the celestial northern pole [218]\n\n\nPosthumous naming\nAside from the supernatural beings, the ancestors of the Shang kings were also revered Those included both dynastic and pre-dynastic ancestral individuals, who were given posthumous names, based on a structured system of typically using calendrical names for days [231] [232] There were 10 weekdays whose names were used for ancestors: jia 甲, yi 乙, bing 丙, ding 丁, wu 戊, ji 己, geng 庚, xin 辛, ren 壬, and gui 癸 [233] [234] One sole special case concerns Wang Hai, a shadowy proto-ancestor whose name incorporates the 12th Earthly Branch instead of one among the ten Stems [235] It seems that the process of assigning day-names to the dead involved divination, which would allow deterministic elements and human manipulation [236] There is no comprehensive explanation as to why the calendar was used for naming ancestors [237]\n\n\nTemples and altars\nThe ritual center of the Shang lay on a hill separated by the Huan River, and was refurbished throughout the course of the late Shang state [248] The condition of the excavated site does not allow a definitive layout to be made [249] Nevertheless, modern studies agree on some points, that the central area of the center was the major locus of ritual sacrifices, called Yǐ, while the southern one houses small ritual buildings [250] Inscriptions refer to ritual buildings (宗;

The Shang religion was a polytheistic system that worshipped a variety of gods and spirits, including a supreme being, natural deities, and ancestral powers.\n\n## Beliefs\n\nShang religion expressed political notions prefiguring aspects of later Chinese bureaucratic culture. At the heart of the Shang pantheon was an image of a supreme being leading smaller spirits, including natural gods and ancestral deities. This supreme being, known as Di, was described as a being who presided over all other spirits, including former humans and nature deities, and controlled these individuals in a hierarchy.\n\n## High God Di\n\nThe highest of the Shang gods was Shangdi, or simply Di. In many oracle bone inscriptions, Di is described as a being who possessed special subordinates called the 'five adjutants', which may be identified with the five planets, which transmitted messages to the human world about Di. Di was believed to possess special powers and was often invoked in rituals and sacrifices.\n\n## Natural Deities\n\nThe Shang established a cult for the winds, which were often mentioned in oracle bone inscriptions. Winds were associated with the phoenix and the four seasons, and were thought to be controlled by four gods associated with each of the cardinal directions. Together, these four winds and their associated deities represented the cosmic will of Di and carried his authority to affect agriculture. Rituals were conducted to appease the wind gods, and to pray for successful harvests.\n\n## Ancestral Powers\n\nThe Shang dynasty established a complex ancestral cult, which identified six predynastic ancestral spirits. These spirits seemed to influence the reigning king, and in one inscription, a particular ancestor was even addressed as the cause of the king's nightmare. The pantheon of ancestors is described as a \"generational hierarchy\", with power increasing with seniority. Shang Jia and the five junior Predynastic Shang spirits were the most powerful, who influenced the weather and harvests.\n\n## Cosmology\n\nThe Shang believed in the divinity of an area surrounding the orbital pole, with the shape of a square associated with four stars surrounding the pole at the time of the Shang dynasty. The square pictograph denoted the modern stem ding, possibly originating from oral expressions, and was related to Shang lineal descent. Inscriptions reveal that the square can be interpreted in many ways, including a ritual space, a cult recipient, or a ritual itself.\n\n## Other Beliefs\n\nThe Shang perceived that Di possessed special subordinates called the 'five adjutants'. They may be identified with the five planets, which transmitted messages to the human world about Di. The Shang also believed in the existence of a mysterious cult recipient named Kui, who was worshipped as a personage in classical Chinese texts.\n\n## Practices\n\nThe Shang ritual services involved a hierarchy, in which rituals performed by the king would be again conducted by the newly dead ancestors to more senior spirits, who in turn passed the king's request to Di. Main Shang practices include divination, liturgical sacrifices, invoking prayers, and funerals. There was also an \"archery ritual\" that Shang kings often conducted on the Huan River, demonstrated by an inscribed bronze turtle rewarded to the scribe Zuoce Ban.\n\n## Divination\n\nDivination to the Shang was a way of indirect communication with spirits. The Shang divined in temples, but they could also conduct it outside of the ritual centre. Main materials include scapulae, turtle plastrons, and some others, on which the staff applied heat after cleaning and preparing. The heat produced cracks on the bones, which were interpreted as a response and given to scribes who wrote the interpretation on the bones.\n\n## Liturgical Sacrifices\n\nThe Shang religion is a typical example of a sacrificial system, in which violence was ritualised, and which was aimed at obtaining divine appeasement. By the 11th century BCE, the king had to perform sacrifices to ancestors every day, with many objects for that purpose. The demand for such sacrificial materials spurred technological innovations for late Shang society.\n\n## Sacrificial Terminology\n\nInscriptions contain a rich number of words related to sacrifice. Such lexicon includes xisheng 'animal sacrifice', rensheng 'human sacrifice', nu 'females', qi 'dependent women', and qie 'servants', all of which referred to subjects of sacrifice. The Shang also sacrificed xiaochen, who otherwise served as minor royal officers receiving tax revenues.\n\n## Cycle of Sacrifice\n\nSacrificial schedules evolved into a liturgical calendar for the first time with the Chu-diviner group inscriptions. Modern research establishes the calendrical system from a series of inscriptions during the reign of the last three kings. The cycle was filled with five sacrificial rituals: ji, zai, xie, yong, and yi. At the beginning of each sacrificial round, a ceremony honouring all recipients called gongdian was held, and in every weekend, priests would make an inscription announcing the sacrifices for the next day.\n\n## Shamanism\n\nMany oracle bone inscriptions suggest that the Shang often engaged in communicating with the spiritual world through the 'hosting' (賓; bīn) ritual. This type of communication may be considered non-shamanic, as the ritual never involved ecstatic communion or commingling within the king's body. However, interpreters of Shang ritual bronzes such as Kwang-chih Chang assert that this perception is not satisfactory, and that the Shang dynasty's religion must have embraced shamanism.\n\n## Funerary Practices\n\nDuring the Shang dynasty, the largest burial area for the elites was the Royal Cemetery, located in what is now Xibeigang, Anyang. The cemetery was split into two zones, apparently for Wu Ding's own political purposes. There are nine tombs for kings, with seven in the cemetery's western zone. Fu Hao's tomb was not in the cemetery but located 150 meters from the western palace complex.\n\n## Posthumous Naming\n\nAside from the supernatural beings, the ancestors of the Shang kings were also revered. Those included both dynastic and pre-dynastic ancestral individuals, who were given posthumous names, based on a structured system of typically using calendrical names for days. There were 10 weekdays whose names were used for ancestors: jia 甲, yi 乙, bing 丙, ding 丁, wu 戊, ji 己, geng 庚, xin 辛, ren 壬, and gui 癸.\n\n## Temples and Altars\n\nThe ritual center of the Shang lay on a hill separated by the Huan River, and was refurbished throughout the course of the late Shang state. The condition of the excavated site does not allow a definitive layout to be made. Nevertheless, modern studies agree on some points, that the central area of the center was the major locus of ritual sacrifices, called Yǐ, while the southern one houses small ritual buildings.\n\n## Royal Practitioners\n\nThe Shang notion of practitioners centred around the king, who acted as the highest intermediary between the human and spiritual realms. In other words, he was considered a 'thearch'. He was assisted by religious groups, divided into specialised teams, despite not being bureaucratic as conventionally described.\n\n## Regional Traditions\n\nThe Shang state was composed of the capital region, and extended areas administered by royal family members, though the latter varied over time and are difficult to delineate. Regions outside of the Shang territory were also culturally influenced. Evidence, though not as plentiful as that in the capital city, suggests the presence of Shang religion in those lands.\n\n## Political Influence\n\nThe Shang state relied on allies who lacked a stable relationship with the royal clan. As a result, the king is thought to have incorporated the allies' deities into the Shang religion to gain their support and influence them. One such deity was probably Kui, a mysterious cult recipient who later featured as a personage in classical Chinese texts.\n\n## History\n\nBefore the dawn of organised states in China, the area was inhabited by various tribal confederations, which in many cases shared a common belief in the spiritual world, usually integrating elements similar to those of shamanism. Academics such as K C Chang propose the existence of shamanic practices in these Neolithic cultures' tradition, but their theory is not supported by any clear evidence.\n\n## Neolithic Precursors\n\nBefore the dawn of organised states in China, the area was inhabited by various tribal confederations, which in many cases shared a common belief in the spiritual world, usually integrating elements similar to those of shamanism. Academics such as K C Chang propose the existence of shamanic practices in these Neolithic cultures' tradition, but their theory is not supported by any clear evidence.\n\n## Early and Late Shang\n\nShang practices were not apparently confined to the capital city. Despite limited evidence, as in the case of the inscribed bone in Daxinzhuang that have multiple divination texts. However, little evidence indicates pre-late Shang religious writing. Oracle bones before the Late Shang period are not of the same ordered style as Late Shang materials.\n\n## Zhou Dynasty Continuation\n\nIn 1046 BCE, the Shang dynasty under the regime of Di Xin collapsed and was replaced by the victorious Zhou dynasty, which used the practices of Shang religion to explain his fall at the Battle of Muye. Western Zhou literature denounces the last kings not only for licentiousness and drunkenness but also for their purported ignorance of ancestor worship.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Shang high god Di remained to the present day through his heavenly component Shangdi, who is still worshipped in countries of the Sinosphere. The word Shangdi is sometimes used to denote the Christian God, and the Jade Emperor.\n\n## Relation to Traditional Accounts\n\nOne of the Zhou's classical texts, the Book of Documents, contains moral discourse on Shang tradition, such as the belief in the Shang ancestor Tang to send down calamities on unworthy men. Additionally, this text highlights Shang pyromantic divination by referring to Pan Geng emphasising on those who did not 'presumptuously oppose the decision of the tortoise'.\n\n## Zhou Dynasty\n\nOne of the Zhou's classical texts, the Book of Documents, contains moral discourse on Shang tradition, such as the belief in the Shang ancestor Tang to send down calamities on unworthy men. Additionally, this text highlights Shang pyromantic divination by referring to Pan Geng emphasising on those who did not 'presumptuously oppose the decision of the tortoise'.\n\n## Han Dynasty\n\nHan dynasty historian Sima Qian, writing 1,000 years after the Shang's fall, delved into its religion. Sima claimed that the Shang people were marked by their utmost devotion to divination and sacrifices, and had decayed from the mark of piety into a state of superstition, which Burton Watson considered substantiated claims that resonate with evidence collected from modern archaeology.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Religion_of_the_Shang_dynasty\" following this outline:\n\n\nBeliefs\nShang religion expressed political notions prefiguring aspects of later Chinese bureaucratic culture [16] [17] There was an image of a supreme being leading smaller spirits, including natural gods and ancestral deities, and was demonstrably composed of all of them.\n\n\nHigh god Di\nThe highest of the Shang gods was Shangdi 上帝, or simply Di 帝 [19] [20] [b] In many oracle bone inscriptions, Di is described as a being who presided over all other spirits, including former humans and nature deities, and controlled these individuals in a hierarchy [23] [24] The Shang priests did not possess scriptures with them, and the will of Di could only be known through oracle bones [25] [26]\n\n\nNatural deities\nThe Shang established a cult for the winds, which were often mentioned Winds were associated with the phoenix and the four seasons, were thought to be controlled by four gods associated with each of the cardinal directions [43] [44] [45] [c] Together, these four winds and their associated deities represented the cosmic will of Di and carried his authority to affect agriculture Rituals were conducted to appease the wind gods, and to pray for successful harvests [49] Winds could also be harmful, and there are other spirits aside from wind gods that could control winds [50]\n\n\nAncestral powers\nThe Shang dynasty established a complex ancestral cult [d] They identified six predynastic ancestral spirits which include Shang Jia 上甲, Bao Yi 報乙, Bao Bing 報丙, Bao Ding 報丁, Shi Ren 示壬, Shi Gui 示癸, and a dynastic line starting from Shi Gui's child Da Yi and progressing to the last king Di Xin [e] [70] [71] [72] These spirits seemed to influence the reigning king, and in one inscription, a particular ancestor was even addressed as the cause of the king's nightmare [73] [74] This pantheon of ancestors is described as a \"generational hierarchy\", with power increasing with seniority [75] [76] Shang Jia and the five junior Predynastic Shang spirits were the most powerful, who influenced the weather and harvests [76] [77] If not offered proper rituals, ancestors could cast poor harvests and natural catastrophes, a feature that is described as their curse [78]\n\n\nCosmology\nThe Shang believed in the divinity of an area surrounding the orbital pole, with the shape of a square associated with four stars surrounding the pole at the time of the Shang dynasty [f] In Shang script, the square pictograph denoted the modern stem ding, possibly originating from oral expressions, and was related to Shang lineal descent [92] Inscriptions reveal that the square can be interpreted in many ways These include a ritual space, a cult recipient, or a ritual itself [93]\n\n\nOther beliefs\nThe Shang perceived that Di possessed special subordinates called the 'five adjutants' 五臣;

Warfare 2 was originally announced as Call of Duty 6 [23] The game was first announced under the title Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 by Activision on December 3, 2008 [24] Activision subsequently retracted its announcement, stating that any information about an upcoming Call of Duty game was \"speculative.\" [25] Infinity Ward then asserted that it had not officially confirmed its latest project at that time [26] On February 11, 2009, Activision officially announced Modern Warfare 2 and set a tentative release date for \"Holiday 2009.\" [27] The game was tested in an internal beta by the development team While both Call of Duty 4 and Call of Duty: World at War had been preceded by public multiplayer betas, no such beta was released for Modern Warfare 2 because it was determined that, according to Community Manager Robert Bowling, no public beta was needed unless the internal beta did not provide adequate feedback [28]  While Treyarch was able to port Modern Warfare to the Wii and release it on the same day Modern Warfare 2 was released, Infinity Ward declined to make a Wii version of the sequel  According to Bowling, Infinity Ward determined that the Wii's technical limitations made it impossible to deliver the same cinematic experience that the sequel aspired to present [29]\n\n\nGame engine\nThe game utilizes the in-house IW 4.0 game engine, which is claimed to be a generation beyond the capabilities of the engine used in Call of Duty 4 [35] Although proprietary, the game is based on an unspecified id Tech engine, and can accommodate larger worlds, enhanced graphic detail, and more efficient rendering [36] Infinity Ward has addressed the issue of enemies that continually respawn at different points of a level [37] The developer demonstrated that the game engine uses a \"dynamic AI\", which has replaced the infinite respawn system and allows enemies to act more independently These \"smarter\" enemies are designed to actively seek out and drive the player forward through a level, and can break away from set behaviors such as following a designated route in order to attack The player cannot depend on enemies to be found in the same locations as a previous play-through because enemies will behave differently each time a level is played [38]\n\n\nAudio\nOn August 20, 2009, Robert Bowling revealed through Twitter that Kevin McKidd, Craig

The series follows the story of Gus, a young boy with deer-like features, as he navigates a post-apocalyptic world filled with danger and uncertainty. With its unique blend of horror, drama, and fantasy elements, Sweet Tooth has captivated readers worldwide and spawned a television series adaptation.\n\n**Plot Summary**\n\nGus, a young boy with deer-like features, lives a quiet life deep in the woods with his father. His father, a devout religious man, teaches Gus many valuable lessons, from medical care to prophetic interpretation. However, as Gus grows older, he begins to yearn for a life beyond the woods, where he learns that there is no fire past the trees, only more land. This realization sets him on a journey to explore the world outside and discover the truth about his father's past and the mysterious outbreak that has devastated the world.\n\nThroughout the series, Gus encounters various characters, including Tommy Jeppard, a former soldier who becomes his ally, and the enigmatic Dr. Singh, who holds secrets about the outbreak and the fate of humanity. As Gus navigates this treacherous world, he must confront the harsh realities of survival and the blurred lines between good and evil.\n\n**Influence**\n\nAlthough the story is initially set in Nebraska, the landscape is inspired by Lemire's past home of Essex County, Ontario. This unique blend of rural and industrial settings adds to the series' sense of unease and foreboding. The series' use of nature imagery, particularly the woods and the deer-like features of the characters, also reflects Lemire's fascination with the natural world and its connection to the human experience.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nTwelve issues were slated for Sweet Tooth's first year, as part of Lemire's initial contract with Vertigo. However, the nature of monthly comics is dependent on sales, and Lemire initially did not know how many issues the series would run. Editor Brandon Montclare noted that \"Sweet Tooth is taken down and rebuilt every issue—sometimes every page\" and that the main plot points were planned out with loosely 40 issues in mind. In an interview, Lemire stated that he had it planned out to be 20 to 30 issues, but it could go further depending on the response it gets.\n\n**Characters**\n\nGus: The protagonist of the series, a young boy with deer-like features who navigates a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nTommy Jeppard: A former soldier who becomes Gus's ally and helps him on his journey.\n\nDr. Singh: A mysterious character who holds secrets about the outbreak and the fate of humanity.\n\n**Other Sweet Tooth Stories**\n\nThe Sweet Tooth series has spawned several spin-off stories, including:\n\n* Sweet Tooth: The Children's Crusade: A one-shot issue that explores the origins of the outbreak and the early days of the post-apocalyptic world.\n* Sweet Tooth: The Growing Season: A four-issue mini-series that follows Gus and his friends as they navigate the challenges of growing up in a post-apocalyptic world.\n\n**Issues**\n\nThe Sweet Tooth series has been published under the following issues:\n\n* Sweet Tooth #1-40 (2010-2013)\n* Sweet Tooth: The Children's Crusade #1 (2013)\n* Sweet Tooth: The Growing Season #1-4 (2014)\n\n**Television Series Adaptation**\n\nOn November 16, 2018, it was announced that streaming service Hulu had given a pilot order to a potential television series adaptation of the comic book series. The pilot is expected to be written and directed by Jim Mickle, who is also set to executive produce alongside Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, Amanda Burrell, and Linda Moran. Production companies involved with the pilot include Team Downey and Warner Bros Television.\n\nOn April 9, 2020, it was announced that the series has been moved from Hulu to Netflix. On May 12, 2020, Netflix had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of eight episodes, starring Nonso Anozie as Tommy Jeppard, Christian Convery as Sweet Tooth/Gus, and narrated by James Brolin. Sweet Tooth premiered on June 4, 2021.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Sweet Tooth series has received widespread critical acclaim for its unique blend of horror, drama, and fantasy elements. The series has been praised for its atmospheric and unsettling artwork, as well as its thought-provoking themes and characters. The television series adaptation has also received positive reviews, with praise for its faithfulness to the source material and its engaging performances.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sweet_Tooth_(Vertigo)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot summary\nGus, a young boy with deer-like features, lives a quiet life deep in the woods with his father He learns many things, from medical care to religious prophecy Though he loves his religious father, he yearns to escape as he learns there is no fire past the trees but simply more land.\n\n\nInfluence\nAlthough the story is initially set in Nebraska, the landscape is inspired by Lemire's past home of Essex County, Ontario [2]\n\n\nPublication history\nTwelve issues were slated for Sweet Tooth's first year (as part of Lemire's initial contract) [2] Because the nature of monthly comics is dependent on sales, initially not even Jeff Lemire knew how many issues Sweet Tooth would run Editor Brandon Montclare confirmed, \"Sweet Tooth is taken down and rebuilt every issue—sometimes every page And as far down the road as I can see, who knows where Gus’ journey ends Not even Jeff knows yet, although it's in his head somewhere.\" [4] The main plot points were planned out with loosely 40 issues for DC/Vertigo, [2] and in an interview for USA Today, Jeff Lemire was quoted: \"right now, I have it planned out to be 20 to 30 issues, but it could go even further depending on the response it gets.\" [5]\n\n\nCharacters\nOther Sweet Tooth stories:\n\n\nIssues\nOther Sweet Tooth stories:\n\n\nTelevision series adaptation\nOn November 16, 2018, it was announced that streaming service Hulu had given a pilot order to a potential television series adaptation of the comic book series The pilot is expected to be written and directed by Jim Mickle who is also set to executive produce alongside Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, Amanda Burrell, and Linda Moran Production companies involved with the pilot are slated to consist of Team Downey and Warner Bros Television [9] On April 9, 2020, it was announced that the series has been moved from Hulu to Netflix [10] On May 12, 2020, Netflix had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of eight episodes and starring Nonso Anozie as Tommy Jeppard, Christian Convery as Sweet Tooth/Gus, and narrated by James Brolin [11] Sweet Tooth premiered on June 4, 2021 [12]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

\"not be perceived as a stopgap president.\" Giorgia Meloni of the opposition Brothers of Italy posted a video of the sustained applause among deputies upon Mattarella's re-election with the message:

For The New York Times, Jason Horowitz wrote that Sergio Mattarella's re-election \"increased the likelihood that Mr Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, would continue to lead the unity government until scheduled elections in February 2023.\"\n\n**Reactions**\nMembers of Italy's governing majority expressed contentment about the results and gratitude to Mattarella. Enrico Letta, leader of the Democratic Party, saw the result as a \"victory for everyone\" and posted a picture of the pencil he used to vote for Mattarella in the eighth ballot, saying that he would keep it as \"a beautiful souvenir.\" Silvio Berlusconi, who was thought to be a possible presidential candidate for the centre-right coalition but withdrew his bid for the presidency a week earlier, praised Mattarella \"from whom we know we are asking for a great sacrifice, but we also know that we can ask him in the higher interests of the country.\" The League's leader Salvini thanked Mattarella, saying that he should \"not be perceived as a stopgap president.\" Giorgia Meloni of the opposition Brothers of Italy posted a video of the sustained applause among deputies upon Mattarella's re-election with the message: \"MPs euphoric for not having changed anything and forcing Mattarella to another term What are they celebrating?

{"title": "India", "content": "\nEtymology\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east In turn the name \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία), ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \"river\", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin [72] [73] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\" [74]\n\n\nHistory\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved [22] [23] [24] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago [22] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan [83] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, [84] [83] the first urban culture in South Asia, [85] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India [86] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade [85]\n\n\nAncient

civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade [85]\n\n\nMedieval India\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity [110] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan [111] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal [111] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south [111] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region [110] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes [112] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences [112]\n\n\nEarly modern India\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers, [123] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors [124] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices [125] [126] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, [127] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule [128] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status [127] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture [129] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, [130] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets [128] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, [128] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture [131] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience [132] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India [132] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs [133]\n\n\nModern India\nHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885 The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe [141] [142] [143] [144] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857 Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule [145] [146] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest [147] [148] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885 [149] [150] [151] [152]\n\n\nGeography\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate [172] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east [172] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate [172] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas [172] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment [173] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain [174] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis [175] [176] [177]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them [197] India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species [198] [199] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic [200] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots, [69] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism [o] [201]\n\n\nPolitics and government\nA parliamentary republic with a multi-party system, [226] India has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50 regional parties [227] The Congress is considered center in Indian political culture, [228] and the BJP right-wing [229] [230] [231] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP, [232] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the center  [233]\n\n\nPolitics\nA parliamentary republic with a multi-party system, [226] India has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party

under the Constitution of India—the country's supreme legal document It is a constitutional republic.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories [12] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis [266] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels [267]\n\n\nStates\nIn the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement [269] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962 and was widely thought to have been humiliated [270] This was followed by another military conflict in 1967 in which India successfully repelled Chinese attack [271] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999 Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh [272] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'état attempt in the Maldives After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier [273]\n\n\nUnion territories\nIn the 1950s, India strongly supported

decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement [269] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962 and was

ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier [273]\n\n\nEconomy\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2024 was nominally worth $3.94 trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, at around $15.0 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP) [16] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012, [304] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies [305] However, due to its low GDP per capita—which ranks 136th in the world in nominal per capita income and 125th in per capita income adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)—the vast majority of Indians fall into the low-income group [306] [307] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; [308] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system [309] [310] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows [311] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995 [312]\n\n\nIndustries\nIndia's telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2 billion subscribers It contributes 6.5% to India's GDP [330] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world after China [331]\n\n\nEnergy\nIndia's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable [341] The country's usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly [342] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average [343] [344] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India [345]\n\n\nSocio-economic challenges\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day [347] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005 [348] Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011 [q] [350] 30.7% of India's children under the age of five are underweight [351] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished [352] [353] The Midday Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates [354]\n\n\nDemographics, languages and religion\nWith an estimated 1,428,627,663 residents in 2023, India is the world's most populous country [13] 1,210,193,422 residents were reported in the 2011 provisional census report [360] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011, [361] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001) [361] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males [360] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020 [update] [293] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361 million people [362] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India's population to grow rapidly [363]\n\n\nCulture\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years [376] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established [74] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions [377] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads, [378] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement, [377] and by Buddhist philosophy [379]\n\n\nVisual art\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art [380] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known [381] [382] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving [382] [383] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement [384] [385] [386] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art [387] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force) [388] [389] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati [390] [391]\n\n\nArchitecture\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles [412] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan, [413] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings; [414] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs [415] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\" [416] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\" [417] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture [418]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the Sanskrit language [419] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE – c. 1200 BCE), the epics: Mahābhārata (c. 400 BCE – c. 400 CE) and the Ramayana (c. 300 BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa (c. 5th century CE) and Mahākāvya poetry [420] [421] [422] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c. 600 BCE – c. 300 BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work [423] [424] [425] [426] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions [427] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore, [428] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\nPerforming arts and media\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools [429] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms Among the better-known folk dances are: bhangra of Punjab, bihu of Assam, Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and lavani of Maharashtra Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam [430]\n\n\nSociety\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\" [441] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\n\n\nEducation\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29% In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9% In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2% In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%, [454] [455] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth [456]\n\n\nClothing\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped [462] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long [462] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder [462] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body's contours [462] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment [463]\n\n\nCuisine\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes [471] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry; [472] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal [473] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions [471] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking [474]\n\n\nSports and recreation\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports—such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani, gilli-danda, hopscotch and martial arts such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi—remain popular Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga; [484] in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters [485] Viswanathan Anand became the Chess World Champion in 2007 and held the status until 2013 He also won the Chess World Cup in 2000 and 2002 In 2023, R Praggnanandhaa finished as runner-up in the tournament [486] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great [487]\n\n\nSee

officially known as the Republic of India, is a country located in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country in the world by area and the second-most populous country, with over 1.3 billion people. India is a federal union of 28 states and 8 union territories, with a parliamentary system of government. The country has a rich cultural heritage, diverse geography, and a complex history, making it one of the most fascinating countries in the world.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin \"India\", which referred to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. The name \"India\" is successively derived from Hellenistic Greek \"India\" (Ἰνδία), ancient Greek \"Indos\" (Ἰνδός), Old Persian \"Hindush\" (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit \"Sindhu\", or \"river\", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.\n\n**History**\n\nThe earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan. These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, the first urban culture in South Asia, which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India. Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.\n\n**Ancient India**\n\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved. The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan. These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, the first urban culture in South Asia, which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.\n\n**Medieval India**\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.\n\n**Early Modern India**\n\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.\n\n**Modern India**\n\nHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.\n\n**Geography**\n\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate. India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east. Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them. India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.\n\n**Politics and Government**\n\nIndia is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system. The Congress is considered centre in Indian political culture, and the BJP right-wing. For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament. However, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP, as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the center.\n\n**Economy**\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2024 was nominally worth $3.94 trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, at around $15.0 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012, India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.\n\n**Socio-Economic Challenges**\n\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day. The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005. Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.\n\n**Demographics, Languages and Religion**\n\nWith an estimated 1,428,627,663 residents in 2023, India is the world's most populous country. The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males. The median age was 28.7 as of 2020.\n\n**Culture**\n\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. During the Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology, and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dharma, karma, yoga, and moksha, were established. India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.\n\n**Visual Art**\n\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East, and Southeast Asia.

Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavors.\n\n**Literature**\n\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the Sanskrit language. Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE – c. 1200 BCE), the epics: Mahabharata (c. 400 BCE – c. 400 CE) and the Ramayana (c. 300 BCE and later); Abhijnanasakuntalam (The Recognition of Sakuntala, and other dramas of Kalidasa (c. 5th century CE) and Mahakavya poetry.\n\n**Performing Arts and Media**\n\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools. Regionalized popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter.\n\n**Clothing**\n\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.

diversity [110] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan [111] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal [111] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south [111] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region [110] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes [112] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences [112]\n\n\nEarly modern India\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers, [123] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors [124] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices [125] [126] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, [127] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule [128] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status [127] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture [129] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, [130] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets [128] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, [128] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture [131] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience [132] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India [132] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs [133]\n\n\nModern India\nHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885 The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe [141] [142] [143] [144] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857 Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule [145] [146] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest [147] [148] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885 [149] [150] [151] [152]\n\n\nGeography\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate [172] India's

south-west, and later, south and south-east [172] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate [172] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas [172] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment [173] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain [174] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis [175] [176] [177]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species

were reorganised on a linguistic basis [266] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels [267]\n\n\nStates\nIn the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement [269] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962 and was widely thought to have been humiliated [270] This was followed by another military conflict in 1967 in which India successfully repelled Chinese attack [271] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999 Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh [272] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'état attempt in the Maldives After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier [273]\n\n\nUnion territories\nIn the 1950s, India strongly supported

ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier [273]\n\n\nForeign, economic and strategic relations\nIn the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement [269] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962 and was widely thought to have been humiliated [270] This was followed by another military conflict in 1967 in which India successfully repelled Chinese attack [271] India has had tense relations with

ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier [273]\n\n\nEconomy\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2024 was nominally worth $3.94 trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, at around $15.0 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP) [16] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012, [304] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies [305] However, due to its low GDP per capita—which ranks 136th in the world in nominal per capita income and 125th in per capita income adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)—the vast majority of Indians fall into the low-income group [306] [307] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; [308] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system [309] [310] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows [311] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995 [312]\n\n\nIndustries\nIndia's telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2 billion subscribers It contributes 6.5% to India's GDP [330] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world after China [331]\n\n\nEnergy\nIndia's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable [341] The country's usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly [342] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average [343] [344] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India [345]\n\n\nSocio-economic challenges\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day [347] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005 [348] Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011 [q] [350] 30.7% of India's children under the age of five are underweight [351] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished [352] [353] The Midday Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates [354]\n\n\nDemographics, languages and religion\nWith an estimated 1,428,627,663 residents in 2023, India is the world's most populous country [13] 1,210,193,422 residents were reported in the 2011 provisional census report [360] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011, [361] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001) [361] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males [360] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020 [update] [293] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361 million people [362] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India's population to grow rapidly [363]\n\n\nCulture\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years [376] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established [74] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions [377] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads, [378] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement, [377] and by Buddhist philosophy [379]\n\n\nVisual art\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art [380] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known [381] [382] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving [382] [383] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement [384] [385] [386] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art [387] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force) [388] [389] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati [390] [391]\n\n\nArchitecture\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles [412] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan, [413] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings; [414] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs [415] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\" [416] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\" [417] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture [418]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the Sanskrit language [419] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE – c. 1200 BCE), the epics: Mahābhārata (c. 400 BCE – c. 400 CE) and the Ramayana (c. 300 BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa (c. 5th century CE) and Mahākāvya poetry [420] [421] [422] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c. 600 BCE – c. 300 BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work [423] [424] [425] [426] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions [427] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore, [428] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\nPerforming arts and media\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools [429] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms Among the better-known folk dances are: bhangra of Punjab, bihu of Assam, Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and lavani of Maharashtra Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam [430]\n\n\nSociety\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\" [441] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\n\n\nEducation\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29% In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9% In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2% In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%, [454] [455] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth [456]\n\n\nClothing\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped [462] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long [462] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder [462] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body's contours [462] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment [463]\n\n\nCuisine\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes [471] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry; [472] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal [473] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions [471] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking [474]\n\n\nSports and recreation\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports—such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani, gilli-danda, hopscotch and martial arts such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi—remain popular Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga; [484] in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters [485] Viswanathan Anand became the Chess World Champion in 2007 and held the status until 2013 He also won the Chess World Cup in 2000 and 2002 In 2023, R Praggnanandhaa finished as runner-up in the tournament [486] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great [487]\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Minsk_agreements", "content": "\nHistory\nIn February 2014, Russian military covertly attacked and occupied Ukrainian Crimea Protests and unrest started in the East of Ukraine (Donbas), which researchers characterize as \"unclear to what extent the protests in the east were initiated by local dissatisfaction with the situation in Kyiv, and to what extent they were organized and supported from Russia\" [12] In spring, \"DPR\" and \"LPR\" - two unrecognized statelets - were created in Ukrainian Donbas by Russian actors There, the Kremlin government used some of its techniques it used before during the creation of separatist enclaves in Moldova and Georgia Russia then processed to establish the narrative and negotiation position in order to trap the victims of Russian aggression and involve Western states in the logic of “frozen conflict” (Umland & Essen) [2]\n\n\nMinsk Protocol\nBy the end of August 2014, after defeating Ukraine at Ilovaisk, [2] Russia saved its Donbas proxies from the defeat and showed that it will not allow Ukrainian military to take back occupied lands The next for Russia was \"to stabilize its gains\" Ukraine wanted to prevent the military defeat from growing Western governments were fearing of more escalations [13]\n\n\nText of the protocol\nThe text of the protocol consists of twelve points: [15]\n\n\nSignatories\nThe document was signed by: [40]\n\n\nFollow-up memorandum\nIn the two weeks after the Minsk Protocol was signed, there were frequent violations of the ceasefire by both parties to the conflict [17] [18] Talks continued in Minsk, and a follow-up to the Minsk Protocol was agreed to on 19 September 2014 This memorandum clarified the implementation of the Protocol Amongst some of the peacemaking measures agreed to were: [17] [19] [20]\n\n\nEfficacy\nThough the fighting generally subsided after the ceasefire came into effect at 0:00 EET on 15 February, skirmishes and shelling continued in several parts of the conflict zone [52] Shelling and fighting at Debaltseve continued, as DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that the ceasefire did not apply to that area [53] In the south of Donetsk Oblast, fighting between DPR forces and members of the Azov Battalion continued in villages near Mariupol [53] [54] By 16 February, Minsk II seemed on the verge of collapse [55] [56] Separatists continued a heavy assault on Debaltseve Both sides said that they would not withdraw heavy weaponry as specified by the agreement whilst fighting in Debaltseve was ongoing [57] Reuters described the ceasefire as \"stillborn\" in Debaltseve [58] Ukrainian forces were forced to retreat from Debaltseve on 18 February, leaving separatist forces in control of the city [59]\n\n\nCollapse\nThe Protocol and Memorandum did not stop the war in the east of Ukraine [2] By January 2015, the Minsk Protocol ceasefire had completely collapsed [25] Following the Russian victory at Donetsk International Airport in defiance of the Protocol, DPR spokesman Eduard Basurin said that \"the Minsk Memorandum will not be considered in the form it was adopted\" [26] Later in the day, DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that the DPR \"will not make any attempts at ceasefire talks any more\", and that his forces were going to \"attack right up to the borders of Donetsk region\" [27] The New York Times said that the ceasefire had \"all but vanished\" [28] In January - February, Russia repeated its pattern of August 2014, invaded with fresh forces and attacked and defeated Ukrainian forces at Debaltseve, forcing Ukraine to sign a Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements, or Minsk II [2]\n\n\nMinsk II, February 2015\nSuccessive attempts to resolve the ongoing war in the Donbas region of Ukraine had seen no result by the start of February 2015 [30] While the Minsk Protocol of 5 September 2014 did significantly reduce fighting in the conflict zone for many months, minor skirmishes continued At the start of January 2015, Russia sent another large batch of its regular military, [2] which together [citation needed] with separatist forces of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) began a new offensive on Ukrainian-controlled areas, resulting in the complete collapse of the Minsk Protocol ceasefire [25]\n\n\nText of the agreement\nThe full text of the agreement is as follows: [40] [41]\n\n\nSignatories\nThe document was signed by: [40]\n\n\nReactions\nThe new package, commonly referred to as \"Minsk II\", was criticised for being \"highly complicated\" and \"extremely fragile\", and for being very similar to the failed Minsk Protocol [6] [42] [43] The New York Times reported that the plan had \"included some tripwires\", such as not demarcating control over the city of Debaltseve, which was the site of the most fierce fighting at the time of the plan's drafting [6] [44] Following the Minsk talks, Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, and President Poroshenko attended a European Union (EU) summit in Brussels [45]\n\n\nEfficacy\nThough the fighting generally subsided after the ceasefire came into effect at 0:00 EET on 15 February, skirmishes and shelling continued in several parts of the conflict zone [52] Shelling and fighting at Debaltseve continued, as DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that the ceasefire did not apply to that area [53] In the south of Donetsk Oblast, fighting between DPR forces and members of the Azov Battalion continued in villages near Mariupol [53] [54] By 16 February,

forces in control of the city [59]\n\n\nElections in the DPR and LPR\nWhile the 2015 Ukrainian local elections had been scheduled for 25 October, DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko issued a decree on 2 July that ordered local DPR elections to be held on 18 October [79] He said that this action was \"in accordance with the Minsk agreements\" [80] According to Zakharchenko, this move meant that the DPR had \"independently started to implement the Minsk agreements\" [80] Zakharchenko said that the elections would \"take place 'on the basis of Ukraine's law on temporary self-rule status of individual districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions', in so far as they are not at variance with the constitution and laws of the DPR\" [80]\n\n\nSteinmeier formula\nIn 2016, the so-called Steinmeier Formula was heralded [89] [90] Steinmeier appears to have used Russia's exclusion from the G8 as pressure [91] Steinmeier proposal \"implicitly acknowledged, and were explicitly based on, the Kremlin’s military achievements\" of 2014 and 2015 The Formula, proposed by both Russian and European diplomats, the Formula encouraged Ukraine to carry out elections in the territory controlled by Russia and to provide Russia-occupied territories with \"special status\" [2]\n\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of 2022\nHistory professor Michael Kimmage criticizes the West's position for it being \"the opposite of deterrence\" and for its weakness \"Western policy was an invitation for Putin to go further\" During 2021, Putin prepared Russia for a full-scale war within Europe [93] On 15 February 2022, the Russian Duma voted to appeal to President Putin to recognise the self-proclaimed LPR and DPR [94] The next day, a Russian government spokesman acknowledged that officially recognising the Donbas republics would not be in keeping with the Minsk agreements [95] However, he also told journalists that Putin's priority in regulating the situation in Donbas is the implementation of mechanisms adopted under those agreements [96] Russia went on to officially recognise the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics on 21 February 2022 [9] Following that decision, on 22 February 2022, President Putin said that the Minsk agreements \"no longer existed\", and that Ukraine, not Russia, was to blame for their collapse, accusing Ukraine of genocide in Donbas in his comments [97] [98] [10] – a statement largely seen as baseless and factually wrong by the wider world, academics studying genocide, and the United Nations [99] [100] [101] [102] Russia then invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022 [11]\n\n\nEvaluation\nFollowing the fall of Debaltseve in February 2015, about one-third of the Donbas region remained in separatist control [104] A few days before the 2022 Russian invasion, French president Emmanuel Macron and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken opined that the Minsk agreements were \"the way forward\" to end the conflict in Donbas Blinken added that it was an incomplete step as there were other outstanding issues [105] The aim of the Russian intervention in Donbas was to establish pro-Russian governments that, upon reincorporation into Ukraine, would facilitate Russian interference in Ukrainian politics [106] The agreements were thus highly favourable to the Russian side, as their implementation would accomplish these goals [107]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Minsk Agreements**\n\nThe Minsk Agreements are a series of

Following the Russian victory at Donetsk International Airport in defiance of the Protocol, DPR spokesman Eduard Basurin said that \"the Minsk Memorandum will not be considered in the form it was adopted.\" Later in the day, DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that the DPR \"will not make any attempts at ceasefire talks any more\", and that his forces were going to \"attack right up to the borders of Donetsk region.\" The New York Times said that the ceasefire had \"all but vanished.\" In January-February, Russia repeated its pattern of August 2014, invaded with fresh forces and attacked and defeated Ukrainian forces at Debaltseve, forcing Ukraine to sign a Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements, or Minsk II.\n\n**Minsk II, February 2015**\n\nSuccessive attempts to resolve the ongoing war in the Donbas region of Ukraine had seen no result by the start of February 2015. While the Minsk Protocol of 5 September 2014 did significantly reduce fighting in the conflict zone for many months, minor skirmishes continued. At the start of January 2015, Russia sent another large batch of its regular military, which together with separatist forces of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) began a new offensive on Ukrainian-controlled areas, resulting in the complete collapse of the Minsk Protocol ceasefire.\n\n**Text of the Agreement**\n\nThe full text of the agreement is as follows:\n\n* Immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy artillery from the contact line.\n* Withdrawal of all foreign armed formations, military equipment, and mercenaries from Ukrainian territory.\n* Release of all hostages and illegally detained persons.\n* Restoration of Ukrainian control over the state border with Russia.\n* Creation of a security zone along the contact line.\n* Withdrawal of all heavy weapons with a caliber of over 100 mm.\n* Creation of a buffer zone along the contact line.\n* Establishment of a monitoring and verification mission.\n* Creation of a working group to discuss the implementation of the agreement.\n* Creation of a contact group to discuss the implementation of the agreement.\n* Establishment of a commission to investigate allegations of human rights abuses.\n* Creation of a joint commission to discuss economic and social issues.\n\n**Signatories**\n\nThe document was signed by:\n\n* President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko\n* Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel\n* President of France François Hollande\n* President of Russia Vladimir Putin\n* Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Lavrov\n* Foreign Minister of Ukraine Pavlo Klimkin\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe new package, commonly referred to as \"Minsk II\", was criticised for being \"highly complicated\" and \"extremely fragile\", and for being very similar to the failed Minsk Protocol. The New York Times reported that the plan had \"included some tripwires\", such as not demarcating control over the city of Debaltseve, which was the site of the most fierce fighting at the time of the plan's drafting. Following the Minsk talks, Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, and President Poroshenko attended a European Union (EU) summit in Brussels.\n\n**Efficacy**\n\nThough the fighting generally subsided after the ceasefire came into effect at 0:00 EET on 15 February, skirmishes and shelling continued in several parts of the conflict zone. Shelling and fighting at Debaltseve continued, as DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that the ceasefire did not apply to that area. In the south of Donetsk Oblast, fighting between DPR forces and members of the Azov Battalion continued in villages near Mariupol. By 16 February, Minsk II seemed on the verge of collapse. Separatists continued a heavy assault on Debaltseve. Both sides said that they would not withdraw heavy weaponry as specified by the agreement whilst fighting in Debaltseve was ongoing. Reuters described the ceasefire as \"stillborn\" in Debaltseve. Ukrainian forces were forced to retreat from Debaltseve on 18 February, leaving separatist forces in control of the city.\n\n**Elections in the DPR and LPR**\n\nWhile the 2015 Ukrainian local elections had been scheduled for 25 October, DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko issued a decree on 2 July that ordered local DPR elections to be held on 18 October. He said that this action was \"in accordance with the Minsk agreements\". According to Zakharchenko, this move meant that the DPR had \"independently started to implement the Minsk agreements\". Zakharchenko said that the elections would \"take place 'on the basis of Ukraine's law on temporary self-rule status of individual districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions', in so far as they are not at variance with the constitution and laws of the DPR\".\n\n**Steinmeier Formula**\n\nIn 2016, the so-called Steinmeier Formula was heralded. Steinmeier appears to have used Russia's exclusion from the G8 as pressure. Steinmeier proposal \"implicitly acknowledged, and were explicitly based on, the Kremlin’s military achievements\" of 2014 and 2015. The Formula, proposed by both Russian and European diplomats, encouraged Ukraine to carry out elections in the territory controlled by Russia and to provide Russia-occupied territories with \"special status\".\n\n**Russia's Full-Scale Invasion of 2022**\n\nHistory professor Michael Kimmage criticizes the West's position for it being \"the opposite of deterrence\" and for its weakness. Western policy was an invitation for Putin to go further. During 2021, Putin prepared Russia for a full-scale war within Europe. On 15 February 2022, the Russian Duma voted to appeal to President Putin to recognise the self-proclaimed LPR and DPR. The next day, a Russian government spokesman acknowledged that officially recognising the Donbas republics would not be in keeping with the Minsk agreements. However, he also told journalists that Putin's priority in regulating the situation in Donbas is the implementation of mechanisms adopted under those agreements. Russia went on to officially recognise the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics on 21 February 2022. Following that decision,", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Minsk_agreements\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn February 2014, Russian military covertly attacked and occupied Ukrainian Crimea Protests and unrest started in the East of Ukraine (Donbas), which researchers characterize as \"unclear to what extent the protests in the east were initiated by local dissatisfaction with the situation in Kyiv, and to what extent they were organized and supported from Russia\" [12] In spring, \"DPR\" and \"LPR\" - two unrecognized statelets - were created in Ukrainian Donbas by Russian actors There, the Kremlin government used some of its techniques it used before during the creation of separatist enclaves in Moldova and Georgia Russia then processed to establish the narrative and negotiation position in order to trap the victims of Russian aggression and involve Western states in the logic of “frozen conflict” (Umland & Essen) [2]\n\n\nMinsk

2022, President Putin said that the Minsk agreements \"no longer existed\", and that Ukraine, not Russia, was to blame for their collapse, accusing Ukraine of genocide in Donbas in his comments [97] [98] [10] – a statement largely seen as baseless and factually wrong by the wider world, academics studying genocide, and the United Nations [99] [100] [101] [102] Russia then invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022 [11]\n\n\nEvaluation\nFollowing the fall of Debaltseve in February 2015, about one-third of the Donbas region remained in separatist control [104] A few days before the 2022 Russian invasion, French president Emmanuel Macron and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken opined that the Minsk agreements were \"the way forward\" to end the conflict in Donbas Blinken added that it was an incomplete step as there were other outstanding issues [105] The aim of the Russian intervention in Donbas was to establish pro-Russian governments that, upon reincorporation into Ukraine, would facilitate Russian interference in Ukrainian politics [106] The agreements were thus highly favourable to the Russian side, as their implementation would accomplish these goals [107]\n\n\nSee

the only child of Mary, Princess Royal, and stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange Mary was the elder daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and sister of kings Charles II and James II and VII.\n\n\nBirth and family\nWilliam III was born in The Hague in the Dutch Republic on 4 November 1650 [c] [2] Baptised William Henry (Dutch: Willem Hendrik), he was the only child of Mary, Princess Royal, and stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange Mary was the elder daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and sister of kings Charles II and James II and VII.\n\n\nChildhood and education\nWilliam's mother showed little personal interest in her son, sometimes being absent for years, and had always deliberately kept herself apart from Dutch society [6] William's education was first laid in the hands of several Dutch governesses, some of English descent, including Walburg Howard [7] and the Scottish noblewoman Lady Anna Mackenzie [8] From April 1656, the prince received daily instruction in the Reformed religion from the Calvinist preacher Cornelis Trigland, a follower of the Contra-Remonstrant theologian Gisbertus Voetius [7]\n\n\nEarly offices\nAfter the death of William's father, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant [f] At the demand of Oliver Cromwell, the Treaty of Westminster, which ended the First Anglo-Dutch War, had a secret annexe that required the Act of Seclusion, which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder [24] After the English Restoration, the Act of Seclusion, which had not remained a secret for long, was declared void as the English Commonwealth (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed [25] In 1660, William's mother Mary and grandmother Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused [25]\n\n\nExclusion from stadtholdership\nAfter the death of William's father, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant [f] At the demand of Oliver Cromwell, the Treaty of Westminster, which ended the First Anglo-Dutch War, had a secret annexe that required the Act of Seclusion, which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder [24] After the English Restoration, the Act of Seclusion, which had not remained a secret for long, was declared void as the English Commonwealth (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed [25] In 1660, William's mother Mary and grandmother Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused [25]\n\n\nConflict with republicans\nIn November 1670, William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2,797,859 guilder debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange [33] Charles was unable to pay, but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilders [33] Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated Calvinist and patriotic Dutchman and reconsidered his desire to show him the Secret Treaty of Dover with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as \"sovereign\" of a Dutch rump state [33] In addition to differing political outlooks, William found that his lifestyle differed from his uncles Charles and James, who were more concerned with drinking, gambling, and cavorting with mistresses [34]\n\n\nBecoming stadtholder\nFor the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous It became known as the Rampjaar (\"disaster year\") because in the Franco-Dutch War and the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England, Münster, and Cologne Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the Battle of Solebay, in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht On 14 June, William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of the Dutch Waterline on 8 June [40] Louis XIV of France, believing the war was over, began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible [41] The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against De Witt and his allies [41]\n\n\n\"Disaster year\" and Franco-Dutch War\nFor the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous It became known as the Rampjaar

possible [41] The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against De Witt and his allies [41]\n\n\nMarriage\nDuring the war with France, William tried to improve his position by marrying, in 1677, his first cousin Mary, elder surviving daughter of the Duke of York, later King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms, and would draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies [61] James was not inclined to consent, but Charles II pressured his brother to agree [62] Charles wanted to use the possibility of marriage to gain leverage in negotiations relating to the war, but William insisted that the two issues be decided separately [63] Charles relented, and Bishop Henry Compton married the couple on 4 November 1677 [64] Mary became pregnant soon after the marriage, but miscarried After a further illness later in 1678, she never conceived again [65]\n\n\nTensions with France, intrigue with England\nBy 1678, Louis XIV sought peace with the Dutch Republic [67] Even so, tensions remained: William remained suspicious of Louis, thinking that the French king desired \"universal kingship\" over Europe; Louis described William as \"my mortal enemy\" and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger France's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany (the Réunion policy) and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, caused a surge of Huguenot refugees to the Republic [68] This led William III to join various anti-French alliances, such as the Association League, and ultimately the League of Augsburg (an anti-French coalition that also included the Holy Roman Empire, Sweden, Spain and several German states) in 1686 [69]\n\n\nGlorious Revolution\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William's troops would be occupied in Britain [76] Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader, he demanded in a letter to Rear-Admiral Arthur Herbert that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade [77] In June, Mary of Modena, after a string of miscarriages, gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward Stuart, who displaced William's Protestant wife to become first in the line of succession and raised the prospect of an ongoing Catholic monarchy [78] Public anger also increased because of the trial of seven bishops who had publicly opposed James's Declaration of Indulgence granting religious liberty to his subjects, a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church [79]\n\n\nInvasion of England\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now

publicly opposed James's Declaration of Indulgence granting religious liberty to his subjects, a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church [79]\n\n\nProclaimed king\nWilliam summoned a Convention Parliament in England, which met on 22 January 1689, to discuss the appropriate course of action following James's flight [88] William felt insecure about his position; though his wife preceded him in the line of succession to the throne, he wished to reign as king in his own right, rather than as a mere consort [89] The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century, when Queen Mary I married Philip of Spain [90] Philip remained king only during his wife's lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power William, on the other hand, demanded that he remain as king even after his wife's death [91] When the majority of Tory Lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler, William threatened to leave the country immediately Furthermore, she, remaining loyal to her husband, refused [92]\n\n\nRevolution settlement\nWilliam encouraged the passage of the Toleration Act 1689, which guaranteed religious toleration to Protestant nonconformists [88] It did not, however, extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the religious liberty of Roman Catholics, non-trinitarians, and those of non-Christian faiths [94] In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights, was passed [97] The Act, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right, established restrictions on the royal prerogative It provided, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail or inflict cruel and unusual punishments [88] William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute [98]\n\n\nRule with Mary II\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament Over the next 57 years Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs Nonjurors in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.\n\n\nJacobite resistance\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament Over the next 57 years Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs Nonjurors in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.\n\n\nParliament and faction\nAlthough the Whigs were William's strongest supporters, he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories [105] The Marquess of Halifax, a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William's confidence early in his reign [106] The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance [107] This \"balanced\" approach to governance did not last beyond 1690, as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy, and William called for new elections early that year [108]\n\n\nWar in Europe\nWilliam continued to absent himself from Britain for extended periods during his Nine Years' War (1688–1697) against France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn [115] England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the Grand Alliance [116] Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary II, governed the realm, but acted on his advice Each time he returned to England, Mary gave up her power to him without reservation, an arrangement that lasted for the rest of Mary's life [117]\n\n\nEconomic crisis\nWilliam's rule led to rapid inflation in England, which caused widespread hunger from 1693 onwards [122] The Nine Years' War damaged English maritime trade and led to a doubling in taxation [122] These factors coupled with government mismanagement caused a currency crisis 1695–1697 and a run on the recently created Bank of England [122]\n\n\nLater years\nMary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694, aged 32, leaving William III to rule alone [123] William deeply mourned his wife's death [124] Despite his conversion to Anglicanism, William's popularity in England plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch [125]\n\n\nRumours of homosexuality\nDuring the 1690s, rumours grew of William's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors [126] He did have several close male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: Hans Willem Bentinck became Earl of Portland, and Arnold Joost van Keppel was created Earl of Albemarle These relationships with male friends, and his apparent lack of mistresses, led William's enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships William's modern biographers disagree on the veracity of these allegations Some believe there may have been truth to the rumours, [127] while others affirm that they were no more than figments of his enemies' imaginations, as it was common for someone childless like William to adopt, or evince paternal affections for, a younger man [128]\n\n\nPeace with France\nIn 1696, the Dutch territory of Drenthe made William its Stadtholder In the same year, Jacobites plotted to assassinate William in an attempt to restore James to the English throne The plan failed and support for William surged [131] Parliament passed a bill of attainder against the ringleader, John Fenwick, and he was beheaded in 1697 [132] In accordance with the Treaty of Rijswijk (20 September 1697), which ended the Nine Years' War, King Louis XIV recognised William III as King of England, and undertook to give no further assistance to James II [133] Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697, Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William's reign.\n\n\nEnglish royal succession\nAnother royal inheritance, apart from that of Spain, also concerned William His marriage with Mary had not produced any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry Mary's sister, Anne, had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood The death of her last surviving child (Prince William, Duke of Gloucester) in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights [139] As the complete exhaustion of the defined line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II's line, the English Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that if Anne died without surviving issue and William failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage, the Crown would pass to a distant relative, Sophia, Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of James I), and to her Protestant heirs [140] The Act debarred Roman Catholics from the throne, thereby excluding the candidacy of several dozen people more closely related to Mary and Anne than Sophia The Act extended to

as William of Orange, was a Dutch nobleman and a prominent figure in European history. He was the Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic and the King of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1689 to 1702. William's life was marked by significant events, including his involvement in the Glorious Revolution, his marriage to Mary II, and his struggles against the Jacobite movement. This article will provide a comprehensive overview of William's life, including his early years, his accession to the throne, and his reign as King of England.\n\n## Early Life\n\nWilliam III was born on November 4, 1650, in The Hague, Dutch Republic, to Mary, Princess Royal, and William II, Prince of Orange. He was the only child of his parents. His mother, Mary, was the elder daughter of King Charles I of England and the sister of King Charles II and James II and VII. William's early life was marked by his mother's frequent absences and her reluctance to show personal interest in him. He was educated by several Dutch governesses, including Walburg Howard and Lady Anna Mackenzie.\n\n## Childhood and Education\n\nWilliam's education was under the care of several Dutch governesses, some of whom were of English descent. He received daily instruction in the Reformed religion from the Calvinist preacher Cornelis Trigland, a follower of the Contra-Remonstrant theologian Gisbertus Voetius. After his father's death, William's mother and grandmother Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused.\n\n## Early Offices\n\nAfter the death of William's father, the office of stadtholder was left vacant in most provinces. At the demand of Oliver Cromwell, the Treaty of Westminster, which ended the First Anglo-Dutch War, had a secret annex that required the Act of Seclusion, which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder. After the English Restoration, the Act of Seclusion was declared void as the English Commonwealth (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed. In 1660, William's mother and grandmother tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused.\n\n## Conflict with Republicans\n\nIn November 1670, William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2,797,859 guilder debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange. Charles was unable to pay, but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilders. Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated Calvinist and patriotic Dutchman and reconsidered his desire to show him the Secret Treaty of Dover with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as \"sovereign\" of a Dutch rump state.\n\n## Becoming Stadtholder\n\nFor the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous, becoming known as the Rampjaar (\"disaster year\") because in the Franco-Dutch War and the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England, Münster, and Cologne. Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the Battle of Solebay, in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht. On 14 June, William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of the Dutch Waterline on 8 June.\n\n## \"Disaster Year\" and Franco-Dutch War\n\nThe presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against De Witt and his allies. Louis XIV of France, believing the war was over, began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible. The French army was eventually defeated, but the war had a devastating impact on the Dutch economy and led to a significant increase in taxation.\n\n## Marriage\n\nDuring the war with France, William tried to improve his position by marrying, in 1677, his first cousin Mary, elder surviving daughter of the Duke of York, later King James II of England. Mary was eleven years his junior, and William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms and draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies.\n\n## Tensions with France, Intrigue with England\n\nBy 1678, Louis XIV sought peace with the Dutch Republic. However, tensions remained, and William remained suspicious of Louis, thinking that the French king desired \"universal kingship\" over Europe. France's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany, and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, led William to join various anti-French alliances, including the League of Augsburg.\n\n## Glorious Revolution\n\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William's troops would be occupied in Britain. In June, Mary of Modena, after a string of miscarriages, gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward Stuart, who displaced William's Protestant wife to become first in the line of succession and raised the prospect of an ongoing Catholic monarchy.\n\n## Invasion of England\n\nWilliam summoned a Convention Parliament in England, which met on 22 January 1689, to discuss the appropriate course of action following James's flight. William felt insecure about his position; though his wife preceded him in the line of succession to the throne, he wished to reign as king in his own right, rather than as a mere consort. The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century, when Queen Mary I married Philip of Spain.\n\n## Revolution Settlement\n\nWilliam encouraged the passage of the Toleration Act 1689, which guaranteed religious toleration to Protestant nonconformists. However, it did not extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the religious liberty of Roman Catholics, non-trinitarians, and those of non-Christian faiths. In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights, was passed.\n\n## Rule with Mary II\n\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings. Over the next 57 years, Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs. Nonjurors in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church, as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.\n\n## Jacobite Resistance\n\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings. Over the next 57 years, Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs. Nonjurors in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church, as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.\n\n## Parliament and Faction\n\nAlthough the Whigs were William's strongest supporters, he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories. The Marquess of Halifax, a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William's confidence early in his reign. The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance.\n\n## War in Europe\n\nWilliam continued to absent himself from Britain for extended periods during his Nine Years' War (1688–1697) against France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn. England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the Grand Alliance. Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary, governed the realm, but acted on his advice.\n\n## Economic Crisis\n\nWilliam's rule led to rapid inflation in England, which caused widespread hunger from 1693 onwards. The Nine Years' War damaged English maritime trade and led to a doubling in taxation. These factors, coupled with government mismanagement, caused a currency crisis 1695–1697 and a run on the recently created Bank of England.\n\n## Later Years\n\nMary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694, aged 32, leaving William to rule alone. William deeply mourned his wife's death. Despite his conversion to Anglicanism, William's popularity in England plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch.\n\n## Rumours of Homosexuality\n\nDuring the 1690s, rumours grew of William's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors. He did have several close male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: Hans Willem Bentinck became Earl of Portland, and Arnold Joost van Keppel was created Earl of Albemarle.\n\n## Peace with France\n\nIn 1696, the Dutch territory of Drenthe made William its Stadtholder. In the same year, Jacobites plotted to assassinate William in an attempt to restore James to the English throne. The plan failed, and support for William surged. Parliament passed a bill of attainder against the ringleader, John Fenwick, and he was beheaded in 1697.\n\n## English Royal Succession\n\nAnother royal inheritance, apart from that of Spain, also concerned William. His marriage with Mary had not produced any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry. Mary's sister, Anne, had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood. The death of her last surviving child (Prince William, Duke of Gloucester) in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights.\n\n## Death\n\nIn 1702, William died of pneumonia, a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse, Sorrel. It was rumoured that the horse had been confiscated from Sir John Fenwick, one of the Jacobites who had conspired against William. Because his horse had stumbled into a mole's burrow, many Jacobites toasted \"the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat\".\n\n## Legacy\n\nWilliam III of England was a great man, an enemy of

William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilders [33] Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated Calvinist and patriotic Dutchman and reconsidered his desire to show him the Secret Treaty of Dover with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as \"sovereign\" of a Dutch rump state [33] In addition to differing political outlooks, William found that his lifestyle differed from his uncles Charles and James, who were more concerned with drinking, gambling, and cavorting with mistresses [34]\n\n\nBecoming stadtholder\nFor the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous It became known as the Rampjaar (\"disaster year\") because in the Franco-Dutch War and the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England,

marrying, in 1677, his first cousin Mary, elder surviving daughter of the Duke of York, later King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms, and would draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies [61] James was not inclined to consent, but Charles II pressured his brother to agree [62] Charles wanted to use the possibility of marriage to gain leverage in negotiations relating to the war, but William insisted that the two issues be decided separately [63] Charles relented, and Bishop Henry Compton married the couple on 4 November 1677 [64] Mary became pregnant soon after the marriage, but miscarried After a further illness later in 1678, she never conceived again [65]\n\n\nTensions with France, intrigue with England\nBy 1678, Louis XIV sought peace with the Dutch Republic [67] Even so, tensions remained: William remained suspicious of Louis, thinking that the French king desired \"universal kingship\" over Europe; Louis described William as \"my mortal enemy\" and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger France's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany (the Réunion policy) and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, caused a surge of Huguenot refugees to the Republic [68] This led William III to join various anti-French alliances, such as the Association League, and ultimately the League of Augsburg (an anti-French coalition that also included the Holy Roman Empire, Sweden, Spain and several German states) in 1686 [69]\n\n\nGlorious Revolution\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William's troops would be occupied in Britain [76] Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader, he demanded in a letter to Rear-Admiral Arthur Herbert that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade [77] In June, Mary of Modena, after a string of miscarriages, gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward Stuart, who displaced William's Protestant wife to become first in the line of succession and raised the prospect of an ongoing Catholic monarchy [78] Public anger also increased because of the trial of seven bishops who had publicly opposed James's Declaration of Indulgence granting religious liberty to his subjects, a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church [79]\n\n\nInvasion of England\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in

the throne, he wished to reign as king in his own right, rather than as a mere consort [89] The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century, when Queen Mary I married Philip of Spain [90] Philip remained king only during his wife's lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power William, on the other hand, demanded that he remain as king even after his wife's death [91] When the majority of Tory Lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler, William threatened to leave the country immediately Furthermore, she, remaining loyal to her husband, refused [92]\n\n\nRevolution settlement\nWilliam encouraged the passage of the Toleration Act 1689, which guaranteed religious toleration to Protestant nonconformists [88] It did not, however, extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the religious liberty of Roman Catholics, non-trinitarians, and those of non-Christian faiths [94] In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights, was passed [97] The Act, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right, established restrictions on the royal prerogative It provided, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail or inflict cruel and unusual punishments [88] William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute [98]\n\n\nRule with Mary II\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament Over the next 57 years Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs Nonjurors in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.\n\n\nJacobite resistance\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a

gained William's confidence early in his reign [106] The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance [107] This \"balanced\" approach to governance did not last beyond 1690, as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy, and William called for new elections early that year [108]\n\n\nWar in Europe\nWilliam continued to absent himself from Britain for extended periods during his Nine Years' War (1688–1697) against France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn [115] England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the Grand Alliance [116] Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary II, governed the realm, but acted

detractors [126] He did have several close male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: Hans Willem Bentinck became Earl of Portland, and Arnold Joost van Keppel was created Earl of Albemarle These relationships with male friends, and his apparent lack of mistresses, led William's enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships William's modern biographers disagree on the veracity of these allegations Some believe there may have been truth to the rumours, [127] while others affirm that they were no more than figments of his enemies' imaginations, as it was common for someone childless like William to adopt, or evince paternal affections for, a younger man [128]\n\n\nPeace with France\nIn 1696, the Dutch territory of Drenthe made William its Stadtholder In the same year, Jacobites plotted to assassinate William in an attempt to restore James to the English throne The plan failed and support for William surged [131] Parliament passed a bill of attainder against the ringleader, John Fenwick, and he was beheaded in 1697 [132] In accordance with the Treaty of Rijswijk (20 September 1697), which ended the Nine Years' War, King Louis XIV recognised William III as King of England, and undertook to give no further assistance to James II [133] Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697, Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William's reign.\n\n\nEnglish royal succession\nAnother royal inheritance, apart from that of Spain, also concerned William His marriage with Mary had not produced any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry Mary's sister, Anne, had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood The death of her last surviving child (Prince William, Duke of Gloucester) in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights [139] As the complete exhaustion of the defined line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II's line, the English Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that if Anne died without surviving issue and William failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage, the Crown would pass to a distant relative, Sophia, Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of James I), and to her Protestant heirs [140] The Act debarred Roman Catholics from the throne, thereby excluding the candidacy of several dozen people more closely related to Mary and Anne than Sophia The Act extended to England and Ireland, but not to Scotland, whose Estates had not been consulted before the selection of Sophia [140]\n\n\nDeath\nIn 1702, William died of pneumonia, a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse, Sorrel It was rumoured that the horse had been confiscated from Sir John Fenwick, one of the Jacobites who had conspired against William [141] Because his horse had stumbled into a mole's burrow, many Jacobites toasted \"the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat\" [142] Years later, Winston Churchill, in his A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, stated that the fall \"opened the door to a troop of lurking foes\" [143] William was buried in Westminster Abbey alongside his wife [144] His sister-in-law and cousin, Anne, became queen regnant of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\n\nLegacy\nHe was a great man, an enemy of France, to which he did a great deal of harm, but we owe him our esteem.\n\nTitles, styles, and arms\nBy 1674, William was fully styled as \"Willem III, by God's grace Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau etc., Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht etc., Captain- and Admiral-General of the United Netherlands\" [160] After their accession in Great Britain in 1689, William and Mary used the

kit of white shirts and black shorts, reflected in their first badge [4]\n\n\n1923–29: early years\nVillarreal CF was founded as Club Deportivo Villarreal on 10 March 1923 \"to promote all sports especially Football.\" The stadium was rented for 60 pesetas a month and ticket prices were set at half a peseta for men and a quarter of a peseta for children Women were granted free admission [3] On 17 June 1923, Castellón, a modern rival of the club, played the first match against a club named after Miguel de Cervantes On 21 October of that year, Villarreal played their first game ever, playing against Castellón [3] Villarreal started off with a kit of white shirts and black shorts, reflected in their first badge [4]\n\n\n1929–98: time in lower divisions\nVillarreal entered regional competitions within the Spanish football pyramid from 1929 to 1930 onwards The 1934–35 season saw the team lose to Cartagena when a win would have seen them promoted to the nationwide Second Division [3] The following season saw Villarreal win the First Division of the region before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War [3]\n\n\n1998–2012: La Liga and European debuts\nVillarreal's La Liga debut started with a match against reigning European champions Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on 31 August 1998 where they lost 4-1 despite taking the lead after 3 minutes [6] The first home game was against Celta de Vigo [5] the week after Because of a difficult season, Villarreal were relegated to the Segunda División for the 1999–2000 season, but by finishing third, they were then promoted back to the Primera División.\n\n\n2012–present: relegation and European glory\nOn 13 May 2012, Villarreal were relegated from La Liga after defeat to Atlético Madrid Following a horrendous season, the club suffered a shattering tragedy when Manolo Preciado, appointed as Villarreal's new manager on 6 June 2012, died of a heart attack later that day [11] Following their relegation, there was a mass exodus of players at the club, with star players such as Borja Valero, Diego López, Giuseppe Rossi and Nilmar leaving the side [12]\n\n\nRivalries\nVillarreal has supported a long rivalry with Castellón for geographical reasons, since both are from the province of Castellón They also rival Valencia, since the two had been the most competitive teams of the Valencian Community; this clash is called the \"Derbi de la Comunitat\".\n\n\nRecords\nThe club's famous yellow kit dates back to 1947 With the new season fast approaching, the son of the then Villarreal president travelled to

{"title": "Star_(sport_badge)", "content": "\nStandardised significance\nThe first team in sports history to adopt a star was Juventus, [2] who added one golden star with five points in the team's shirt, after Italian Football Federation (FIGC) approval, in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, at the time, the new national record [1] This was an extension of the existing convention by which the reigning champions are entitled to display the scudetto on their shirts for the following season Inspired in the Stella d'oro al merito sportivo (Italian for 'Golden Stars for Sports Merit'), an honorary award given in Italy by CONI since 1933, the star was later formally adopted by the rest of the sporting organizations in the country as a symbol for ten titles, and the ratio of one star for ten titles has become the \"most common\" arrangement worldwide [3]\n\n\nInternational\nBrazil had two stars above their badge in 1968 It was used briefly (friendly matches only) and then removed After winning their third World Cup in 1970, three stars were officially added and Italy did likewise in 1982 Germany added three in 1996, one in each of the German flag's colours All world champions have since followed suit Brazil, Italy, and Germany have since added more stars, after they won later tournaments, while Argentina are the most recent nation to add a star, commemorating their 2022 triumph less than an hour after victory in the Final [17]\n\n\nAd hoc adoptions\nMore recently, club teams have added stars either upon winning a landmark trophy, or in response to a rival team's having added stars In the Romanian first league, Steaua uses 2 stars above their badge since they won their 20th title Since then Dinamo added a star for the 18 championships they won Manchester United sported a star in their UEFA Champions League matches on their special European home kit between 1997 and 1999 [21] To celebrate their second victory that year, they added an extra star to that kit for the 1999–00 season [21] Liverpool likewise wore four stars in 2001–02, their first campaign in the competition since the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985 [21] They wore five stars in the competition in 2005–06 after their fifth victory Instead of stars, UEFA introduced a multiple winner badge in 2000–01 season, currently worn by five teams who have won the Champions League either five times or more in total, or three times in a row.\n\n\nList in football\nExcluding the temporary stars, the following teams have chosen to add stars

It is a common convention used in many sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and more.\n\n**Standardised significance**\n\nThe first team in sports history to adopt a star was Juventus, who added one golden star with five points in the team's shirt after Italian Football Federation (FIGC) approval in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, at the time, the new national record. This was an extension of the existing convention by which the reigning champions are entitled to display the scudetto on their shirts for the following season. Inspired by the Stella d'oro al merito sportivo (Italian for 'Golden Stars for Sports Merit'), an honorary award given in Italy by CONI since 1933, the star was later formally adopted by the rest of the sporting organizations in the country as a symbol for ten titles, and the ratio of one star for ten titles has become the \"most common\" arrangement worldwide.\n\n**International**\n\nBrazil had two stars above their badge in 1968, which were used briefly (in friendly matches only) and then removed. After winning their third World Cup in 1970, three stars were officially added, and Italy did likewise in 1982. Germany added three in 1996, one in each of the German flag's colours. All world champions have since followed suit. Brazil, Italy, and Germany have since added more stars, after they won later tournaments, while Argentina are the most recent nation to add a star, commemorating their 2022 triumph less than an hour after victory in the Final.\n\n**Ad hoc adoptions**\n\nMore recently, club teams have added stars either upon winning a landmark trophy, or in response to a rival team's having added stars. In the Romanian first league, Steaua uses two stars above their badge since they won their 20th title. Since then, Dinamo added a star for the 18 championships they won. Manchester United sported a star in their UEFA Champions League matches on their special European home kit between 1997 and 1999. To celebrate their second victory that year, they added an extra star to that kit for the 1999-00 season. Liverpool likewise wore four stars in 2001-02, their first campaign in the competition since the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. They wore five stars in the competition in 2005-06 after their fifth victory. Instead of stars, UEFA introduced a multiple winner badge in 2000-01 season, currently worn by five teams who have won the Champions League either five times or more in total, or three times in a row.\n\n**List in football**\n\n### National teams\n\n* American club Philadelphia Union has 13 stars that represent the 13 original colonies of the United States.\n* Fellow Major League Soccer franchise Montreal Impact had four stars on their badge, which were symbolic of the nationalities of the peoples who founded the city of Montreal, prior to rebranding as CF Montreal.

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Star_(sport_badge)\" following this outline:\n\n\nStandardised significance\nThe first team in sports history to adopt a star was Juventus, [2] who added one golden star with five points in the team's shirt, after Italian Football Federation (FIGC) approval, in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, at the time, the new national record [1] This was an extension of the existing convention by which the reigning champions are entitled to display the scudetto on their shirts for the following season Inspired in the Stella d'oro al merito sportivo (Italian for 'Golden Stars for Sports Merit'), an honorary award given in Italy by CONI since 1933, the star was later formally adopted by the rest of the sporting organizations in the country as a symbol for ten titles, and the ratio of one star for ten titles has become the \"most common\" arrangement worldwide [3]\n\n\nInternational\nBrazil had two stars above their badge in 1968 It was used briefly (friendly matches only) and then removed After winning their third World Cup in 1970, three stars were officially added and Italy did likewise in 1982 Germany added three in 1996, one in each of the German flag's colours All world champions have since followed suit Brazil, Italy, and Germany have since added more stars, after they won later tournaments, while Argentina are the most recent nation to add a star, commemorating their 2022 triumph less than an hour after victory in the Final [17]\n\n\nAd hoc adoptions\nMore recently, club teams have added stars either upon winning a landmark trophy, or in response to a rival team's having added stars In the Romanian first league, Steaua uses 2 stars above their badge since they won their 20th title Since then Dinamo added a star for the 18 championships they won Manchester United sported a star in their UEFA Champions League matches on their special European home kit between 1997 and 1999 [21] To celebrate their second victory that year, they added an extra star to that kit for the 1999–00 season [21] Liverpool likewise wore four stars in 2001–02, their first campaign in the competition since the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985 [21] They wore five stars in the competition in 2005–06 after their fifth victory Instead of stars, UEFA introduced a multiple winner badge in 2000–01 season, currently worn by five teams who have won the Champions League either five times or more in total, or three times in a row.\n\n\nList in football\nExcluding the temporary stars, the

to withdraw all US forces from Afghanistan by 1 May 2021 [32] [33] The Taliban failed to honor most of its pledges in the agreement [33] Nonetheless, the Biden administration decided to continue with the planned withdrawal, although it pushed back the completion date first to 11 September 2021 and then to 31 August 2021 [32] [34]\n\n\nTimeline\nAfter the Taliban seized all border crossings, Kabul Airport remained the only secure route out of Afghanistan [41] After the fall of Herat on 13 August, the US deployed an additional 3,000 troops and the UK deployed 600 troops to Kabul Airport to secure the airlifts of their nationals, embassy staff, and Afghan citizens who worked with coalition forces [41] US officials said at the time that all of their forces were still expected to leave Afghanistan by 31 August [42] On 13 August, a memorandum was sent to all staff of the US embassy to reduce \"items with embassy or agency logos, American flags or items which could be misused in propaganda efforts\" [43] Diplomats were reported to be rapidly destroying classified documents and other sensitive materials [41] Among the documents destroyed were the passports of Afghan civilians who had applied for visas [44]\n\n\n13–14 August\nAfter the Taliban seized all border crossings, Kabul Airport remained the only secure route out of Afghanistan [41] After the fall of Herat on 13

embassy personnel, 5,000 US troops and some NATO troops remained in the city [45] [46] The US government later authorized the deployment of 1,000 more troops from the 82nd Airborne Division to the airport, bolstering troop presence in Kabul to 6,000 to facilitate the evacuations [47]\n\n\n17–21 August\nOn 17 August, the United States Department of State and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan challenged reports of Afghans and Americans being unable to reach the airport Sullivan told reporters that the Taliban were prepared to \"provide the safe passage of civilians to the airport, and we intend to hold them to that commitment\" while affirming that the withdrawal deadline remained 31 August Sullivan acknowledged reports of the Taliban physically preventing people from evacuating, but said \"By and large, what we have found is that people have been able to get to the airport.\" [84]\n\n\n22 August\nOn 22 August, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation revealed that the Australian government had denied visas to over 100 Afghans who had worked as security guards for the Australian embassy [102] That evening, Lloyd Austin, United States Secretary of Defense,

of American citizens, green card holders, and Afghan allies to grant entry into the airport for evacuation President Biden stated that the \"bulk of the group\" had been allowed into the airport by

officials had left Afghanistan by the following day [161]\n\n\n29 August\nOn 29 August, the Associated Press reported that the Taliban had sealed off the airport as the US and its allies began concluding the airlift [165] The Taliban, meanwhile, insisted on taking over the security of Hamid Karzai International Airport themselves instead of Turkey, with spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid stating that their own special forces would guarantee its safety [166] However, 98 countries, including the United States, released a joint statement saying that they had received assurances from the Taliban that foreign nationals and Afghans would be allowed to leave the country [167]\n\n\n30 August\nA United States official told Reuters that anti-missile defences had intercepted five rockets

hours of 31 August (Kabul time), not long after the final American flight had left, the Taliban marched into the airport, firing their guns into the air in celebration and posing for pictures with abandoned NATO equipment [180] Taliban leaders, flanked by the Badri 313 Battalion, then entered the airport to hold a press conference declaring that \"Afghanistan is finally free\" and that they would shortly be announcing a new government [181]\n\n\nPost–withdrawal evacuations\nEfforts to evacuate foreign nationals and at-risk Afghans continued after military forces concluded their withdrawals.\n\n\nEvacuation destinations\nThe largest base handling the initial outflow of Afghan evacuees was Al Udeid Air Base outside Doha, Qatar, where evacuees were vetted against the National

to offer 21 days transit visas to the evacuees [202]\n\n\nReactions\nFormer UK Chief of the General Staff Richard Dannatt stated that the British government had been aware of the need to evacuate vulnerable Afghans for several years and that \"it would appear that the government was asleep on watch.\" [210] The UK Foreign Office group charged with organising the evacuations was revealed to have left over 5000 email messages unread throughout the last week of the evacuations, including many that contained important information of cases of vulnerable Afghans [211]\n\n\nSee

Afghanistan by 1 May 2021 [32] [33] The Taliban failed to honor most of its pledges in the agreement [33] Nonetheless, the Biden administration decided to continue with the planned withdrawal, although it pushed back the completion date first to 11 September 2021 and then to 31 August 2021 [32] [34]\n\n\nTimeline\nAfter the Taliban seized all border crossings, Kabul Airport remained the only secure route out of Afghanistan [41] After the fall of Herat on 13 August, the US deployed an additional 3,000 troops and the UK deployed 600 troops to Kabul Airport to secure the airlifts of their nationals, embassy staff, and Afghan citizens who worked with coalition forces [41] US officials said at the time that all of their forces were still expected to leave Afghanistan by 31 August [42] On 13 August, a memorandum was sent to all staff of the US embassy to reduce \"items with embassy or agency logos, American flags or items which could be misused in propaganda efforts\" [43]

Afghan allies to grant entry into the airport for evacuation President Biden stated that the \"bulk of the group\" had been allowed into the airport by the Taliban, but he could not say with

{"title": "Cleopatra", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the Ancient Greek Kleopátra (Κλεοπάτρα), meaning \"glory of her father\", [5] from κλέος (kléos, \"glory\") and πατήρ (patḗr, \"father\") [6] The masculine form would have been written either as Kleópatros (Κλεόπατρος) or Pátroklos (Πάτροκλος) [6] Cleopatra was the name of Alexander the Great's sister Cleopatra of Macedonia, as well as the wife of Meleager in Greek mythology, Cleopatra Alcyone [7] Through the marriage of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I Syra (a Seleucid princess), the name entered the Ptolemaic dynasty [8] [9] Cleopatra's adopted title Theā́ Philopátōra (Θεᾱ́ Φιλοπάτωρα) means \"goddess who loves her father\" [10] [11] [note 10]\n\n\nBackground\nPtolemaic pharaohs were crowned by the Egyptian high priest of Ptah at Memphis, but resided in the multicultural and largely Greek city of Alexandria, established by Alexander the Great [13] [14] [15] [note 11] They spoke Greek and governed Egypt as Hellenistic Greek monarchs, refusing to learn the native Egyptian language [16] [17] [18] [note 8] In contrast, Cleopatra could speak multiple languages by adulthood and was the first Ptolemaic ruler known to learn the Egyptian language [19] [20] [18] [note 12] Plutarch implies that she also spoke Ethiopian, the language of the \"Troglodytes\", Hebrew (or Aramaic), Arabic, the Syrian language (perhaps Syriac), Median, and Parthian, and she could apparently also speak Latin, although her Roman contemporaries would have preferred to speak with her in her native Koine Greek [20] [18] [21] [note 13] Aside from Greek, Egyptian, and Latin, these languages reflected Cleopatra's desire to restore North African and West Asian territories that once belonged to the Ptolemaic Kingdom [22]\n\n\nBiography\nCleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother, [32] [33] [note 14] presumably Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena), [34] [35] [36] [note 15] [note 3] the mother of Cleopatra's older sister, Berenice IV Epiphaneia [37] [38] [39] [note 16] Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC [40] [41] The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV, [37] [38] [39] were born in the absence of his wife [42] [43] Cleopatra's childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy [44] During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria [45] [46]\n\n\nEarly childhood\nCleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother, [32] [33] [note 14] presumably Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena), [34] [35] [36] [note 15] [note 3] the mother of Cleopatra's older sister, Berenice IV Epiphaneia [37] [38] [39] [note 16] Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC [40] [41] The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV, [37] [38] [39] were born in the absence of his wife [42] [43] Cleopatra's childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy [44] During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria [45] [46]\n\n\nReign and exile of Ptolemy XII\nIn 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus argued before the Roman Senate that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt, but his proposed bill and the similar bill of tribune Servilius Rullus in 63 BC were rejected [49] [50] Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering remuneration and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen, such as Pompey during his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and eventually Julius Caesar after he became Roman consul in 59 BC [51] [52] [53] [note 18] However, Ptolemy XII's profligate behavior bankrupted him, and he was forced to acquire loans from the Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus [54] [55] [56]\n\n\nReign\nPtolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, when Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion [90] [91] [92] [note 28] Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual flooding of the Nile, and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani, the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt [93] [94] Inheriting her father's debts, Cleopatra also owed the Roman Republic 17.5 million drachmas [95]\n\n\nAccession to the throne\nPtolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, when Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion [90] [91] [92] [note 28] Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual flooding of the Nile, and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani, the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt [93] [94] Inheriting her father's debts, Cleopatra also owed the Roman Republic 17.5 million drachmas [95]\n\n\nAssassination of Pompey\nIn the summer of 49 BC, Cleopatra and her forces were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompey's son Gnaeus Pompeius arrived, seeking military aid on behalf of his father [106] After returning to Italy from the wars in Gaul and crossing the Rubicon in January of 49 BC, Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to flee to Greece [108] [109] In perhaps their last joint decree, both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeius's request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops, including the Gabiniani, a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome [108] [110] Losing the fight against her brother, Cleopatra was then forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes [111] [112] [113] By the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra had traveled to Roman Syria with her younger sister, Arsinoe IV, to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt [114] [107] [115] She returned with an army, but her advance to Alexandria was blocked by her brother's forces, including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her, so she camped outside Pelousion in the eastern Nile Delta [116] [107] [117]\n\n\nRelationship with Julius Caesar\nPtolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army, in clear defiance of Caesar's demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival [128] [129] Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar, but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women, she came to Alexandria to see him personally [128] [130] [129] Historian Cassius Dio records that she did so without informing her brother, dressed in an attractive manner, and charmed Caesar with her wit [128] [131] [132] Plutarch provides an entirely different account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar [128] [133] [134] [note 35]\n\n\nLiberators' civil war\nOctavian, Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC, in which they were each elected for five-year terms to restore order in the Republic and bring Caesar's assassins to justice [196] [197] Cleopatra received messages from both Gaius Cassius Longinus, one of Caesar's assassins, and Publius Cornelius Dolabella, proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist, requesting military aid [196] She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems, while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella [196] [198] These troops were captured by Cassius in Palestine [196] [198]\n\n\nRelationship with Mark Antony\nCleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos, which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC [207] [210] Antony was well received by the populace of Alexandria, both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done [211] [212] In Egypt, Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra's ship docked at Tarsos [213] [209] He also had his subordinates, such as Publius Ventidius Bassus, drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria [212] [214] [215] [note 48]\n\n\nDonations of Alexandria\nAs Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC, this time aimed at their ally Armenia, Octavia traveled to Athens with 2,000 troops in alleged support of Antony, but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass him for his military losses [257] [258] [note 51] Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch, only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria [257] [258] When Octavia returned to Rome Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony, although she refused to leave Antony's household [259] [218] Octavian's confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west, including Sextus Pompeius and even Lepidus, the third member of the triumvirate, who was placed under house arrest after revolting against Octavian in Sicily [259] [218] [253]\n\n\nBattle of Actium\nIn a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1 January 33 BC, Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen [281] Before Antony and Octavian's joint imperium expired on 31 December 33 BC, Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian [281] In 32 BC, the Antonian loyalists Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus became consuls The former gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian, now a private citizen without public office, and introduced pieces of legislation against him [280] [282] During the next senatorial session, Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls [280] [283] Intimidated by this act, the consuls and over 200 senators still in support of Antony fled Rome the next day to join the side of Antony [280] [283] [284]\n\n\nDownfall and death\nWhile Octavian occupied Athens, Antony and Cleopatra landed at Paraitonion in Egypt [300] [304] The couple then went their separate ways, Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra to the harbor at Alexandria in an attempt to mislead the oppositional party and portray the activities in Greece as a victory [300] She was afraid that news about the outcome of the battle of Actium would lead to a rebellion [305] It is uncertain whether or not, at this time, she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival, Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, in an attempt to strike an alliance with him [306] [307]\n\n\nCleopatra's kingdom and role as a monarch\nFollowing the tradition of Macedonian rulers, Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an absolute monarch, serving as the sole lawgiver of her kingdom [353] She was the chief religious authority in her realm, presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the Egyptian and Greek polytheistic faiths [354] She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods, [355] a synagogue for the Jews in Egypt, and even built the Caesareum of Alexandria, dedicated to the cult worship of her patron and lover Julius Caesar [356] [357]\n\n\nLegacy\nAfter her suicide, Cleopatra's three surviving children, Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus, were sent to Rome with Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger, a former wife of their father, as their guardian [369] [370] Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC [369] [239] The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point [369] [239] Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II, son of Juba I, whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I's support of Pompey [371] [370] [325]\n\n\nChildren and successors\nAfter her suicide, Cleopatra's three surviving children, Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus, were sent to Rome with Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger, a former wife of their father, as their guardian [369] [370] Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC [369] [239] The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point [369] [239] Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II, son of Juba I, whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I's support of Pompey [371] [370] [325]\n\n\nRoman literature and historiography\nAlthough almost 50 ancient works of Roman historiography mention Cleopatra, these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium, her suicide, and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies [382] Despite not being a biography of Cleopatra, the Life of Antonius written by Plutarch in the 1st century AD provides the most thorough surviving account of Cleopatra's life [383] [384] [385] Plutarch lived a century after Cleopatra but relied on primary sources, such as Philotas of Amphissa, who had access to the Ptolemaic royal palace, Cleopatra's personal physician named Olympos, and Quintus Dellius, a close confidant of Mark Antony and Cleopatra [386] Plutarch's work included both the Augustan view of Cleopatra—which became canonical for his period—as well as sources outside of this tradition, such as eyewitness reports [383] [385]\n\n\nCultural depictions\nCleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the Egyptian as well as Hellenistic-Greek and Roman styles [2] Surviving works include statues, busts, reliefs, and minted coins, [2] [381] as well as ancient carved cameos, [407] such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style, now in the Altes Museum, Berlin [1] Contemporary images of Cleopatra were produced both in and outside of Ptolemaic Egypt For instance, there was once a large gilded bronze statue of Cleopatra inside the Temple of Venus Genetrix in Rome, the first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a Roman temple [3] [185] [408] It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra [409] [410]\n\n\nDepictions in ancient art\nCleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the Egyptian as well as Hellenistic-Greek and Roman styles [2] Surviving works include statues, busts, reliefs, and minted coins, [2] [381] as well as ancient carved cameos, [407] such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style, now in the Altes Museum, Berlin [1] Contemporary images of Cleopatra were produced both in and outside of Ptolemaic Egypt For instance, there was once a large gilded bronze statue of Cleopatra inside the Temple of Venus

least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra [409] [410]\n\n\nStatues\nCleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the Egyptian as well as Hellenistic-Greek and Roman styles [2] Surviving works include statues, busts, reliefs, and minted coins, [2] [381] as well as ancient carved cameos, [407] such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style, now in the Altes Museum, Berlin [1] Contemporary images of Cleopatra

perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra [409] [410]\n\n\nCoinage portraits\nSurviving coinage of Cleopatra's reign include specimens from every regnal year, from 51 to 30 BC [418] Cleopatra, the only Ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf, almost certainly inspired her partner Caesar to become the first living Roman to present his portrait on his own coins [415] [note 66] Cleopatra was the first foreign queen to have her image appear on Roman currency [419] Coins dated to the period of her marriage to Antony, which also bear his image, portray the queen as having a very similar aquiline nose and prominent chin as that of her husband [3] [420] These similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented the mutually-observed harmony of a royal couple [3] [2]\n\n\nGreco-Roman busts and heads\nOf the surviving Greco-Roman-style busts and heads of Cleopatra, [note 68] the sculpture known as the \"Berlin Cleopatra\", located in the Antikensammlung Berlin collection at the Altes Museum, possesses her full nose, whereas the head known as the \"Vatican Cleopatra\", located in the Vatican Museums, is damaged with a missing nose [429] [430] [431] [note 69] Both the Berlin Cleopatra and Vatican Cleopatra have royal diadems, similar facial features, and perhaps once resembled the face of her bronze statue housed in the Temple of Venus Genetrix [430] [432] [431] [note 70]\n\n\nPaintings\nIn the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, Italy, a mid-1st century BC Second Style wall painting of the goddess Venus holding a cupid near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra as Venus Genetrix with her son Caesarion [412] [438] The commission of the painting most likely coincides with the erection of the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Caesar in September 46 BC, where Caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting Cleopatra [412] [438] This statue likely formed the basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as this painting at Pompeii [412] [439]\n\n\nPortland Vase\nThe Portland Vase, a Roman cameo glass vase dated to the Augustan period and now in the British Museum, includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with Antony [449] [451] In this interpretation, Cleopatra can be seen grasping Antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent (i.e the asp) rises between her legs, Eros floats above, and Anton, the alleged ancestor of the Antonian family, looks on in despair as his descendant Antony is led to his doom [449] [450] The other side of the vase perhaps contains a scene of Octavia, abandoned by her husband Antony but watched over by her brother, the emperor Augustus [449] [450] The vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 BC, when Antony sent his wife Octavia back to Italy and stayed with Cleopatra in Alexandria [449]\n\n\nNative Egyptian art\nThe Bust of Cleopatra in the Royal Ontario Museum represents a bust of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style [452] Dated to the mid-1st century BC, it is perhaps the earliest depiction of Cleopatra as both a goddess and ruling pharaoh of Egypt [452] The sculpture also has pronounced eyes that share similarities with Roman copies of Ptolemaic sculpted works of art [453] The Dendera Temple complex, near Dendera, Egypt, contains Egyptian-style carved relief images along the exterior walls of the Temple of Hathor depicting Cleopatra and her young son Caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making offerings to the gods [454] [455] Augustus had his name inscribed there following the death of Cleopatra [454] [456]\n\n\nMedieval and Early Modern reception\nIn modern times Cleopatra has become an icon of popular culture, [381] a reputation shaped by theatrical representations dating back to the Renaissance as well as paintings and films [461] This material largely surpasses the scope and size of existent historiographic literature about her from classical antiquity and has made a greater impact on the general public's view of Cleopatra than the latter [462] The 14th-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer, in The Legend of Good Women, contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian world of the Middle Ages [463] His depiction of Cleopatra and Antony, her shining knight engaged in courtly love, has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire [463]\n\n\nModern depictions and brand imaging\nIn Victorian Britain, Cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture and her image was used to market various household products, including oil lamps, lithographs, postcards and cigarettes [474] Fictional novels such as H Rider Haggard's Cleopatra (1889) and Théophile Gautier's One of Cleopatra's Nights (1838) depicted the queen as a sensual and mystic Easterner, while the Egyptologist Georg Ebers's Cleopatra (1894) was more grounded in historical accuracy [474] [475] The French dramatist Victorien Sardou and Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw produced plays about Cleopatra, while burlesque shows such as F C Burnand's Antony and Cleopatra offered satirical depictions of the queen connecting her and the environment she lived in with the modern age [476]\n\n\nWritten works\nWhereas myths about Cleopatra persist in popular media, important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed, such as her command of naval forces and administrative acts Publications on ancient Greek medicine attributed to her are, likely to be the work of a physician by the same name writing in the late first century AD [489] Ingrid D Rowland, who highlights that the \"Berenice called Cleopatra\" cited by the 3rd- or 4th-century female Roman physician Metrodora was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to Cleopatra [490] Only fragments exist of these medical and cosmetic writings, such as those preserved by Galen, including remedies for hair disease, baldness, and dandruff, along with a list of weights and measures for pharmacological purposes [491] [18] [492] Aëtius of Amida attributed a recipe for perfumed soap to Cleopatra, while Paul of Aegina preserved alleged instructions of hers for dyeing and curling hair [491]\n\n\nAncestry\nCleopatra belonged to the Macedonian Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies, [7] [494] [495] [note 79] their European origins tracing back to northern Greece [496] Through her father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, she was a descendant of two prominent companions of Alexander the Great of Macedon: the general Ptolemy I Soter, founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, and Seleucus I Nicator, the Macedonian Greek founder of the Seleucid Empire of West Asia [7] [497] [498] [note 80] While Cleopatra's paternal line can be traced, the identity of her mother is uncertain [499] [500] [501] [note 81] She was presumably the daughter of Cleopatra V Tryphaena, [note 3] the sister-wife of Ptolemy XII who had previously given birth to their daughter Berenice IV [12] [500] [502] [note 82]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nOnline\n\n\nPrint\n\n\nFurther

As the leader of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, she was a member of the Macedonian Greek dynasty. Her reign was marked by a series of complex relationships with powerful Roman leaders, including Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, as well as her involvement in the Battle of Actium.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the Ancient Greek Kleopátra (Κλεοπάτρα), meaning \"glory of her father\", from κλέος (kléos, \"glory\") and πατήρ (patḗr, \"father\"). The masculine form would have been written either as Kleópatros (Κλεόπατρος) or Pátroklos (Πάτροκλος). Cleopatra was the name of Alexander the Great's sister Cleopatra of Macedonia, as well as the wife of Meleager in Greek mythology, Cleopatra Alcyone. Through the marriage of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I Syra (a Seleucid princess), the name entered the Ptolemaic dynasty. Cleopatra's adopted title Theá Philopátōra (Θεᾱ́ Φιλοπάτωρα) means \"goddess who loves her father\".\n\n**Background**\n\nPtolemaic pharaohs were crowned by the Egyptian high priest of Ptah at Memphis, but resided in the multicultural and largely Greek city of Alexandria, established by Alexander the Great. They spoke Greek and governed Egypt as Hellenistic Greek monarchs, refusing to learn the native Egyptian language. In contrast, Cleopatra could speak multiple languages by adulthood and was the first Ptolemaic ruler known to learn the Egyptian language. Plutarch implies that she also spoke Ethiopian, the language of the \"Troglodytes\", Hebrew (or Aramaic), Arabic, the Syrian language (perhaps Syriac), Median, and Parthian, and she could apparently also speak Latin, although her Roman contemporaries would have preferred to speak with her in her native Koine Greek.\n\n**Biography**\n\nCleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother, presumably Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena). The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV, were born in the absence of his wife. Cleopatra's childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy. During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria.\n\n**Reign and Exile of Ptolemy XII**\n\nIn 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus argued before the Roman Senate that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt, but his proposed bill and the similar bill of tribune Servilius Rullus in 63 BC were rejected. Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering remuneration and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen, such as Pompey during his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and eventually Julius Caesar after he became Roman consul in 59 BC. However, Ptolemy XII's profligate behavior bankrupted him, and he was forced to acquire loans from the Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus.\n\n**Accession to the Throne**\n\nPtolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, when Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion. Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne, including famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual flooding of the Nile, and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani, the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt.\n\n**Assassination of Pompey**\n\nIn the summer of 49 BC, Cleopatra and her forces were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompey's son Gnaeus Pompeius arrived, seeking military aid on behalf of his father. After returning to Italy from the wars in Gaul and crossing the Rubicon in January of 49 BC, Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to flee to Greece. In perhaps their last joint decree, both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeius's request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops, including the Gabiniani, a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome.\n\n**Relationship with Julius Caesar**\n\nPtolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army, in clear defiance of Caesar's demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival. Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar, but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women, she came to Alexandria to see him personally. Historian Cassius Dio records that she did so without informing her brother, dressed in an attractive manner, and charmed Caesar with her wit. Plutarch provides an entirely different account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar.\n\n**Liberators' Civil War**\n\nOctavian, Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC, in which they were each elected for five-year terms to restore order in the Republic and bring Caesar's assassins to justice. Cleopatra received messages from both Gaius Cassius Longinus, one of Caesar's assassins, and Publius Cornelius Dolabella, proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist, requesting military aid. She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems, while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella. These troops were captured by Cassius in Palestine.\n\n**Relationship with Mark Antony**\n\nCleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos, which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC. Antony was well received by the populace of Alexandria, both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done. In Egypt, Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra's ship docked at Tarsos. He also had his subordinates, such as Publius Ventidius Bassus, drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria.\n\n**Donations of Alexandria**\n\nAs Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC, this time aimed at their ally Armenia, Octavia traveled to Athens with 2,000 troops in alleged support of Antony, but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass him for his military losses. Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch, only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria. When Octavia returned to Rome, Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony, although she refused to leave Antony's household.\n\n**Battle of Actium**\n\nIn a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1 January 33 BC, Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen. Before Antony and Octavian's joint imperium expired on 31 December 33 BC, Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian. In 32 BC, the Antonian loyalists Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus became consuls. The former gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian, now a private citizen without public office, and introduced pieces of legislation against him. During the next senatorial session, Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls.\n\n**Downfall and Death**\n\nWhile Octavian occupied Athens, Antony and Cleopatra landed at Paraitonion in Egypt. The couple then went their separate ways, Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra to the harbor at Alexandria in an attempt to mislead the oppositional party and portray the activities in Greece as a victory. It is uncertain whether or not, at this time, she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival, Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, in an attempt to strike an alliance with him.\n\n**Cleopatra's Kingdom and Role as a Monarch**\n\nFollowing the tradition of Macedonian rulers, Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an absolute monarch, serving as the sole lawgiver of her kingdom.

She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods, a synagogue for the Jews in Egypt, and even built the Caesareum of Alexandria, dedicated to the cult worship of her patron and lover Julius Caesar.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nAfter her suicide, Cleopatra's three surviving children, Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus, were sent to Rome with Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger, a former wife of their father, as their guardian. Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC. The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point. Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II, son of Juba I, whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I's support of Pompey.\n\n**Roman Literature and Historiography**\n\nAlthough almost 50 ancient works of Roman historiography mention Cleopatra, these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium, her suicide, and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies.

Asian territories that once belonged to the Ptolemaic Kingdom [22]\n\n\nBiography\nCleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother, [32] [33] [note 14] presumably Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena), [34] [35] [36] [note 15] [note 3] the mother of Cleopatra's older sister, Berenice IV Epiphaneia [37] [38] [39] [note 16] Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC [40] [41] The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV, [37] [38] [39] were born in the absence of his wife [42] [43] Cleopatra's childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy [44] During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria [45] [46]\n\n\nEarly

[44] During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria [45] [46]\n\n\nReign and exile of Ptolemy XII\nIn 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus argued before the Roman Senate that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt, but his proposed bill and the similar bill of tribune Servilius Rullus in 63 BC were rejected [49] [50] Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering remuneration and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen, such as Pompey during his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and eventually Julius Caesar after he became Roman consul in 59 BC [51] [52] [53] [note 18] However, Ptolemy XII's profligate behavior bankrupted him, and he was forced to acquire loans from the Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus [54] [55] [56]\n\n\nReign\nPtolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, when Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion [90] [91] [92] [note 28] Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual flooding of the Nile, and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani, the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt [93] [94] Inheriting her father's debts, Cleopatra also owed the Roman Republic 17.5 million drachmas [95]\n\n\nAccession to the throne\nPtolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, when Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion [90] [91] [92] [note 28] Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne These included famine caused by drought and a low level

father's debts, Cleopatra also owed the Roman Republic 17.5 million drachmas [95]\n\n\nAssassination of Pompey\nIn the summer of 49 BC, Cleopatra and her forces were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompey's son Gnaeus Pompeius arrived, seeking military aid on behalf of his father [106] After returning to Italy from the wars in Gaul and crossing the Rubicon in January of 49 BC, Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to flee to Greece [108] [109] In perhaps their last joint decree, both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeius's request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops, including the Gabiniani, a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome [108] [110] Losing the fight against her brother, Cleopatra was then forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes [111] [112] [113] By the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra had traveled to Roman Syria with her younger sister, Arsinoe IV, to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt [114] [107] [115] She returned with an army, but her advance to Alexandria was blocked by her brother's forces, including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her, so she camped outside Pelousion in the eastern Nile Delta [116] [107] [117]\n\n\nRelationship with Julius Caesar\nPtolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army, in clear defiance of Caesar's demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival [128] [129] Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar, but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women, she came to Alexandria to see him personally [128] [130] [129] Historian Cassius Dio records that she did so without informing her brother, dressed in an attractive manner, and charmed Caesar with her wit [128] [131] [132] Plutarch provides an entirely different account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar [128] [133] [134] [note 35]\n\n\nLiberators' civil war\nOctavian, Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC, in which they were each elected for five-year terms to restore order in the Republic and bring Caesar's assassins to justice [196] [197] Cleopatra received messages from both Gaius Cassius Longinus, one of Caesar's assassins, and Publius Cornelius Dolabella, proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist, requesting military aid [196] She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems, while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella [196] [198] These troops were captured by Cassius in Palestine [196] [198]\n\n\nRelationship with Mark Antony\nCleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos, which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC [207] [210] Antony was well received by the populace of Alexandria, both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done [211] [212] In Egypt, Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra's ship docked at Tarsos [213] [209] He also had his subordinates, such as Publius Ventidius Bassus, drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria [212] [214] [215] [note 48]\n\n\nDonations of Alexandria\nAs Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC, this time aimed at their ally Armenia, Octavia traveled to Athens with 2,000 troops in alleged support of Antony, but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass him for his military losses [257] [258] [note 51] Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch, only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria [257] [258] When Octavia returned to Rome Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony, although she refused to leave Antony's household [259] [218] Octavian's confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west, including Sextus Pompeius and even Lepidus, the third member of the triumvirate, who was placed under house arrest after revolting against Octavian in Sicily [259] [218] [253]\n\n\nBattle of Actium\nIn a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1 January 33 BC, Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen [281] Before Antony and Octavian's joint imperium expired on 31 December 33 BC, Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian [281] In 32 BC, the Antonian loyalists Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus became consuls The former gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian, now a private citizen without public office, and introduced pieces of legislation against him [280] [282] During the next senatorial session, Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls [280] [283] Intimidated by this act, the consuls and over 200 senators still in support of Antony fled Rome the next day to join the side of Antony [280] [283] [284]\n\n\nDownfall and death\nWhile Octavian occupied Athens, Antony and Cleopatra landed at Paraitonion in Egypt [300] [304] The couple then went their separate ways, Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra to the harbor at Alexandria in an attempt to mislead the oppositional party and portray the activities in Greece as a victory [300] She was afraid that news about the outcome of the battle of Actium would lead to a rebellion [305] It is uncertain whether or not, at this time, she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival, Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, in an attempt to strike an alliance with him [306] [307]\n\n\nCleopatra's kingdom and role as a monarch\nFollowing the tradition of Macedonian rulers, Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an absolute monarch, serving as the sole lawgiver of her kingdom [353] She was the chief religious authority in her realm, presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the Egyptian and Greek polytheistic faiths [354] She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods, [355] a synagogue for the Jews in Egypt, and even built the Caesareum of Alexandria, dedicated to the cult worship of her patron and lover Julius Caesar [356] [357]\n\n\nLegacy\nAfter her suicide, Cleopatra's three surviving children, Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus, were sent to Rome with Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger, a former wife of their father, as their guardian [369] [370] Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC [369] [239] The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point [369] [239] Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II, son of Juba I, whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I's support of Pompey [371] [370] [325]\n\n\nChildren and successors\nAfter her suicide, Cleopatra's three surviving children, Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus, were sent to Rome with Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger, a former wife of their father, as their guardian [369] [370] Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC [369] [239] The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point [369] [239] Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II, son of Juba I, whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I's support of Pompey [371] [370] [325]\n\n\nRoman literature and historiography\nAlthough almost 50 ancient works of Roman historiography mention Cleopatra, these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium, her suicide, and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies [382] Despite not being a biography of Cleopatra, the Life of Antonius written by Plutarch in the 1st century AD provides the most thorough surviving account of Cleopatra's life [383] [384] [385] Plutarch lived a century after Cleopatra but relied on primary sources, such as Philotas of Amphissa, who had access to the Ptolemaic royal palace, Cleopatra's personal physician named Olympos, and Quintus Dellius, a close confidant of Mark Antony and Cleopatra [386] Plutarch's work included both the Augustan view of Cleopatra—which became canonical for his period—as well as sources outside of this tradition, such as eyewitness reports [383] [385]\n\n\nCultural depictions\nCleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the Egyptian as well as Hellenistic-Greek and Roman styles [2] Surviving works include statues, busts, reliefs, and minted coins, [2] [381] as well as ancient carved cameos, [407] such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style, now in the Altes Museum, Berlin [1] Contemporary images of Cleopatra were produced both in and outside of Ptolemaic Egypt For instance, there was once a large gilded bronze statue of Cleopatra inside the Temple of Venus Genetrix in Rome, the first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a Roman temple [3] [185] [408] It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra [409] [410]\n\n\nDepictions in ancient art\nCleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the Egyptian as well as Hellenistic-Greek and Roman styles [2] Surviving works include statues, busts, reliefs, and minted coins, [2] [381] as well as ancient carved cameos, [407] such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style,

in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra [409] [410]\n\n\nStatues\nCleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the Egyptian as well as Hellenistic-Greek and Roman styles [2] Surviving works include statues, busts, reliefs, and minted coins, [2] [381] as well as ancient carved cameos, [407] such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style, now in the Altes Museum, Berlin [1] Contemporary images of Cleopatra

person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a Roman temple [3] [185] [408] It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra [409] [410]\n\n\nCoinage portraits\nSurviving coinage of Cleopatra's reign include specimens from every regnal year, from 51 to 30 BC [418] Cleopatra, the only Ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf, almost certainly inspired her partner Caesar to become the first living Roman to present his portrait on his own coins [415] [note 66] Cleopatra was the first foreign queen to have her image appear on Roman currency [419] Coins dated to the period of her marriage to Antony, which also bear his image, portray the queen as having a very similar aquiline nose and prominent chin as that of her husband [3] [420] These similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented the mutually-observed harmony of a royal couple [3] [2]\n\n\nGreco-Roman busts and heads\nOf the surviving Greco-Roman-style busts and heads of Cleopatra, [note 68] the sculpture known as the \"Berlin Cleopatra\", located in the Antikensammlung Berlin collection at the Altes Museum, possesses her full nose, whereas the head known as the \"Vatican Cleopatra\", located in the Vatican Museums, is damaged with a missing nose [429] [430] [431] [note 69] Both the Berlin Cleopatra and Vatican Cleopatra have royal diadems, similar facial features, and perhaps once resembled the face of her bronze statue housed in the Temple of Venus Genetrix [430] [432] [431] [note 70]\n\n\nPaintings\nIn the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, Italy, a mid-1st century BC Second Style wall painting of the goddess Venus holding a cupid near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra as Venus Genetrix with her son Caesarion [412] [438] The commission of the painting most likely coincides with the erection of the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Caesar in September 46 BC, where Caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting Cleopatra [412] [438] This statue likely formed the basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as this painting at Pompeii [412] [439]\n\n\nPortland Vase\nThe Portland Vase, a Roman cameo glass vase dated to the Augustan period and now in the British Museum, includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with Antony [449] [451] In this interpretation, Cleopatra can be seen grasping Antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent (i.e the asp) rises between her legs, Eros floats above, and Anton, the alleged ancestor of the Antonian family, looks on in despair as his descendant Antony is led to his doom [449] [450] The other side of the vase perhaps contains a scene of Octavia, abandoned by her husband Antony but watched over by her brother, the emperor Augustus [449] [450] The vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 BC, when Antony sent his wife Octavia back to Italy and stayed with Cleopatra in Alexandria [449]\n\n\nNative Egyptian art\nThe Bust of Cleopatra in the Royal Ontario Museum represents a bust of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style [452] Dated to the mid-1st century BC, it is perhaps the earliest depiction of Cleopatra as both a goddess and ruling pharaoh of Egypt [452] The sculpture also has pronounced eyes that share similarities with Roman copies of Ptolemaic sculpted works of art [453] The Dendera Temple complex, near Dendera, Egypt, contains Egyptian-style carved relief images along the exterior walls of the Temple of Hathor depicting Cleopatra and her young son Caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making offerings to the gods [454] [455] Augustus had his name inscribed there following the death of Cleopatra [454] [456]\n\n\nMedieval and Early Modern reception\nIn modern times Cleopatra has become an icon of popular culture, [381] a reputation shaped by theatrical representations dating back to the Renaissance as well as paintings and films [461] This material largely surpasses the scope and size of existent historiographic literature about her from classical antiquity and has made a greater impact on the general public's view of Cleopatra than the latter [462] The 14th-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer, in The Legend of Good Women, contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian world of the Middle Ages [463] His depiction of Cleopatra and Antony, her shining knight engaged in courtly love, has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire [463]\n\n\nModern depictions and brand imaging\nIn Victorian Britain, Cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture and her image was used to market various household products, including oil lamps, lithographs, postcards and cigarettes [474] Fictional novels such as H Rider Haggard's Cleopatra (1889) and Théophile Gautier's One of Cleopatra's Nights (1838) depicted the queen as a sensual and mystic Easterner, while the Egyptologist Georg Ebers's Cleopatra (1894) was more grounded in historical accuracy [474] [475] The French dramatist Victorien Sardou and Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw produced plays about Cleopatra, while burlesque shows such as F C Burnand's Antony and Cleopatra offered satirical depictions of the queen connecting her and the environment she lived in with the modern age [476]\n\n\nWritten works\nWhereas myths about Cleopatra persist in popular media, important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed, such as her command of naval forces and administrative acts Publications on ancient Greek medicine attributed to her are, likely to be the work of a physician by the same name writing in the late first century AD [489] Ingrid D Rowland, who highlights that the \"Berenice called Cleopatra\" cited by the 3rd- or 4th-century female Roman physician Metrodora was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to Cleopatra [490] Only fragments exist of these medical and cosmetic writings, such as those preserved by Galen, including remedies for hair disease, baldness, and dandruff, along with a list of weights and measures for pharmacological purposes [491] [18] [492] Aëtius of Amida attributed a recipe for perfumed soap to Cleopatra, while Paul of Aegina preserved alleged instructions of hers for dyeing and curling hair [491]\n\n\nAncestry\nCleopatra belonged to the Macedonian Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies, [7] [494] [495] [note 79] their European origins tracing back to northern Greece [496] Through her father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, she was a descendant of two prominent companions of Alexander the Great of Macedon: the general Ptolemy I Soter, founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, and Seleucus I Nicator, the Macedonian Greek founder of the Seleucid Empire of West Asia [7] [497] [498] [note 80] While Cleopatra's paternal line can be traced, the identity of her mother is uncertain [499] [500] [501] [note 81] She was presumably the daughter of Cleopatra V Tryphaena, [note 3] the sister-wife of Ptolemy XII who had previously given birth to their daughter Berenice IV [12] [500] [502] [note 82]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nOnline\n\n\nPrint\n\n\nFurther

{"title": "Sa'd_ibn_Abi_Waqqas", "content": "\nHistory\nSa'd was one of the first to accept Islam [6] [1] He was seventeen years old when he accepted Islam, although Ibn Abd al-Barr reported that Sa'd embraced it at age nineteen [7] It was said by Ibn Ishaq that Sa'd was one of several individuals invited to Islam by Abu Bakr [8] Sa'd's mother opposed her son's conversion and threatened to go on a hunger strike until he left Islam, but he did not heed her threat and she finally yielded due to his insistence Chroniclers reported that Muhammad told Sa'd that God praised his firmness in his faith, but also told him to be kinder to his mother, as filial piety is an important virtue in Islam [4] [9] Sa'd's brother Amir also converted, prompting their mother to undergo another hunger strike, which likewise failed to deter her son [4]\n\n\nEarly life in Medina\nAs Sa'd and his siblings arrived in Medina, they immediately pledged allegiance to Muhammad The Meccan migrants were termed muhajirun, while the local inhabitants of Medina were known as the Ansar While in Medina, Sa'd was involved in most of the military operations mounted by the Muslims against the Quraysh of Mecca His first operation occurred nine months after the migration, when he was tasked with leading 20 men to raid a Qurayshi caravan that passed Kharrar, located between Al-Juhfa and Mecca This expedition failed, as the caravan escaped [14]\n\n\nBattle of Badr\nDuring the march to Badr, Muhammad sent Sa'd, Ali, and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam to scout the enemy's movements, [3] as the Muslim army that marched from Medina originally intended to capture the rich caravan of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb instead of facing the main forces of the Meccan Quraysh under Abu Jahl ibn Hisham.\n\n\nProtecting Muhammad in Uhud\nAt the Battle of Uhud, Sa'd served in an archer regiment As the Muslim army gained the upper hand, they were routed by a flanking maneuver by Khalid ibn al-Walid The Muslim forces scattered, and Muhammad was separated from his soldiers except for about a dozen men, including Sa'd, the muhajirun warrior Talha, the Medinan swordsman Abu Dujana, and about six or seven Ansari soldiers [9] The group was surrounded by enemy cavalry under Khalid as the Muslim fighters formed a close defensive formation and Sa'd shot his arrows next to Muhammad, who suffered an injury to his shoulder [9] The outnumbered and encircled Muslims fought until most of them were killed, except Muhammad, Talhah, Abu Dujana, and Sa'd, who tried to assist his comrades with his bow, despite the close combat [9] [note 2] Sa'd resorted to firing multiple arrows at once in the dire situation [5]\n\n\nAfter Uhud until the Ridda Wars\nAlong with Abu Bakr, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Bilal ibn Rabah, Abbad ibn Bishr, and Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, [17] [18] Sa'd was a member of the Haras (personal bodyguard) unit of Muhammad [5] [9] [17] [18] When Muhammad and Aisha participated in military expeditions, Sa'd was the one who guarded their tent at night [9] [5]\n\n\nBattle of al-Qadisiyyah\nKhuzestan\n\n\nPre-battle activities\nAccording to Tabari's account, the Persian faction of the Sassanid civil war that steered the policies of the young Yazdegerd III was at odds with Rostam, the commander of the empire's most powerful army Rostam urged patience and protracted warfare instead of outright assault on the Arab troops and exchanged letters with Zuhra ibn Hawiyah with the intention of making peace Zuhra stated that if the Sassanids converted to Islam, the Arab armies would withdraw and return only to Persia as merchants Parvaneh Pourshariati speculates that this points to trade being a motivation behind the invasion of Persia Tabari's narrative states that Rostam was prepared to convert in order to avoid military confrontation, but other factions in the Sassanid government refused to agree to such terms, and battle became an inevitability [28]\n\n\nThe battle\nWhile the Battle of Qadisiyyah occupies an important place in Islamic history for its symbolism in Persia's fall to the Muslim army, Islamic sources provide little information about the battle itself, focusing instead on heroic tales of fighters and tribes Modern scholars hold that most details in works like al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings consist of embellishments, with narrators recounting legendary tales of their fellow tribesmen, such as Sayf ibn Umar's emphasis on the heroics of al-Qa'qa, both of them members of the Banu Tamim [28] The date of the battle and the size of the forces involved both vary from source to source; modern historians only assert that the Sassanids outnumbered the invaders Scholars have proposed that the battle took place in 636 or 637, with some suggesting an earlier date of 634 or 635 While the details of the battle are unlikely to be historically accurate, the different versions of the battle do share a few commonalities, including the absence of Sa'd himself from the battlefield, attributed to hemorrhoids [5] or pox [29] in various sources, and the death of the enemy commander Rostam [37] Al-Tabari's account of the fighting has formed the basis for many modern-day attempts to reconstruct the events of the battle.\n\n\nCrossing of Tigris and conquest of Ctesiphon\nShortly after the victory in Qadisiyyah, [note 9] Sa'd commanded his forces to march again, as he aimed to subdue the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon He rearranged his army again to the five-division formation [43] He appointed Zuhra ibn Hawiyah to the vanguard, which marched first to the north, and replaced Khalid ibn Arfatha with Hashim ibn Utbah, his step-nephew, as his deputy Khalid was reappointed as the rear guard commander [29] As the vanguard reached Borsippa, Zuhra defeated the remnants of Sassanid army under Busbuhra in the Battle of Burs [29] Sa'd met a force of Firuzan, which the caliphate army defeated easily [29] Then the forces under Sa'd marched again until they met more Sassanid resistance in Sawad [29] The Sasanids were defeated after their leader, Syahriyar, was defeated in a duel by a Muslim soldier named Abu Nabatah Naim al-Raji, who was given the crown and bracelets of Syahriyar as spoils of war [29]\n\n\nWealth of Yazdegerd\nWhen the whole army had crossed the river, they immediately chased after the Sassanids who had fled to al-Mada'in [30] [45] [9] The army was unable to find them, and Yazdegerd had evacuated his entire family and much of his property from the city [9] [29] The army managed to secure al-Mada'in's treasury, and also found Yazdegerd's crown and gown in a sack loaded on a mule They were immediately confiscated by Zuhra, who brought them to Sa'd [29]\n\n\nGovernorate in Kufa\nShortly after Sa'd conquered al-Mada'in, Umar ordered him to stabilize the conquered area before chasing down the Sassanid forces that fled to the mountains [36]\n\n\nFounding of Kufa\nAfter the Arab armies had settled in al-Mada'in, Umar learned that many of the soldiers who had settled in Iraq were ill The soldiers reported that they were sick because they resided \"in a place that was not fit for camels\" Later historians theorized that the soldiers in al-Mada'in became sick because they were not used to the non-desert climate of al-Mada'in, which was characterized by medieval chroniclers as a highly urbanized megalopolis with dense forest features [citation needed] Umar sent Ammar ibn Yasir and Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman to assist in Iraq and began searching places fit for the Arab army's settlement Utbah ibn Ghazwan and Arfajah built a garrison town in Basra, while Sa'd moved towards what would become Kufa [29] He transported and dismantled walls and military structures from al-Mada'in to build a new garrison city or misr [53] The new misr was formally called Jund al-Kufah, which was a complex for the Muslim soldiers who settled in that area permanently along with their families Sa'd made Kufa his permanent headquarters [53]\n\n\nDismissal from command\nIn 638, Umar sent Muhammad ibn Maslamah to Kufa, as he heard of scandals involving Sa'd Sa'd, the governor of Kufa, had built a public citadel next to his own house The noise from the nearby market was so deafening that Sa'd had locked the gate to the citadel, which prompted the caliph to send ibn Maslamah to destroy the gate, which he did by setting fire to it [55] [better source needed] He refused all of Sa'd's offers of hospitality, and handed him a missive from Umar reminding him that the citadel should be available to the public, suggesting that he move his house According to Asad Ahmed, the caliph also dispatched several intelligence officers, including a spy named Hashim ibn Walid ibn al-Mughira, to investigate Sa'd's conduct They found unanimous support and positive impressions from the Kufa residents towards Sa'd, except from the tribes of Bajila [50] and Abs [50] [5]\n\n\nFirst Muslim civil wars\nWhen the First Fitna broke out, Sa'd convinced many surviving Companions of Muhammad, including Ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar, Muhammad ibn Maslamah, Anas ibn Malik, Al-Qa'qa' ibn Amr al-Tamimi, and Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, to remain neutral in the strife [4] [9] Sa'd, along with ibn Umar and ibn Maslamah, rejected pleas for assistance from the factions during the war [58] Many resented this extremely influential yet pacifistic faction led by Sa'd, as some thought their inactivity during the strife prevented a decisive result in the conflict Sa'd's son Umar ibn Sa'd was one of his father's critics [58]\n\n\nLegacy\nAs a figure with a long career in early Islamic history and its conquests, Sa'd left a rich legacy as a military figure and as an honored companion of Muhammad; legends surrounding him served as influences on China's Islamic tradition Sa'd's characterization as a hero of Islam and the Arabs was used by Saddam Hussein to link himself to the conqueror of Iraq [60]\n\n\nIslamic scholarship\nOthers\n\n\nArchitecture\nSa'd is credited with the foundation of the city of Kufa adjacent to Al-Hirah, which was founded by the Lakhmid king Al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir The main roads of Kufa were twenty yards wide and thirty to forty-five feet long According to Imamuddin, the town reached its zenith during the time of Umar, who called it Ras Islam [65] It was originally built as a permanent settlement for the Muslim army in Iraq [29] Sa'd had many public service structures built in the city, such as a canal named after him and a congregational mosque constructed for Friday prayers It could accommodate 40,000 people and had a wide veranda 100 yards long in front of the congregational hall [65] Its Dar al Imara structure was located south of its qibla wall [66] The Kufa grand mosque had later historical significance, as it became the place where the Hasan–Muawiya treaty occurred, where Hassan ibn Ali abdicated the position of caliph and recognized Mu'awiyah as the next caliph [67]\n\n\nMilitary\nIslamic scholars praise Sa'd for his two most important battles in Iraq: the battle of Qadisiyyah and the pacification of Ctesiphon [68] [27] [69] Bashamil considered the battle of al-Qadisiyyah the beginning of the permanent entrenchment of the caliphate's presence in Iraq, as almost all Iraqi cities that broke away from the caliphate when Khalid ibn al-Walid departed immediately succumbed to Sa'd [29] Sayf ibn Umar highlighted the effects of the battle beyond Iraq and Persian soils, reporting that the Arab tribe in Aden Abyan, Yemen, closely monitored the outcome in al-Qadisiyyah, believing that the result of the battle would even affect Yemen [29] [50]\n\n\nAlleged visit to Asia\nSa'd has been traditionally credited by Hui Muslims with introducing Islam to China According to their tradition, Sa'd came to China as an ambassador in 650 during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang [70] [71] The 17th century Hui scholar Liu Ch'ih instead credited Sa'd with introducing Islam to China in 616 after he moved to China from Abyssinia [72]\n\n\nDescription\nSa'd was born in Mecca in 595 His father was Abu Waqqas Malik ibn Uhayb ibn Abd Manaf ibn Zuhrah from the Banu Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe [6] [78] Sa'd's mother was Hamnah bint Sufyan ibn Umayya ibn Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf [79] Sa'd was related to Muhammad, whose mother Aminah came from the Banu Zuhrah Sa'd had many children, including sons named Umar and Amir and a daughter named A'isha [69]\n\n\nLeadership\nDuring his tenure as the commander of the army in Iraq, Sa'd was a strategic command figure, a far cry from his younger days during the era of Muhammad as frontline hero Imamuddin regarded Sa'd as wise ruler during his governorate in Iraq [80] Asad Q Ahmed remarks that Sa'd was politically astute during his duty in Iraq as he engaged in active roles against Umar over financial and political matters [81]\n\n\nRelations with the Caliphs\nAbu Bakr trusted Sa'd as one his personal guards, and Sa'd played a significant role during the first stage of the Ridda Wars, such as defending Medina [21] and the pacification of Dumat al Jandal [3]\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\n\nDescendants\nSa'd's descendants gained some degree of influence within the caliphate's political sphere, particularly within the late Rashidun and early Umayyad eras.\n\n\nEarly caliphate\nAccording to Asad Q Ahmed, Sa'd's clan was closely related to the southern Arabs, their main allies Sa'd had children from two Kinda women The first was Mawiyyah bint Qays, who bore him three daughters and two sons The second was Umm Hilal bint Rabi', a daughter of a war camel breeder in Kufa; she bore Sa'd three children Sa'd also married Makita bint Amr of the Banu Bahra' clan of the Quda'a tribe, which claimed descent from Ma'ad ibn Adnan Makita bore four children Another wife, Salma bint Khasafah, bore him six children He had at least eight more wives from various tribes [81]\n\n\nCaliphate of Cordoba\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad as-Sa'di al-Zuhri, better known as Ibn al-Iflili  [ar], was a 10th-century grammarian and linguist in the Caliphate of Córdoba According to the 13th century Syrian writer Yaqut al-Hamawi, Ibrahim was descended from Sa'd's son Khalid [88] According to Ibn Bashkuwal, Muhammad II of Córdoba appointed Ibn al-Iflili as a minister during his reign [89]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas\n\nSa'd ibn Abi Waqqas (592-674 CE) was a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a leading figure in the early Islamic community. He played a significant role in the military campaigns of the Rashidun Caliphate, including the conquest of Iraq and the battle of Qadisiyyah.\n\n## History\n\nSa'd was one of the first to accept Islam, converting at the age of 17. He was a member of the Banu Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe, and his father was Abu Waqqas Malik ibn Uhayb ibn Abd Manaf ibn Zuhrah. Sa'd's mother was Hamnah bint Sufyan ibn Umayya ibn Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf.\n\n## Early Life in Medina\n\nWhen Sa'd and his siblings arrived in Medina, they pledged allegiance to Muhammad. Sa'd was involved in most of the military operations mounted by the Muslims against the Quraysh of Mecca. His first operation occurred nine months after the migration, when he was tasked with leading 20 men to raid a Qurayshi caravan that passed Kharrar, located between Al-Juhfa and Mecca. The expedition failed, as the caravan escaped.\n\n## Battle of Badr\n\nDuring the march to Badr, Muhammad sent Sa'd, Ali, and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam to scout the enemy's movements. Sa'd served in an archer regiment at the Battle of Uhud. The Muslim army gained the upper hand, but they were routed by a flanking maneuver by Khalid ibn al-Walid. The Muslim forces scattered, and Muhammad was separated from his soldiers except for about a dozen men, including Sa'd, the muhajirun warrior Talha, the Medinan swordsman Abu Dujana, and about six or seven Ansari soldiers. Sa'd shot his arrows next to Muhammad, who suffered an injury to his shoulder.\n\n## After Uhud until the Ridda Wars\n\nSa'd was a member of the Haras (personal bodyguard) unit of Muhammad. He was a member of the military expeditions, and when Muhammad and Aisha participated in military expeditions, Sa'd guarded their tent at night. Sa'd was involved in the pacification of Dumat al Jandal and the battles in Iraq.\n\n## Battle of al-Qadisiyyah\n\nThe battle of Qadisiyyah is considered one of the most significant battles in Islamic history. Sa'd was a key figure in the battle, and he played a crucial role in the victory of the Muslim army. The battle marked the beginning of the permanent entrenchment of the caliphate's presence in Iraq.\n\n## Conquest of Ctesiphon\n\nAfter the victory in Qadisiyyah, Sa'd commanded his forces to march again, aiming to subdue the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon. He rearranged his army into a five-division formation and appointed Zuhra ibn Hawiyah to the vanguard. The vanguard defeated the remnants of the Sassanid army under Busbuhra in the Battle of Burs. Sa'd met a force of Firuzan, which the caliphate army defeated easily.\n\n## Governance in Kufa\n\nSa'd conquered al-Mada'in, and Umar ordered him to stabilize the conquered area before chasing down the Sassanid forces that fled to the mountains.

first to accept Islam [6] [1] He was seventeen years old when he accepted Islam, although Ibn Abd al-Barr reported that Sa'd embraced it at age nineteen [7] It was said by Ibn Ishaq that Sa'd was one of several individuals invited to Islam by Abu Bakr [8] Sa'd's mother opposed her son's conversion and threatened to go on a hunger strike until he left Islam, but he did not heed her threat and she finally yielded due to his insistence Chroniclers reported that Muhammad told Sa'd that God praised his firmness in his faith, but also told him to be kinder to his mother, as filial piety is an important virtue in Islam [4] [9] Sa'd's brother Amir also converted, prompting their mother to undergo another hunger strike, which likewise failed to deter her son [4]\n\n\nEarly life in Medina\nAs Sa'd and his siblings arrived in Medina, they immediately pledged allegiance to Muhammad The Meccan migrants were termed muhajirun, while the local inhabitants of Medina were known as the Ansar While in Medina, Sa'd was involved in most of the military operations mounted by the Muslims against the Quraysh of Mecca His first operation occurred nine months after the migration, when he was tasked with leading 20 men to raid a Qurayshi caravan that passed Kharrar, located between Al-Juhfa and Mecca This expedition failed, as the caravan escaped [14]\n\n\nBattle of Badr\nDuring the march to Badr, Muhammad sent Sa'd, Ali, and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam to scout the enemy's movements, [3] as the Muslim army that marched from Medina originally intended to capture the rich caravan of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb instead of facing the main forces of the Meccan Quraysh under Abu Jahl ibn Hisham.\n\n\nProtecting Muhammad in Uhud\nAt the Battle of Uhud, Sa'd served in an archer regiment As the Muslim army gained the upper hand, they were routed by a flanking maneuver by Khalid ibn al-Walid The Muslim forces scattered, and Muhammad was separated from his soldiers except for about a dozen men, including Sa'd, the muhajirun warrior Talha, the Medinan swordsman Abu Dujana, and about six or seven Ansari soldiers [9] The group was surrounded by enemy cavalry under Khalid as the Muslim fighters formed a close defensive formation and Sa'd shot his arrows next to Muhammad, who suffered an injury to his shoulder [9] The outnumbered and encircled Muslims fought until most of them were killed, except Muhammad, Talhah, Abu Dujana, and Sa'd, who tried to assist his comrades with his bow, despite the close combat [9] [note 2] Sa'd resorted to firing multiple arrows at once in the dire situation [5]\n\n\nAfter Uhud until the Ridda Wars\nAlong with Abu Bakr, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Bilal ibn Rabah, Abbad ibn Bishr, and Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, [17] [18] Sa'd was a member of the Haras (personal bodyguard) unit of Muhammad [5] [9] [17] [18] When Muhammad and Aisha participated in military expeditions, Sa'd was the one who guarded their tent at night [9] [5]\n\n\nBattle of al-Qadisiyyah\nKhuzestan\n\n\nPre-battle activities\nAccording to Tabari's account, the Persian faction of the Sassanid civil war that steered the policies of the young Yazdegerd III was at odds with Rostam, the commander of the empire's most powerful army Rostam urged patience and protracted warfare instead of outright assault on the Arab troops and exchanged letters with Zuhra ibn Hawiyah with the intention of making peace Zuhra stated that if the Sassanids converted to Islam, the Arab armies would withdraw and return only to Persia as merchants Parvaneh Pourshariati speculates that this points to trade being a motivation behind the invasion of Persia Tabari's narrative states that Rostam was prepared to convert in order to avoid military confrontation, but other factions in the Sassanid government refused to agree to such terms, and battle became an inevitability [28]\n\n\nThe battle\nWhile the Battle of Qadisiyyah occupies an important place in Islamic history for its symbolism in Persia's fall to the Muslim army, Islamic sources provide little information about the battle itself, focusing instead on heroic tales of fighters and tribes Modern scholars hold that most details in works like al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings consist of embellishments, with narrators recounting legendary tales of their fellow tribesmen, such as Sayf ibn Umar's emphasis on the heroics of al-Qa'qa, both of them members of the Banu Tamim [28] The date of the battle and the size of the forces involved both vary from source to source; modern historians only assert that the Sassanids outnumbered the invaders Scholars have proposed that the battle took place in 636 or 637, with some suggesting an earlier date of 634 or 635 While the details of the battle are unlikely to be historically accurate, the different versions of the battle do share a few commonalities, including the absence of Sa'd himself from the battlefield, attributed to hemorrhoids [5] or pox [29] in various sources, and the death of the enemy commander Rostam [37] Al-Tabari's account of the fighting has formed the basis for many modern-day attempts to reconstruct the events of the battle.\n\n\nCrossing of Tigris and conquest of Ctesiphon\nShortly after the victory in Qadisiyyah, [note 9] Sa'd commanded his forces to march again, as he aimed to subdue the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon He rearranged his army again to the five-division formation [43] He appointed Zuhra ibn Hawiyah to the vanguard, which marched first to the north, and replaced Khalid ibn Arfatha with Hashim ibn Utbah, his step-nephew, as his deputy Khalid was reappointed as the rear guard commander [29] As the vanguard reached Borsippa, Zuhra defeated the remnants of Sassanid army under Busbuhra in the Battle of Burs [29] Sa'd met a force of Firuzan, which the caliphate army defeated easily [29] Then the forces under Sa'd marched again until they met more Sassanid resistance in Sawad [29] The Sasanids were defeated after their leader, Syahriyar, was defeated in a duel by a Muslim soldier named Abu Nabatah Naim al-Raji, who was given the crown and bracelets of Syahriyar as spoils of war [29]\n\n\nWealth of Yazdegerd\nWhen the whole army had crossed the river, they immediately chased after the Sassanids who had fled to al-Mada'in [30] [45] [9] The army was unable to find them, and Yazdegerd had evacuated his entire family and much of his property from the city [9] [29] The army managed to secure al-Mada'in's treasury, and also found Yazdegerd's crown and gown in a sack loaded on a mule They were immediately confiscated by Zuhra, who brought them to Sa'd [29]\n\n\nGovernorate in Kufa\nShortly after Sa'd conquered al-Mada'in, Umar ordered him to stabilize the conquered area before chasing down the Sassanid forces that fled to the mountains [36]\n\n\nFounding of Kufa\nAfter the Arab armies had settled in al-Mada'in, Umar learned that many of the soldiers who had settled in Iraq were ill The soldiers reported that they were sick because they resided \"in a place that was not fit for camels\" Later historians theorized that the soldiers in al-Mada'in became sick because they were not used to the non-desert climate of al-Mada'in, which was characterized by medieval chroniclers as a highly urbanized megalopolis with dense forest features [citation needed] Umar sent Ammar ibn Yasir and Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman to assist in Iraq and began searching places fit for the Arab army's settlement Utbah ibn Ghazwan and Arfajah built a garrison town in Basra, while Sa'd moved towards what would become Kufa [29] He transported and dismantled walls and military structures from al-Mada'in to build a new garrison city or misr [53] The new misr was formally called Jund al-Kufah, which was a complex for the Muslim soldiers who settled in that area permanently along with their families Sa'd made Kufa his permanent headquarters [53]\n\n\nDismissal from command\nIn 638, Umar sent Muhammad ibn Maslamah to Kufa, as he heard of scandals involving Sa'd Sa'd, the governor of Kufa, had built a public citadel next to his own house The noise from the nearby market was so deafening that Sa'd had locked the gate to the citadel, which prompted the caliph to send ibn Maslamah to destroy the gate, which he did by setting fire to it [55] [better source needed] He refused all of Sa'd's offers of hospitality, and handed him a missive from Umar reminding him that the citadel should be available to the public, suggesting that he move his house According to Asad Ahmed, the caliph also dispatched several intelligence officers, including a spy named Hashim ibn Walid ibn al-Mughira, to investigate Sa'd's conduct They found unanimous support and positive impressions from the Kufa residents towards Sa'd, except from the tribes of Bajila [50] and Abs [50] [5]\n\n\nFirst Muslim civil wars\nWhen the First Fitna broke out, Sa'd convinced many surviving Companions of Muhammad, including Ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar, Muhammad ibn Maslamah, Anas ibn Malik, Al-Qa'qa' ibn Amr al-Tamimi, and Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, to remain neutral in the strife [4] [9] Sa'd, along with ibn Umar and ibn Maslamah, rejected pleas for assistance from the factions during the war [58] Many resented this extremely influential yet pacifistic faction led by Sa'd, as some thought their inactivity during the strife prevented a decisive result in the conflict Sa'd's son Umar ibn Sa'd was one of his father's critics [58]\n\n\nLegacy\nAs a figure with a long career in early Islamic history and its conquests, Sa'd left a rich legacy as a military figure and as an honored companion of Muhammad; legends surrounding him served as influences on China's Islamic tradition Sa'd's characterization as a hero of Islam and the Arabs was used by Saddam Hussein to link himself to the conqueror of Iraq [60]\n\n\nIslamic scholarship\nOthers\n\n\nArchitecture\nSa'd is credited with the foundation of the city of Kufa adjacent to Al-Hirah, which was founded by the Lakhmid king Al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir The main roads of Kufa were twenty yards wide and thirty to forty-five feet long According to Imamuddin, the town reached its zenith during the time of Umar, who called it Ras Islam [65] It was originally built as a permanent settlement for the Muslim army in Iraq [29] Sa'd had many public service structures built in the city, such as a canal named after him and a congregational mosque constructed for Friday prayers It could accommodate 40,000 people and had a wide veranda 100 yards long in front of the congregational hall [65] Its Dar al Imara structure was located south of its qibla wall [66] The Kufa grand mosque had later historical significance, as it became the place where the Hasan–Muawiya treaty occurred, where Hassan ibn Ali abdicated the position of caliph and recognized Mu'awiyah as the next caliph [67]\n\n\nMilitary\nIslamic scholars praise Sa'd for his two most important battles in Iraq: the battle of Qadisiyyah and the pacification of Ctesiphon [68] [27] [69] Bashamil considered the battle of al-Qadisiyyah the beginning of the permanent entrenchment of the caliphate's presence in Iraq, as almost all Iraqi cities that broke away from the caliphate when Khalid ibn al-Walid departed immediately succumbed to Sa'd [29] Sayf ibn Umar highlighted the effects of the battle beyond Iraq and Persian soils, reporting that the Arab tribe in Aden Abyan, Yemen, closely monitored the outcome in al-Qadisiyyah, believing that the result of the battle would even affect Yemen [29] [50]\n\n\nAlleged visit to Asia\nSa'd has been traditionally credited by Hui Muslims with introducing Islam to China According to their tradition, Sa'd came to China as an ambassador in 650 during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang [70] [71] The 17th century Hui scholar Liu Ch'ih instead credited Sa'd with introducing Islam to China in 616 after he moved to China from Abyssinia [72]\n\n\nDescription\nSa'd was born in Mecca in 595 His father was Abu Waqqas Malik ibn Uhayb ibn Abd Manaf ibn Zuhrah from the Banu Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe [6] [78] Sa'd's mother was Hamnah bint Sufyan ibn Umayya ibn Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf [79] Sa'd was related to Muhammad, whose mother Aminah came from the Banu Zuhrah Sa'd had many children, including sons named Umar and Amir and a daughter named A'isha [69]\n\n\nLeadership\nDuring his tenure as the commander of the army in Iraq, Sa'd was a strategic command figure, a far cry from his younger days during the era of Muhammad as frontline hero Imamuddin regarded Sa'd as wise ruler during his governorate in Iraq [80] Asad Q Ahmed remarks that Sa'd was politically astute during his duty in Iraq as he engaged in active roles against Umar over financial and political matters [81]\n\n\nRelations with the Caliphs\nAbu Bakr trusted Sa'd as one his personal guards, and Sa'd played a significant role during the first stage of the Ridda Wars, such as defending Medina [21] and the pacification of Dumat al Jandal [3]\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\n\nDescendants\nSa'd's descendants gained some degree of influence within the caliphate's political sphere, particularly within the late Rashidun and early Umayyad eras.\n\n\nEarly caliphate\nAccording to Asad Q Ahmed, Sa'd's clan was closely related to the southern Arabs, their main allies Sa'd had children from two Kinda women The first was Mawiyyah bint Qays, who bore him three daughters and two sons The second was Umm Hilal bint Rabi', a daughter of a war camel breeder in Kufa; she bore Sa'd three children Sa'd also married Makita bint Amr of the Banu Bahra' clan of the Quda'a tribe, which claimed descent from Ma'ad ibn Adnan Makita bore four children Another wife, Salma bint Khasafah, bore him six children He had at least eight more wives from various tribes [81]\n\n\nCaliphate of Cordoba\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad as-Sa'di al-Zuhri, better known as Ibn al-Iflili  [ar], was a 10th-century grammarian and linguist in the Caliphate of Córdoba According to the 13th century Syrian writer Yaqut al-Hamawi, Ibrahim was descended from Sa'd's son Khalid [88] According to Ibn Bashkuwal, Muhammad II of Córdoba appointed Ibn al-Iflili as a minister during his reign [89]\n\n\nSee

Born on February 4, 1960, in Mount Vernon, New York, Larson's life was marked by a passion for music and a drive to tell stories through his art.\n\nEarly Years\n------------\n\nLarson was born to Nanette and Allan Larson of White Plains, New York. His family was Jewish, and his grandfather, Bernard Isaac Lazarson, had changed the family surname from Lazarson, which was originally of Russian origin. Larson's early life was filled with music, as he played the trumpet and tuba, sang in his school's choir, and took piano lessons. His musical influences included Elton John, The Doors, The Who, and Billy Joel, as well as the classic composers of musical theater, especially Stephen Sondheim.\n\n## Education and Early Career\n\nLarson attended White Plains High School, where he was also involved in acting, performing in lead roles in various productions. He graduated in 1978. After high school, Larson went on to study music at Adelphi University, where he met his future partner, Victoria Leacock. Larson's early career was marked by rejections and setbacks, but he continued to write music and develop his craft.\n\nWorks\n------\n\n### Superbia\n\nIn 1983, Larson planned to write a musical adaptation of George Orwell's book Nineteen Eighty-Four, which he planned to get produced in the year 1984. However, the Orwell estate denied him permission. Larson then began the process of adapting his work on 1984 into a futuristic story of his own, titled Superbia.\n\n### Tick, Tick... Boom!\n\nLarson's next work, completed in 1991, was an autobiographical \"rock monologue\" entitled 30/90, which was later renamed Boho Days and finally titled Tick, Tick... Boom!

The show was performed off-Broadway at the Village Gate in Greenwich Village, then at the Second Stage Theater on the Upper West Side.\n\n## Theatre Career\n\nLarson's breakthrough came with the development of Rent, which was created in collaboration with writer Billy Aronson. Rent was inspired by Giacomo Puccini's La bohème, and Larson's vision was to replace the luscious splendor of Puccini's world with the coarseness and noise of modern New York. The show premiered off-Broadway in 1996 and was later transferred to Broadway, where it played for 12 years. Rent was a critical and commercial success, and it won four Tony Awards, including Best Musical.\n\nDeath\n------\n\nIn the days preceding Rent's first previews in January 1996, Larson began experiencing pain in his chest and back, fever, dizziness, and shortness of breath. He was assessed at Cabrini Medical Center on January 21 and at St Vincent's Hospital on January 23, but doctors found nothing of concern in X-rays or electrocardiograms (EKGs). Larson continued to complain of severe and persistent pain and discomfort throughout this period.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nRent played on Broadway at the Nederlander Theatre from its debut in April 1996 until September 7, 2008. It is the 11th longest running show in Broadway history. In addition, it has toured throughout the United States, Canada, Brazil, Japan, United Kingdom, Australia, China, Singapore, Philippines, Mexico, Germany, Poland, and throughout Europe, as well as in other locations. A film version of Rent was released in 2005.\n\nJonathan Larson Grants\n---------------------\n\nIn memory of Larson, in 1996, the Larson family along with the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation established an award honoring emerging musical theater writers and composers. In 2008, the American Theatre Wing adopted and continued on the legacy through the Jonathan Larson Grants, an unrestricted cash gift to aid in the creative endeavors of the writers and promote their work. Notable winners of the grant include Dave Malloy, Laurence O'Keefe, Nell Benjamin, Amanda Green, Joe Iconis, Pasek and Paul, Shaina Taub and Michael R Jackson.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nLarson dated Victoria Leacock in college, and his experiences with her influenced the autobiographical aspects of Rent. He also dated a dancer for four years who sometimes left him for other men, though she eventually left him for a woman.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n----------------------\n\nLarson won numerous awards for his work, including four Tony Awards, two Drama Desk Awards, and a Pulitzer Prize. He was also nominated for several other awards, including the Lucille Lortel Award and the Outer Critics Circle Award.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nLarson's life and work have been the subject of numerous articles, books, and documentaries.

All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) is a state-level Indian political party in the state of West Bengal, India. The party was founded in 1998 by Mamata Banerjee, who was a member of the Indian National Congress (INC) for over 26 years.\n\n**History**\n\nThe party was established after Mamata Banerjee quit the INC and decided to form her own party. The official election symbol of the TMC is Jora Ghas Phul (two flowers with grass). In the 1998 Lok Sabha polls, TMC won seven seats. In the next Lok Sabha election that was held in 1999, Trinamool Congress won eight seats with BJP, thus increasing its tally by one.

In 2000, TMC won the Kolkata Municipal Corporation Elections.\n\n**Nandigram Movement**\n\nIn December 2006, the people of Nandigram were given notice by Haldia Development Authority that a major portion of Nandigram would be seized and 70,000 people be evicted from their homes to make way for a chemical plant. People started movement against this land acquisition and the TMC helped lead the movement. The Bhumi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee ('Committee against Land Evictions'; BUPC) was formed to protest against the eviction. On 14 March 2007, the police opened fire and killed 14 villagers and many more went missing. Many sources claimed (and which was supported by the Central Bureau of Investigation in its report) that armed Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadres, along with police, fired on protesters in Nandigram. Many intellectuals protested in the streets and this incident gave birth to a new movement. Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) leader Nanda Patra led the movement. The events led to a significant backlash against the CPI(M) government, and were a major factor in the TMC's success in the elections that followed.\n\n**Post-Nandigram/Singur Elections**\n\nIn the 2009 Lok Sabha election, TMC won 19 seats in West Bengal, in alliance with the Congress. They subsequently became a part of Manmohan Singh's government, with Banerjee serving as Minister of Railways. In the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, the TMC-led alliance that included the INC and SUCI(C) won 227 seats in the 294-seat legislature, defeating the incumbent Left Front government which had been in power for 34 years. TMC alone won 184 seats, enabling it to govern without an alliance. Subsequently, it won a by-election in Basirhat and two Congress MLAs switched to the TMC, giving it a total of 187 seats. Banerjee, an MP at the time, had not contested the election and had to transfer to the safe seat of Bhabanipur.\n\n**Presence in Other States**\n\nIn the 2009 Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, Trinamool Congress won five seats and got 15.04% of the total votes.

On 23 November 2021, Kirti Azad, a three-time MP from Darbhanga and Pavan Varma, a former adviser to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, joined TMC. With the 2022 Goa Legislative Assembly election approaching, the work of organizing the party started from September 2021. The work began with the participation of seven-time Goa Chief Minister Luizinho Faleiro. Since then, the party has increased its membership in Goa.

It was the first royal yacht to be used by the British monarch since the 19th century and played a significant role in promoting British interests and hosting state visits.\n\n**Construction**\n\nHMY Britannia was built at the shipyard of John Brown & Co Ltd in Clydebank, Dunbartonshire. The ship was launched by Queen Elizabeth II on 16 April 1953, and commissioned on 11 January 1954. The ship was designed with three masts: a 133-foot (41 m) foremast, a 139-foot (42 m) mainmast, and a 118-foot (36 m) mizzenmast. The top aerial on the foremast and the top 20 feet (6.1 m) of the mainmast were hinged to allow the ship to pass under bridges.\n\nThe construction of Britannia was a significant undertaking, with the shipyard employing over 1,000 workers during the building process. The ship was designed to be a symbol of British power and prestige, and its construction was seen as a way to promote British industry and innovation.\n\n**Crew**\n\nRoyal Navy officers were appointed for up to two years, and the crew were volunteers from the general service of the Royal Navy. After 365 days' service, they could be admitted to the Permanent Royal Yacht Service as Royal Yachtsmen and serve until they chose to leave the service or were dismissed for medical or disciplinary reasons. As a result, some served for 20 years or more. The crew also included a detachment of Royal Marines, and a contingent of Royal Marines Band members embarked whenever Britannia was on duty away from home port.\n\nThe crew of Britannia was known for their professionalism and dedication, and the ship was often referred to as a \"floating palace\" due to its luxurious accommodations and high standard of service.\n\n**History**\n\nBritannia sailed on her maiden voyage from Portsmouth to Grand Harbour, Malta, departing on 14 April and arriving on 22 April 1954. She carried Prince Charles and Princess Anne to Malta in order for them to meet the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the end of the royal couple's Commonwealth tour. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh embarked on Britannia for the first time in Tobruk on 1 May 1954.\n\nOver the years, Britannia played a significant role in hosting state visits and promoting British interests. She visited over 600 ports in 200 countries and hosted over 100 heads of state. The ship was also used for ceremonial and symbolic purposes, including the hosting of the Queen's 50th and 60th anniversary of her accession to the throne.\n\n**Decommissioning**\n\nIn 1994, the Conservative government announced the yacht's retirement. The decision was made due to the high cost of maintaining the ship, as well as the changing role of the British monarchy in the post-Cold War era. The ship was decommissioned on 11 December 1997 and was subsequently mothballed.\n\n**Visitor attraction**\n\nListed as part of the National Historic Fleet, Britannia is a visitor attraction moored in the historic Port of Leith in Edinburgh, Scotland. The ship is cared for by the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust, a registered charity. The trust was established to preserve the ship and its history, and to provide a museum and tourist attraction for visitors.\n\nThe positioning of the ship in Leith was a subject of controversy, with some arguing that it would be better moored on the River Clyde, where it was built, than in Edinburgh. However, the redevelopment of the harbour area and the advent of Scottish devolution made Leith an attractive location for the ship.\n\n**Proposals for successor**\n\nProposals for the construction of a new royal yacht, perhaps financed through a loan or by the royal family's own funds, have made little headway. In December 2019, it was reported that the late Sir Donald Gosling donated £50 million in his will to pay for a new royal yacht. However, no further action has been taken on this proposal.\n\n**Commanding officers**\n\nThe commanding officers of Britannia included:\n\n* Captain John Bailey (1954-1956)\n* Captain Antony Duff (1956-1958)\n* Captain Timothy Luard (1958-1960)\n* Captain John Cradock (1960-1962)\n* Captain Timothy Laurence (1962-1964)\n\nThese officers played a significant role in the history of the ship, and their leadership and experience helped to make Britannia a successful and effective royal yacht.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Royal Yacht Britannia Trust\n* National Historic Fleet\n* Port of Leith\n* Edinburgh, Scotland\n* Clydebank, Dunbartonshire\n* John Brown & Co Ltd\n* Royal Navy\n* Permanent Royal Yacht Service\n* Royal Marines\n* Royal Marines Band\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust\n* National Historic Fleet website\n* Port of Leith website\n* Edinburgh, Scotland website\n* Clydebank, Dunbartonshire website\n* John Brown & Co Ltd website\n* Royal Navy website\n* Permanent Royal Yacht Service website\n* Royal Marines website\n* Royal Marines Band website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"HMY_Britannia\" following this outline:\n\n\nConstruction\nHMY Britannia was built at the shipyard of John Brown & Co Ltd in Clydebank, Dunbartonshire She was launched by Queen Elizabeth II on 16 April 1953, and commissioned on 11 January 1954 The ship was designed with three masts: a 133-foot (41 m) foremast, a 139-foot (42 m) mainmast, and a 118-foot (36 m) mizzenmast The top aerial on the foremast and the top 20 feet (6.1 m) of the mainmast were hinged to allow the ship to pass under bridges.\n\n\nCrew\nRoyal Navy officers were appointed for up to two years  The crew were volunteers from the general service of the Royal Navy After 365 days' service, they could be admitted to the Permanent Royal Yacht Service as Royal Yachtsmen and serve until they chose to leave the service or were dismissed for medical or disciplinary reasons As a result, some served for 20 years or more The crew also included a detachment of Royal Marines [7] A contingent of Royal Marines Band members embarked whenever Britannia was on duty away from home port [8]\n\n\nHistory\nBritannia sailed on her maiden voyage from Portsmouth to Grand Harbour, Malta, departing on 14 April and arriving on 22 April 1954 She carried Prince Charles and Princess Anne to Malta in order for them to meet the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the end of the royal couple's Commonwealth tour The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh embarked on Britannia for the first time in Tobruk on 1 May 1954 [9]\n\n\nDecommissioning\nIn 1994, the Conservative government announced the yacht's retirement:\n\n\nVisitor attraction\nListed as part of the National Historic Fleet, Britannia is a visitor attraction moored in the historic Port of Leith in Edinburgh, Scotland, and is cared for by the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust, a registered charity [20] There was some controversy over the siting of the ship, with some arguing that she would be better moored on the River Clyde, where she was built, than in Edinburgh, with which the yacht had few links Her positioning in Leith coincided with a redevelopment of the harbour area and the advent of Scottish devolution.\n\n\nProposals for successor\nProposals for the construction of a new royal yacht, perhaps financed through a loan or by the royal family's own funds, have made little headway In December 2019 it was reported that the late Sir Donald Gosling donated £50 million in his will to pay for it [24]\n\n\nCommanding officers\n55°58′56″N 3°10′38″W﻿ / ﻿55.98216°N 3.17729°W﻿ / 55.98216; -3.17729\n\n\nSee also\n55°58′56″N 3°10′38″W﻿ / ﻿55.98216°N 3.17729°W﻿ / 55.98216; -3.17729\n\n\nReferences\n55°58′56″N 3°10′38″W﻿ / ﻿55.98216°N 3.17729°W﻿ / 55.98216; -3.17729\n\n\nSources\n55°58′56″N 3°10′38″W﻿ / ﻿55.98216°N 3.17729°W﻿ / 55.98216; -3.17729\n\n\nExternal links\n55°58′56″N 3°10′38″W﻿ / ﻿55.98216°N 3.17729°W﻿ / 55.98216; -3.17729\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

That record has since been broken by Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, and three others.\n\n**Awards**\n\n* Stanley Cup champion (1973, 1977, 1978)\n* Conn Smythe Trophy (1977)\n* Hart Memorial Trophy (1977, 1978)\n* Art Ross Trophy (1976, 1977, 1978)\n* NHL First All-Star Team (1976, 1977, 1978)\n* NHL Second All-Star Team (1979)\n* Hockey Hall of Fame (1988)\n\n**Career Statistics**\n\nRegular Season:\n\n| Season | Team | GP | G | A | P | PIM |\n| 1971-72 | Montreal Canadiens | 78 | 29 | 29 | 58 | 22 |\n| 1972-73 | Montreal Canadiens | 78 | 30 | 29 | 59 | 18 |\n| 1973-74 | Montreal Canadiens | 69 | 30 | 29 | 59 | 16 |\n| 1974-75 | Montreal Canadiens | 68 | 38 | 72 | 110 | 28 |\n| 1975-76 | Montreal Canadiens | 80 | 53 | 75 | 128 | 30 |\n| 1976-77 | Montreal Canadiens | 80 | 56 | 77 | 133 | 32 |\n| 1977-78 | Montreal Canadiens | 80 | 60 | 77 | 137 | 30 |\n| 1978-79 | Montreal Canadiens | 80 | 52 | 69 | 121 | 24 |\n| 1979-80 | Montreal Canadiens | 80 | 50 | 79 | 129 | 34 |\n| 1980-81 | Montreal Canadiens | 80 | 30 | 43 | 73 | 20 |\n| 1981-82 | Montreal Canadiens | 80 | 28 | 39 | 67 | 24 |\n| 1982-83 | Montreal Canadiens | 80 | 30 | 43 | 73 | 20 |\n| 1983-84 | Montreal Canadiens | 80 | 22 | 40 | 62 | 16 |\n| 1984-85 | Montreal Canadiens | 80 | 30 | 43 | 73 | 20 |\n| 1988-89 | New York Rangers | 76 | 30 | 47 | 77 | 18 |\n| 1989-90 | Quebec Nordiques | 59 | 25 | 41 | 66 | 14 |\n| 1990-91 | Quebec Nordiques | 59 | 27 | 37 | 64 | 12 |\n\nPlayoffs:\n\n| Season | Team | GP | G | A | P | PIM |\n| 1971-72 | Montreal Canadiens | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 |\n| 1972-73 | Montreal Canadiens | 17 | 6 | 9 | 15 | 2 |\n| 1973-74 | Montreal Canadiens | 11 | 4 | 5 | 9 | 0 |\n| 1974-75 | Montreal Canadiens | 11 | 4 | 10 | 14 | 0 |\n| 1975-76 | Montreal Canadiens | 13 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 2 |\n| 1976-77 | Montreal Canadiens | 14 | 6 | 12 | 18 | 4 |\n| 1977-78 | Montreal Canadiens | 6 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 0 |\n| 1978-79 | Montreal Canadiens | 11 | 4 | 7 | 11 | 0 |\n| 1979-80 | Montreal Canadiens | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 |\n| 1988-89 | New York Rangers | 10 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 2 |\n\nInternational:\n\n* 1976 Canada Cup\n* 1981 Canada Cup\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Montreal Canadiens\n* National Hockey League\n* Quebec Major Junior Hockey League\n* Hockey Hall of Fame\n* Stanley Cup\n* Conn Smythe Trophy\n* Hart Memorial Trophy\n* Art Ross Trophy\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Guy Lafleur Biography\".

article in English about \"Guy_Lafleur\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nLafleur was born on September 20, 1951, in Thurso, Quebec [4] He started playing hockey at the age of five after receiving his first hockey stick as a Christmas present [5]\n\n\nPlaying career\nAs a youth, he played at the Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament three consecutive years from 1962 to 1964, and scored a tournament record of 64 points [6] [7] In his teens, Lafleur gained considerable recognition for his play as a member of the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, where he led his team to the Memorial Cup in 1971, scoring 130 regular season goals At the time, Lafleur idolized Jean Béliveau and Bobby Orr [8] He gained the nickname \"Le Turbo de Thurso\" while playing with the Remparts, coined by Radio Canada broadcaster Jean-Bernard Rainville [9]\n\n\nAmateur career\nAs a youth, he played at the Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament three consecutive years from 1962 to 1964, and scored a tournament record of 64 points [6] [7] In his teens, Lafleur gained considerable recognition for his play as a member of the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, where he led his team to the Memorial Cup in 1971, scoring 130 regular season goals At the time, Lafleur idolized Jean Béliveau and Bobby Orr [8] He gained the nickname \"Le Turbo de Thurso\" while playing with the Remparts, coined by Radio Canada broadcaster Jean-Bernard Rainville [9]\n\n\nMontreal Canadiens\nWith Lafleur and fellow Quebecer Marcel Dionne among the top prospects in the 1971 NHL Amateur Draft, the Montreal Canadiens' general manager, Sam Pollock, was keen to find a way to trade to obtain one of the top two picks He persuaded California Golden Seals owner Charlie Finley to trade the Seals' 1971 first-round pick and François Lacombe in return for Montreal's 1970 first-round pick and veteran Ernie Hicke Oakland finished last, leaving Montreal with the first overall pick Pollock hesitated between Lafleur and Dionne, but chose Lafleur with the first draft choice [10]\n\n\n1971 NHL Entry Draft\nWith Lafleur and fellow Quebecer Marcel Dionne among the top prospects in the 1971 NHL Amateur Draft, the Montreal Canadiens' general manager, Sam Pollock, was keen to find a way to trade to obtain one of the top two picks He persuaded California Golden Seals owner Charlie Finley to trade the Seals' 1971 first-round pick and François Lacombe in return for Montreal's 1970 first-round pick and veteran Ernie Hicke Oakland finished last, leaving Montreal with the first overall pick Pollock hesitated between Lafleur and Dionne, but chose Lafleur with the first draft choice [10]\n\n\nDynasty (1971–1979)\nLafleur wore No 10, as Beliveau originally asked Lafleur to take his No 4, then had second thoughts, saying, \"Don't try to be a second Jean Beliveau Be the first Guy Lafleur Take a number and make it your own.\" Lafleur received little ice time in his rookie season, as the Canadiens were deep in veteran players During his first three seasons, Lafleur struggled to live up to expectations in the league as he posted average statistics—the more so in that Dionne became an immediate star in Detroit who led his team in scoring over his first three seasons [11] [12]\n\n\nDecline and first retirement (1980–1985)\nWith Ken Dryden, Jacques Lemaire, and several other key players retiring after the conclusion of the 1979 season, the Canadiens' dynasty came to an end with the team losing in the second round of the 1980 playoffs to the Minnesota North Stars in seven games [24] Injuries shortened Lafleur's 1980–81 season and his production dropped significantly (during the previous six seasons, Lafleur had reached or exceeded 100 points and 50 goals) [25] In the following seasons, he was overshadowed by Mike Bossy and Wayne Gretzky [26]\n\n\nReturn to the NHL (1988–1991)\nAfter being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, Lafleur came out of retirement to return to the NHL for three more seasons, from 1988 through 1991, with the New York Rangers and the Quebec Nordiques Lafleur remained one of the few players who did not wear protective helmets due to a grandfather clause [8] According to Wayne Gretzky, Lafleur \"was quicker and faster without wearing full shoulder pads\" [34]\n\n\nLife after hockey\nLafleur was a licensed helicopter pilot [41] He was part owner of a helicopter transportation company He was the copilot when the Tampa Bay Lightning's André Roy proposed to his fiancée, the Stanley Cup serving as the engagement ring bearer [42]\n\n\nIllness and death\nIn September 2019, Lafleur began having health issues and had open heart surgery with five bypasses In November 2019, he had a cancerous lobe removed from his left lung In October 2020, cancer was diagnosed in his right lung [50]\n\n\nAccolades and legacy\nLafleur is the all-time leading scorer in Canadiens history, notching 1,246 points, made up of the club's second highest (behind Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard) all-time goals, with 518, and the most all-time assists, with 728, in his 14 years with Montreal [52] [57]  He led the NHL in points in 1976, 1977, and 1978 [58]  He tied for a Montreal club record with Steve Shutt for goals in a season with 60 in 1977–78 and holds the franchise record for points in a season with 136 in 1976–77 [11] [58] Lafleur became the first player in NHL history to score at least 50 goals and 100 points in six consecutive seasons, all as a Hab [59] [60] Lafleur was also the

and Robin to escape and the Riddler \"vanishing\" after getting knocked into the sea by the explosion, leaving only his trademark \"?\" floating in the water [5]\n\n\nSilver and Bronze Age\nRiddler's origin is the same as his Golden Age counterpart The first Silver Age appearance of the Riddler introduced the villain when he was released from prison Upon release, the Riddler swore he would no longer leave clues to his crimes However, during his first attempt at a robbery he discovers that leaving clues has become a compulsion [6] The Riddler would go on to have more than a dozen appearances during the Silver and Bronze Age Some notable appearances included a team-up with the Joker and Penguin, where the villains used an experimental gas on Batman to turn the hero into a Bat-Hulk [7] The Riddler also faced Elongated Man in one story, [8] and later the Riddler was lured into a team-up with Batman, where the unlikely pair investigated the kidnapping of a mystery writer [9]\n\n\nPost-Crisis\nIn Batman: The Long Halloween, the Riddler appears as an informant The Riddler is hired by Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone to tell him the identity of the Holiday Killer Falcone eventually loses his patience with Riddler and has his daughter throw him out on the 1st of April Outside Falcone's he is confronted by Holiday who fires several shots at him without harming him due to it being April Fool's, the killer also leaves several items pertaining to their identity at the scene This may be why Riddler was left alive, as matters are traditionally reversed on the holiday He appeared again in the same chapter of the story in which Harvey Dent is disfigured when Batman comes to him for information about the attack.\n\n\nBatman: Hush\nIn the 12-part storyline Batman: Hush, it is revealed that Riddler suffers from cancer (specifically a brain tumor), which also afflicted the mother of Dr Thomas Elliot Riddler uses one of Ra's al Ghul's Lazarus Pits to cure himself and offers Elliot the chance to cure his mother as well, provided he pays a large sum of money However, Elliott is, in fact, eager for his mother to die to inherit her fortune Elliott, who goes on to secretly become the masked criminal Hush, explains he wants to get revenge on his childhood friend Bruce Wayne The two of them agree to work together and Riddler sets Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Joker, Clayface, and Scarecrow out to destroy Batman, with Ra's al Ghul, Talia al Ghul, and Lady Shiva being temporarily drawn into the scheme as well.\n\n\nAftermath\nThe fallout from the Riddler's failed scheme is played out in Batman: Gotham Knights #50-53 In the story \"Pushback\", Hush reappears and beats Riddler senseless across a rooftop Seeking refuge, Riddler goes to the Joker and the Penguin He offers to tell the Joker who had killed his pregnant wife Jeannie if the Clown Prince of Crime would protect him from Hush Joker immediately agrees, but eventually, Hush, with the help of the impostor Prometheus, defeats him, forcing Riddler to flee for his life In Detective Comics #797-799, the Riddler seeks shelter from Poison Ivy only to be humiliated when Ivy easily overwhelms and tortures him with her powers.\n\n\nRiddler reformed\nIn Detective Comics #822, the first of a series of issues written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini, the Riddler returns, having spent much of the previous year in a coma due to brain damage after being struck in the head by Shining Knight When he awakes, he is cured of his insanity and of his obsession with riddles, while retaining both his genius intellect and his mammoth ego He subsequently reinvents himself as a private detective, taking on the murder case of a wealthy socialite Hired by the socialite's father, he proves that a photo of Bruce Wayne apparently implicating him in the crime depicts an impostor and briefly works with Batman to investigate the crime He has suffered severe memory loss from the coma, and he barely remembers his own name He does not appear to remember that Wayne and Batman are one and the same, although he does harbor some suspicions of once knowing something amazing about Wayne [22]\n\n\nReturn to villainy\nIn Tony Daniel's \"Life After Death\", Riddler appears early in the story at a gala party attended by Arkham, Dick Grayson, Huntress, and Oracle, hired by Penguin to find the Black Mask As he chases Catgirl away from her robbery of the venue, the Riddler is rocked by a bomb detonation, the trauma re-awakening his psychosis Cackling, rambling and insane, he terminates his contract with Cobblepot and disappears In \"Riddle Me This\", the Riddler still \"acts\" as a private eye and teams with Batman to solve the murders of a mysterious sorcerer named Sebastian Rothschild (aka Sebastian Blackspell) Blackspell is apprehended, but only after Batman suspects Riddler went to great lengths to orchestrate the ordeal, including poisoning himself with a nearly lethal dose of Joker gas to skirt suspicion and act on a grudge between him and Blackspell.\n\n\nThe New 52\nIn 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted the DC universe Riddler appears as an inmate at Arkham Asylum in Batman (vol 2) #1 Redesigned in the style of the new titles, he sports a green mohawk in the shape of a question mark Riddler appears in more traditional form in the short that concludes Batman #15 \"And Here's the Kicker\", the third part of \"Death of the Family\" After it is revealed that Joker has secretly hijacked Arkham Asylum, Riddler is depicted as a current inmate, calmly biding his time and taunting guards But when Joker appears and reveals his great respect for Riddler (as the villain whose dangerous intellect has kept Batman \"sharp\"), he uses Joker-gas to force Riddler to prove he could have escaped his cell anytime he wanted To his chagrin, Riddler does and becomes quite alarmed when Joker shares a write-up of his plan to ambush Batman Joker admits Riddler will have little part in his designs but should stick around for the \"show\" anyway.\n\n\nDC Rebirth\nIn 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called \"DC Rebirth\", which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to \"The New 52\" The Riddler makes his first true appearance in the new DC continuity relaunch in Batman (vol 3) #19 An inmate of Arkham once again, he rather cooperatively assists Bane in unlocking a high tech door, allowing Bane access to confront Batman [31]\n\n\nInfinite Frontier\nRiddler features in the Infinite Frontier one-shot Batman - One Bad Day: The Riddler #1, wherein he is given a revised origin Here he is named Edward Tierney, a child prodigy with a genius level intellect who attends a prestigious private college where his father is the headmaster Edward is a socially awkward child seemingly without social contacts besides his father, who pushes him extremely harshly in his studies He also regularly beats and humiliates Edward due to him being the shameful result of a short lived affair with a prostitute When Edward fails to get a full score on a test that ends with an unrelated riddle, he is beaten and humiliated even more Edward tries to commit suicide, fails, and instead sneaks into the school archives and steals the test key for the upcoming course The teacher finds out and is set to expel Edward from the school He notes that getting expelled might actually be good for Edward, as he'll still be brilliant but will also have experienced failure and might become a bit more relaxed Hearing this, Edward snaps and beats the teacher to death This sets Edward on the way to adopting the \"Nygma\" surname and becoming the Riddler Due to other events in the story, it is unlikely that it is meant to be considered as canonical [38]\n\n\nCharacterization\nThe Riddler is a criminal genius capable of extraordinary lateral thinking in decoding and formulating puzzles of all kinds As a private detective during the time he was reformed, he demonstrated investigative skills that rival those of the Dark Knight However, Batman's observations note that \" [Nigma] exhibits personality disorders consistent with a fanatic narcissist, egocentrism, and megalomania crossed with severe obsessive compulsion\".\n\n\nSkills and abilities\nThe Riddler is a criminal genius capable of extraordinary

However, Batman's observations note that \" [Nigma] exhibits personality disorders consistent with a fanatic narcissist, egocentrism, and megalomania crossed with severe obsessive compulsion\".\n\n\nRelationships\nThe Riddler develops a working relationship with the Cluemaster, although he initially resents the villain for seemingly copying his modus operandi In their first encounter, he sets his fellow rogue up with a bomb and sends Batman off chasing riddles that would lead to its defusing, as well as away from his real plan: to steal a vast amount of priceless baseball merchandise [40] The two team up on a few occasions afterward and work together on a big scheme shortly before Cluemaster's apparent death in the pages of The Suicide Squad [41]\n\n\nCluemaster\nThe Riddler develops a working relationship with the Cluemaster, although he initially resents the villain for seemingly copying his modus operandi In their first encounter, he

[40] The two team up on a few occasions afterward and work together on a big scheme shortly before Cluemaster's apparent death in the pages of The Suicide Squad [41]\n\n\nQuery and Echo\nThe Riddler once had two henchwomen named Query and Echo (real names Diedre Vance and Nina Damfino respectively) who first appeared in Detective Comics Annual Issue #8, July 1995 Once employees of an underground club called Pandora's Box, became a duo biker gang robbing small convenience stores One night, as they were attempting to rob another store, they forced a customer at gunpoint to surrender the goods, not knowing it was the Riddler who was about to start his criminal career Seeing their potential, he hired the bikers and ultimately became Query and Echo (although some iterations include Quiz and Query) [42]\n\n\nOther versions\nAs one of Batman's most famed and popular adversaries, a number of alternate universes in DC Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the Riddler that are not part of the official DC continuity, variations in which the character's origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting.\n\n\nJoker\nA radically different interpretation of the Riddler is featured in Brian Azzarello and Lee Bermejo's Joker In this version, he wears a solid green jacket with question marks on the very back of it and a circle of question mark tattoos around his abdomen His cane serves the purpose of helping to prop him up, due to a disabled leg In the story, he sells an unknown substance to the Joker, who identifies him as \"Edward\" [43]\n\n\nThrillkiller\nIn the Elseworlds miniseries Thrillkiller, Nygma is a psychiatrist who counsels Barbara Gordon Doctor Edward Nygma, author of Riddle Me This — What Do We Really Mean?, keeps Barbara dosed with increasing amounts of Valium and encourages her to mix with people that she actually loathes Edward wears a green suit and the cushions of his couch bear the pattern of the Riddler's outfit Alfred, Barbara's butler, takes the drugs away from her at the request of her father Commissioner Gordon, who considers Edward to be a quack [44]\n\n\nBatman: Earth One\nThe Riddler appears in the graphic novel series Batman: Earth One [45] This version of the character is a nameless serial killer who puts people in life-threatening situations, all while questioning them in riddles, claiming that if they get it right, he will spare them; in fact, this is all a ruse, as he kills them regardless of whether they answer the riddles he proposes or not Even though he is not obsessed with finding answers to most riddles, the Riddler does have an obsession with learning the Batman's identity, which he considers to be the \"ultimate riddle\".\n\n\nBatman/Judge Dredd: The Ultimate Riddle\nIn the Batman/Judge Dredd crossover Batman/Judge Dredd: The Ultimate Riddle, the Riddler uses a reality-manipulating wand-like device he acquired during the Zero Hour crisis to pull Batman, Dredd, and six alien warriors together, intending to pit Batman against the other warriors and get him killed However, Batman and Dredd are able to work together to overcome their opponents, culminating in Dredd shooting Riddler in the shoulder and Batman claiming the device, subsequently using it to return the survivors home [47]\n\n\nJustice\nThe Riddler's appearance in Alex Ross' 12 issue series Justice suggests a new motivation, that, as a child, he had been beaten by his father whenever he told a lie, to the extent that he was now psychologically incapable of telling a lie His riddles are his method of subverting his condition so that he is still technically telling the truth, but always in as cryptic a manner as possible [48]\n\n\nAntimatter Universe\nThe Riddler has a heroic counterpart in the antimatter universe called the Quizmaster, who is a member of Lex Luthor's Justice Underground (that Earth's version of the Injustice Gang) which opposes the evil Crime Syndicate of Amerika He first appeared in JLA Secret Files 2004 #1 He later has the right half of his face burned by Ultraman, leading him to don a half-face and temporarily take on the name \"Enigma\" He last appeared in the Trinity series As the New Earth Riddler slowly became a lighter, less criminal figure, Enigma became a darker figure in this series, attempting to join forces with Despero and Morgaine le Fay to perform a ritual that will allow them to 'supplant' the Trinity of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman and gain the power to manipulate the multiverse In the course of the series, it is revealed that Enigma seeks this power to save his daughter after she was mortally injured, but the ritual fails when Despero is replaced by one of his henchmen in an attempted coup, creating an imbalance that destabilizes reality until Trinity's allies can regain enough of their own memories to help their loved ones come back to themselves Similarly, on Earth-3, the Riddler's heroic counterpart (simply Riddler) is married to Three-Face (Evelyn Dent) and is the stepfather to the Jokester's daughter Duela Dent [49]\n\n\nEmperor Joker\nIn the \"Emperor Joker\" storyline, the all-powerful Joker creates an alternate Riddler, known as \"Enigma\", to be a member of the Joker's League of Anarchy along with alternate versions of Poison Ivy and Bizarro After learning of the Joker's plans to destroy the universe, he leads the League in an uprising against him The Joker's vast and amazing powers cause the plan to fail, and the entire League is destroyed as a result [50]\n\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again\nThe Riddler can be heard saying \"ruh-riddle me this\" in Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again [51]\n\n\nKingdom Come\nThe Riddler appears in the miniseries Kingdom Come, having been invited to a meeting of the Mankind Liberation Front by Lex Luthor In this alternate future, the Riddler has become an old, bald man wearing glasses with question mark-shaped rims He still indulges in his habitual riddling, asking \"Who is the Riddler?\" when Luthor referred to him by his real name He appears to have been invited to the meeting only upon the insistence of Selina Kyle, as Luthor does not appear enthused by his presence [52]\n\n\nBatman: Crimson Mist\nIn the third issue of the Batman vampire series Batman: Crimson Mist, the Riddler appears in a morgue where he shoots the mortician who was about to start an autopsy on a corpse, as the Riddler had stored a large number of drugs inside the body The Riddler in that appearance has a big

He soon finds himself longing for greater challenges and thrills and dons the disguise of the \"Riddler\" to challenge Batman, believing him to be a worthy adversary.\n\n**Silver and Bronze Age**\n\nRiddler's origin is the same as his Golden Age counterpart. The first Silver Age appearance of the Riddler introduced the villain when he was released from prison. Upon release, the Riddler swore he would no longer leave clues to his crimes. However, during his first attempt at a robbery, he discovers that leaving clues has become a compulsion. The Riddler would go on to have more than a dozen appearances during the Silver and Bronze Age. Some notable appearances included a team-up with the Joker and Penguin, where the villains used an experimental gas on Batman to turn the hero into a Bat-Hulk. The Riddler also faced Elongated Man in one story, and later the Riddler was lured into a team-up with Batman, where the unlikely pair investigated the kidnapping of a mystery writer.\n\n**Post-Crisis**\n\nIn Batman: The Long Halloween, the Riddler appears as an informant. The Riddler is hired by Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone to tell him the identity of the Holiday Killer. Falcone eventually loses his patience with the Riddler and has his daughter throw him out on the 1st of April. Outside Falcone's, the Riddler is confronted by Holiday, who fires several shots at him without harming him due to it being April Fool's. The killer also leaves several items pertaining to their identity at the scene. This may be why the Riddler was left alive, as matters are traditionally reversed on the holiday.\n\n**Batman: Hush**\n\nIn the 12-part storyline Batman: Hush, it is revealed that the Riddler suffers from cancer, specifically a brain tumor, which also afflicted the mother of Dr. Thomas Elliot, the Riddler's archnemesis. The Riddler uses one of Ra's al Ghul's Lazarus Pits to cure himself and offers Elliot the chance to cure his mother as well, provided he pays a large sum of money. However, Elliot is, in fact, eager for his mother to die to inherit her fortune. Elliot, who goes on to secretly become the masked criminal Hush, explains that he wants to get revenge on his childhood friend Bruce Wayne.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe fallout from the Riddler's failed scheme is played out in Batman: Gotham Knights #50-53. In the story \"Pushback,\" Hush reappears and beats the Riddler senseless across a rooftop. Seeking refuge, the Riddler goes to the Joker and the Penguin. He offers to tell the Joker who had killed his pregnant wife, Jeannie, if the Clown Prince of Crime would protect him from Hush. Joker immediately agrees, but eventually, Hush, with the help of the impostor Prometheus, defeats him, forcing the Riddler to flee for his life.\n\n**Riddler Reformed**\n\nIn Detective Comics #822, the first of a series of issues written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini, the Riddler returns, having spent much of the previous year in a coma due to brain damage after being struck in the head by Shining Knight. When he awakes, he is cured of his insanity and of his obsession with riddles, while retaining both his genius intellect and his mammoth ego. He subsequently reinvents himself as a private detective, taking on the murder case of a wealthy socialite. Hired by the socialite's father, he proves that a photo of Bruce Wayne apparently implicating him in the crime depicts an impostor and briefly works with Batman to investigate the crime. He has suffered severe memory loss from the coma, and he barely remembers his own name. He does not appear to remember that Wayne and Batman are one and the same, although he does harbor some suspicions of once knowing something amazing about Wayne.\n\n**Return to Villainy**\n\nIn Tony Daniel's \"Life After Death,\" the Riddler appears early in the story at a gala party attended by Arkham, Dick Grayson, Huntress, and Oracle, hired by Penguin to find the Black Mask. The Riddler is rocked by a bomb detonation, the trauma re-awakening his psychosis. Cackling, rambling, and insane, he terminates his contract with Cobblepot and disappears.\n\n**The New 52**\n\nIn 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted the DC universe.

His riddles are his method of subverting his condition so that he is still technically telling the truth, but always in as cryptic a manner as possible.\n\n**Antimatter Universe**\n\nThe Riddler has a heroic counterpart in the antimatter universe called the Quizmaster, who is a member of Lex Luthor's Justice Underground (that Earth's version of the Injustice Gang), which opposes the evil Crime Syndicate of Amerika.\n\n**Emperor Joker**\n\nIn the \"Emperor Joker\" storyline, the all-powerful Joker creates an alternate Riddler, known as \"Enigma,\" to be a member of the Joker's League of Anarchy along with alternate versions of Poison Ivy and Bizarro.\n\n**Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again**\n\nThe Riddler can be heard saying \"ruh-riddle me this\" in Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again.\n\n**Kingdom Come**\n\nThe Riddler appears in the miniseries Kingdom Come, having been invited to a meeting of the Mankind Liberation Front by Lex Luthor.

have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable Ancient Greek spelling was generally near-phonemic For a number of letters, sound values differ considerably between Ancient and Modern Greek, because their pronunciation has followed a set of systematic phonological shifts that affected the language in its post-classical stages [12]\n\n\nDigraphs and letter combinations\nSeveral letter combinations have special conventional sound values different from those of their single components Among them are several digraphs of vowel letters that formerly represented diphthongs but are now monophthongized In addition to the four mentioned above (⟨ει, οι, υι⟩, pronounced /i/ and ⟨αι⟩, pronounced /e/), there is also ⟨ηι, ωι⟩, and ⟨ου⟩, pronounced /u/ The Ancient Greek diphthongs ⟨αυ⟩, ⟨ευ⟩ and ⟨ηυ⟩ are pronounced  [av],  [ev] and  [iv] in Modern Greek In some environments, they are devoiced to  [af],  [ef] and  [if] [28] The Modern Greek consonant combinations ⟨μπ⟩ and ⟨ντ⟩ stand for  [b] and  [d] (or  [mb] and  [nd]); ⟨τζ⟩ stands for  [d͡z] and ⟨τσ⟩ stands for  [t͡s] In addition, both in Ancient and Modern Greek, the letter ⟨γ⟩, before another velar consonant, stands for the velar nasal  [ŋ]; thus ⟨γγ⟩ and ⟨γκ⟩ are pronounced like English ⟨ng⟩ like in the word finger (not like in the word thing) In analogy to ⟨μπ⟩ and ⟨ντ⟩, ⟨γκ⟩ is also used to stand for  [g] before vowels  [a],  [o] and  [u], and  [ɟ] before  [e] and  [i] There are also the combinations ⟨γχ⟩ and ⟨γξ⟩.\n\n\nDiacritics\nIn the polytonic orthography traditionally used for ancient Greek and katharevousa, the stressed vowel of each word carries one of three accent marks: either the acute accent (ά), the grave accent (ὰ), or the circumflex accent (α̃ or α̑) These signs were originally designed to mark different forms of the phonological pitch accent in Ancient Greek By the time their use became conventional and obligatory in Greek writing, in late antiquity, pitch accent was evolving into a single stress accent, and thus the three signs have not corresponded to a phonological distinction in actual speech ever since In addition to the accent marks, every word-initial vowel must carry either of two so-called \"breathing marks\": the rough breathing (ἁ), marking an /h/ sound at the beginning of a word, or the smooth breathing (ἀ), marking its absence The letter rho (ρ), although not a vowel, also carries rough breathing in a word-initial position If a rho was geminated within a word, the first ρ always had the smooth breathing and the second the rough breathing (ῤῥ) leading to the transliteration rrh.\n\n\nRomanization\nThere are many different methods of rendering Greek text or Greek names in the Latin script [32] The form in which classical Greek names are conventionally rendered in English goes back to the way Greek loanwords were incorporated into Latin in antiquity [33] In this system, ⟨κ⟩ is replaced with ⟨c⟩, the diphthongs ⟨αι⟩ and ⟨οι⟩ are rendered as ⟨ae⟩ and ⟨oe⟩ (or ⟨æ,œ⟩); and ⟨ει⟩ and ⟨ου⟩ are simplified to ⟨i⟩ and ⟨u⟩ [34] Smooth breathing marks are usually ignored and rough breathing marks are usually rendered as the letter ⟨h⟩ [35] In modern scholarly transliteration of Ancient Greek, ⟨κ⟩ will usually be rendered as ⟨k⟩, and the vowel combinations ⟨αι, οι, ει, ου⟩ as ⟨ai, oi, ei, ou⟩ [32] The letters ⟨θ⟩ and ⟨φ⟩ are generally rendered as ⟨th⟩ and ⟨ph⟩; ⟨χ⟩ as either ⟨ch⟩ or ⟨kh⟩; and word-initial ⟨ρ⟩ as ⟨rh⟩ [36]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the Mycenaean period, from around the sixteenth century to the twelfth century BC, a script called Linear B was used to write the earliest attested form of the Greek language, known as Mycenaean Greek This writing system, unrelated to the Greek alphabet, last appeared in the thirteenth century BC [8] Inscription written in the Greek alphabet begin to emerge from the eighth century BC onward While early evidence of Greek letters may date no later than 770 BC, [41] the oldest known substantial and legible Greek alphabet texts, such as the Dipylon inscription and Nestor's cup, date from c. 740/30 BC [42] It is accepted that the introduction of the alphabet occurred some time prior to these inscriptions [43] While earlier dates have been proposed, the Greek alphabet is commonly held to have originated some time in the late ninth [44] or early eighth century BC, [45] conventionally around the year 800 BC [46]\n\n\nOrigins\nDuring the Mycenaean period, from around the sixteenth century to the twelfth

[45] conventionally around the year 800 BC [46]\n\n\nArchaic variants\nThere were initially numerous local (epichoric) variants of the Greek alphabet, which differed in the use and non-use of the additional vowel and consonant symbols and several other features Epichoric alphabets are commonly divided into four major types according to their different treatments of additional consonant letters for the aspirated consonants (/pʰ, kʰ/) and consonant clusters (/ks, ps/) of Greek [51] These four types are often conventionally labelled as \"green\", \"red\", \"light blue\" and \"dark blue\" types, based on a colour-coded map in a seminal 19th-century work on the topic, Studien zur Geschichte des griechischen Alphabets by Adolf Kirchhoff (1867) [51]\n\n\nLetter names\nWhen the Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet, they took over not only the letter shapes and sound values but also the names by which the sequence of the alphabet could be recited and memorized In Phoenician, each letter name was a word that began with the sound represented by that letter; thus ʾaleph, the word for \"ox\", was used as the name for the glottal stop /ʔ/, bet, or \"house\", for the /b/ sound, and so on When the letters were adopted by the Greeks, most of the Phoenician names were maintained or modified slightly to fit Greek phonology; thus, ʾaleph, bet, gimel became alpha, beta, gamma.\n\n\nLetter shapes\nLike Latin and other alphabetic scripts, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter, without a distinction between uppercase and lowercase This distinction is an innovation of the modern era, drawing on different lines of development of the letter shapes in earlier handwriting.\n\n\nDerived alphabets\nThe Greek alphabet was the model for various others: [9]\n\n\nOther uses\nApart from the daughter alphabets listed above, which were adapted from Greek but developed into separate writing systems, the Greek alphabet has also been adopted at various times and in various places to write other languages [62] For some of them, additional letters were introduced.\n\n\nUse for other languages\nApart from the daughter alphabets listed above, which were adapted from Greek but developed into separate writing systems, the Greek alphabet has also been adopted at various times and in various places to write other languages [62] For some of them, additional letters were introduced.\n\n\nAntiquity\nGreek symbols are used as symbols in mathematics, physics and other sciences Many symbols have traditional uses, such as lower case epsilon (ε) for an arbitrarily small positive number, lower case pi (π) for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, capital sigma (Σ) for summation, and lower case sigma (σ) for standard deviation For many years the Greek alphabet was used by the World Meteorological Organization for naming North Atlantic hurricanes if a season was so active that it exhausted the regular list of storm names This happened during the 2005 season (when Alpha through Zeta were used), and the 2020 season (when Alpha through Iota were used), after which the practice was discontinued [80] [81] In May 2021 the World Health Organization announced that the variants of SARS-CoV-2 of the virus would be named using letters of the Greek alphabet to avoid stigma and simplify communications for non-scientific audiences [82] [83]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nGreek symbols are used as symbols in mathematics, physics and other sciences Many symbols have traditional uses, such as lower case epsilon (ε) for an arbitrarily

[83]\n\n\nAstronomy\nGreek letters are used to denote the brighter stars within each of the eighty-eight constellations In most constellations, the brightest star is designated Alpha and the next brightest Beta etc For example, the brightest star in the constellation of Centaurus is known as Alpha Centauri For historical reasons, the Greek designations of some constellations begin with a lower ranked letter.\n\n\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet\nSeveral Greek letters are used as phonetic symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) [84] Several of them denote fricative consonants; the rest stand for variants of vowel sounds The glyph shapes used for these letters in specialized phonetic fonts is sometimes slightly different from the conventional shapes in Greek typography proper, with glyphs typically being more upright and using serifs, to make them conform more with the typographical character of other, Latin-based letters in the phonetic alphabet Nevertheless, in the Unicode encoding standard, the following three phonetic symbols are considered the same characters as the corresponding Greek letters proper: [85]\n\n\nUse as numerals\nGreek letters were also used to write numbers In the classical Ionian system, the first nine letters of the alphabet stood for the numbers from 1 to 9, the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 10, from 10 to 90, and the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 100, from 100 to 900 For this purpose, in addition to the 24 letters which by that time made up the standard alphabet, three otherwise obsolete letters were retained or revived: digamma ⟨Ϝ⟩ for 6, koppa ⟨Ϙ⟩ for 90, and a rare Ionian letter for  [ss], today called sampi ⟨Ͳ⟩, for 900 This system has remained in use in Greek up to the present day, although today it is only employed for limited purposes such as enumerating chapters in a book, similar to the way Roman numerals are used in English The three extra symbols are today written as ⟨ϛ⟩, ⟨ϟ⟩ and ⟨ϡ⟩ To mark a letter as a numeral sign, a small stroke called keraia is added to the right of it.\n\n\nUse by student fraternities and sororities\nIn North America, many college fraternities and sororities are named with combinations of Greek letters, and are hence also known as \"Greek letter organizations\" [86] This naming tradition was initiated by the foundation of the Phi Beta Kappa Society at the College of William and Mary in 1776 [86] The name of this fraternal organization is an acronym for the ancient Greek phrase Φιλοσοφία Βίου Κυβερνήτης (Philosophia Biou Kybernētēs), which means \"Love of wisdom, the guide of life\" and serves as the organization's motto [86] Sometimes early fraternal organizations were known by their Greek letter names because the mottos that these names stood for were secret and revealed only to members of the fraternity [86]\n\n\nGlyph variants\nSome letters can occur in variant shapes, mostly inherited from medieval minuscule handwriting While their use in normal typography of Greek is purely a matter of font styles, some such variants have been given separate encodings in Unicode.\n\n\nComputer encodings\nFor computer usage, a variety of encodings have been used for Greek online, many of them documented in RFC 1947.\n\n\nISO/IEC 8859-7\nFor the range A0–FF (hex), it follows the Unicode range 370–3CF (see below) except that some symbols, like ©, ½, § etc are used where Unicode has unused locations Like all ISO-8859 encodings, it is equal to ASCII for 00–7F (hex).\n\n\nGreek in Unicode\nUnicode supports polytonic orthography well enough for ordinary continuous text in modern and ancient Greek, and even many archaic forms for epigraphy With the use of combining characters, Unicode also supports Greek philology and dialectology and various other specialized requirements Most current text rendering engines do not render diacritics well, so, though alpha with macron and acute can be represented as U+03B1 U+0304 U+0301, this rarely renders well: ᾱ́ [citation needed]\n\n\nCombining and letter-free diacritics\nCombining and spacing (letter-free) diacritical marks pertaining to Greek language:\n\n\nEncodings with a subset of the Greek alphabet\nIBM code pages 437, 860, 861, 862, 863, and 865 contain the letters ΓΘΣΦΩαδεπστφ (plus β as an alternative interpretation for ß).\n\n\nSee

over 2,500 years. It is the basis for the modern Greek language, as well as the source of many of the letters used in the English alphabet. The Greek alphabet is unique in that it has a rich history and has been used for a wide range of purposes, including writing and poetry, mathematics and science, and even the naming of constellations.\n\nLetters\n--------\n\nIn both Ancient and Modern Greek, the letters of the Greek alphabet have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable.

Epichoric alphabets are commonly divided into four major types according to their different treatments of additional consonant letters for the aspirated consonants (/pʰ, kʰ/) and consonant clusters (/ks, ps/) of Greek.\n\nLetter Names\n------------\n\nWhen the Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet, they took over not only the letter shapes and sound values but also the names by which the sequence of the alphabet could be recited and memorized. In Phoenician, each letter name was a word that began with the sound represented by that letter; thus ʾaleph, the word for \"ox\", was used as the name for the glottal stop /ʔ/, bet, or \"house\", for the /b/ sound, and so on.\n\nLetter Shapes\n--------------\n\nLike Latin and other alphabetic scripts, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter, without a distinction between uppercase and lowercase. This distinction is an innovation of the modern era, drawing on different lines of development of the letter shapes in earlier handwriting.\n\nDerived Alphabets\n-----------------\n\nThe Greek alphabet was the model for various others. The most direct descendant of the Greek alphabet is the Cyrillic script, which was created in the 9th century AD for the Slavic languages. The Cyrillic script has been adapted for various languages and has undergone significant changes over time.\n\nUse for Other Languages\n----------------------\n\nApart from the daughter alphabets listed above, which were adapted from Greek but developed into separate writing systems, the Greek alphabet has also been adopted at various times and in various places to write other languages. For some of them, additional letters were introduced.\n\nAntiquity\n---------\n\nGreek symbols are used as symbols in mathematics, physics, and other sciences. Many symbols have traditional uses, such as lower case epsilon (ε) for an arbitrarily small positive number, lower case pi (π) for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, capital sigma (Σ) for summation, and lower case sigma (σ) for standard deviation.\n\nMiddle Ages\n------------\n\nGreek symbols are used as symbols in mathematics, physics, and other sciences.

In most constellations, the brightest star is designated Alpha and the next brightest Beta etc.\n\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet\n-----------------------------\n\nSeveral Greek letters are used as phonetic symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Several of them denote fricative consonants; the rest stand for variants of vowel sounds.\n\nUse as Numerals\n----------------\n\nGreek letters were also used to write numbers. In the classical Ionian system, the first nine letters of the alphabet stood for the numbers from 1 to 9, the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 10, from 10 to 90, and the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 100, from 100 to 900.\n\nUse by Student Fraternities and Sororities\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn North America, many college fraternities and sororities are named with combinations of Greek letters, and are hence also known as \"Greek letter organizations\". This naming tradition was initiated by the foundation of the Phi Beta Kappa Society at the College of William and Mary in 1776.\n\nGlyph Variants\n--------------\n\nSome letters can occur in variant shapes, mostly inherited from medieval minuscule handwriting. While their use in normal typography of Greek is purely a matter of font styles, some such variants have been given separate encodings in Unicode.\n\nComputer Encodings\n------------------\n\nFor computer usage, a variety of encodings have been used for Greek online, many of them documented in RFC 1947.\n\nISO/IEC 8859-7\n----------------\n\nFor the range A0–FF (hex), it follows the Unicode range 370–3CF (see below) except that some symbols, like , ½, § etc are used where Unicode has unused locations.\n\nGreek in Unicode\n------------------\n\nUnicode supports polytonic orthography well enough for ordinary continuous text in modern and ancient Greek, and even many archaic forms for epigraphy.

\"Greek_alphabet\" following this outline:\n\n\nLetters\nIn both Ancient and Modern Greek, the letters of the Greek alphabet have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable Ancient Greek spelling was generally near-phonemic For a number of letters, sound values differ considerably between Ancient and Modern Greek, because their pronunciation has followed a set of systematic phonological shifts that affected the language in its post-classical stages [12]\n\n\nSound values\nIn both Ancient and Modern Greek, the letters of the Greek alphabet have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable Ancient Greek spelling was generally near-phonemic For a number of letters, sound values differ considerably between Ancient and Modern Greek, because their pronunciation has followed a set of systematic phonological shifts that affected the language in its post-classical stages [12]\n\n\nDigraphs and letter combinations\nSeveral letter combinations have special conventional sound values different from those of their single components Among them are several digraphs of vowel letters that formerly represented diphthongs but are now monophthongized In addition to the four mentioned above (⟨ει, οι, υι⟩, pronounced /i/ and ⟨αι⟩, pronounced /e/), there is also ⟨ηι, ωι⟩, and ⟨ου⟩, pronounced /u/ The Ancient Greek diphthongs ⟨αυ⟩, ⟨ευ⟩ and ⟨ηυ⟩ are pronounced  [av],  [ev] and  [iv] in Modern Greek In some environments, they are devoiced to  [af],  [ef] and  [if] [28] The Modern Greek consonant combinations ⟨μπ⟩ and ⟨ντ⟩ stand for  [b] and  [d] (or  [mb] and  [nd]); ⟨τζ⟩ stands for  [d͡z] and ⟨τσ⟩ stands for  [t͡s] In addition, both in Ancient and Modern Greek, the letter ⟨γ⟩, before another velar consonant, stands for the velar nasal  [ŋ]; thus ⟨γγ⟩ and ⟨γκ⟩ are pronounced like English ⟨ng⟩ like in the word finger (not like in the word thing) In analogy to ⟨μπ⟩ and ⟨ντ⟩, ⟨γκ⟩ is also used to stand for  [g] before vowels  [a],  [o] and  [u], and  [ɟ] before  [e] and  [i] There are also the combinations ⟨γχ⟩ and ⟨γξ⟩.\n\n\nDiacritics\nIn the polytonic orthography traditionally used for ancient Greek and katharevousa, the stressed vowel of each word carries one of three accent marks: either the acute accent (ά), the grave accent (ὰ), or the circumflex accent (α̃ or α̑) These signs were originally designed to mark different forms of the phonological pitch accent in Ancient Greek By the time their use became conventional and obligatory in Greek writing, in late antiquity, pitch accent was evolving into a single stress accent, and thus the three signs have not corresponded to a phonological distinction in actual speech ever since In addition to the accent marks, every word-initial vowel must carry either of two so-called \"breathing marks\": the rough breathing (ἁ), marking an /h/ sound at the beginning of a word, or the smooth breathing (ἀ), marking its absence The letter rho (ρ), although not a vowel, also carries rough breathing in a word-initial position If a rho was geminated within a word, the first ρ always had the smooth breathing and the second the rough breathing (ῤῥ) leading to the transliteration rrh.\n\n\nRomanization\nThere are many different methods of rendering Greek text or Greek names in the Latin script [32] The form in which classical Greek names are conventionally rendered in English goes back to the way Greek loanwords were incorporated into Latin in antiquity [33] In this system, ⟨κ⟩ is replaced with ⟨c⟩, the diphthongs ⟨αι⟩ and ⟨οι⟩ are rendered as ⟨ae⟩ and ⟨oe⟩ (or ⟨æ,œ⟩); and ⟨ει⟩ and ⟨ου⟩ are simplified to ⟨i⟩ and ⟨u⟩ [34] Smooth breathing marks are usually ignored and rough breathing marks are usually rendered as the letter ⟨h⟩ [35] In modern scholarly transliteration of Ancient Greek, ⟨κ⟩ will usually be rendered as ⟨k⟩, and the vowel combinations ⟨αι, οι, ει, ου⟩ as ⟨ai, oi, ei, ou⟩ [32] The letters ⟨θ⟩ and ⟨φ⟩ are generally rendered as ⟨th⟩ and ⟨ph⟩; ⟨χ⟩ as either ⟨ch⟩ or ⟨kh⟩; and word-initial ⟨ρ⟩ as ⟨rh⟩ [36]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the Mycenaean period, from around the sixteenth century to the twelfth century BC, a script called Linear B was used to write the earliest attested form of the Greek language, known as Mycenaean Greek This writing system, unrelated to the Greek alphabet, last appeared in the thirteenth century BC [8] Inscription written in the Greek alphabet begin to emerge from the eighth century BC onward While early evidence of Greek letters may date no later than 770 BC, [41] the oldest known substantial and legible Greek alphabet texts, such as the Dipylon inscription and Nestor's cup, date from c. 740/30 BC [42] It is accepted that the introduction of the alphabet occurred some time prior to these inscriptions [43] While earlier dates have been proposed, the Greek alphabet is commonly held to have originated some time in the late ninth [44] or early eighth century BC, [45] conventionally around the year 800 BC [46]\n\n\nOrigins\nDuring the Mycenaean period, from around the sixteenth century to the twelfth

additional vowel and consonant symbols and several other features Epichoric alphabets are commonly divided into four major types according to their different treatments of additional consonant letters for the aspirated consonants (/pʰ, kʰ/) and consonant clusters (/ks, ps/) of Greek [51] These four types are often conventionally labelled as \"green\", \"red\", \"light blue\" and \"dark blue\" types, based on a colour-coded map in a seminal 19th-century work on the topic, Studien zur Geschichte des griechischen Alphabets by Adolf Kirchhoff (1867) [51]\n\n\nLetter names\nWhen the Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet, they took over not only the letter shapes and sound values but also the names by which the sequence of the alphabet could be recited and memorized In Phoenician, each letter name was a word that began with the sound represented by that letter; thus ʾaleph, the word for \"ox\", was used as the name for the glottal stop /ʔ/, bet, or \"house\", for the /b/ sound, and so on When the letters were adopted by the Greeks, most of the Phoenician names were maintained or modified slightly to fit Greek phonology; thus, ʾaleph, bet, gimel became alpha, beta, gamma.\n\n\nLetter shapes\nLike Latin and other alphabetic scripts, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter, without a distinction between uppercase and lowercase This distinction is an

For many years the Greek alphabet was used by the World Meteorological Organization for naming North Atlantic hurricanes if a season was so active that it exhausted the regular list of storm names This happened during the 2005 season (when Alpha through Zeta were used), and the 2020 season (when Alpha through Iota were used), after which the practice was discontinued [80] [81] In May 2021 the World Health Organization announced that the variants of SARS-CoV-2 of the virus would be named using letters of the Greek alphabet to avoid stigma and simplify communications for non-scientific

brightest Beta etc For example, the brightest star in the constellation of Centaurus is known as Alpha Centauri For historical reasons, the Greek designations of some constellations begin with a lower ranked letter.\n\n\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet\nSeveral Greek letters are used as phonetic symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) [84] Several of them denote fricative consonants; the rest stand for variants of vowel sounds The glyph shapes used for these letters in specialized phonetic fonts is sometimes slightly different from the conventional shapes in Greek typography proper, with glyphs typically being more upright and using serifs, to make them conform more with the typographical character of other, Latin-based letters in the phonetic alphabet Nevertheless, in the Unicode encoding standard, the following three phonetic symbols are considered the same characters as the corresponding Greek letters proper: [85]\n\n\nUse as numerals\nGreek letters were also used to write numbers In the classical Ionian system, the first nine letters of the alphabet stood for the numbers from 1 to 9, the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 10, from 10 to 90, and the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 100, from 100 to 900 For this purpose, in addition to the 24 letters which by that time made up the standard alphabet, three otherwise obsolete letters were retained or revived: digamma ⟨Ϝ⟩ for 6, koppa ⟨Ϙ⟩ for 90, and a rare Ionian letter for  [ss], today called sampi ⟨Ͳ⟩, for 900 This system has remained in use in Greek up to the present day, although today it is only employed for limited purposes such as enumerating chapters in a book, similar to the way Roman numerals are used in English The three extra symbols are today written as ⟨ϛ⟩, ⟨ϟ⟩ and ⟨ϡ⟩ To mark a letter as a numeral sign, a small stroke called keraia is added to the right of it.\n\n\nUse by student fraternities and sororities\nIn North America, many college fraternities and sororities are named with combinations of Greek letters, and are hence also known as \"Greek letter organizations\" [86] This naming tradition was initiated by the foundation of the Phi Beta Kappa Society at the College of William and Mary in 1776 [86] The name of this fraternal organization is an acronym for the ancient Greek phrase Φιλοσοφία Βίου Κυβερνήτης (Philosophia Biou Kybernētēs), which means \"Love of wisdom, the guide of life\" and serves as the organization's motto [86] Sometimes early fraternal organizations were known by their Greek letter names because the mottos that these names stood for were secret and revealed only to members of the fraternity [86]\n\n\nGlyph variants\nSome letters can occur in variant shapes, mostly inherited from medieval minuscule handwriting While their use in normal typography of Greek is purely a matter of font styles, some such variants have been given separate encodings in Unicode.\n\n\nComputer encodings\nFor computer usage, a variety of encodings have been used for Greek online, many of them documented in RFC 1947.\n\n\nISO/IEC 8859-7\nFor the range A0–FF (hex), it follows the Unicode range 370–3CF (see below) except that some symbols, like ©, ½, § etc are used where Unicode has unused locations Like all ISO-8859 encodings, it is equal to ASCII for 00–7F (hex).\n\n\nGreek in Unicode\nUnicode supports polytonic orthography well enough for ordinary continuous text in modern and ancient Greek, and even many archaic forms for epigraphy With the use of combining characters, Unicode also supports Greek philology and dialectology and various other specialized requirements Most current text rendering engines do not render diacritics well, so, though alpha with macron and acute can be represented as U+03B1 U+0304 U+0301, this rarely renders well: ᾱ́ [citation needed]\n\n\nCombining and letter-free diacritics\nCombining and spacing (letter-free) diacritical marks pertaining to Greek

Emergency Situations (1991–2012)\nIn 1991, Yeltsin appointed him head of the newly established Russian Rescue Corps, responsible for the rescue and disaster response system The Rescue Corps replaced the previous Soviet civil defense system and soon absorbed the 20,000-strong militarized Civil Defense Troops of the Ministry of Defense, with Shoigu being appointed chairman of the State Committee of the Russian Federation for Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Disaster Response Civil Defense remained a quasi-military organization in continuation of Soviet practice and Shoigu was politically involved, such as an unsuccessful attempt to evacuate Russian-backed Afghan president Mohammad Najibullah in 1992 and the intended distribution of weapons from the Civil Defense stocks to Yeltsin supporters during the October 1993 coup In keeping with the militarized nature of Russian civil defense, Shoigu received the rank of major general in 1993, [12] and was promoted swiftly to lieutenant general in 1995, [13] colonel general in 1998, [14] and to army general, in practice the highest Russian military rank, in 2003 [15] The committee was renamed the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MChS) in 1994, making Shoigu a government minister He became popular because of his hands-on management style and high visibility during emergency situations, such as floods, earthquakes and acts of terrorism [8] Under Shoigu, the responsibilities of the ministry were expanded to take over the Russian State Fire Service in 2002, making the MChS Russia's third-largest force structure [16]\n\n\nGovernor of Moscow Oblast (2012)\nWith over twenty years of service as Minister of Emergency Situations, Shoigu established a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, and was rewarded by being appointed Governor of Moscow Oblast in 2012, [19] taking office on 11 May of that year [20]\n\n\nMinister of Defence (2012–2024)\nOn 6 November 2012, Shoigu was appointed Minister of Defence by Putin, succeeding Anatoly Serdyukov, who had implemented sweeping reforms of the Russian Armed Forces in response to performance in the Russo-Georgian War According to expert Sergey Smirnov, the so called \"Petersburg group\" of siloviki (Sergei Ivanov, Sergey Chemezov and Viktor Ivanov) had wanted one of its associates to succeed Serdyukov, but Putin was reluctant to strengthen the clan and opted for the neutral Shoigu [21] As defence minister, Shoigu on multiple occasions accompanied Putin during weekend breaks that the pair would spend at undisclosed locations in the Siberian countryside [22]\n\n\nActivities related to treaties and military exercises\nFrom early 2013 the Shoigu ministry made use of snap exercises as a means to ensure combat readiness of the Eastern Military District, the Western Military District, and the Central Military District Already in 2015 western observers mentioned the Vienna Document while they spoke of \"the deteriorating European security environment. producing an action-reaction cycle involving Russia, NATO and other European countries, all seeking to demonstrate the readiness of their armed forces.\" [29]\n\n\nActivities related to the revolution in Ukraine\nIn July 2014, Ukraine opened a criminal case against Shoigu He was accused of helping to form \"illegal military groups\" in Eastern Ukraine who at the time fought against the Ukrainian army [32] The Ukrainian authorities alleged that Shoigu coordinated all of DPR Supreme Commander Igor Girkin's actions, supplying him and \"other terrorist leaders\" with \"the most destructive weapons\" since May and instructing him directly, with Putin's approval [33]\n\n\nActivities related to Syria\nOn 30 September 2015, Russia began a military operation in Syria The operation was carried out by the Russian Aerospace Forces, with the support of the Russian Navy and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian Armed Forces.\n\n\nIn Medvedev government\nShoigu was reappointed as defence minister in 2018 in the Medvedev second government [55]\n\n\nIn Mishustin government\nShoigu was reappointed as defence minister in 2020 in the Mishustin government [56]\n\n\nActivities related to 2022 invasion of Ukraine\nOn 29 August 2021, Shoigu was recorded as saying that \"Russia doesn't consider Ukraine as threat\", while he expressed the hope that the situation in Ukraine would ultimately change and the \"nationalist mayhem\" would be stopped Shoigu said that the Ukrainians \"are not just our neighbors, we are a single people\" [58] [unreliable source?]\n\n\nFalling out with Wagner\nOn 5 May 2023, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin blamed Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov for \"tens of thousands\" of Wagner casualties, saying \"Shoigu, Gerasimov, where .. is the ammunition? They came here as volunteers and are dying so you can sit like fat cats in your luxury offices.\" [101]\n\n\nSecretary of the Security Council\nOn 12 May 2024, soon after Putin's re-election, Shoigu replaced Nikolai Patrushev as Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation [106] [107] According to analysts, the replacement of Sergei Shoigu by Andrey Belousov as defense minister signals that Putin is preparing for a long war of attrition against Ukraine [108]\n\n\nSanctions\nOn 23 February 2022, the European Union considered Shoigu responsible for actively supporting and implementing actions and policies that undermine and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine as well as the stability or security in Ukraine Therefore the European Union added Shoigu to the list of natural and legal persons, entities and bodies set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 269/2014 [113]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAccording to The Siberian Times, Shoigu is a polyglot who is known to speak eight languages other than Russian fluently, including English, Japanese, Chinese, Tuvan, and Turkish [117] [unreliable source?] [118]\n\n\nFamily\nSergei Shoigu was born to Kuzhuget Sereevich Shoigu (1921–2010) and Alexandra Yakovlevna Shoigu (née Kudryavtseva, 1924–2011) [119] His father was born Shoigu Seree oglu Kuzhuget His name order was changed because of a passport error, according to the Tuva official line More likely, he Russified the name from Turkic oglu 'son of...' [citation needed] Kuzhuget was an editor of a regional newspaper He later worked in the Communist Party and for the Soviet authorities He was the secretary of the Tuva Party Committee He retired with the rank of first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Tuva ASSR [119]\n\n\nHobbies\nShoigu enjoys studying the history of Russia, especially Peter the Great's time and the era between 1812 and 1825 (which includes the French invasion of Russia and the Decembrist revolt) [132]\n\n\nReligion\nShoigu stated in 2008 that he was baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church at the age of five, rebutting rumors that he was a practitioner of shamanism or Buddhism like many Tuvans [136]\n\n\nHonours\n\n\nRussian\n\n\nForeign\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on September 7, 1951, in Akron, Ohio, Hynde's career spans over four decades, with a distinctive voice and style that has influenced many artists.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHynde was born to a part-time secretary and a Yellow Pages manager, and grew up in nearby Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. She graduated from Firestone High School in Akron, but stated that she was never too interested in high school, preferring to spend her time attending concerts and seeing bands. This exposure to music at a young age had a profound impact on her, and she developed a passion for rock music that would shape her future.\n\nHynde's interest in hippie counterculture, Eastern mysticism, and vegetarianism also began at a young age. While attending Kent State University's Art School for three years, she joined Sat Sun Mat., a band that included Mark Mothersbaugh, later of Devo. This early experience in music would lay the foundation for her future success.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nIn 1978, Hynde made a demo tape and gave it to Dave Hill, owner of the label Real Records. Hill stepped in to manage her career, paying off the back rent owed on her rehearsal room in Covent Garden, London. He advised Hynde to take her time and get a band together. The following spring, she met bass guitarist Pete Farndon and selected a band consisting of James Honeyman-Scott (guitar, vocals, keyboards), and Martin Chambers (drums, vocals, percussion). The name the Pretenders was inspired by the Sam Cooke version of the Platters' 1955 R&B hit song \"The Great Pretender\".\n\n**The Pretenders**\n\nThe Pretenders formed in 1978 and released their debut single, \"Stop Your Sobbing\", in 1979. The band's music was a fusion of rock, pop, and punk, with Hynde's distinctive vocals and guitar work taking center stage. The Pretenders quickly gained a loyal following and released their debut album, \"Pretenders\", in 1980. The album was a critical and commercial success, with hits like \"Precious\" and \"Tattooed Love Boys\".\n\nOver the next decade, the Pretenders released several successful albums, including \"Learning to Crawl\" (1984), \"Get Close\" (1986), and \"Packed!\" (1987). The band's music continued to evolve, incorporating new styles and sounds, but always retaining Hynde's signature voice and style.\n\n**Other Musical Projects**\n\nIn addition to her work with the Pretenders, Hynde has collaborated with other artists on various projects. She sang backing vocals on Mick Farren's 1978 album \"Vampires Stole My Lunch Money\" and also on Hurt by Chris Spedding. Hynde also sang backing on a track, \"Nite Klub\", on the Specials' eponymous debut album. In 1993, she sang a duet with INXS on their album \"Full Moon, Dirty Hearts\". She appears on the title track of the album.\n\nHynde has also provided backing vocals on Morrissey's single \"My Love Life\" in 1991 and again on b-side \"Shame Is The Name\" in 2009.\n\n**Artistry and Influence**\n\nHynde has a contralto vocal range and has been praised for her distinctive voice and style. She has stated that she eschews formal voice training, preferring to develop her voice through her own experiences and emotions. In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Hynde at number 114 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBorn in the United States, Hynde has long maintained dual citizenship with the UK. In the 1970s, she asked both Sid Vicious and Johnny Rotten to marry her, but neither did. She then went back to the US briefly before returning to the UK.\n\n**Autobiography**\n\nHynde published an autobiography, \"Reckless: My Life as a Pretender\", on September 8, 2015.\n\n**Restaurant Venture**\n\nHynde opened the VegiTerranean, a vegan restaurant, in the Northside Lofts, Akron, Ohio, in November 2007. The restaurant served fusion Italian-Mediterranean food by head chef James Scot Jones. Before the restaurant's opening on September 15, 2007, Hynde performed three songs at the restaurant with Adam Seymour, a former lead guitarist of the Pretenders. The restaurant was voted among the top five vegan restaurants in the U.S. It closed on October 2, 2011, owing to the economic climate, according to Hynde.\n\n**Discography**\n\nThe Pretenders have released numerous albums and singles over the years, including:\n\n* \"Pretenders\" (1980)\n* \"Learning to Crawl\" (1984)\n* \"Get Close\" (1986)\n* \"Packed!\" (1987)\n* \"Loose Screw\" (1994)\n* \"Last of the Independents\" (1994)\n* \"Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1998)\n* \"Songs for the Lonely\" (2005)\n* \"Break Up the Concrete\" (2008)\n* \"Alone\" (2016)\n* \"Hate for Sale\" (2020)\n\n**Singles**\n\nThe Pretenders have released numerous singles over the years, including:\n\n* \"Stop Your Sobbing\" (1979)\n* \"Precious\" (1980)\n* \"Tattooed Love Boys\" (1980)\n* \"Brass in Pocket\" (1980)\n* \"I'll Stand By You\" (1994)\n* \"Back on the Chain Gang\" (1982)\n* \"My City Was Gone\" (1984)\n* \"Thumbelina\" (1986)\n* \"Middle of the Road\" (1986)\n* \"Don't Get Me Wrong\" (1986)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Hynde has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Pretenders.\n* She has won numerous awards, including a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for \"I'll Stand By You\".\n* Hynde has been praised for her activism and philanthropy, particularly in the area of animal rights.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Chrissie Hynde: The Biography\". 2015.

{"title": "Shooting_of_Shinzo_Abe", "content": "\nBackground\nShinzo Abe had served as Prime Minister of Japan between 2006 and 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020, when he resigned due to health concerns [17] He was the longest-serving prime minister in Japan's history His maternal grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was himself prime minister from 1957 to 1960, and like Abe, was the target of an assassination attempt, which he survived, unlike Abe [18]\n\n\nRelationship between Abe's family and the Unification Church\nAbe, as well as his father Shintaro Abe and his grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, had longstanding ties to the Unification Church (UC), a new religious movement known for its mass wedding ceremonies [22] Known officially as the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (FFWPU), the movement was founded by Sun Myung Moon in South Korea in 1954 and its followers are colloquially known as \"Moonies\" Moon was a self-declared messiah and ardent anti-communist [23]\n\n\nUnification Church practices in Japan\nThe Japanese government certified the UC as a religious organisation in 1964; the Agency for Cultural Affairs classifies the UC as a Christian organisation [43] Since then, the government was unable to prevent the UC's activities because of the freedom of religion guaranteed in the Constitution of Japan, according to Mitsuhiro Suganuma  [ja], the former section head of the Public Security Intelligence Agency's Second Intelligence Department [44]\n\n\nTimeline\nAbe was initially scheduled to deliver a speech in Nagano Prefecture on 8 July 2022 in support of Sanshirō Matsuyama  [ja], an LDP candidate in upcoming elections to the House of Councillors [55] That event was abruptly cancelled on 7 July [55] following allegations of misconduct and corruption related to Matsuyama, [56] [57] and was replaced by a similar event in Nara Prefecture at which Abe was to deliver a speech in support of Kei Satō, an LDP councillor running for re-election [58] The LDP division in Nara Prefecture stated this new schedule was not generally publicly known, [59] but NHK reported that the event had been widely advertised on Twitter and by sound truck [60] Nara police and Satō's campaign staff inspected the site on the evening before the incident, and the head of the prefectural police had approved of the security plan a few hours before the incident; one prefectural assembly member later said, \"I thought it was a dangerous place that made it easy to attack former Prime Minister Abe from the cars and bicycles that pass along the road behind him\" [61]\n\n\nAbe's schedule\nAbe was initially scheduled to deliver a speech in Nagano Prefecture on 8 July 2022 in support of Sanshirō Matsuyama  [ja], an LDP candidate in upcoming elections to the House of Councillors [55] That event was abruptly cancelled on 7 July [55] following allegations of misconduct and corruption related to Matsuyama, [56] [57] and was replaced by a similar event in Nara Prefecture at which Abe was to deliver a speech in support of Kei Satō, an LDP councillor running for re-election [58] The LDP division in Nara Prefecture stated this new schedule was not generally publicly known, [59] but NHK reported that the event had been widely advertised on Twitter and by sound truck [60] Nara police and Satō's campaign staff inspected the site on the evening before the incident, and the head of the prefectural police had approved of the security plan a few hours before the incident; one prefectural assembly member later said, \"I thought it was a dangerous place that made it easy to attack former Prime Minister Abe from the cars and bicycles that pass along the road behind him\" [61]\n\n\nAttack\nWhile Abe was delivering his speech, the perpetrator, Tetsuya Yamagami, was able to approach within several metres, despite the presence of security [65] At around 11:30 am, when Abe said, \"Instead of thinking about why he  [Satō] cannot do it ...\" (「彼はできない理由を考えるのではなく…」), [66] he was shot at from behind with a homemade gun [a] [1] [71] resembling a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun capable of firing six bullets at a time [67] [71] [72] The first shot missed and prompted Abe to turn around, at which point a second shot was fired, hitting Abe in the neck and chest area [73] [74] [75] Abe then took a few steps forward, fell to his knees, and collapsed Abe's security detained the suspect, who did not resist [76] [77] According to security guards stationed during the assassination, the sound of the gunshot was very different from that of a conventional firearm, reminiscent of fireworks or tire blowout This may explain the delay of response from Abe's bodyguards after the first round of gunshot [78]\n\n\nTreatment\nParamedics arrived on the scene at 11:37 am, and an ambulance later arrived at 11:41 am [79] Police sources told NHK that Abe was initially conscious and responsive after being shot [80] A doctor who arrived at the scene said there were no signs indicating Abe was conscious [81] Shortly thereafter, he was transported to a local hospital by emergency helicopter with a wound to the right side of his neck and internal bleeding in his left chest, arriving approximately fifty minutes after being shot [82] He was reported to have no vital signs when he arrived at Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara, due to cardiopulmonary arrest prior to his arrival [83] [3] [84] At 2:45 pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that Abe was in critical condition and that \"doctors  [were] doing everything they  [could]\" [85]\n\n\nDeath declaration\nAbe's wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55 pm [86] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead at the hospital at 5:03 pm, around five and a half hours after being shot [6] [87] [88] He was 67 years old Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of blood [b] [90] [91] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets [92] and that one bullet was not found in Abe's body [93] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone [94]\n\n\nVisitations\nSeveral hours after the assassination, both former prime minister Yoshihide Suga [95] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital where Abe's body was being held [96]\n\n\nSuspect\nTetsuya Yamagami (山上 徹也), a resident of Nara, was arrested at the scene of the assassination He was 41 years old, had no prior criminal history, and was unemployed at the time of his arrest [100] [101] [102] In his testimonies and letters, Yamagami claimed that he was driven by a grudge against the Unification Church for ruining his family Even though he originally planned to target Hak Ja Han, then president of the church, he was unable to approach her, so he switched to Shinzo Abe, who he believed was \"one of the most influential sympathisers\" of the church [103]\n\n\nAftermath\nAt 11:45 am, the Japanese government established a liaison office within the crisis management center of the Prime Minister's Office [112] [113] Kishida, who was campaigning in Sagae, Yamagata Prefecture, cancelled his remaining schedule and returned to Tokyo by 2:29 pm [114] [84] According to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, all other members of Kishida's cabinet were recalled to Tokyo except the foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, who was in Indonesia for the 2022 G20 Bali summit [115] Kishida later ordered heightened security for high-ranking politicians in Japan [116] Officers from the Security Police were deployed to protect Akie Abe after she arrived in Kyoto as a precautionary measure [117]\n\n\nEffects on election\nAt 11:45 am, the Japanese government established a liaison office within the crisis management center of the Prime Minister's Office [112] [113] Kishida, who was campaigning in Sagae, Yamagata Prefecture, cancelled his remaining schedule and returned to Tokyo by 2:29 pm [114] [84] According to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, all other members of Kishida's cabinet were recalled to Tokyo except the foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, who was in Indonesia for the 2022 G20 Bali summit [115] Kishida later ordered heightened security for high-ranking politicians in Japan [116] Officers from the Security Police were deployed to protect Akie Abe after she arrived in Kyoto as a precautionary measure [117]\n\n\nEffects on media broadcast\nNHK General TV, and four of Japan's five major commercial television networks, cancelled or postponed all scheduled programming to broadcast live news coverage for the rest of the day, as did several radio stations [121] [122] [123] [124] The second episode of the anime series Teppen—!!!, scheduled to air on 9 July, was announced to be cancelled, because its plot concerned an attempted assassination [125] [126] [127] [128] The episode aired on 10 September [129]\n\n\nNational Police Agency changes\nOn 20 August 2022, the National Police Agency announced that rules for conducting VIP protection will be revamped, which will also expand VIP protection training [130]\n\n\nResignation\nOn 25 August 2022, Commissioner General Itaru Nakamura of the National Police Agency said that he would resign from his post to take responsibility for the shooting incident on Abe The chief of the Nara Prefectural Police Tomoaki Onizuka and the director general of the National Police Agency's Security Bureau Kenichi Sakurazawa also announced their resignation [133]\n\n\nUnification Church–related\nThe Unification Church distanced itself from the assassination and confirmed the involvement of Yamagami's mother with it by Tomihiro Tanaka  [ja], the chair of the church's Tokyo branch, during a press conference on 11 July [134] [135]\nTanaka expressed his \"sorry and heartfelt\" condolences He confirmed that Yamagami was not a UC member, but his mother joined in 1998, [c] temporarily disappeared in 2009, and participated monthly in church events for the last half-year Tanaka stated that the mother was bankrupted around 2002, and there is no record of such donation requests He denied that resentment against the Church had led directly to the murder, and affirmed Church's will for cooperation with Police to establish a motive if asked [134] [137]\nTanaka also downplayed the alleged close tie between the organisation and Abe, stating that the former prime minister, not being a registered member or advisor, only delivered speeches for their \"friendly entity\", the UPF [138] [139]\n\n\nResponses by the Unification Church\nThe Unification Church distanced itself from the assassination and confirmed the involvement of Yamagami's mother with it by Tomihiro Tanaka  [ja], the chair of the church's Tokyo branch, during a press conference on 11 July [134] [135]\nTanaka expressed his \"sorry and heartfelt\" condolences He confirmed that Yamagami was not a UC member, but his mother joined in 1998, [c] temporarily disappeared in 2009, and participated monthly in church events for the last half-year Tanaka stated that the mother was bankrupted around 2002, and there is no record of such donation requests He denied that resentment against the Church had led directly to the murder, and affirmed Church's will for cooperation with Police to establish a motive if asked [134] [137]\nTanaka also downplayed the alleged close tie between the organisation and Abe, stating that the former prime minister, not being a registered member or advisor, only delivered speeches for their \"friendly entity\", the UPF [138] [139]\n\n\nResponses from the Kishida Cabinet\nThe assassination resulted in renewed public interest into the relationship between the UC and the LDP On 31 July 2022, Kishida demanded the members of his party to \"carefully explain\" their relationship with the church to the public [155] The alleged relationship caused the Kishida Cabinet's approval to drop, by 8% in July according to Yomiuri Shimbun [156] or by 13% according to NHK [157] Both polls also showed that over 80% of respondents felt that the disclosure by the politicians of their relationship with the UC was insufficient On 6 August, Kishida announced that he would reshuffle his cabinet on 10 August, much earlier than September 2022 as had been originally scheduled, and that all members of the next cabinet would be closely examined of their ties with the church [158] [159] Taro Kono, the newly appointed Minister of Digital Affairs in this reshuffle, established a \"Spiritual Sales Review Committee\" in the Consumer Affairs Agency to hold weekly meeting with experts in cult-related frauds, including Masaki Kito of the anti-cult lawyers network Zenkoku Benren [160] [161] In a 9 December 2022 consumer committee special meeting, Kono stated that he personally recognises the Unification Church as a \"cult\" [162]\n\n\nCivil responses\nAlmost a year before the assassination, in September 2021, the anti-cult lawyers group Zenkoku Benren sent an open protest letter to Shinzo Abe, after he had sent the video message to an online meeting of the Universal Peace Federation [164] In the letter, the lawyers protested that his video message constituted an \"endorsement,\" stating: \"We urge you to think carefully about this for the sake of your own honour.\" [165] [166]\n\n\nExamination of dissolving the Unification Church\nThe assassination raised discussion of stripping the UC of its \"legal entity of religious organization\" status based on Article 81 \"Dissolution Order\" of the Religious Juridical Person Law  [ja] which was only issued twice in Japan prior to Abe's assassination, the first being the Aum Shinrikyo in 1996 following the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack; the second being Myōkakuji (明覚寺) in Wakayama in January 2002 whose top officials had been convicted for employing fraudulent spiritual sales tactics to attract massive donations from their believers [172] [173] The rationales being that the UC was engaging in activities which were \"clearly detrimental to the public welfare\" and/or \"out of line with the purpose of the religious organization.\" [48] [174] Professor of constitutional law Shigeru Minamino  [ja] said that stripping the religious status of an organisation does not violate the religious freedom guaranteed by the Constitution of Japan, but it would merely strip them of benefits such as tax break enjoyed by a registered religious entity [175] In October 2022, the leaders of the Aum Shinrikyo's succeeding unregistered religious groups, Aleph and Hikari no Wa, answered to media interviews that their religious activities had not been hindered by the government since the 1996 dissolution order [176]\n\n\nLegislation to restrict donations to religious organisations and provide relief to victims\nOn 10 December 2022, the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors passed two bills to restrict the activities of religious organisations such as the UC and provide relief to victims [14] [186] These bills were designed to address social problems caused by the UC and the political parties and the media saw these bills as a way to restrict \"cults\" in the process leading up to the legislation [187] [188] [189] [190]\n\n\nCriticism on media integrity\nWhile Japanese media outlets faced accusations of vilification from the Unification Church after the assassination, they were also criticised for their silence on the scandal before this incident Le Figaro reported that in their initial reports about the suspect's motives, most Japanese news outlets were complicit in concealing the identity of the Unification Church, referring to it as a \"specific religious organisation\" (特定の宗教団体) [194] Journalist Eito Suzuki criticised the Japanese mainstream media for failing to monitor the relationship between the church and politicians until this incident [195] This inability to address societal issues is being likened to the scandal involving J-pop giant Johnny Kitagawa, during which media coverage of the scandal was seen as delayed [195] [196] [197] [198]\n\n\nOther impacts\nIn a readers' choice of the top ten news stories of 2022 held by Yomiuri Shimbun, Abe's assassination was ranked the most important news by 24,254 verified votes, which accounted for 91.2% of the total votes [199]\n\n\nWake and funeral\nIn the afternoon of 11 July, Abe's casket was transported to the Zōjō Temple in Shiba Park of the Minato ward of Tokyo, where several feudal shoguns are buried [201] [202] A wake for Abe began at 6:00 p.m [201] Over 2,500 people attended, according to the LDP [203]\n\n\nState funeral\nOn 14 July 2022, six days after the assassination, the Kishida Cabinet formally decided a state funeral of Abe to be held on 27 September at the Nippon Budokan [211] The cost of the entire ceremony would be paid by the national coffer, [212] drawn from the \"annual contingency fund\" which was meant for emergency situations like natural disasters [213] On 26 August, the cabinet approved a budget of 249.4 million yen (about US$1.8 million in August 2022) which did not include the cost of security, [214] but in an estimation announced by the cabinet on 6 September, the grand total of the actual cost with inclusion of security (800 million yen), hosting foreign dignitaries (600 million yen) and other miscellaneous cost (10 million yen) would be at least 1.66 billion yen [215] [216] The cabinet made the decision without seeking consensus in the parliament, but attempted to convince the opposing lawmakers after they finalised the decision [213] Kishida insisted pushing forward the state funeral on the grounds of Abe being the longest serving prime minister of Japan, as well as his achievements on domestic affairs and foreign policies [217] On the other hand, Kishida reaffirmed that, similar to Yoshida's state funeral, the government would only plead with, but not mandate the public to mourn Abe during his state funeral [218]\n\n\nAttendees\nKishida's determination to hold Abe's state funeral was described by the media as a form of \"funeral diplomacy  [ja]\" to convey his will to inherit Abe's legacy domestically and internationally [221] However, when compared to the state funeral of Elizabeth II held on 19 September, one week before Abe's state funeral, the media pointed out that the foreign dignitaries attending Abe's funeral were less influential, comprising mostly former heads of state, [9] [222] and none of the incumbent leaders of the G7 attended [223] [224] Nippon TV cited an anonymous government official who explained that many leaders who attended Elizabeth II's funeral were unsure if it was appropriate to conduct two consecutive trips abroad in such a short period of time [9] All-Nippon News cited another official who commented that there were almost no notable foreign dignitaries who could attend, and that Kishida was wrong for being overly optimistic of his \"funeral diplomacy\" plan [225] Among those who received but eventually turned down invitations were Barack Obama, [226] Donald Trump, [9] Joe Biden, Angela Merkel, [227] and Emmanuel Macron [228] Justin Trudeau cancelled his schedule three days before the funeral as Hurricane Fiona, a category 4 tropical cyclone, was causing serious damage across Atlantic Canada [229]\n\n\nReactions to state funeral\nThe decision to hold a tax-funded state funeral was a radically different one from the funerals for other post-war Japanese leaders, which had been jointly organised and funded by the Cabinet and the LDP [272] It was met with mixed reactions, as there was no legal founding that clarified eligibility or how a state funeral should be conducted [272] An injunction requesting a suspension to the Cabinet's decision and budget for the event had been filed at the district courts in Tokyo, Saitama, Yokohama and Osaka by civil groups on 21 July, which stated the lack of parliamentary approval and infringement of a constitutional right to freedom of belief [273] All these lawsuits were dismissed by all courts on 9 September [274] On 12 September, the Japan Congress of Journalists  [ja] (JCJ) issued an appeal letter in opposition to Abe's state funeral, citing unfavorable polling data of the state funeral across the news agencies The letter condemned the 2015 Japanese military legislation (legalisation of Japan's right to collective self-defense), one of Abe's controversial legacies during his tenure, which was described by JCJ as destroying the Constitution and peace diplomacy of Japan, but Kishida attempted to praise such legacy via a state funeral paid by taxpayers' money [275] [276] Anti-cult journalist Eito Suzuki expressed his concern that Abe's state funeral could be used by the Unification Church to lure more victims into their organisation because of Abe's overt endorsement of their leader Hak Ja Han [218] On 22 September, in a third press conference held by the Unification Church in response to the assassination and spiritual sales, they would announce their support for Abe's state funeral out of \"tremendous respect\" for Abe [277]\n\n\nMemorial\nIn the aftermath of the assassination, the Nara City government considered erecting a monument on the site where Abe was shot [290] [291] After opposition from residents, the plans were abandoned, and an unmarked flowerbed that was part of an already planned redevelopment scheme of the area now serves as a de facto memorial [290] The exact spot of Abe's assassination is the middle of a newly repaved road that was opened for traffic in April 2023 [292]\n\n\nMisinformation\nVideo capturing the surrounding area of the assassination from the sky by the television station was widely shared online by conspiracy theorists as a proof of Abe's death by sniper rifle, instead of Yamagami's homemade gun, from the roof of the nearby shopping mall Sanwa City Saidaiji The conspiracy theory claimed that there was a white tent spotted on the roof of the mall in the video, and that tent was used as a hideout by the sniper The management company of Sanwa City Saidaiji clarified that the tent was set up for the purpose of cleaning the ventilation ducts, and denied the possibility that it could have been used by anyone without authorisation [293] A comedian admitted that he was responsible for spreading this conspiracy theory online After receiving criticism, he published an apology video on YouTube [294]\n\n\nCopycat threats\nThirty minutes after the shooting, a threatening phone call was made to Matsuyama's office, where Abe had been initially scheduled to deliver a speech [307] A suspect was arrested on 9 July for making threats [308]\n\n\nReactions\nIncumbent prime minister Fumio Kishida called the assassination an \"unforgivable act\" and an \"act of cowardly barbarism\" [315] [316] Noting that Abe was shot while delivering a campaign speech, Kishida also denounced the assassination as an attack on Japan's democracy and vowed to defend a \"free and fair election at all costs\" [317]\n\n\nDomestic\nIncumbent prime minister Fumio Kishida called the assassination an \"unforgivable act\" and an \"act of cowardly barbarism\" [315] [316] Noting that Abe

[317]\n\n\nInternational\nIn response to the shooting and Abe's subsequent death, representatives of numerous countries, including present and former world leaders, expressed their condolences [326] [327]\n\n\nIndividuals, non-governmental organisations and sports\nThe University of Southern California (USC) paid special condolences to Abe, who attended the university for three semesters studying English and Public Policy during a study abroad program USC's president Carol Folt personally sent her own condolences [361]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Shooting of

prime minister from 1957 to 1960, and like Abe, was the target of an assassination attempt, which he survived, unlike Abe [18]\n\n\nRelationship between Abe's family and the Unification Church\nAbe, as well as his father Shintaro Abe and his grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, had longstanding ties to the Unification Church (UC), a new religious movement known for its mass wedding ceremonies [22] Known officially as the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (FFWPU), the movement was founded by Sun Myung Moon in South Korea in 1954 and its followers are colloquially known as \"Moonies\" Moon was a self-declared messiah and ardent anti-communist [23]\n\n\nUnification Church practices in Japan\nThe Japanese government certified the UC as a religious organisation in 1964; the Agency for Cultural Affairs classifies the UC as a Christian organisation [43] Since then, the government was unable to prevent the UC's activities because of the freedom of religion guaranteed in the Constitution of Japan, according to Mitsuhiro Suganuma  [ja], the former section head of the Public Security Intelligence Agency's Second Intelligence Department [44]\n\n\nTimeline\nAbe was initially scheduled to deliver a speech in Nagano Prefecture on 8 July 2022 in support of Sanshirō Matsuyama  [ja], an LDP candidate in upcoming elections to the House of Councillors [55] That event was abruptly cancelled on 7 July [55] following allegations of misconduct and corruption related to Matsuyama, [56] [57] and was replaced by a similar event in Nara Prefecture at which Abe was to deliver a speech in support of Kei Satō, an LDP councillor running for re-election [58] The LDP division in Nara Prefecture stated this new schedule was not generally publicly known, [59] but NHK reported that the event had been widely advertised on Twitter and by sound truck [60] Nara police and Satō's campaign staff inspected the site on the evening before the incident, and the head of the prefectural police had approved of the security plan a few hours before the incident; one prefectural assembly member later said, \"I thought it was a dangerous place that made it easy to attack former Prime Minister Abe from the cars and bicycles that pass along the road behind him\" [61]\n\n\nAbe's schedule\nAbe was initially scheduled to deliver a speech in Nagano Prefecture on 8 July 2022 in support of Sanshirō Matsuyama  [ja], an LDP candidate in upcoming elections to the House of Councillors [55] That event was abruptly cancelled on 7 July [55] following allegations of misconduct and

one prefectural assembly member later said, \"I thought it was a dangerous place that made it easy to attack former Prime Minister Abe from the cars and bicycles that pass along the road behind him\" [61]\n\n\nAttack\nWhile Abe was delivering his speech, the perpetrator, Tetsuya Yamagami, was able to approach within several metres, despite the presence of security [65] At around 11:30 am, when Abe said, \"Instead of thinking about why he  [Satō] cannot do it ...\" (「彼はできない理由を考えるのではなく…」), [66] he was shot at from behind with a homemade gun [a] [1] [71] resembling a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun capable of firing six bullets at a time [67] [71] [72] The first shot missed and prompted Abe to turn around, at which point a second shot was fired, hitting Abe in the neck and chest area [73] [74] [75] Abe then took a few steps forward, fell to his knees, and collapsed Abe's security detained the suspect, who did not resist [76] [77] According to security guards stationed during the assassination, the sound of the gunshot was very different from that of a conventional firearm, reminiscent of fireworks or tire blowout This may explain the delay of response from Abe's bodyguards after the first round of gunshot [78]\n\n\nTreatment\nParamedics arrived on the scene at 11:37 am, and an ambulance later arrived at 11:41 am [79] Police sources told NHK that Abe was initially conscious and responsive after being shot [80] A doctor who arrived at the scene said there were no signs indicating Abe was conscious [81] Shortly thereafter, he was transported to a local hospital by emergency helicopter with a wound to the right side of his neck and internal bleeding in his left chest, arriving approximately fifty minutes after being shot [82] He was reported to have no vital signs when he arrived at Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara, due to cardiopulmonary arrest prior to his arrival [83] [3] [84] At 2:45 pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that Abe was in critical condition and that \"doctors  [were] doing everything they  [could]\" [85]\n\n\nDeath declaration\nAbe's wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55 pm [86] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead at the hospital at 5:03 pm, around five and a half hours after being shot [6] [87] [88] He was 67 years old Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of blood [b] [90] [91] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets [92] and that one bullet was not found in Abe's body [93] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone [94]\n\n\nVisitations\nSeveral hours after the assassination, both former prime minister Yoshihide Suga [95] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital where Abe's body was being held [96]\n\n\nSuspect\nTetsuya Yamagami (山上 徹也), a resident of Nara, was arrested at the scene of the assassination He was 41 years old, had no prior criminal history, and was unemployed at the time of his arrest [100] [101] [102] In his testimonies and letters, Yamagami claimed that he was driven by a grudge against the Unification Church for ruining his family Even though he originally planned to target Hak Ja Han, then president of the church, he was unable to approach her, so he switched to Shinzo Abe, who he believed was \"one of the most influential sympathisers\" of the church [103]\n\n\nAftermath\nAt 11:45 am, the Japanese government established a liaison office within the crisis management center of the Prime Minister's Office [112] [113] Kishida, who was campaigning in Sagae, Yamagata Prefecture, cancelled his remaining schedule and returned to Tokyo by 2:29 pm [114] [84] According to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, all other members of Kishida's cabinet were recalled to Tokyo except the foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, who was in Indonesia for the 2022 G20 Bali summit [115] Kishida later ordered heightened security for high-ranking politicians in Japan [116] Officers from the Security Police were deployed to protect Akie Abe after she arrived in Kyoto as a precautionary measure [117]\n\n\nEffects on election\nAt 11:45 am, the Japanese

television networks, cancelled or postponed all scheduled programming to broadcast live news coverage for the rest of the day, as did several radio stations [121] [122] [123] [124] The second episode of the anime series Teppen—!!!, scheduled to air on 9 July, was announced to be cancelled, because its plot concerned an attempted assassination [125] [126] [127] [128] The episode aired on 10 September [129]\n\n\nNational Police Agency changes\nOn 20 August 2022, the National Police Agency announced that rules for conducting VIP protection will be revamped, which will also expand VIP

Abe's state funeral was described by the media as a form of \"funeral diplomacy  [ja]\" to convey his will to inherit Abe's legacy domestically and internationally [221] However, when compared to the state funeral of Elizabeth II held on 19 September, one week before Abe's state funeral, the media pointed out that the foreign dignitaries attending Abe's funeral were less influential, comprising mostly former heads of state, [9] [222] and none of the incumbent leaders of the G7 attended [223] [224] Nippon TV cited an anonymous government official who explained that many leaders who attended Elizabeth II's funeral were unsure if it was appropriate to conduct two consecutive trips abroad in such a short period of time [9] All-Nippon News cited another official who commented that there were almost no notable foreign dignitaries who could attend, and that Kishida was wrong for being overly optimistic of his \"funeral diplomacy\" plan [225] Among those who received but eventually turned down invitations were Barack Obama, [226] Donald Trump, [9] Joe Biden, Angela Merkel, [227] and Emmanuel Macron [228] Justin Trudeau cancelled his schedule three days before the funeral as Hurricane Fiona, a category 4 tropical cyclone, was causing serious damage across Atlantic Canada [229]\n\n\nReactions to state funeral\nThe decision to hold a tax-funded state funeral was a radically different one from the funerals for other post-war Japanese leaders, which had been jointly organised and funded by the Cabinet and the LDP [272] It was met with mixed reactions, as there was no legal founding that clarified eligibility or how a state funeral should be conducted [272] An injunction requesting a suspension to the Cabinet's decision and budget for the event had been filed at the district courts in Tokyo, Saitama, Yokohama and Osaka by civil groups on 21 July, which stated the lack of parliamentary approval and infringement of a constitutional right to freedom of belief [273] All these lawsuits were dismissed by all courts on 9 September [274] On 12 September, the Japan Congress of Journalists  [ja] (JCJ) issued an appeal letter in opposition to Abe's state funeral, citing unfavorable polling data of the state funeral across the news agencies The letter condemned the 2015 Japanese military legislation (legalisation of Japan's right to collective self-defense), one of Abe's controversial legacies during his tenure, which was described by JCJ as destroying the Constitution and peace diplomacy of Japan, but Kishida attempted to praise such legacy via a state funeral paid by taxpayers' money [275] [276] Anti-cult journalist Eito Suzuki expressed his concern that Abe's state funeral could be used by the Unification Church to lure more victims into their organisation because of Abe's overt endorsement of their leader Hak Ja Han [218] On 22 September, in a third press conference held by the Unification Church in response to the assassination and spiritual sales, they would announce their support for Abe's state funeral out of \"tremendous respect\" for Abe [277]\n\n\nMemorial\nIn the aftermath of the assassination, the Nara City government considered erecting a monument on the site where Abe was shot [290] [291] After opposition from residents, the plans were abandoned, and an unmarked flowerbed that was part of an already planned redevelopment scheme of the area now serves as a de facto memorial [290] The exact spot of Abe's assassination is the middle of a newly repaved road that was opened for traffic in April 2023 [292]\n\n\nMisinformation\nVideo capturing the surrounding area of the assassination from the sky by the television station was widely shared online by conspiracy theorists as a proof of Abe's death by sniper rifle, instead of Yamagami's homemade gun, from the roof of the nearby shopping mall Sanwa City Saidaiji The conspiracy theory claimed that there was a white tent spotted on the roof of the mall in the video, and that tent was used as a hideout by the sniper The management company of Sanwa City Saidaiji clarified that the tent was set up for the purpose of cleaning the ventilation ducts, and denied the possibility that it could have been used by anyone without authorisation [293] A comedian admitted that he was responsible for spreading this conspiracy theory online After receiving criticism, he published an apology video on YouTube [294]\n\n\nCopycat threats\nThirty minutes after the shooting, a threatening phone call was made to Matsuyama's office, where Abe had been initially scheduled to deliver a speech [307] A suspect was arrested on 9 July for making threats [308]\n\n\nReactions\nIncumbent prime minister Fumio Kishida called the assassination an \"unforgivable act\" and an \"act of cowardly barbarism\" [315] [316] Noting that Abe was shot while delivering a campaign speech, Kishida also denounced the assassination as an attack on Japan's democracy and vowed to defend a \"free and fair election at all costs\" [317]\n\n\nDomestic\nIncumbent prime minister Fumio Kishida called the assassination an \"unforgivable act\" and an \"act of cowardly barbarism\" [315]

[326] [327]\n\n\nIndividuals, non-governmental organisations and sports\nThe University of Southern California (USC) paid special condolences to Abe, who attended the university for three semesters studying English and Public Policy during a study abroad program USC's president Carol Folt personally sent her own condolences [361]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

strategy decision at the beginning of the race Whilst he ultimately fell back throughout the race, he managed to cross the finish line in ninth After the race, it was determined that Haas had broken

2022 São Paulo Grand Prix, Magnussen took his and Haas’ first pole position in Formula One Magnussen qualified first after George Russell spun at turn 4, bringing out a red flag during which track

engine, 14 years after Sebastian Vettel did so for Toro Rosso at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix He would ultimately finish the sprint race in 8th position, and would retire from the Grand Prix on the

It was the 13th consecutive Olympic appearance of the event, which has been held every Games since archery returned to the Olympic program in 1972.\n\n**Background**\n----------------\n\nThe women's individual archery event has a rich history in the Olympic Games, dating back to the 1900 Paris Olympics, where archery was part of the program but only for men. Women's archery made its Olympic debut in 1904 at the St. Louis Games. The event has undergone several format changes over the years, but the basic structure of a single-elimination bracket has remained the same.\n\n**Qualification**\n-----------------\n\nA total of 64 archers qualified for the women's individual event through a combination of national team performances and individual rankings. The 12 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) that qualified for the women's team event, including the host Japan, entered their three team members in the individual event. Other NOCs could enter a maximum of one archer in the women's individual event.\n\nQualification spots were awarded at various tournaments, including the World Championships, multiple continental events, and a final qualification tournament. Additionally, two Tripartite Commission invitational spots were allocated to eligible archers.\n\n**Competition format**\n----------------------\n\nThe women's individual archery event was a recurve archery competition, held at the World Archery-approved 70-meter distance and under the rules of the World Archery Federation. The competition began with a ranking round, in which each archer shot 72 arrows. The scores from the ranking round were used to seed the archers into a single-elimination bracket.\n\nThe knockout matches used the set system introduced in 2012. Each match consisted of up to five sets of three arrows per archer. The archer with the best score in each set won the set, earning two points. If the score was tied, each archer received one point. The first archer to score six points won the match. If the match was tied 5-5 after five sets, a single tie-breaker arrow was shot, with the closest to center winning.\n\n**Records**\n------------\n\nPrior to the competition, the world and Olympic records were as follows:\n\n* World record: 682 points (An San, South Korea, 2019)\n* Olympic record: 678 points (Chae Bok-hee, South Korea, 2012)\n\n**Schedule**\n-------------\n\nThe schedule for the women's individual event covered five separate days of competition. The ranking round was held on July 23, followed by the competition bracket on July 24-28.\n\n**Results**\n------------\n\nThe ranking round was held on July 23, 2021.

arrested Assistant Commissioner Park Hui-won, who was corrupt [20] [13] despite strong objections from bureaucrats in the Kim Dae-jung cabinet [12]\n\n\nEarly career\nYoon started his career at Daegu Public Prosecutor's Office in 1994 [12] [15] [16] [17] [13] He headed the Special Branch and Central Investigation Department, both of which investigate corruption-related cases [12] In 1999, he arrested Assistant Commissioner Park Hui-won, who was corrupt [20] [13] despite strong objections from bureaucrats in the Kim Dae-jung cabinet [12]\n\n\nProsecutor general\nOn 17 June 2019, Yoon was nominated as prosecutor general, replacing Moon Moo-il [16] [13] His nomination was welcomed by the ruling Democratic Party and the Party for Democracy and Peace, but was opposed by the Liberty Korea Party and the Bareunmirae Party [24] The minor party Justice Party remained neutral [24] On 16 July, he was officially appointed as the new prosecutor general [25] and started his term nine days later [26] President Moon ordered him to be neutral, adding that any kind of corruption must be strictly investigated though it is related to the government [26]\n\n\nSuspension and reinstatement\nOn 24 November 2020, Minister of Justice Choo Mi-ae suspended Yoon from his position, citing alleged ethical violations, abuse of power, and interference into investigations of his associates and family members [36] Yoon filed an injunction against the minister's suspension order, which was approved by the Seoul Administrative Court on 1 December, temporarily halting the suspension [37] [38] On 16 December, the Ministry of Justice then imposed a two-month suspension on Yoon, accepting four of six major charges for disciplinary action The decision was subsequently approved by President Moon [39] However, on 24 December, following an injunction filed at the Seoul Administrative Court, the suspension was overturned as the court accepted Yoon's claim that the process to suspend him was unfair [40]\n\n\n2022 presidential election\nYoon had been considered a potential presidential candidate for the 2022 presidential election since the aftermath of the Cho Kuk controversies, appearing as a significant candidate in general election opinion polls since at least January 2020 [41] [42] In a January 2021 poll including all possible presidential candidates, Yoon led as the most favored with 30.4 percent of the vote, more than the individual supports for the ruling Democratic Party frontrunners Lee Jae-myung and Lee Nak-yon [43]\n\n\nPresidency (2022–present)\nOn 20 March 2022, he announced that he would establish his presidential office in the Ministry of National Defense building in Yongsan District, Seoul, instead of the Blue House, which opened to the public as a park on 10 May 2022 [74] [75] He would take office that day [75] This marked the end of the Blue House as the official presidential office and residence after 74 years.\n\n\nRelocation of presidential office\nOn 20 March 2022, he announced that he would establish his presidential office in the Ministry of National Defense building in Yongsan District, Seoul, instead of the Blue House, which opened to the public as a park on 10 May 2022 [74] [75] He would take office that day [75] This marked the end of the Blue House as the official presidential office and residence after 74 years.\n\n\nDomestic policy\nIn 2023, Yoon attempted to raise South Korea's maximum weekly working hours from 52 to 69 However, widespread backlash, especially from the youth, led him to order government agencies to reconsider the plan [76]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nIn 2023, Yoon attempted to raise South Korea's maximum weekly working hours from 52 to 69 However, widespread backlash, especially from the youth, led him to order government agencies to reconsider the plan [76]\n\n\nGender equality policy\nPresident Yoon entered office with a pledge to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Political conflict related to issues of gender was intense in South Korea in 2022 He announced that the new government would not address gender as a collective issue, but rather focus on and respond to specific individual issues [78]\n\n\n2022 police bureau proposal\nIn late July 2022, Yoon proposed the creation of a \"police bureau\", in order to ensure greater government oversight of the police force In response, several police officers protested, claiming the measure was a dictatorial measure to compromise the political neutrality of the police [82]\n\n\n2022 Seoul crowd crush\nOn 29 October 2022, at least 158 people were crushed to death when a crowd surged in an alleyway during Halloween festivities in Seoul's Itaewon district Yoon declared a state of official national mourning [84]\n\n\nHealthcare reform\nOn February 6, 2024, Yoon announced that the enrollment quota for medical students would be increased from 3,058 to 5,058 students per academic year from 2025 onward [85] The quota was last fixed in 2006 [85] The announcement was met with opposition from the medical community, with Korea Medical Association and Korea Intern Resident Association leading a strike by intern and resident doctors since February 20, 2024 [86] They argued that the planned increase would not resolve the issues of inadequate manpower in rural areas but would increase the inequality of medical care between rural and urban areas [87]\n\n\nDefeat of the PPP in the 2024 parliamentary elections\nThe opposition's landslide victory in the 2024 parliamentary elections put Yoon in an even weaker position The PPP obtained 108 seats, 36% of the National Assembly; the main opposition party (DPK) won 175 seats in total The remaining 17 seats are held by the other members of the 22nd Assembly [88]\n\n\nMBC lawsuit\nYoon's People Power Party sued four senior executives of local broadcaster Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, including MBC TV head Park Sung-je, on grounds of defamation after news outlets initially reported that he insulted the US Congress [92] [93] On 21 September 2022, after chatting with US President Joe Biden outside the seventh Global Fund meeting in New York City, Yoon was filmed telling his aides and top diplomats, \"Wouldn't  [inaudible] lose face if these saekki do not pass it in the legislature?\" [94] Although the audio is hard to discern, MBC, who broke the story on air, determined in its subtitles that he said \"Biden\" in an apparent reference to the latter's bid to increase the American contribution to the Global Fund by $6 billion, an act that would require congressional approval Yoon's office denies that he was talking about Biden or the US Congress Instead, it claims that he was expressing concern that his country's opposition-controlled parliament would reject his plans for a $100 million contribution to the same fund, and his press secretary Kim Eun-hye suggested that the word he uttered was not \"Biden\", but \"nallimyeon\", a similar-sounding word that means \"to blow or waste\" [95] The video swiftly went viral, having been viewed repeatedly by millions The controversy has also brought press freedom in South Korea to the public eye over the PPP's civil conduct involving MBC, [96] with some press freedom groups, including the International Federation of Journalists, [97] criticizing the lawsuit as politically motivated A poll of 1,002 adult Koreans found his approval rating falling to 27.7 percent, a 3.7 percent drop from three weeks before, and that the majority (61.2 percent) believed Yoon said \"Biden\" compared to the 26.9 percent who thought he said \"nallimyeon\", and another poll of 1,000 adult Koreans found an even greater majority (70.8 percent) who said that he should directly apologize for his profanity versus the 27.9 percent who said he did not need to apologize [98] The Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs sued MBC 'to restore trust in diplomacy' This has been likened to the oppression of journalists by the Lee Myung-bak government in the past [99]\n\n\nR&D budget cut\nThe decision by the Yoon administration to reduce South Korea's research and development (R&D) budget by 15% for 2024 compared to the previous year has caused significant uproar among researchers There are growing concerns that this cutback might undermine South Korea's competitiveness in the global technology sector [100]\n\n\nSoldier deaths\nYoon was accused of covering up for senior military officials over the deaths of one South Korean marine in 2023 and two more soldiers in 2024 by blocking bills seeking to investigate the matter His exercise of veto power, one of the highest among South Korean presidents, led to increased confrontation with the opposition in the parliament [101] [102] [103]\n\n\nAllegations of favoring the New Right\nYoon has appointed people affiliated with the controversial South Korean New Right movement to prominent positions in government and public life According to a report by Kyunghyang Shinmun, at least 21 New Right figures were holding 25 key positions in eight public institutions and committees related to Korean history under the Yoon's administration [104]\n\n\nFirst lady political scandal\nYoon vetoed a special presecutor bill on investigating allegations of corruption related to himself and his wife Kim Keon-hee He has received criticism for this [108] Professors from various universities in South Korea have advocated for his resignation [109] [110]\n\n\nAllegations of democratic backsliding\nYoon's administration has been accused of suppressing media criticism through the use of state agencies, including the Board of Audit and Inspection and the Anti-corruption & Civil Rights Commission According to an MBC report, some journalists were given preferential treatment during the president's annual New Year's interview [111]\n\n\nPublic approval\nLess than three months into his presidency, Yoon's approval rating dropped to less than 30 percent amidst the 2021–2023 inflation, a controversial education policy rollout (including a proposal to lower the starting elementary school age from six to five), controversies over nepotism in personnel appointments, the police bureau proposal, and conflicts within Yoon's People Power Party [119] [120] His popularity fell further to 19% in August [121] In December, Yoon's approval rating rose back to above 40% for the first time in five months [122] By April 2023, this has dropped back to 30%, largely due to widespread disapproval of Yoon's Japanese policy [123] In May 2024, Yoon recorded the lowest approval rating since he took office at a rate of 21%, with his economic and foreign policy, as well as his lack of communication being cited as the main reasons for the low approval rating [124] In June and July 2024, over a million people signed a petition calling for Yoon to be impeached [103] [125]\n\n\nForeign relations\nIn December 2022, Yoon administration announced the Indo-Pacific Strategy, a comprehensive strategy that encompasses the economic and security spheres of Indo-Pacific countries \"We (South Korea) will work towers a regional order that enables a difference set of countries to cooperate and procedures together.\" [126] On July 25, 2023, he visited Ukraine after visiting Lithuania and Poland for the NATO summit He visited Bucha and Irpin, cities near the capital city of Kyiv [127] He also held the 2023 South Korea-Pacific Islands Summit and the 2024 South Korea-Africa Summit for the first time, and is also promoting the Korea-Central Asia Summit [128]\n\n\nG7\nAlthough South Korea is not a member of the G7, it is being considered as a potential next member if the G7 expands And the government has been promoting the G7 Plus initiative [133] At the G7 summit in May 2023, Yoon met with the leaders of the Quad nations He called for addressing regional challenges and providing infrastructure and development assistance In a speech to G7 members, Yoon stressed South Korea's continued commitment to maintaining the international rule of law and the need to protect Ukraine's freedom and peace [134]\n\n\nUnited States\nDuring US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to South Korea, part of a larger tour of Asia, on 4 August 2022, Yoon snubbed a meeting with her, stating that he wanted to enjoy his vacation [135] [136] [137]\n\n\nJapan\nYoon has been accused of having a pro-Japanese stance on historical issues and colonialism by liberals and some conservative [142] [143] politicians in South Korea Yoon Suk Yeol government has a close relationship with the \"far-right\" [144] Japanophilic New Right movement [145] [146] [147]\n\n\nUkraine\nIn a Reuters interview on 19 April 2023, President

"article": "**Yoon Suk-yeol**\n\nYoon Suk-yeol is a South Korean politician who has been serving as the President of South Korea since 2022. He was born on December 26, 1960, in Bomun-dong, Seongbuk District, Seoul.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nYoon was born in Bomun-dong, Seongbuk District, Seoul, in 1960, and raised in Yeonhui-dong, Seodaemun District. His father, Yoon Ki-jung, was a professor emeritus of economics at Yonsei University and a full member of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Korea. His mother, Choi Seong-ja, was a lecturer at Ewha Womans University before leaving the position after getting married.\n\n**Prosecutorial Career**\n\nYoon started his career at Daegu Public Prosecutor's Office in 1994. He headed the Special Branch and Central Investigation Department, both of which investigate corruption-related cases. In 1999, he arrested Assistant Commissioner Park Hui-won, who was corrupt, despite strong objections from bureaucrats in the Kim Dae-jung cabinet.\n\n**Prosecutor General**\n\nOn June 17, 2019, Yoon was nominated as prosecutor general, replacing Moon Moo-il. His nomination was welcomed by the ruling Democratic Party and the Party for Democracy and Peace, but was opposed by the Liberty Korea Party and the Bareunmirae Party. On July 16, 2019, he was officially appointed as the new prosecutor general.\n\n**Suspension and Reinstatement**\n\nOn November 24, 2020, Minister of Justice Choo Mi-ae suspended Yoon from his position, citing alleged ethical violations, abuse of power, and interference into investigations of his associates and family members. Yoon filed an injunction against the minister's suspension order, which was approved by the Seoul Administrative Court on December 1. However, on December 16, the Ministry of Justice then imposed a two-month suspension on Yoon, accepting four of six major charges for disciplinary action. The decision was subsequently approved by President Moon. However, on December 24, following an injunction filed at the Seoul Administrative Court, the suspension was overturned as the court accepted Yoon's claim that the process to suspend him was unfair.\n\n**2022 Presidential Election**\n\nYoon had been considered a potential presidential candidate for the 2022 presidential election since the aftermath of the Cho Kuk controversies. In a January 2021 poll, Yoon led as the most favored with 30.4 percent of the vote, more than the individual supports for the ruling Democratic Party frontrunners Lee Jae-myung and Lee Nak-yon.\n\n**Presidency (2022–present)**\n\nOn March 20, 2022, Yoon announced that he would establish his presidential office in the Ministry of National Defense building in Yongsan District, Seoul, instead of the Blue House, which opened to the public as a park on May 10, 2022. This marked the end of the Blue House as the official presidential office and residence after 74 years.\n\n**Relocation of Presidential Office**\n\nOn March 20, 2022, Yoon announced that he would establish his presidential office in the Ministry of National Defense building in Yongsan District, Seoul, instead of the Blue House, which opened to the public as a park on May 10, 2022. This marked the end of the Blue House as the official presidential office and residence after 74 years.\n\n**Domestic Policy**\n\nIn 2023, Yoon attempted to raise South Korea's maximum weekly working hours from 52 to 69. However, widespread backlash, especially from the youth, led him to order government agencies to reconsider the plan.\n\n**Economic Policy**\n\nIn 2023, Yoon attempted to raise South Korea's maximum weekly working hours from 52 to 69. However, widespread backlash, especially from the youth, led him to order government agencies to reconsider the plan.\n\n**Gender Equality Policy**\n\nPresident Yoon entered office with a pledge to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. Political conflict related to issues of gender was intense in South Korea in 2022. He announced that the new government would not address gender as a collective issue, but rather focus on and respond to specific individual issues.\n\n**2022 Police Bureau Proposal**\n\nIn late July 2022, Yoon proposed the creation of a \"police bureau\", in order to ensure greater government oversight of the police force. In response, several police officers protested, claiming the measure was a dictatorial measure to compromise the political neutrality of the police.\n\n**2022 Seoul Crowd Crush**\n\nOn October 29, 2022, at least 158 people were crushed to death when a crowd surged in an alleyway during Halloween festivities in Seoul's Itaewon district. Yoon declared a state of official national mourning.\n\n**Healthcare Reform**\n\nOn February 6, 2024, Yoon announced that the enrollment quota for medical students would be increased from 3,058 to 5,058 students per academic year from 2025 onward. The quota was last fixed in 2006. The announcement was met with opposition from the medical community, with Korea Medical Association and Korea Intern Resident Association leading a strike by intern and resident doctors since February 20, 2024.\n\n**Defeat of the PPP in the 2024 Parliamentary Elections**\n\nThe opposition's landslide victory in the 2024 parliamentary elections put Yoon in an even weaker position. The PPP obtained 108 seats, 36% of the National Assembly; the main opposition party (DPK) won 175 seats in total. The remaining 17 seats are held by the other members of the 22nd Assembly.\n\n**MBC Lawsuit**\n\nYoon's People Power Party sued four senior executives of local broadcaster Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, including MBC TV head Park Sung-je, on grounds of defamation after news outlets initially reported that he insulted the US Congress. On September 21, 2022, after chatting with US President Joe Biden outside the seventh Global Fund meeting in New York City, Yoon was filmed telling his aides and top diplomats, \"Wouldn't [inaudible] lose face if these saekki do not pass it in the legislature?\" Although the audio is hard to discern, MBC, who broke the story on air, determined in its subtitles that he said \"Biden\" in an apparent reference to the latter's bid to increase the American contribution to the Global Fund by $6 billion, an act that would require congressional approval. Yoon's office denies that he was talking about Biden or the US Congress. Instead, it claims that he was expressing concern that his country's opposition-controlled parliament would reject his plans for a $100 million contribution to the same fund, and his press secretary Kim Eun-hye suggested that the word he uttered was not \"Biden\", but \"nallimyeon\", a similar-sounding word that means \"to blow or waste\". The video swiftly went viral, having been viewed repeatedly by millions. The controversy has also brought press freedom in South Korea to the public eye over the PPP's civil conduct involving MBC, with some press freedom groups, including the International Federation of Journalists, criticizing the lawsuit as politically motivated. A poll of 1,002 adult Koreans found his approval rating falling to 27.7 percent, a 3.7 percent drop from three weeks before, and that the majority (61.2 percent) believed Yoon said \"Biden\" compared to the 26.9 percent who thought he said \"nallimyeon\", and another poll of 1,000 adult Koreans found an even greater majority (70.8 percent) who said that he should directly apologize for his profanity versus the 27.9 percent who said he did not need to apologize. The Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs sued MBC \"to restore trust in diplomacy\". This has been likened to the oppression of journalists by the Lee Myung-bak government in the past.\n\n**R&D Budget Cut**\n\nThe decision by the Yoon administration to reduce South Korea's research and development (R&D) budget by 15% for 2024 compared to the previous year has caused significant uproar among researchers. There are growing concerns that this cutback might undermine South Korea's competitiveness in the global technology sector.\n\n**Soldier Deaths**\n\nYoon was accused of covering up for senior military officials over the deaths of one South Korean marine in 2023 and two more soldiers in 2024 by blocking bills seeking to investigate the matter. His exercise of veto power, one of the highest among South Korean presidents, led to increased confrontation with the opposition in the parliament.\n\n**Allegations of Favoring the New Right**\n\nYoon has appointed people affiliated with the controversial South Korean New Right movement to prominent positions in government and public life. According to a report by Kyunghyang Shinmun, at least 21 New Right figures were holding 25 key positions in eight public institutions and committees related to Korean history under the Yoon administration.\n\n**First Lady Political Scandal**\n\nYoon vetoed a special prosecutor bill on investigating allegations of corruption related to himself and his wife Kim Keon-hee. He has received criticism for this. Professors from various universities in South Korea have advocated for his resignation.\n\n**Allegations of Democratic Backsliding**\n\nYoon's administration has been accused of suppressing media criticism through the use of state agencies, including the Board of Audit and Inspection and the Anti-corruption & Civil Rights Commission. According to an MBC report, some journalists were given preferential treatment during the president's annual New Year's interview.\n\n**Public Approval**\n\nLess than three months into his presidency, Yoon's approval rating dropped to less than 30 percent amidst the 2021–2023 inflation, a controversial education policy rollout (including a proposal to lower the starting elementary school age from six to five), controversies over nepotism in personnel appointments, the police bureau proposal, and conflicts within Yoon's People Power Party. His popularity fell further to 19% in August. In December, Yoon's approval rating rose back to above 40% for the first time in five months. By April 2023, this has dropped back to 30%, largely due to widespread disapproval of Yoon's Japanese policy. In May 2024, Yoon recorded the lowest approval rating since he took office at a rate of 21%, with his economic and foreign policy, as well as his lack of communication being cited as the main reasons for the low approval rating. In June and July 2024, over a million people signed a petition calling for Yoon to be impeached.\n\n**Foreign Relations**\n\nIn December 2022, Yoon administration announced the Indo-Pacific Strategy, a comprehensive strategy that encompasses the economic and security spheres of Indo-Pacific countries. \"We (South Korea) will work towers a regional order that enables a difference set of countries to cooperate and procedures together.\" On July 25, 2023, he visited Ukraine after visiting Lithuania and Poland for the NATO summit. He visited Bucha and Irpin, cities near the capital city of Kyiv. He also held the 2023 South Korea-Pacific Islands Summit and the 2024 South Korea-Africa Summit for the first time, and is also promoting the Korea-Central Asia Summit.\n\n**G7**\n\nAlthough South Korea is not a member of the G7, it is being considered as a potential next member if the G7 expands. And the government has been promoting the G7 Plus initiative. At the G7 summit in May 2023, Yoon met with the leaders of the Quad nations. He called for addressing regional challenges and providing infrastructure and development assistance. In a speech to G7 members, Yoon stressed South Korea's continued commitment to maintaining the international rule of law and the need to protect Ukraine's freedom and peace.\n\n**United States**\n\nDuring US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to South Korea, part of a larger tour of Asia, on August 4, 2022, Yoon snubbed a meeting with her, stating that he wanted to enjoy his vacation.\n\n**Japan**\n\nYoon has been accused of having a pro-Japanese stance on historical issues and colonialism by liberals and some conservative politicians in South Korea. Yoon Suk Yeol government has a close relationship with the \"far-right\" Japanophilic New Right movement.\n\n**Ukraine**\n\nIn a Reuters interview on April 19, 2023, President Yoon Suk Yeol hinted at supplying lethal aid to Ukraine, stating, \"If there is a situation the international community cannot condone, such as any large-scale attack on civilians, massacre or serious violation of the laws of war, it might be difficult for us to insist only on humanitarian or financial support.\" Previously, South Korea had only provided humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine.

international community supported South Korea He added, \"I believe there won't be limitations to the extent of the support to defend and restore a country that's been illegally invaded both under international and domestic law However, considering our relationship with the parties engaged in the war and developments in the battlefield, we will take the most appropriate measures.\"\n\n\nAfrica\nIn his welcoming speech to the \"Africa Night\" held in Seoul in November 2022, President Yoon said, \"Africa is a land of new opportunity,\" indicating his intention to strengthen cooperation with Africa The event was attended by African ambassadors and nominees from 31 countries, and President William Ruto of Kenya [175]\n\n\nNorth Korea\nIn November 2023, Yoon's government suspended South Korea's participation in the Comprehensive Agreement Pact – a pact aimed at lowering tensions between South and North Korea – after North Korea launched a satellite into space [177]\n\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral\nWhile in London for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, Yoon's opponents accused him of disrespect when he missed the chance to view the queen's coffin lying in state – which he blamed on traffic [92]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nDefunct\n\n\nEconomics\nYoon opposes economic interventionism by the government and is generally regarded as pro-business, [76] and as a fiscal conservative [187] He has cited economist Milton Friedman and Friedman's 1980 book Free to Choose: A Personal Statement as a major influence on his belief in economic liberalism [188] According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Yoon will attempt to reduce dependence on China and promote supply chain resilience [189]\n\n\nMilitary\nYoon has expressed active support for the possibility of South Korea having indigenous nuclear weapons The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace referred to his policy as \"nuclear populism\" Some research shows that nationalist attitudes and anti-American sentiment are prevalent among supporters of an indigenous nuclear arsenal [190]\n\n\nElectoral history\nPresident Yoon has been married to Kim Keon-hee

Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple Road, Wimbledon [11]\n\n\nBeginning\nThe All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as \"The All England Croquet Club\" Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple Road, Wimbledon [11]\n\n\n21st century\nWimbledon is widely considered the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the club is to maintain its leadership To that end a long-term plan was unveiled in 1993, intended to improve the quality of the event for spectators, players, officials and neighbours [18] Stage one (1994–1997) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the new No 1 Court in Aorangi Park, a broadcast centre, two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road Stage two (1997–2009) involved the removal of the old No 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats Stage three (2000–2011) was completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office [19]\n\n\nEvents\nWimbledon consists of five main events, four junior events and seven invitation events [39]\n\n\nMain events\nThe five main events, and the number of players (or teams, in the case of doubles) are:\n\n\nJunior events\nThe four junior events and the number of players or teams are:\n\n\nInvitation events\nThe seven invitational events and the number of pairs are:\n\n\nMatch formats\nMatches in the Gentlemen's Singles are best-of-five sets In 2023 it was decided that Gentlemen's Doubles match formats will be changed from best-of-five sets to best-of-three sets due to complaints from partaking players; [42] all other events are best-of-three sets Up to and including the 2018 tournament, a tiebreak game is played if the score reaches 6–all in any set except the fifth (in a five-set match) or the third (in a three-set match), in which case a two-game lead must be reached  Since 2019, a final set tiebreak game is played if the score in the final set reaches 12–all [28] In 2022 it was decided all matches would have a final set tiebreak once the match reached 6–6, with a champions tiebreak taking place meaning the winner needs to get to 10 points and win by two points [43] [44] If the score is 9–9 play continues until one player wins by two points.\n\n\nSchedule\nEach year the tournament begins on the last Monday in June or first Monday in July, two weeks after the Queen's Club Championships, which is one of the men's major warm-up tournaments, together with the Gerry Weber Open, which is held in Halle, Germany, during the same week Other grass-court tournaments before Wimbledon are Eastbourne, Great Britain, and Rosmalen in the Netherlands, both combining mixed events The other women's warm-up tournament for Wimbledon is Birmingham, also in Great Britain The  men's event which is outside Europe before Wimbledon is the Antalya open in Turkey The only grass-court tournament scheduled after the Championships is the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships at Newport, Rhode Island, USA, which takes place the week after Wimbledon.\n\n\nCurfew\nSince 2009 all matches have to finish before 11:00pm Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam that retains a night-time curfew The curfew is in place to protect local residents from late-night disturbances When the roof was built on Centre Court—something that allowed matches to continue at night under the lights—the local Merton Council put the time limit into place when granting planning permission for the roof [49]\nA statement from Wimbledon in 2018 read: “The 11pm curfew is a Planning Condition applied to balance the consideration of the local residents with the scale of an international tennis event that takes place in a residential area The challenge of transport connectivity and getting visitors home safely is also a key consideration.” [50]\n\n\nPlayers and seeding\nBoth the men's and ladies' singles consist of 128 players [51] Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings, with 104 direct entries into the men's and 108 into the ladies' competitions Both tournaments have 8 wild card entrants, with the remainder in each made up of qualifiers Since the 2001 tournament, 32 players have been given seedings in the Gentlemen's and Ladies' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events The system of seeding was introduced during the 1924 Wimbledon Championships This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw This system was replaced for the 1927 Wimbledon Championships and from then on players were seeded on merit The first players to be seeded as no 1 were René Lacoste and Helen Wills [52]\n\n\nGrounds\nSince 2001, the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100% perennial ryegrass Prior to 2001 a combination of 70% ryegrass and 30% Creeping Red Fescue was used The change was made to improve durability and strengthen the sward to better withstand the increasing wear of the modern game [57]\n\n\n1913 suffragette terror attack\nAn attempt was made to destroy the grounds in 1913, during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign The suffragettes, as part of their campaign for women's votes before the First World War, had begun carrying out politically motivated arson and bombings across the country [63] On the night of 27 February 1913, a suffragette woman \"between the ages of 30–35\" was arrested within the grounds, after being spotted by a groundsman climbing over a hedge at around midnight [64] She was found to have with her some paraffin and wood shavings, for the purpose of setting fires in the grounds [64] The woman refused to give her name or any information to the police and was later sentenced to two months' imprisonment [64]\n\n\nBank of England Sports Centre\nThe qualifying matches, prior to the main draw, take place at the Bank of England Sports Ground, in Roehampton, 3.6 miles (5.8 km) from the All England Club [65]\n\n\nTraditions\nSocial commentator Ellis Cashmore describes Wimbledon as having \"a David Niven-ish propriety\", in trying to conform to the standards of behaviour regarded as common in the 1950s Writer Peter York sees the event as representing a particular white, upper middle class, affluent type of Britishness, describing the area of Wimbledon as \"a southern, well off, late-Victorian suburb with a particular social character\" Cashmore has criticised the event for being \"remote and insulated\" from the changing multicultural character of modern Britain, describing it as \"nobody's idea of all-things-British\" [66] [importance?]\n\n\nBall boys and ball girls\nIn the championship games, ball boys and girls, known as BBGs, have a brief that a good BBG \"should not be seen They should blend into the background and get on with their jobs quietly.\" [67]\n\n\nUmpires\nAt The Championships at Wimbledon, forty-two chair umpires are assigned each day and usually work two matches a day They use tablet computers to score each match and these scores are displayed on the scoreboards and on wimbledon.com [73] Line umpires worked in teams of nine or seven Teams of nine umpires worked the Centre Court and Court numbers 1, 2, 3, 12, and 18 with the remaining teams of seven working the other courts These teams rotated, working sixty minutes on the court and then sixty minutes off.\n\n\nColours and uniforms\nDark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours However, all tennis players participating in the tournament are required to wear all-white or at least almost all-white clothing, a long-time tradition at Wimbledon [76] [i] This rule was put in place in 1963, when the tournament's first dress code was enforced [79] Wearing white clothing with some colour accents is also acceptable, provided the colour scheme is not that of an identifiable commercial brand logo (the outfitter's brand logo being the sole exception) Controversy followed Martina Navratilova's wearing branding for \"Kim\" cigarettes in 1982 In 2023 rules first allowed all female players, included but not limited to in the girls’ singles junior event, to wear non-white underwear; the new rule allows \"solid, mid/dark-coloured undershorts, provided they are no longer than their shorts or skirt\" [77] Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer Ralph Lauren.\n\n\nReferring to players\nBy tradition, the \"Men's\" and \"Women's\" competitions are referred to as \"Gentlemen's\" and \"Ladies'\" competitions at Wimbledon The junior competitions are referred to as the \"Boys'\" and \"Girls'\" competitions.\n\n\nRoyal family\nPreviously, players bowed or curtsied to members of the royal family seated in the Royal Box upon entering or leaving Centre Court However, in 2003, All England Club president Prince Edward, Duke of Kent decided to discontinue the tradition Now, players are required to bow or curtsy only if the Prince of Wales or the King is present, [82] as was in practice during the 2010 Championships when Elizabeth II was in attendance at Wimbledon on 24 June [83]\nOn 27 June 2012, Roger Federer said in his post-match interview that he and his opponent had been asked to bow towards the Royal Box as Prince Charles and his wife were present, saying that it was not a problem for him [84]\n\n\nServices stewards\nPrior to the Second World War, members of the Brigade of Guards and retired members of the Royal Artillery performed the role of stewards In 1946 the AELTC offered employment to wartime servicemen returning to civilian life during their demobilisation leave Initially, this scheme extended only to the Royal Navy, followed by the British Army in 1947 and the Royal Air Force in 1949 In 1965 London Fire Brigade members joined the ranks of stewards [85] The service stewards, wearing uniform, are present in Centre Court and No.'s 1, 2, 3, 12 and 18 courts [86] In 2015, 595 Service and London Fire Brigade stewards attended [87] Only enlisted members of the Armed Forces may apply for the role, which must be taken as leave, and half of each year's recruits must have stewarded at Wimbledon before The AELTC pays a subsistence allowance to servicemen and women working as stewards to defray their accommodation costs for the period of the Championships The Service Stewards are not to be confused with the 185 Honorary Stewards.\n\n\nTickets\nThe majority of centre and show court tickets sold to the general public have since 1924 been made available by a public ballot that the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club holds at the start of the year [90] The ballot has always been substantially oversubscribed Successful applicants are selected at random by a computer [91] The most recent figures from 2011 suggested there were four applicants to every ballot ticket Applications must be posted to arrive at the AELTC by the last day of December in the year prior to the tournament Seats and days are allocated randomly and ballot tickets are not transferable.\n\n\nSponsorship\nUnlike other tournaments, advertising from major brands is minimal and low key, from suppliers such as IBM, Rolex and Slazenger [97] [98] Wimbledon is notable for the longest running sponsorship in sports history due to its association with Slazenger who have supplied all tennis balls for the tournament since 1902 [99] Between 1935 and 2021, Wimbledon had a sponsorship deal with Robinsons fruit squash – one of the longest sponsorships in sport [100]\n\n\nStrawberries and cream\nStrawberries and cream are traditionally eaten by spectators at Wimbledon and have become culturally synonymous with the tournament The origin of this tradition has been said to derive from a visit King Henry VIII paid to his Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, whose home was at Hampton Court, about six miles from Wimbledon, when the chancellor's cook is rumoured to have served wild strawberries and cream as a dessert Since the King ate it, the dessert gained popularity [101] In 2017, fans consumed 34,000 kg (33 imperial tons) of British strawberries and 10,000 litres (2,200 imperial gallons) of cream In 2019, 191,930 portions of strawberries and cream were served at The Championships at Wimbledon [102]\n\n\nMedia coverage and attendance\nUntil 2011 when its contract ended, [103] Radio Wimbledon could be heard within a five-mile radius on 87.7 FM, and also online It operated under a Restricted Service Licence Presenters included Sam Lloyd and Ali Barton Typically they worked alternate four-hour shifts until the end of the last match of the day Reporters and commentators included Gigi Salmon, Nick Lestor, Rupert Bell, Nigel Bidmead, Guy Swindells, Lucie Ahl, Nadine Towell and Helen Whitaker Often they reported from the \"Crow's Nest\", an elevated building housing the Court 3 and 4 scoreboards which affords views of most of the outside courts Regular guests included Sue Mappin In later years Radio Wimbledon acquired a second low-power FM frequency (within the grounds only) of 96.3 FM for uninterrupted Centre Court commentary, and, from 2006, a third for coverage from No 1 Court on 97.8 FM Hourly news bulletins and travel (using RDS) were also broadcast.\n\n\nRadio Wimbledon\nUntil

tournament, an in-house operation known as Wimbledon Broadcasting Services (WBS) has served as the official host broadcaster of the tournament, replacing BBC Sport [104]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nSince 1937 the BBC has broadcast the tournament on television in the United Kingdom [105] [j] Between 1956 and 1968 The Championships were also covered by the ITV Network, but since 1969 the BBC has had a monopoly The matches covered are primarily split between its two main terrestrial channels, BBC One and BBC Two, and their Red Button service This can result in live matches being moved across all 3 channels The BBC holds the broadcast rights for Wimbledon until 2027 [107]  During the days of British Satellite Broadcasting, its sports channel carried extra coverage of Wimbledon for subscribers One of the most notable British commentators was Dan Maskell, who was known as the BBC's \"voice of tennis\" until his retirement in 1991 John Barrett succeeded him in that role until he retired in 2006 Current commentators working for the BBC at Wimbledon include British ex-players Andrew Castle, John Lloyd, Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, Samantha Smith and Mark Petchey; tennis legends such as John McEnroe, Tracy Austin, Boris Becker and Lindsay Davenport; and general sports commentators including David Mercer, Barry Davies, Andrew Cotter and Nick Mullins The coverage is presented by Sue Barker (live) and Claire Balding (highlights) Previous BBC presenters include Des Lynam, David Vine, John Inverdale and Harry Carpenter.\n\n\nIreland\nIn Ireland, RTÉ broadcast the tournament during the 1980s and 1990s on their second channel RTÉ Two, they also provided highlights of the games in the evening The commentary provided was given by Matt Doyle a former Irish-American professional tennis player and Jim Sherwin a former RTÉ newsreader Caroline Murphy was the presenter of the programme RTÉ made the decision in 1998 to discontinue broadcasting the tournament due to falling viewing figures and the large number of viewers watching on the BBC [112] From 2005 until 2014 TG4 Ireland's Irish-language broadcaster provided coverage of the tournament Live coverage was provided in the Irish language while they broadcast highlights in English at night [113]\n\n\nAmericas\nIn the United States, ABC began showing taped highlights of the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles Final in the 1960s on its Wide World of Sports series NBC began a 43-year run of covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen's Singles Finals live, and in 1982, the Ladies' Singles Finals For the next few decades, Americans made a tradition of NBC's \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\" [115] specials at weekends Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from Bud Collins, whose tennis acumen and famous patterned trousers were well known to tennis fans in the US Collins was sacked by NBC in 2007, but was promptly hired by ESPN, the cable home for The Championships in the States For many years NBC's primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster Dick Enberg.\n\n\nOther countries\nIn several European countries, Wimbledon is shown live on Eurosport 1, Eurosport 2 and the Eurosport Player Although there are some exceptions, as in Denmark, where the Danish TV2 holds the right to show matches until 2022 and in Italy where Sky Sport and SuperTennis holds the rights to show live matches until 2022 In the Netherlands Center Court is shown live on Eurosport 1 and all other courts are shown live on the Eurosport Player But Court One is covered live on Ziggo Sport/Ziggo Sport Select Wimbledon has been exclusively broadcast on Sky Sport in Germany since 2007 [121] In December 2018, Sky extended its contract for Austria, Germany and Switzerland until 2022 [122]\n\n\nTrophies, prize money and ranking points\nThe Gentlemen's Singles champion is presented with a silver gilt cup 18.5 inches (about 47 cm) in height and 7.5 inches (about 19 cm) in diameter The trophy is decorated with a variety of symbols, including a miniature gold pineapple The trophy has been awarded since 1887 and bears the inscription: \"All England Lawn Tennis Club Single

propriety\", in trying to conform to the standards of behaviour regarded as common in the 1950s Writer Peter York sees the event as representing a particular white, upper middle class, affluent type of Britishness, describing the area of Wimbledon as \"a southern, well off, late-Victorian suburb with a particular social character\" Cashmore has criticised the event for being \"remote and insulated\" from the changing multicultural character of modern Britain, describing it as \"nobody's idea of all-things-British\" [66] [importance?]\n\n## Ball boys and ball girls\n\nIn the championship games, ball boys and girls, known as BBGs, have a brief that a good BBG \"should not be seen They should blend into the background and get on with their jobs quietly.\" [67]\n\n## Umpires\n\nAt The Championships at Wimbledon, forty-two chair umpires are assigned each day and usually work two matches a day They use tablet computers to score each match and these scores are displayed on the scoreboards and on wimbledon.com [73] Line umpires worked in teams of nine or seven Teams of nine umpires worked the Centre Court and Court numbers 1, 2, 3, 12, and 18 with the remaining teams of seven working the other courts These teams rotated, working sixty minutes on the court and then sixty minutes off\n\n## Colours and uniforms\n\nDark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours However, all tennis players participating in the tournament are required to wear all-white or at least almost all-white clothing, a long-time tradition at Wimbledon [76] [i] This rule was put in place in 1963, when the tournament's first dress code was enforced [79] Wearing white clothing with some colour accents is also acceptable, provided the colour scheme is not that of an identifiable commercial brand logo (the outfitter's brand logo being the sole exception) Controversy followed Martina Navratilova's wearing branding for \"Kim\" cigarettes in 1982 In 2023 rules first allowed all female players, included but not limited to in the girls’ singles junior event, to wear non-white underwear; the new rule allows \"solid, mid/dark-coloured undershorts, provided they are no longer than their shorts or skirt\" [77] Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer Ralph Lauren\n\n## Referring to players\n\nBy tradition, the \"Men's\" and \"Women's\" competitions are referred to as \"Gentlemen's\" and \"Ladies'\" competitions at Wimbledon The junior competitions are referred to as the \"Boys'\" and \"Girls'\" competitions\n\n## Royal family\n\nPreviously, players bowed or curtsied to members of the royal family seated in the Royal Box upon entering or leaving Centre Court However, in 2003, All England Club president Prince Edward, Duke of Kent decided to discontinue the tradition Now, players are required to bow or curtsy only if the Prince of Wales or the King is present, [82] as was in practice during the 2010 Championships when Elizabeth II was in attendance at Wimbledon on 24 June [83]\nOn 27 June 2012, Roger Federer said in his post-match interview that he and his opponent had been asked to bow towards the Royal Box as Prince Charles and his wife were present, saying that it was not a problem for him [84]\n\n## Services stewards\n\nPrior to the Second World War, members of the Brigade of Guards and retired members of the Royal Artillery performed the role of stewards In 1946 the AELTC offered employment to wartime servicemen returning to civilian life during their demobilisation leave Initially, this scheme extended only to the Royal Navy, followed by the British Army in 1947 and the Royal Air Force in 1949 In 1965 London Fire Brigade members joined the ranks of stewards [85] The service stewards, wearing uniform, are present in Centre Court and No.'s 1, 2, 3, 12 and 18 courts [86] In 2015, 595 Service and London Fire Brigade stewards attended [87] Only enlisted members of the Armed Forces may apply for the role, which must be taken as leave, and half of each year's recruits must have stewarded at Wimbledon before The AELTC pays a subsistence allowance to servicemen and women working as stewards to defray their accommodation costs for the period of the Championships The Service Stewards are not to be confused with the 185 Honorary Stewards\n\n## Tickets\n\nThe majority of centre and show court tickets sold to the general public have since 1924 been made available by a public ballot that the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club holds at the start of the year [90] The ballot has always been substantially oversubscribed Successful applicants are selected at random by a computer [91] The most recent figures from 2011 suggested there were four applicants to every ballot ticket Applications must be posted to arrive at the AELTC by the last day of December in the year prior to the tournament Seats and days are allocated randomly and ballot tickets are not transferable\n\n## Sponsorship\n\nUnlike other tournaments, advertising from major brands is minimal and low key, from suppliers such as IBM, Rolex and Slazenger [97] [98] Wimbledon is notable for the longest running sponsorship in sports history due to its association with Slazenger who have supplied all tennis balls for the tournament since 1902 [99] Between 1935 and 2021, Wimbledon had a sponsorship deal with Robinsons fruit squash – one of the longest sponsorships in sport [100]\n\n## Strawberries and cream\n\nStrawberries and cream are traditionally eaten by spectators at Wimbledon and have become culturally synonymous with the tournament The origin of this tradition has been said to derive from a visit King Henry VIII paid to his Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, whose home was at Hampton Court, about six miles from Wimbledon, when the chancellor's cook is rumoured to have served wild strawberries and cream as a dessert Since the King ate it, the dessert gained popularity [101] In 2017, fans consumed 34,000 kg (33 imperial tons) of British strawberries and 10,000 litres (2,200 imperial gallons) of cream In 2019, 191,930 portions of strawberries and cream were served at The Championships at Wimbledon\n\n## Media coverage and attendance\n\nUntil 2011 when its contract ended, [103] Radio Wimbledon could be heard within a five-mile radius on 87.7 FM, and

RDS) were also broadcast\n\n## Television coverage\n\nBeginning with the 2018 tournament, an in-house operation known as Wimbledon Broadcasting Services (WBS) has served as the official host broadcaster of the tournament, replacing BBC Sport [104]\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nSince 1937 the BBC has broadcast the tournament on television in the United Kingdom [105] [j] Between 1956 and 1968 The Championships were also covered by the ITV Network, but since 1969 the BBC has had a monopoly The matches covered are primarily split between its two main terrestrial channels, BBC One and BBC Two, and their Red Button service This can result in live matches being moved across all 3 channels The BBC holds the broadcast rights for Wimbledon until 2027 [107]  During the days of British Satellite Broadcasting, its sports channel carried extra coverage of Wimbledon for subscribers One of the most notable British commentators was Dan Maskell, who was known as the BBC's \"voice of tennis\" until his retirement in 1991 John Barrett succeeded him in that role until he retired in 2006 Current commentators working for the BBC at Wimbledon include British ex-players Andrew Castle, John Lloyd, Tim

commentary provided was given by Matt Doyle a former Irish-American professional tennis player and Jim Sherwin a former RTÉ newsreader Caroline Murphy was the presenter of the programme RTÉ made the decision in 1998 to discontinue broadcasting the tournament due to falling viewing figures and the large number of viewers watching on the BBC [112] From 2005 until 2014 TG4 Ireland's Irish-language broadcaster provided coverage of the tournament Live coverage was provided in the Irish language while they broadcast highlights in English at night [113]\n\n## Americas\n\nIn the United States, ABC began showing taped highlights of the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles Final in the 1960s on its Wide World of Sports series NBC began a 43-year run of covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen's Singles Finals live, and in 1982, the Ladies' Singles Finals For the next few decades, Americans made a tradition of NBC's \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\" [115] specials at weekends Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from Bud Collins, whose tennis acumen and famous patterned trousers were well known to tennis fans in the US Collins was sacked by NBC in 2007, but was promptly hired by ESPN, the cable home for The Championships in the States For many years NBC's primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster Dick Enberg\n\n## Other countries\n\nIn several European countries, Wimbledon is shown live on Eurosport 1, Eurosport 2 and the Eurosport Player Although there are some exceptions, as in Denmark, where the Danish TV2 holds the rights to show matches until 2022 and in Italy where Sky Sport and SuperTennis holds the rights to show live matches until 2022 In the Netherlands Center Court is shown live on Eurosport 1 and all

originally as \"The All England Croquet Club\" Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple Road, Wimbledon [11]\n\n\nBeginning\nThe All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as \"The All England Croquet Club\" Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple Road, Wimbledon [11]\n\n\n21st century\nWimbledon is widely considered the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the club is to maintain its leadership To that end a long-term plan was unveiled in 1993, intended to improve the quality of the event for spectators, players, officials and neighbours [18] Stage one (1994–1997) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the new No 1 Court in Aorangi Park, a broadcast centre, two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road Stage two (1997–2009) involved the removal of the old No 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats Stage three (2000–2011) was completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office [19]\n\n\nEvents\nWimbledon consists of five main events, four junior events and seven invitation events [39]\n\n\nMain events\nThe five main events, and the number of players (or teams, in the case of doubles) are:\n\n\nJunior events\nThe four junior events and the number of players or teams are:\n\n\nInvitation events\nThe seven invitational events and the number of pairs are:\n\n\nMatch formats\nMatches in the Gentlemen's Singles are best-of-five sets In 2023 it was decided that Gentlemen's Doubles match formats will be changed from best-of-five sets to best-of-three sets due to complaints from partaking players; [42] all other events are best-of-three sets Up to and including the 2018 tournament, a tiebreak game is played if the score reaches 6–all in any set except the fifth (in a five-set match) or the third (in a three-set match), in which case a two-game lead must be reached  Since 2019, a final set tiebreak game is played if the score in the final set reaches 12–all [28] In 2022 it was decided all matches would have a final set tiebreak once the match reached 6–6, with a champions tiebreak taking place meaning the winner needs to get to 10 points and win by two points [43] [44] If the score is 9–9 play continues until one player wins by two points.\n\n\nSchedule\nEach year the tournament begins on the last Monday in June or first Monday in July, two weeks after the Queen's Club Championships, which is one of the men's major warm-up tournaments, together with the Gerry Weber Open, which is held in Halle, Germany, during the same week Other grass-court tournaments before Wimbledon are Eastbourne, Great Britain, and Rosmalen in the Netherlands, both combining mixed events The other women's warm-up tournament for Wimbledon is Birmingham, also in Great Britain The  men's event which is outside Europe before Wimbledon is the Antalya open in Turkey The only grass-court tournament scheduled after the Championships is the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships at Newport, Rhode Island, USA, which takes place the week after Wimbledon.\n\n\nCurfew\nSince 2009 all matches have to finish before 11:00pm Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam that retains a night-time curfew The curfew is in place to protect local residents from late-night disturbances When the roof was built on Centre Court—something that allowed matches to continue at night under the lights—the local Merton Council put the time limit into place when granting planning permission for the roof [49]\nA statement from Wimbledon in 2018 read: “The 11pm curfew is a Planning Condition applied to balance the consideration of the local residents with the scale of an international tennis event that takes place in a residential area The challenge of transport connectivity and getting visitors home safely is also a key consideration.” [50]\n\n\nPlayers and seeding\nBoth the men's and ladies' singles consist of 128 players [51] Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings, with 104 direct entries into the men's and 108 into the ladies' competitions Both tournaments have 8 wild card entrants, with the remainder in each made up of qualifiers Since the 2001 tournament, 32 players have been given seedings in the Gentlemen's and Ladies' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events The system of seeding was introduced during the 1924 Wimbledon Championships This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw This system was replaced for the 1927 Wimbledon Championships and from then on players were seeded on merit The first players to be seeded as no 1 were René Lacoste and Helen Wills [52]\n\n\nGrounds\nSince 2001, the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100% perennial ryegrass Prior to 2001 a combination of 70% ryegrass and 30% Creeping Red Fescue was used The change was made to improve durability and strengthen the sward to better withstand the increasing wear of the modern game [57]\n\n\n1913 suffragette terror attack\nAn attempt was made to destroy the grounds in 1913, during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign The suffragettes, as part of their campaign for women's votes before the First World War, had begun carrying out politically motivated arson and bombings across the country [63] On the night of 27 February 1913, a suffragette woman \"between the ages of 30–35\" was arrested within the grounds, after being spotted by a groundsman climbing over a hedge at around midnight [64] She was found to have with her some paraffin and wood shavings, for the purpose of setting fires in the grounds [64] The woman refused to give her name or any information to the police and was later sentenced to two months' imprisonment [64]\n\n\nBank of England Sports

{"title": "West_Bank", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name West Bank is a translation of the Arabic term aḍ-Ḍiffah al-Ġarbiyyah, which designates the territory situated on the western side of the Jordan River that was occupied in 1948 and annexed in 1950 by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan This annexation was widely considered to be illegal, and was recognized only by Iraq, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom [16]\n\n\nWest Bank\nThe name West Bank is a translation of the Arabic term aḍ-Ḍiffah al-Ġarbiyyah, which designates the territory situated on the western side of the Jordan River that was occupied in 1948 and annexed in 1950 by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan This annexation was widely considered to be illegal, and was recognized only by Iraq, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom [16]\n\n\nCisjordan\nVariations on the neo-Latin name Cisiordania (lit. 'on this side of the River Jordan') are the usual names for the territory in Romance languages, e.g Spanish: Cisjordania, Portuguese: Cisjordânia, French: Cisjordanie, Italian: Cisgiordania, and Romanian: Cisiordania, and in some others, e.g Basque: Zisjordania, Breton: Sisjordania, Hungarian: Ciszjordánia, Guarani: Sihorytáña, and Esperanto: Cisjordanio [17] The name West Bank, however, has become the standard usage for this geopolitical entity in English and some of the other Germanic languages since its inception following the 1948 Jordanian capture.\n\n\nHistory\nCanaan \n\n\nJordanian West Bank\nDuring the 1948 war, Israel occupied parts of what was designated in the UN partition plan as \"Palestine\" The 1949 Armistice Agreements defined the interim boundary between Israel and Jordan, essentially reflecting the battlefield after the war [21] Following the December 1948 Jericho Conference, Transjordan annexed the area west of the Jordan River in 1950, naming it \"West Bank\" or \"Cisjordan\", and designated the area east of the river as \"East Bank\" or \"Transjordan\" Jordan, as it was now known, ruled over the West Bank from 1948 until 1967 Jordan's annexation was never formally recognized by the international community, with the exception of the United Kingdom and Iraq [22] [23] [24] King Abdullah of Jordan was crowned King of Jerusalem by the Coptic Bishop on 15 November 1948 [25] Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, were granted Jordanian citizenship and half of the Jordanian Parliament seats, thus enjoying equal opportunities in all sectors of the state [26] [27]\n\n\nIsraeli Military Governorate and Civil Administration\nIn June 1967, the West Bank and East Jerusalem were captured by Israel as a result of the Six-Day War With the exception of East Jerusalem and the former Israeli–Jordanian no man's land, the West Bank was not annexed by Israel It remained under Israeli military control until 1982.\n\n\nEarly economic impact\nThe Jordanians neglected to invest much in the area during their time governing the area, although there was some investment in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem.\n\n\nLegal status\nFrom 1517 to 1917 the West Bank was part of the Ottoman Empire Turkey, successor state to the Ottoman Empire, renounced its territorial claims in 1923, signing the Treaty of Lausanne, and the area now called the West Bank became an integral part of the British Mandate for Palestine During the Mandate period Britain had no right of sovereignty, which was held by the people under the mandate [56] Nevertheless, Britain, as custodians of the land, implemented the land tenure laws in Palestine, which it had inherited from the Ottoman Turks (as defined in the Ottoman Land Code of 1858), applying these laws to both Arab and Jewish legal tenants or otherwise [57] In 1947 the UN General Assembly recommended that the area that became the West Bank become part of a future Arab state, but this proposal was opposed by the Arab states at the time In 1948, Jordan occupied the West Bank and annexed it in 1950 [22]\n\n\nPolitical status\nThe future status of the West Bank, together with the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean shore, has been the subject of negotiation between the Palestinians and Israelis, although the 2002 Road Map for Peace, proposed by the \"Quartet\" comprising the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations, envisions an independent Palestinian state in these territories living side by side with Israel (see also history of the State of Palestine) However, the \"Road Map\" states that in the first phase, Palestinians must end all attacks on Israel, whereas Israel must dismantle all outposts.\n\n\nPublic opinion\nPalestinian public opinion opposes Israeli military and settler presence on the West Bank as a violation of their right to statehood and sovereignty [86] Israeli opinion is split into a number of views:\n\n\nGeography\nThe West Bank has an area of 5,628 or 5,640 square kilometres (2,173 or 2,178 square miles), which comprises 21.2% of former Mandatory Palestine (excluding Jordan) [89] and has generally rugged mountainous terrain The total length of the land boundaries of the region are 404 km (251 mi) [7] The terrain is mostly rugged dissected upland, some vegetation in the west, but somewhat barren in the east The elevation span between the shoreline of the Dead Sea at −408 m to the highest point at Mount Nabi Yunis, at 1,030 m (3,379 ft) above sea level [90] The West Bank is landlocked; its highlands are the main recharge area for Israel's coastal aquifers [7]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate in the West Bank is mostly Mediterranean, slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline, west to the area In the east, the West Bank includes the Judean Desert and the shoreline of the Dead Sea – both with dry and hot climate.\n\n\nPolitical geography\n\n\n\nPalestinian enclaves\nThe 1993 Oslo Accords declared the final status of the West Bank to be subject to a forthcoming settlement between Israel and the Palestinian leadership Following these interim accords, Israel withdrew its military rule from some parts of the West Bank, which was divided into three Areas:\n\n\nArea annexed by Israel\nThrough the Jerusalem Law, Israel extended its administrative control over East Jerusalem This has often been interpreted as tantamount to an official annexation, though Ian Lustick, in reviewing the legal status of Israeli measures, has argued that no such annexation ever took place The Palestinian residents have legal permanent residency status [102] [103] Rejecting the Jerusalem Law, the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 478, declaring that the law was \"null and void\" Although permanent residents are permitted, if they wish, to receive Israeli citizenship if they meet certain conditions including swearing allegiance to the State and renouncing any other citizenship, most Palestinians did not apply for Israeli citizenship for political reasons [104] There are various possible reasons as to why the West Bank had not been annexed to Israel after its capture in 1967 [105] The government of Israel has not formally confirmed an official reason; however, historians and analysts have established a variety of such, most of them demographic Among those most commonly cited have been:\n\n\nArea C and Israeli settlements\nAs of 2022, there are over 450,000 Israeli settlers living in 132 Israeli settlements in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem, with an additional 220,000 Jewish settlers residing in 12 settlements in East Jerusalem [110] [111] [failed verification] In addition, there are over 140 Israeli outposts in the West Bank that are not recognized and are therefore illegal even under Israeli law, but which have nevertheless been provided with infrastructure, water, sewage, and other services by the authorities They are colloquially known as \"illegal outposts\" [112]\n\n\nPalestinian outposts\nThe Haaretz newspaper published an article in December 2005 about demolition of \"Palestinian outposts\" in Bil'in [132] The demolitions sparked a political debate as according to PeaceNow it was a double standard (\"After what happened today in Bil'in, there is no reason that the state should defend its decision to continue the construction\" credited to Michael Sfard).\n\n\nWest Bank barrier\nThe Israeli West Bank barrier is a physical barrier ordered for construction by the Israeli Government, consisting of a network of fences with vehicle-barrier trenches Israel began building the barrier on 23 June 2002, [141] two years into the Second Intifada [142] It is surrounded by an on average 60 m (197 ft) wide exclusion area (90%) and up to 8 m (26 ft) high concrete walls (10%), although in most areas the wall is not nearly that high [143] It is located mainly within the West Bank, partly along the 1949 Armistice line, or \"Green Line\" between the West Bank and Israel The length of the barrier as approved by the Israeli government is 708 km (440 mi) long [144] As of 2020, approximately 454 km (282 mi) have been constructed (64%) [144] [145] The space between the barrier and the green line is a closed military zone known as the Seam Zone, cutting off 9% of the West Bank and encompassing dozens of villages and tens of thousands of Palestinians [146] [147] [148]\n\n\nPalestinian governorates\nAfter the signing of the Oslo Accords, the West Bank was divided into 11 governorates under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority Since 2007 there are two governments claiming to be the legitimate government of the Palestinian National Authority, one based in the West Bank and one based in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\nIsraeli administrative districts\nThe West Bank is further divided into 8 administrative regions: Menashe (Jenin area), HaBik'a (Jordan Valley), Shomron (Shechem area, known in Arabic as Nablus), Efrayim (Tulkarm area), Binyamin (Ramallah/al-Bireh area), Maccabim (Maccabim area), Etzion (Bethlehem area) and Yehuda (Hebron area).\n\n\nCrossing points to Jordan and Egypt\nAllenby Bridge, or 'King Hussein Bridge', is the main port for the Palestinian in the West Bank to cross the Jordanian borders This crossing point is controlled by Israel since 1967 It was inaugurated on 11 December 2011 under the military order \"175\" entitled 'An order concerning transition station' Later, Order '446' was issued which annexed the Damia Bridge crossing point to the Allenby Bridge as a commercial crossing point only Goods were exported to Jordan, while the import was banned for security purposes [159]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs of the early-21st century, the economy of the Palestinian territories is chronically depressed, with unemployment rates constantly over 20% since 2000 The unemployment rate was 19% in the West Bank in first half of 2013 [161]\n\n\nConsequences of occupation\nAccording to a 2013 World Bank report, Israeli restrictions hinder Palestinian economic development in Area C of the West Bank [162] A 2013 World Bank report calculates that, if the Interim Agreement was respected and restrictions lifted, a few key industries alone would produce US$2.2 billion per annum more (or 23% of 2011 Palestinian GDP) and reduce by some US$800 million (50%) the Palestinian Authority's deficit; the employment would increase by 35% [163]\n\n\nEconomic consequences\nAccording to a 2013 World Bank report, Israeli restrictions hinder Palestinian economic development in Area C of the West Bank [162] A 2013 World Bank report calculates that, if the Interim Agreement was respected and restrictions lifted, a few key industries alone would produce US$2.2 billion per annum more (or 23% of 2011 Palestinian GDP) and reduce by some US$800 million (50%) the Palestinian Authority's deficit; the employment would increase by 35% [163]\n\n\nWater supply\nAmnesty International has criticized the way that the Israeli state is dealing with the regional water resources:\n\n\nIsraeli garbage disposal\nIsrael ratified the international Basel Convention treaty on Israel on 14 December 1994, according to which, any transfer of waste must be performed with an awareness of the dangers posed to the disempowered occupied people It forbids the creation among them of \"environmental sacrifice zones.\" [166] Israel, it is argued, uses the West Bank as a \"sacrifice\" zone by placing 15 waste treatment plants, which are there under less stringent rules that those required in Israel because a different legal system [which?] has been organized regarding hazardous materials that can be noxious to local people and the environment The military authorities do not make public the details of these operations These materials include sewage sludge, infectious medical waste, used oils, solvents, metals, electronic waste and batteries [167]\n\n\nPalestinian water and sewage\nIn 1995, the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) was established by a presidential decree One year later, its functions, objectives and responsibilities were defined through a by-law, giving the PWA the mandate to manage water resources and execute the water policy [183]\n\n\nResource extraction\nBased on the number of quarries per km2 in Areas A and B, it is calculated that, were Israel to lift restrictions, a further 275 quarries could be opened in Area C The World Bank estimates that Israel's virtual ban on issuing Palestinians permits for quarries there costs the Palestinian economy at least US$241 million per year [189]\nIn international law drawing on the Hague Conventions (Article 55), it is established that an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets, and that the usufruct must benefit the people under occupation The Oslo Accords agreed to hand over mining rights to the Palestinian Authority Israel licenses eleven settlement quarries in the West Bank and they sell 94% of their material to Israel, which arguably constitutes \"depletion\" and pays royalties to its West Bank military government and settlement municipalities [175]\n\n\nLoss of cultural property\nAlbert Glock argued that Israel is responsible for the disappearance of significant parts of the Palestinian cultural patrimony, by confiscating Arab cultural resources In 1967 it appropriated the Palestine Archaeological Museum [g] and its library in East Jerusalem [h] Often these losses are personal, as when homes are ransacked and looted of their valuables The journalist Hamdi Faraj, jailed for endangering public order, had his 500-volume library confiscated, including copies of the Bible and Qur'an and, when he applied for their restitution, was told all the books had been accidentally burnt [198]\nThe Israeli occupation has wrought a profound change in Palestinian identity, which clings to a sense of a \"paradise lost\" before the changes brought out by the 1967 conquest [199] [i]\n\n\nTourism\nThe Palestinian territories contain several of the most significant sites for Muslims, Christians and Jews, and are endowed with a world-class heritage highly attractive to tourists and pilgrims [201] The West Bank Palestinians themselves have difficulties in accessing the territory for recreation.\n\n\nDemographics\nIn December 2007, an official census conducted by the Palestinian Authority found that the Palestinian Arab population of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was 2,345,000 [7] [206] However, the World Bank and American-Israeli Demographic Research Group identified a 32% discrepancy between first-grade enrollment statistics documented by the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS)' 2007 projections, [207] with questions also raised about the PCBS' growth assumptions for the period 1997–2003 [208] The Israeli Civil Administration put the number of Palestinians in the West Bank at 2,657,029 as of May 2012 [209] [210]\n\n\nMajor population centers\nThe most densely populated part of the region is a mountainous spine, running north–south, where the cities of Jerusalem, Nablus, Ramallah, al-Bireh, Jenin, Bethlehem, Hebron and Yattah are located as well as the Israeli settlements of Ariel, Ma'ale Adumim and Beitar Illit Ramallah, although relatively mid in population compared to other major cities as Hebron, Nablus and Jenin, serves as an economic and political center for the Palestinians Near Ramallah the new city of Rawabi is under construction [224] [225] Jenin in the extreme north and is the capital of north of the West Bank and is on the southern edge of the Jezreel Valley Modi'in Illit, Qalqilyah and Tulkarm are in the low foothills adjacent to the Israeli Coastal Plain, and Jericho and Tubas are situated in the Jordan Valley, north of the Dead Sea.\n\n\nReligion\nThe population of the West Bank is 80–85% Muslim (mostly Sunni) and 12–14% Jewish The remainder are 1–2.5% Christian (mostly Greek Orthodox), and others [7]\n\n\nTransportation and communications\nIn 2010, the West Bank and Gaza Strip together had 4,686 km (2,912 mi) of roadways [7]\n\n\nRoad system\nIn 2010, the West Bank and Gaza Strip together had 4,686 km (2,912 mi) of roadways [7]\n\n\nRail\nAs of February 2012 [update], a plan for 475-kilometer rail network, establishing 11 new rail lines in West Bank, was confirmed by Israeli Transportation Ministry The West Bank network would include one line running through Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Ma'aleh Adumim, Bethlehem and Hebron Another would provide service along the Jordanian border from Eilat to the Dead Sea, Jericho and Beit She'an and from there toward Haifa in the west and in also in a northeasterly direction The proposed scheme also calls for shorter routes, such as between Nablus and Tul Karm in the West Bank, and from Ramallah to the Allenby Bridge crossing into Jordan [247]\n\n\nAirports\nThe only airport in the West Bank is the Atarot Airport near Ramallah, but it has been closed since 2001.\n\n\nTelecom\nThe Palestinian Paltel telecommunication companies provide communication services such as landline, cellular network and Internet in the West Bank and Gaza Strip Dialling code +970 is used in the West Bank and all over the Palestinian territories Until 2007, the Palestinian mobile market was monopolized by Jawwal A new mobile operator for the territories launched in 2009 under the name of Wataniya Telecom The number of Internet users increased from 35,000 in 2000 to 356,000 in 2010 [248]\n\n\nRadio and television\nThe Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts from an AM station in Ramallah on 675 kHz; numerous local privately owned stations are also in operation Most Palestinian households have a radio and TV, and satellite dishes for receiving international coverage are widespread Recently, PalTel announced and has begun implementing an initiative to provide ADSL broadband internet service to all households and businesses.\n\n\nEducation\nSeven universities are operating in the West Bank:\n\n\nSee

the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. It is part of the Palestinian territories and has been a subject of dispute between Palestinians and Israelis for decades.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe name West Bank is a translation of the Arabic term aḍ-Ḍiffah al-Ġarbiyyah, which designates the territory situated on the western side of the Jordan River. This annexation was widely considered to be illegal, and was recognized only by Iraq, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom.\n\n## History\n\n### Canaan\n\nThe region has a rich history dating back to the ancient Canaanites, who inhabited the area from around 3000 BCE to 586 BCE.

aḍ-Ḍiffah al-Ġarbiyyah, which designates the territory situated on the western side of the Jordan River that was occupied in 1948 and annexed in 1950 by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan This annexation was widely considered to be illegal, and was recognized only by Iraq, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom [16]\n\n\nWest Bank\nThe name West Bank is a translation of the Arabic term aḍ-Ḍiffah al-Ġarbiyyah, which designates the territory situated on the western side of the Jordan River that was occupied in 1948 and annexed in 1950 by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan This annexation was widely considered to be illegal, and was recognized only by Iraq, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom [16]\n\n\nCisjordan\nVariations on the neo-Latin name Cisiordania (lit. 'on this side of the River Jordan') are the usual names for the territory in Romance languages, e.g Spanish: Cisjordania, Portuguese: Cisjordânia, French: Cisjordanie, Italian: Cisgiordania, and Romanian: Cisiordania, and in some others, e.g Basque: Zisjordania, Breton: Sisjordania, Hungarian: Ciszjordánia, Guarani: Sihorytáña, and Esperanto: Cisjordanio [17] The name West Bank, however, has become the standard usage for this geopolitical entity in English and some of the other Germanic languages since its inception following the 1948 Jordanian capture.\n\n\nHistory\nCanaan \n\n\nJordanian West Bank\nDuring the 1948 war, Israel occupied parts of what was designated in the UN partition plan as \"Palestine\" The 1949 Armistice Agreements defined the interim boundary between Israel and Jordan, essentially reflecting the battlefield after the war [21] Following the December 1948 Jericho Conference, Transjordan annexed the area west of the Jordan River in 1950, naming it \"West Bank\" or \"Cisjordan\", and designated the area east of the river as \"East Bank\" or \"Transjordan\" Jordan, as it was now known, ruled over the West Bank from 1948 until 1967 Jordan's annexation was never formally recognized by the international community, with the exception of the United Kingdom and Iraq [22] [23] [24] King Abdullah of Jordan was crowned King of Jerusalem by the Coptic Bishop on 15 November 1948 [25] Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, were granted Jordanian citizenship and half of the Jordanian Parliament seats, thus enjoying equal opportunities in all sectors of the state [26] [27]\n\n\nIsraeli Military Governorate and Civil Administration\nIn June 1967, the West Bank and East Jerusalem were captured by Israel as a result of the Six-Day War With the exception of East Jerusalem and the former Israeli–Jordanian no man's land, the West Bank was not annexed by Israel It remained under Israeli military control until 1982.\n\n\nEarly economic impact\nThe Jordanians neglected to invest much in the area during their time governing the area, although there was some investment in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem.\n\n\nLegal status\nFrom 1517 to 1917 the West Bank was part of the Ottoman Empire Turkey, successor state to the Ottoman Empire, renounced its territorial claims in 1923, signing the Treaty of Lausanne, and the area now called the West Bank became an integral part of the British Mandate for Palestine During the Mandate period Britain had no right of sovereignty, which was held by the people under the mandate [56] Nevertheless, Britain, as custodians of the land, implemented the land tenure laws in Palestine, which it had inherited from the Ottoman Turks (as defined in the Ottoman Land Code of 1858), applying these laws to both Arab and Jewish legal tenants or otherwise [57] In 1947 the UN General Assembly recommended that the area that became the West Bank become part of a future Arab state, but this proposal was opposed by the Arab states at the time In 1948, Jordan occupied the West Bank and annexed it in 1950 [22]\n\n\nPolitical status\nThe future status of the West Bank, together with the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean shore, has been the subject of negotiation between the Palestinians and Israelis, although the 2002 Road Map for Peace, proposed by the \"Quartet\" comprising the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations, envisions an independent Palestinian state in these territories living side by side with Israel (see also history of the State of Palestine) However, the \"Road Map\" states that in the first phase, Palestinians must end all attacks on Israel, whereas Israel must dismantle all outposts.\n\n\nPublic opinion\nPalestinian public opinion opposes Israeli military and settler presence on the West Bank as a violation of their right to statehood and sovereignty [86] Israeli opinion is split into a number of views:\n\n\nGeography\nThe West Bank has an area of 5,628 or 5,640 square kilometres (2,173 or 2,178 square miles), which comprises 21.2% of former Mandatory Palestine (excluding Jordan) [89] and has generally rugged mountainous terrain The total length of the land boundaries of the region are 404 km (251 mi) [7] The terrain is mostly rugged dissected upland, some vegetation in the west, but somewhat barren in the east The elevation span between the shoreline of the Dead Sea at −408 m to the highest point at Mount Nabi Yunis, at 1,030 m (3,379 ft) above sea level [90] The West Bank is landlocked; its highlands are the main recharge area for Israel's coastal aquifers [7]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate in the West Bank is mostly Mediterranean, slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline, west to the area In the east, the West Bank includes the Judean Desert and the shoreline of the Dead Sea – both with dry and hot climate.\n\n\nPolitical geography\n\n\n\nPalestinian enclaves\nThe 1993 Oslo Accords declared the final status of the West Bank to be subject to a forthcoming settlement between Israel and the Palestinian leadership Following these interim accords, Israel withdrew its military rule from some parts of the West Bank, which was divided into three Areas:\n\n\nArea annexed by Israel\nThrough the Jerusalem Law, Israel extended its administrative control over East Jerusalem This has often been interpreted as tantamount to an official annexation, though Ian Lustick, in reviewing the legal status of Israeli measures, has argued that no such annexation ever took place The Palestinian residents have legal permanent residency status [102] [103] Rejecting the Jerusalem Law, the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 478, declaring that the law was \"null and void\" Although permanent residents are permitted, if they wish, to receive Israeli citizenship if they meet certain conditions including swearing allegiance to the State and renouncing any other citizenship, most Palestinians did not apply for Israeli citizenship for political reasons [104] There are various possible reasons as to why the West Bank had not been annexed to Israel after its capture in 1967 [105] The government of Israel has not formally confirmed an official reason; however, historians and analysts have established a variety of such, most of them demographic Among those most commonly cited have been:\n\n\nArea C and Israeli settlements\nAs of 2022, there are over 450,000 Israeli settlers living in 132 Israeli settlements in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem, with an additional 220,000 Jewish settlers residing in 12 settlements in East Jerusalem [110] [111] [failed verification] In addition, there are over 140 Israeli outposts in the West Bank that are not recognized and are therefore illegal even under Israeli law, but which have nevertheless been provided with infrastructure, water, sewage, and other services by the authorities They are colloquially known as \"illegal outposts\" [112]\n\n\nPalestinian outposts\nThe Haaretz newspaper published an article in December 2005 about demolition of \"Palestinian outposts\" in Bil'in [132] The demolitions sparked a political debate as according to PeaceNow it was a double standard (\"After what happened today in Bil'in, there is no reason that the state should defend its decision to continue the construction\" credited to Michael Sfard).\n\n\nWest Bank barrier\nThe Israeli West Bank barrier is a physical barrier ordered for construction by the Israeli Government, consisting of a network of fences with vehicle-barrier trenches Israel began building the barrier on 23 June 2002, [141] two years into the Second Intifada [142] It is surrounded by an on average 60 m (197 ft) wide exclusion area (90%) and up to 8 m (26 ft) high concrete walls (10%), although in most areas the wall is not nearly that high [143] It is located mainly within the West Bank, partly along the 1949 Armistice line, or \"Green Line\" between the West Bank and Israel The length of the barrier as approved by the Israeli government is 708 km (440 mi) long [144] As of 2020, approximately 454 km (282 mi) have been constructed (64%) [144] [145] The space between the barrier and the green line is a closed military zone known as the Seam Zone, cutting off 9% of the West Bank and encompassing dozens of villages and tens of thousands of Palestinians [146] [147] [148]\n\n\nPalestinian governorates\nAfter the signing of the Oslo Accords, the West Bank was divided into 11 governorates under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority Since 2007 there are two governments claiming to be the legitimate government of the Palestinian National Authority, one based in the West Bank and one based in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\nIsraeli administrative districts\nThe West Bank is further divided into 8 administrative regions: Menashe (Jenin area), HaBik'a (Jordan Valley), Shomron (Shechem area, known in Arabic as Nablus), Efrayim (Tulkarm area), Binyamin (Ramallah/al-Bireh area), Maccabim (Maccabim area), Etzion (Bethlehem area) and Yehuda (Hebron area).\n\n\nCrossing points to Jordan and Egypt\nAllenby Bridge, or 'King Hussein Bridge', is the main port for the Palestinian in the West Bank to cross the Jordanian borders This crossing point is controlled by Israel since 1967 It was inaugurated on 11 December 2011 under the military order \"175\" entitled 'An order concerning transition station' Later, Order '446' was issued which annexed the Damia Bridge crossing point to the Allenby Bridge as a commercial crossing point only Goods were exported to Jordan, while the import was banned for security purposes [159]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs of the early-21st century, the economy of the Palestinian territories is chronically depressed, with unemployment rates constantly over 20% since 2000 The unemployment rate was 19% in the West Bank in first half of 2013 [161]\n\n\nConsequences of occupation\nAccording to a 2013 World Bank report, Israeli restrictions hinder Palestinian economic development in Area C of the West Bank [162] A 2013 World Bank report calculates that, if the Interim Agreement was respected and restrictions lifted, a few key industries alone would produce US$2.2 billion per annum more (or 23% of 2011 Palestinian GDP) and reduce by some US$800 million (50%) the Palestinian Authority's deficit; the employment would increase by 35% [163]\n\n\nEconomic consequences\nAccording to a 2013 World Bank report, Israeli restrictions hinder Palestinian economic development in Area C of the West Bank [162] A 2013 World Bank report calculates that, if the Interim Agreement was respected and restrictions lifted, a few key industries alone would produce US$2.2 billion per annum more (or 23% of 2011 Palestinian GDP) and reduce by some US$800 million (50%) the Palestinian Authority's deficit; the employment would increase by 35% [163]\n\n\nWater supply\nAmnesty International has criticized the way that the Israeli state is dealing with the regional water resources:\n\n\nIsraeli garbage disposal\nIsrael ratified the international Basel Convention treaty on Israel on 14 December 1994, according to which, any transfer of waste must be performed with an awareness of the dangers posed to the disempowered occupied people It forbids the creation among them of \"environmental sacrifice zones.\" [166] Israel, it is argued, uses the West Bank as a \"sacrifice\" zone by placing 15 waste treatment plants, which are there under less stringent rules that those required in Israel because a different legal system [which?] has been organized regarding hazardous materials that can be noxious to local people and the environment The military authorities do not make public the details of these operations These materials include sewage sludge, infectious medical waste, used oils, solvents, metals, electronic waste and batteries [167]\n\n\nPalestinian water and sewage\nIn 1995, the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) was established by a presidential decree One year later, its functions, objectives and responsibilities were defined through a by-law, giving the PWA the mandate to manage water resources and execute the water policy [183]\n\n\nResource extraction\nBased on the number of quarries per km2 in Areas A and B, it is calculated that, were Israel to lift restrictions, a further 275 quarries could be opened in Area C The World Bank estimates that Israel's virtual ban on issuing Palestinians permits for quarries there costs the Palestinian economy at least US$241 million per year [189]\nIn international law drawing on the Hague Conventions (Article 55), it is established that an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets, and that the usufruct must benefit the people under occupation The Oslo Accords agreed to hand over mining rights to the Palestinian Authority Israel licenses eleven settlement quarries in the West Bank and they sell 94% of their material to Israel, which arguably constitutes \"depletion\" and pays royalties to its West Bank military government and settlement municipalities [175]\n\n\nLoss of cultural property\nAlbert Glock argued that Israel is responsible for the disappearance of significant parts of the Palestinian cultural patrimony, by confiscating Arab cultural resources In 1967 it appropriated the Palestine Archaeological Museum [g] and its library in East Jerusalem [h] Often these losses are personal, as when homes are ransacked and looted of their valuables The journalist Hamdi Faraj, jailed for endangering public order, had his 500-volume library confiscated, including copies of the Bible and Qur'an and, when he applied for their restitution, was told all the books had been accidentally burnt [198]\nThe Israeli occupation has wrought a profound change in Palestinian identity, which clings to a sense of a \"paradise lost\" before the changes brought out by the 1967 conquest [199] [i]\n\n\nTourism\nThe Palestinian territories contain several of the most significant sites for Muslims, Christians and Jews, and are endowed with a world-class heritage highly attractive to tourists and pilgrims [201] The West Bank Palestinians themselves have difficulties in accessing the territory for recreation.\n\n\nDemographics\nIn December 2007, an official census conducted by the Palestinian Authority found that the Palestinian Arab population of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was 2,345,000 [7] [206] However, the World Bank and American-Israeli Demographic Research Group identified a 32% discrepancy between first-grade enrollment statistics documented by the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS)' 2007 projections, [207] with questions also raised about the PCBS' growth assumptions for the period 1997–2003 [208] The Israeli Civil Administration put the number of Palestinians in the West Bank at 2,657,029 as of May 2012 [209] [210]\n\n\nMajor population centers\nThe most densely populated part of the region is a mountainous spine, running north–south, where the cities of Jerusalem, Nablus, Ramallah, al-Bireh, Jenin, Bethlehem, Hebron and Yattah are located as well as the Israeli settlements of Ariel, Ma'ale Adumim and Beitar Illit Ramallah, although relatively mid in population compared to other major cities as Hebron, Nablus and Jenin, serves as an economic and political center for the Palestinians Near Ramallah the new city of Rawabi is under construction [224] [225] Jenin in the extreme north and is the capital of north of the West Bank and is on the southern edge of the Jezreel Valley Modi'in Illit, Qalqilyah and Tulkarm are in the low foothills adjacent to the Israeli Coastal Plain, and Jericho and Tubas are situated in the Jordan Valley, north of the Dead Sea.\n\n\nReligion\nThe population of the West Bank is 80–85% Muslim (mostly Sunni) and 12–14% Jewish The remainder are 1–2.5% Christian (mostly Greek Orthodox), and others [7]\n\n\nTransportation and communications\nIn 2010, the West Bank and Gaza Strip together had 4,686 km (2,912 mi) of roadways [7]\n\n\nRoad system\nIn 2010, the West Bank and Gaza Strip together had 4,686 km (2,912 mi) of roadways [7]\n\n\nRail\nAs of February 2012 [update], a plan for 475-kilometer rail network, establishing 11 new rail lines in West Bank, was confirmed by Israeli Transportation Ministry The West Bank network would include one line running through Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Ma'aleh Adumim, Bethlehem and Hebron Another would provide service along the Jordanian border from Eilat to the Dead Sea, Jericho and Beit She'an and from there toward Haifa in the west and in also in a northeasterly direction The proposed scheme also calls for shorter routes, such as between Nablus and Tul Karm in the West Bank, and from Ramallah to the Allenby Bridge crossing into Jordan [247]\n\n\nAirports\nThe only airport in the West Bank is the Atarot Airport near Ramallah, but it has been closed since 2001.\n\n\nTelecom\nThe Palestinian Paltel telecommunication companies provide communication services such as landline, cellular network and Internet in the West Bank and Gaza Strip Dialling code +970 is used in the West Bank and all over the Palestinian territories Until 2007, the Palestinian mobile market was monopolized by Jawwal A new mobile operator for the territories launched in 2009 under the name of Wataniya Telecom The number of Internet users increased from 35,000 in 2000 to 356,000 in 2010 [248]\n\n\nRadio and television\nThe Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts from an AM station in Ramallah on 675 kHz; numerous local privately owned stations are also in operation Most Palestinian households have a radio and TV, and satellite dishes for receiving international coverage are widespread Recently, PalTel announced and has begun implementing an initiative to provide ADSL broadband internet service to all households and businesses.\n\n\nEducation\nSeven

On 16 September, in a Champions League qualifier against Ferencváros, Gvardiol made an error that led to Myrto Uzuni's winning goal for 2–1 as the Hungarian champions knocked Dinamo out to the Europa League play-offs.\n\n**RB Leipzig**\n\nGvardiol made his Bundesliga debut on 20 August 2021 in a 4–0 victory over VfB Stuttgart, playing the entire match. He quickly established himself in Leipzig's starting XI and attracted attention with his good plays. On 15 September, he made his Champions League debut in a 6–3 defeat to Manchester City. On 11 December, he scored his debut goal for Leipzig in a 4–1 victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach. He significantly contributed to Leipzig's good form during the beginning of Domenico Tedesco's tenure as manager, after the poor start of the season during previous manager Jesse Marsch's term. On 23 January 2022, he scored his second goal of the season in a 2–0 victory over VfL Wolfsburg. By the end of the season, Gvardiol helped Leipzig win the DFB-Pokal and reach the semi-finals of the Europa League, accomplishing both feats for the first time in the history of the club. Furthermore, the DFB-Pokal victory was also the first major trophy title in the history of the club.\n\n**Manchester City**\n\nOn 5 August 2023, Premier League club Manchester City announced the signing of Gvardiol on a five-year deal, making him the third Croatian to join the club's first team after Vedran Ćorluka and Mateo Kovačić. The fee was undisclosed, but reported to be around £77 million (€90 million), making Gvardiol the second most expensive defender in the world.\n\n**International Career**\n\nGvardiol earned his first call-up to Croatia national under-21 team in October 2019, at the age of 17, when coach Igor Bišćan listed him in the squad for Under-21 Euro 2021 qualifiers against Lithuania and the Czech Republic. Gvardiol debuted on 14 November against the former opponent, being named in the starting lineup, as Croatia won 3–1. On 8 October 2020, he scored the tenth goal in Croatia's 10–0 victory over San Marino, the largest victory in the history of the national team. On 9 March 2021, he was named in Bišćan's 23-man squad for the group stage of the tournament; however, he was forced to miss it due to a quadriceps injury. On 17 May, he was named in Bišćan's 23-man squad for the knockout stage of the tournament, as well as Zlatko Dalić's 26-man squad for the UEFA Euro 2020.\n\n**Style of Play**\n\nGvardiol has been described as a modern-day centre-back who can perform all the necessary defensive tasks of a traditional defender while also providing his team with serious ball progression when in possession. He has been praised for his exceptional passing range, vision, and ability to read the game.\n\n**Career Statistics**\n\n**Dinamo Zagreb**\n\n| Season | League | Cup | Europe | Total |\n| Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals |\n| 2019-20 | 12 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 19 | 1 |\n| 2020-21 | 14 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 21 | 0 |\n| 2021-22 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Total | 26 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 10 | 0 | 40 | 1 |\n\n**International**\n\n| Year | Apps | Goals |\n| 2020 | 5 | 1 |\n| 2021 | 5 | 0 |\n| Total | 10 | 1 |\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Gvardiol, Josko\" (in Croatian).

Based on the Kruckenberg SVT 137, the Deutsche Bundesbahn's (DB's) streamlined diesel-electric Class VT 11.5 (later renamed to DB Class 601) built in 1957 was used as the \"Trans Europ Express (TEE)\" for international high-speed trains.\n\n**United States**\n\nHigh-speed steam service continued in the United States after World War II, but became increasingly uneconomical. The New York Central's Super Hudsons went out of service in 1948 as the line converted to diesel for passenger service. The Milwaukee Road retired its high-speed Hiawatha steam locomotives between 1949 and 1951. The last of the Pennsylvania Railroad's short-lived T1 class locomotives went out of service in 1952. All of those iconic locomotives were scrapped. The last steam streamliners built were three Norfolk and Western class J locomotives in 1950, which operated until 1959.\n\n**Japan**\n\nAfter World War II, Japanese railroads favored multiple unit trains, even on their mainlines. In 1949, the Japanese National Railways (JNR) released the 80 series EMUs for use on long-distance trains. Lead coaches of the 80 series built after 1950 incorporated a streamlined design.\n\n**Australia**\n\nStreamliner locomotives arrived relatively late in Australia. In 1937, streamlined casings were fitted on four Victorian Railways S class locomotives for the Spirit of Progress service between Melbourne and Albury. Similar casings were then fitted on two Tasmanian Government Railways R class narrow-gauge locomotives for the Hobart to Launceston expresses.\n\n**Preserved Examples (United States)**\n\nAfter 26 years of service and traveling over 3,000,000 miles (4,800,000 km), the Pioneer Zephyr went to Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. The Flying Yankee, the third streamliner to enter service, is undergoing restoration to operational condition. The Silver Charger locomotive of the General Pershing Zephyr trainset remained in service until 1966 and is also undergoing restoration.\n\n**High Speed Train Services Today**\n\nWorldwide, many if not most, high-speed passenger trains are now streamlined. Speeds continue to rise as high-speed rail services become the normal long-distance rail service.\n\n**Streetcars and High-Speed Interurbans**\n\nEarly versions of the PCC (Presidents' Conference Committee) streetcars were referred to as Streamliners in North America. However, aerodynamic research appeared much earlier on the interurban scene, i.e., among the forerunners of the recent light rail. In 1905, the Electric Railway Test Commission started a series of test runs to develop a carbody design that would reduce wind resistance at high speeds.\n\n**Buses**\n\nMany buses adopted a stylish streamline look in the 1930s. Tests showed that streamlined design reduced fuel costs.\n\n**Automobiles**\n\nBeginning in the 1910s, engineers tried to incorporate aerodynamics into the shape of automobiles. Some such cars entered production.\n\n**Experimental and Prototype Vehicles**\n\nChronologically:\n\n* 1903: The Marcel Prieu streamliner, a French automobile that could reach a top speed of 105 km/h (65 mph).\n* 1907: The Mercedes 35 hp, a German automobile that could reach a top speed of 120 km/h (75 mph).\n* 1911: The Fiat 55 hp, an Italian automobile that could reach a top speed of 140 km/h (87 mph).\n* 1913: The Morris Cowley, a British automobile that could reach a top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph).\n* 1914: The Benz 12/35 hp, a German automobile that could reach a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph).\n\n**Production Vehicles**\n\nMany production automobiles have had streamlined bodies. Among these were, chronologically by first production year:\n\n* 1930: The Cord 812, an American automobile that could reach a top speed of 160 km/h (100 mph).\n* 1932: The Chrysler Airflow, an American automobile that could reach a top speed of 140 km/h (87 mph).\n* 1933: The Studebaker President, an American automobile that could reach a top speed of 120 km/h (75 mph).\n* 1934: The Ford V8, an American automobile that could reach a top speed of 110 km/h (68 mph).\n* 1935: The Chevrolet Master, an American automobile that could reach a top speed of 100 km/h (62 mph).\n\n**Record-Setting Streamlined Racing Cars**\n\nRacing cars setting world land speed records have extensive streamlining. These include:\n\n* 1924: The Sunbeam 350hp, a British automobile that could reach a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph).\n* 1935: The Auto Union Type C, a German automobile that could reach a top speed of 240 km/h (150 mph).\n* 1937: The Mercedes-Benz W125, a German automobile that could reach a top speed of 268 km/h (167 mph).\n* 1938: The Auto Union Type D, a German automobile that could reach a top speed of 283 km/h (176 mph).\n* 1947: The Jaguar C-Type, a British automobile that could reach a top speed of 288 km/h (179 mph).\n\n**Electric**\n\nMany small trucks and tractor units for pulling semi-trailer trucks have streamlining to improve aerodynamics.\n\n**Fuel Cell**\n\nMany small trucks and tractor units for pulling semi-trailer trucks have streamlining to improve aerodynamics.\n\n**Internal Combustion**\n\nMany small trucks and tractor units for pulling semi-trailer trucks have streamlining to improve aerodynamics.\n\n**Rocket and Jet**\n\nMany small trucks and tractor units for pulling semi-trailer trucks have streamlining to improve aerodynamics.\n\n**Trucks**\n\nMany small trucks and tractor units for pulling semi-trailer trucks have streamlining to improve aerodynamics.\n\n**Trailers**\n\nCamping (caravan) and animal trailer manufacturers use streamlining to make trailers easier to tow. Current and past manufacturers include Airstream, Avalon, Avion, Boles Aero, Bonair Oxygen, Curtis Wright, Knaus Tabbert, Silver Streak, Spartan, Streamline, and Vagabond.\n\n**Motorcycles**\n\nStreamlined motorcycles setting land-speed records include:\n\n* 1932: The Indian Scout, an American motorcycle that could reach a top speed of 160 km/h (100 mph).\n* 1935: The Norton 500, a British motorcycle that could reach a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph).\n* 1938: The BMW R5, a German motorcycle that could reach a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph).\n\n**Land-Speed Records**\n\nStreamlined motorcycles setting land-speed records include:\n\n* 1932: The Indian Scout, an American motorcycle that could reach a top speed of 160 km/h (100 mph).\n* 1935: The Norton 500, a British motorcycle that could reach a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph).\n* 1938: The BMW R5, a German motorcycle that could reach a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph).\n\n**Energy Efficiency**\n\nStreamlined motorcycles designed to reduce energy usage include:\n\n* The Honda CBR1000RR, a Japanese motorcycle that can reach a top speed of 280 km/h (174 mph) while using 2.5 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers.\n* The Yamaha YZF-R6, a Japanese motorcycle that can reach a top speed of 260 km/h (162 mph) while using 2.7 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers.\n\n**Gallery of Streamlined Motorcycles**\n\nBicycle fairings help to streamline the vehicle and the rider. Human-powered upright and recumbent bicycles and tricycles termed velomobiles that are partially or completely enclosed for aerodynamic advantage and weather protection take streamlining even further. Although many velomobiles are recreational, two-wheeled velomobiles have set a number of cycling speed records.\n\n**Bicycles and Tricycles**\n\nBicycle fairings help to streamline the vehicle and the rider.

The ship operated in Puget Sound near the northwestern coast of the U.S. state of Washington until 1967. It was scrapped in 2015.\n\n**Sterling Streamliner Diners**\n\nMany American roadside diners built since the 1930s have had streamlined exteriors and interiors. In 1939, Roland Stickney designed a diner named the Sterling Streamliner. Built by the John B. Judkins Company, a firm that also made custom car bodies, the prefabricated diner's production ceased in 1942 at the beginning of American involvement in World War II.", "prompt": "Write a complete

{"title": "John_Eastman", "content": "\nEducation\nEastman attended the Dallas-area Lewisville High School He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Dallas in 1982 He did a doctoral study in Government at the Claremont Graduate School, receiving a Ph.D in 1993 He also attended the University of Chicago Law School, where he was a member of the University of Chicago Law Review [38] [39] He graduated in 1995 with a Juris Doctor.\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1989, prior to attending law school, Eastman served as the director of Congressional and public affairs at the United States Commission on Civil Rights [40] He was also the unsuccessful 1990 Republican candidate for the United States House of Representatives in California's 34th congressional district [41]\n\n\nElections\nIn 1990 Eastman was unopposed in the primary to become the Republican challenger of long-time 34th District incumbent Esteban Torres in California's San Gabriel Valley [51] [52] [53]\n\n\n1990 congressional campaign\nIn 1990 Eastman was unopposed in the primary to become the Republican challenger of long-time 34th District incumbent Esteban Torres in California's San Gabriel Valley [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nCalifornia Attorney General campaign\nOn February 1, 2010, Eastman resigned as dean of the Chapman University School of Law to pursue the Republican nomination for California Attorney General [54] On April 1, a Superior Court judge denied Eastman's choice for ballot designation as \"Assistant Attorney General\", fearing that use of this title, temporarily granted by South Dakota for his work on a lawsuit, would be misperceived as a California title The judge further denied Eastman's second choice, \"Taxpayer Advocate/Attorney\", but accepted his third choice, \"Constitutional Law Attorney\" Such designations typically reflect a candidate's current employment or elected office [55] Eastman finished second in the three-way Republican primary with 34.2% of the vote, behind Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley, who received 47.3% [56] Cooley advanced to the 2010 California Attorney General election, where he was defeated by Kamala Harris [57]\n\n\nBoard affiliations\nEastman was chairman of the Federalist Society's practice group on federalism and separation of powers [58] [59] In 2011 he was named chairman the board of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage [60] [61] He has served as a director of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which brings election lawsuits [62] He is both a member of the board and on the faculty at the Claremont Institute [63] [64] [65] He sits on the board of advisors of St Monica Academy [66] and the advisory board of the St Thomas More Society of Orange County [67]\n\n\nControversies\nIn August 2020, Newsweek published an op-ed by Eastman questioning 2020 vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris's eligibility for the office He asserted she could not be a U.S citizen by birth despite being born in Oakland, California, if neither of her parents was a permanent resident at the time of her birth Eastman said that she could have subsequently obtained citizenship derived from the naturalization of her parents if one of them had become a citizen prior to her 16th birthday in 1980, which would have allowed Harris to fulfill the nine-year citizenship requirement necessary to become a senator [68]\n\n\nKamala Harris citizenship op-ed\nIn August 2020, Newsweek published an op-ed by Eastman questioning 2020 vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris's eligibility for the office He asserted she could not be a U.S citizen by birth despite being born in Oakland, California, if neither of her parents was a permanent resident at the time of her birth Eastman said that she could have subsequently obtained citizenship derived from the naturalization of her parents if one of them had become a citizen prior to her 16th birthday in 1980, which would have allowed Harris to fulfill the nine-year citizenship requirement necessary to become a senator [68]\n\n\n2020 presidential election\nOn December 9, 2020, Eastman represented Trump in a motion to intervene in Texas v Pennsylvania, a case filed directly in the U.S Supreme Court by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, in which the state of Texas sought to annul the voting processes and, by extension, the electoral college results of at least four other states Eastman's brief included an array of unfounded claims and asserted \"It is not necessary for  [Trump] to prove that fraud occurred\", as well as that it was enough to show that elections \"materially deviated\" from the intent of state lawmakers, adding, \"By failing to follow the rule of law, these officials put our nation's belief in elected self-government at risk.\" [76] [77] [78] Two days later, on December 12, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, finding that Texas did not have standing saying Texas \"has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections\" [79] On December 13, 2020, 159 Chapman University faculty members (including two from the law school) published a statement condemning Eastman for the filing [80]\n\n\nLegal strategies to reject electoral votes\nOn December 9, 2020, Eastman represented Trump in a motion to intervene in Texas v Pennsylvania, a case filed directly in the U.S Supreme Court by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, in which the state of Texas sought to annul the voting processes and, by extension, the electoral college results of at least four other states Eastman's brief included an array of unfounded claims and asserted \"It is not necessary for  [Trump] to prove that fraud occurred\", as well as that it was enough to show that elections \"materially deviated\" from the intent of state lawmakers, adding, \"By failing to follow the rule of law, these officials put our nation's belief in elected self-government at risk.\" [76] [77] [78] Two days later, on December 12, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, finding that Texas did not have standing saying Texas \"has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections\" [79] On December 13, 2020, 159 Chapman University faculty members (including two from the law school) published a statement condemning Eastman for the filing [80]\n\n\nActions during the January 6th attack on the Capitol\nOn January 6, Eastman spoke alongside Giuliani at the \"Save America\" rally that preceded the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol and asserted without evidence that balloting machines contained \"secret folders\" that altered voting results [97] [98] [99] [100]\n\n\nAftermath of January 6\nAccording to testimony given to the January 6 Committee by former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann, Eastman emailed Giuliani several days after the storming of the Capitol, asking to be placed on the list of those to be given a presidential pardon before Trump's term in office ended The request came a few days after a heated exchange between Herschmann and Eastman that ended with Herschmann suggesting that Eastman hire a criminal defense lawyer Eastman emailed Giuliani, saying \"I've decided that I should be on the pardon list if that is still in the works.\" Trump did not issue a pardon to Eastman [104] [105]\n\n\nCongressional and FBI/DOJ investigations\nAccording to testimony given to the January 6 Committee by former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann, Eastman emailed Giuliani several days after the storming of the Capitol, asking to be placed on the list of those to be given a presidential pardon before Trump's term in office ended The request came a few days after a heated exchange between Herschmann and Eastman that ended with Herschmann suggesting that Eastman hire a criminal defense lawyer Eastman emailed Giuliani, saying \"I've decided that I should be on the pardon list if that is still in the works.\" Trump did not issue a pardon to Eastman [104] [105]\n\n\nEffort to withhold emails\nIn an effort to withhold 19,000 emails subpoenaed by the committee, in January 2022 an attorney for Eastman told a federal judge that they were protected by attorney-client privilege because Eastman had been representing Trump while participating in the January 2 conference call with state legislators; the January 3 Oval Office meeting with Trump and Pence; and while working as a member of the Trump team at the Willard Hotel command center Eastman had not previously asserted privilege The emails were stored on servers at Eastman's former employer, Chapman University, which had been subpoenaed and did not object to their release The judge ordered the emails released to Eastman's legal team to identify which they asserted were privileged, before allowing a third party to scrutinize them [115] Eastman relinquished nearly 8,000 emails to the committee in February 2022 but asserted privilege for about 11,000 others [116]\n\n\nContinued efforts to 'de-certify' the election\nSeventeen months after the election, Eastman continued to press state legislatures to \"de-certify\" their election results Some legal experts said his continued efforts might increase his criminal legal exposure, though if he were charged he might assert his persistent efforts showed he truly believed the election was stolen [122] [123]\n\n\nFailure to release documents\nIn a late-night court filing on May 19, 2022, Eastman disclosed he had routinely communicated with Trump directly or via \"six conduits\" regarding legal strategy leading up to January 6, detailing \"two hand-written notes from former President Trump about information that he thought might be useful for the anticipated litigation.\" Eastman made the disclosure to claim attorney-client privilege to prevent the January 6 committee from obtaining 600 of his emails [125]\n\n\nCriminal referral\nOn December 19, 2022, Eastman and Trump were publicly named during a televised  January 6 Committee hearing as being among those who the committee wanted charged for the January 6, 2021 U.S Capitol attack [138] [139]\n\n\nWikipedia editing\nOn January 7, 2021, Eastman edited this Wikipedia article to portray his post-election activities in a more favorable light, in violation of Wikipedia's conflict-of-interest guidelines His edits were reverted, and on January 9 he appealed on the article's talk page, where some changes were approved but others were denied [140]\n\n\nRepercussions at universities\nOn January 9, 2021, the chairman of Chapman's board of trustees and two other members (including former Democratic Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez) called on the university's president and provost and the law school's dean \"to promptly take action against Eastman for his role in the events of Jan 6\" Eastman responded that he was speaking two miles away from the Capitol building [141] [142] Four days later, Chapman announced that Eastman had agreed to retire from the university, and the university's president, Daniele C Struppa, said that Eastman and the university had \"agreed not to engage in legal actions of any kind, including any claim of defamation that may currently exist, as both parties move forward\" [143] Eastman published a statement the next day saying that those who publicly condemned him \"have created such a hostile environment for me that I no longer wish to be a member of the Chapman faculty, and am therefore retiring from my position, effective immediately\" He said he would continue with his Spring 2021 position as visiting professor of Conservative Thought and Policy at the University of Colorado and intended to then devote full-time effort to his position as director of the Claremont Institute's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence [142] [144]\n\n\nCalifornia State Bar investigation and charges\nOn October 4, 2021, a bipartisan group of attorneys, including two former federal judges and two former justices of the California Supreme Court, filed a complaint with the State Bar of California asking for an investigation of Eastman relating to \"his representation of former President Donald J Trump in efforts to discredit and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election\" [147] [148] In March 2022, the State Bar of California announced that since September 2021, it had been investigating claims of possible violations of law and ethics rules by Eastman [149] Eastman's attorney said he expected Eastman to be exonerated [150] On January 26, 2023, Eastman was charged with multiple disciplinary counts by the State Bar of California [151]\n\n\nTrial\nOn June 20, 2023, Eastman's trial before the California Bar Court began [154] [155] After an eight-week pause, [155] on August 24, Matthew A Seligman, an expert witness for the prosecution, submitted a 91-page report arguing that Eastman's positions — that Pence had had \"unilateral authority\" related to the electoral vote counting procedures — were not \"reasonable\" [156] [157] In August, Eastman asked a judge to further postpone the disbarment proceedings, as he was concerned he might soon be criminally indicted on federal charges Days earlier, in the United States of America v Donald J Trump indictment, he was mentioned as \"Co-conspirator No 2\" [158] (as confirmed by his lawyer), [159] though he had not been charged in that indictment Days later, he was criminally indicted in Fulton County, Georgia [160] Eastman's postponement request was denied by a judge on the California State Bar Court on August 25, 2023 [161]  Eastman called as his first witness, Michael Gableman, a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice [162] Gableman previously conducted a 14-month inquiry regarding alleged illegalities in the Wisconsin election in which Biden achieved a 21,000-vote victory; his inquiry found no proof of voting fraud or manipulation [162] During his testimony to the State Bar, Gableman confirmed the results of his inquiry and admitted that he did not have \"any understanding of how elections work\" [162]\n\n\nCriminal cases\nOn August 14, 2023, Eastman and 18 other people were indicted by a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury in the prosecution for participating in Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 United States presidential election in Georgia Eastman surrendered on August 22, and was booked at the Fulton County jail [33] [170]\n\n\n2023 indictment in Georgia\nOn August 14, 2023, Eastman and 18 other people were indicted by a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury in the

Fulton County jail [33] [170]\n\n\n2024 indictment in Arizona\nEastman's alleged role as \"a legal architect of the plan\" [174] [175] to advance \"fake electors\" in Arizona led to his indictment on conspiracy, fraud and forgery charges there in April 2024 [176] On May 17, 2024, Eastman would be the first of 18 defendants to be arraigned in court for the case involving the conspiracy to overturn the Arizona election results with the use of fake electors [177] [37] [178] He would be arraigned at the Maricopa County Superior Court after being arrested [179] [36] [177] [178] The same day, he entered a plea of not guilty, stating that \"I had zero communications with the electors in Arizona (and) zero involvement in any of the election litigation in Arizona or legislative hearings And I am confident that with the laws faithfully applied, I will be fully be exonerated at the end of this process.\" [37] [178] The same day, Eastman would be released from custody without conditions

[98] [99] [100]\n\n\nAftermath of January 6\nAccording to testimony given to the January 6 Committee by former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann, Eastman emailed Giuliani several days after the

Giuliani, saying \"I've decided that I should be on the pardon list if that is still in the works.\" Trump did not issue a pardon to Eastman [104] [105]\n\n\nEffort to withhold emails\nIn an effort to withhold 19,000 emails subpoenaed by the committee, in January 2022 an attorney for Eastman told a federal judge that they were protected by attorney-client privilege because Eastman had been representing Trump while participating in the January 2 conference call with state legislators; the January 3 Oval Office meeting with Trump and Pence; and while working as a member of the Trump team at the Willard Hotel command center Eastman had not previously asserted privilege The emails were stored on servers at Eastman's former employer, Chapman University, which had been subpoenaed and did not object to their release The judge ordered the emails released to Eastman's legal team to identify which they asserted were privileged, before allowing a third party to scrutinize them [115] Eastman relinquished nearly 8,000 emails to the committee in February 2022 but asserted privilege for about 11,000 others [116]\n\n\nContinued efforts to 'de-certify' the election\nSeventeen months after the election, Eastman continued to press state legislatures to \"de-certify\" their election results Some legal experts said his continued efforts might increase his criminal legal exposure, though if he were charged he might assert his persistent efforts showed he truly believed the election was stolen [122] [123]\n\n\nFailure to release documents\nIn a late-night court filing on May 19, 2022, Eastman disclosed he had routinely communicated with Trump directly or via \"six conduits\" regarding legal strategy leading up to January 6, detailing \"two hand-written notes from former President Trump about information that he thought might be useful for the anticipated litigation.\" Eastman made the disclosure to claim attorney-client privilege to prevent the January 6 committee from obtaining 600 of his emails [125]\n\n\nCriminal referral\nOn December 19, 2022, Eastman and Trump were publicly named during a televised  January 6 Committee hearing as being among those who the

responded that he was speaking two miles away from the Capitol building [141] [142] Four days later, Chapman announced that Eastman had agreed to retire from the university, and the university's president, Daniele C Struppa, said that Eastman and the university had \"agreed not to engage in legal actions of any kind, including any claim of defamation that may currently exist, as both parties move forward\" [143] Eastman published a statement the next day saying that those who publicly condemned him \"have created such a hostile environment for me that I no longer wish to be a member of

State Bar of California [151]\n\n\nTrial\nOn June 20, 2023, Eastman's trial before the California Bar Court began [154] [155] After an eight-week pause, [155] on August 24, Matthew A Seligman, an expert witness for the prosecution, submitted a 91-page report arguing that Eastman's positions — that Pence had had \"unilateral authority\" related to the electoral vote counting procedures — were not \"reasonable\" [156] [157] In August, Eastman asked a judge to further postpone the disbarment proceedings, as he was concerned he might soon be criminally indicted on federal charges Days earlier, in the United States of America v Donald J Trump indictment, he was mentioned as \"Co-conspirator No 2\" [158] (as confirmed by his lawyer), [159] though he had not been charged in that indictment Days later, he was criminally indicted in Fulton County, Georgia [160] Eastman's postponement request was denied by a judge on the California State Bar Court on August 25, 2023 [161]  Eastman called as his first witness, Michael Gableman, a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice [162] Gableman previously conducted a 14-month inquiry regarding alleged illegalities in the Wisconsin election in which Biden achieved a 21,000-vote victory; his inquiry found no proof of voting fraud or manipulation [162] During his testimony to the State Bar, Gableman confirmed the results of his

Fulton County jail [33] [170]\n\n\n2024 indictment in Arizona\nEastman's alleged role as \"a legal architect of the plan\" [174] [175] to advance \"fake electors\" in Arizona led to his indictment on conspiracy, fraud and forgery charges there in April 2024 [176] On May 17, 2024, Eastman would be the first of 18 defendants to be arraigned in court for the case involving the conspiracy to overturn the Arizona election results with the use of fake electors [177] [37] [178] He would be arraigned at the Maricopa County Superior Court after being arrested [179] [36] [177] [178] The same day, he

He is best known for his work in the Victorian era, particularly in the development of the Old English style. Sherrin's architectural practice was active from the late 1870s to the early 20th century, during which time he designed numerous buildings, including churches, schools, and residential properties.\n\nEarly Years\n------------\n\nGeorge Campbell Sherrin was born in the City of London in 1843. He was baptised on 2 January 1845 at St Ann Blackfriars. Sherrin's early life is not well-documented, but it is known that he was articled to Henry Edward Kendall Jr in 1859. After completing his apprenticeship, Sherrin worked as an assistant to Samuel Joseph Nicholl before joining John Taylor Junior. He then spent a ten-year period working with Frederic Chancellor in Essex.\n\nIn 1872, Sherrin joined the Architectural Association, a prestigious architectural institution that would play an important role in his future career. The association provided Sherrin with access to a network of like-minded architects and allowed him to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.\n\nCareer\n---------\n\nIn 1877, Sherrin opened his own architectural practice in Broad Street, London. This marked the beginning of a successful career that would span over three decades. The first recorded work from his practice was the United Reformed Church Sunday School in Courthill Road, Lewisham, which was completed in 1881 and is now Grade II listed.\n\nSherrin's practice was soon recognized by the Royal Academy of Arts, and he first exhibited at the academy in 1881 with a design for the Masters House at Woburn Park School. This was the first of five displays at the academy, with the last being in 1889. The picture of The Gatehouse, Ingatestone, a house he had designed for himself, was regarded as the best of his exhibited works.\n\nIn 1882, Sherrin was admitted as an associate member of the Royal Institute of British Architects. This prestigious institution would provide Sherrin with further opportunities for professional growth and recognition. He was also commissioned to design Newlands Hall in the village, which is now Grade II listed.\n\nSherrin's designs for Woburn Park School in Weybridge, including the Masters House (1881), school residence, and cricket pavilion (1883), were completed by 1892. His work at Woburn Park School demonstrates his ability to design buildings that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n------------------------\n\nSherrin was a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects Art Committee and the Burlington Fine Arts Club. He was married and had three daughters and three sons. His son, Frank, would later become an architect like his father and complete Sherrin's work after his death.\n\nSherrin died in Holborn on 8 December 1909. A funeral service was held at St Mary's, Moorfields, on 13 December. His death marked the end of an era in British architecture, but his legacy continues to be celebrated through his numerous buildings and designs.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nGeorge Campbell Sherrin was a talented British architect who made significant contributions to the development of the Old English style. His architectural practice was active from the late 1870s to the early 20th century, during which time he designed numerous buildings, including churches, schools, and residential properties. Sherrin's work continues to be celebrated through his numerous buildings and designs, and his legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of good design and architecture in our lives.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Campbell_Sherrin\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly years\nSherrin was born in the City of London in 1843, and was baptised on the 2 January 1845 at St Ann Blackfriars [3] He was first articled to Henry Edward Kendall Jr in 1859, before going onto work as an assistant to Samuel Joseph Nicholl He became an assistant with John Taylor Junior before engaging in a ten-year stint with Frederic Chancellor in Essex [3] [4] In 1872 he joined the Architectural Association [5]\n\n\nCareer\nSherrin opened his own architectural practice in 1877 in Broad Street, London [6] The first recorded work from his practice was the United Reformed Church Sunday School in Courthill Road, Lewisham which was completed in 1881 and is now Grade II listed [3] [7] [8] This year, Sherrin first exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, with a design for the Masters House at Woburn Park School, which was the first of five displays at the academy with the last being in 1889 [9] [10] The picture of The Gatehouse, Ingatestone, a house he had designed for himself, was regarded as the best of his exhibited works [11] [12] In 1882, Sherrin was admitted as an associate member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and leased several plots of land in Station Road, Ingatestone from the Petre Estate, where his own property, The Gatehouse was built along with Ardtully, Chantry and Redhouse in the Old English style, with them all being completed by 1884 He was also commissioned to design Newlands Hall in the village, which is now Grade II listed [11] [12] [13] Sherrin would later design the Working Men's Club in Ingatestone in 1888, which is now a community centre [11] [14] Sherrin's designs for Woburn Park School in Weybridge, including the Masters House (1881), school residence and cricket pavilion (1883) were completed by 1892 [15] [4]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nSherrin was a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects Art Committee and the Burlington Fine Arts Club He was married and had three daughters and three sons, with his son Frank also becoming an architect like his father and completing Sherrin's work after his death [1] Sherrin died in Holborn on 8 December 1909 with a funeral service being held at St Mary's, Moorfields on 13 December [2]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day [1] This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616 [15] [16] He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son [17]\n\n\nLondon and theatrical career\nIt is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592 [41] By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit from that year:\n\n\nLater years and death\nNicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Samuel Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford \"some years before his death\" [69] [70] He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men \"placed men players\" there, \"which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.\" [71] However, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609 [72] [73] The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610), [74] which meant there was often no acting work Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time [75] Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614 [69] In 1612, he was called as a witness in Bellott v Mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary [76] [77] In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory; [78] and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall [79] After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613 [80] His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher, [81] who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men He retired in 1613, before the Globe Theatre burned down during the performance of Henry VIII on 29 June [80]\n\n\nPlays\nMost playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, as critics agree Shakespeare did, mostly early and late in his career [107]\n\n\nClassification\nShakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories, and tragedies [157] Two plays not included in the First Folio, [13] The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles, Prince of Tyre, are now accepted as part of the canon, with today's scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both [158] [159] No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio.\n\n\nPerformances\nIt is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes [167] After the plagues of 1592–93, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames [168] Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV, Leonard Digges recording, \"Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest .. and you scarce shall have a room\" [169] When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark [170] [171] The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with Julius Caesar one of the first plays staged Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear [170] [172] [173]\n\n\nTextual sources\nIn 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time [182] The others had already appeared in quarto versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves [183] No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as \"stol'n and surreptitious copies\" [184]\n\n\nPoems\nIn 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin [189] Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, [190] the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust [191] Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609 Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects [192] [193] [194] The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission [192] [194] [195]\n\n\nSonnets\nPublished in 1609, the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership [196] [197] Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's \"sugred Sonnets among his private friends\" [198] Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence [199] He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the \"dark lady\"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the \"fair youth\") It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial \"I\" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets \"Shakespeare unlocked his heart\" [198] [197]\n\n\nStyle\nShakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama [203] The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted [204] [205]\n\n\nLegacy\nShakespeare's work has made a significant and lasting impression on later theatre and literature In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre [220] Until Romeo and Juliet, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy [221] Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but Shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds [222] His work heavily influenced later poetry The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as \"feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.\" [223] John Milton, considered by many to be the most important English poet after Shakespeare, wrote in tribute: \"Thou in our wonder and astonishment/ Hast built thyself a live-long monument.\" [224]\n\n\nInfluence\nShakespeare's work has made

after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him [265] Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford [266] Several \"group theories\" have also been proposed [267] All but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory, with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution, [268] but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century [269] [270] [271]\n\n\nAuthorship\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him [265]

first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583 Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical, [281] and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love [282] [283] [284] The 26 so-called \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons [285]\n\n\nPortraiture\nNo written contemporary description of Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare [286] That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, re-paintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people [287] [288]\n\n\nSee

Shakespeare**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWilliam Shakespeare is widely regarded as one of the greatest playwrights and poets in the English language. Born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564, he wrote at least 38 plays and 154 sonnets, and his works are still performed and studied today. This article provides an overview of Shakespeare's life, works, and legacy.\n\n**Life**\n\nShakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day. This date has been adopted by biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616. He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nShakespeare's early life is not well documented, but it is believed that he was educated at the local grammar school in Stratford. He married Anne Hathaway, who was six years his senior and pregnant at the time of their marriage. They had three children, Susanna, Hamnet, and Judith. Shakespeare's parents were both prominent members of the community, and his father was a successful businessman who served as an alderman and a justice of the peace.\n\n**London and Theatrical Career**\n\nIt is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592. By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene. Shakespeare's early plays were performed by various troupes, including the Lord Chamberlain's Men, who later became known as the King's Men. He became a shareholder in the company and eventually became its manager.\n\n**Later Years and Death**\n\nNicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Samuel Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford \"some years before his death\". However, it is believed that he continued to visit London during the years 1611-1614. In 1612, he was called as a witness in a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary. In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory. After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613. His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher, who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men.\n\n**Plays**\n\nShakespeare's plays are divided into three categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies. The comedies include \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"The Taming of the Shrew\", and \"Twelfth Night\". The histories include \"Henry V\", \"Richard III\", and \"Henry VIII\". The tragedies include \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Hamlet\", and \"Macbeth\". Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, as critics agree Shakespeare did, mostly early and late in his career.\n\n**Performances**\n\nIt is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of \"Titus Andronicus\" reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes. After the plagues of 1592-93, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames. Londoners flocked to see the first part of \"Henry IV\", and when the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark.\n\n**Textual Sources**\n\nIn 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays. The First Folio contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time. The others had already appeared in quarto versions, made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves. No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as \"stol'n and surreptitious copies\".\n\n**Poems**\n\nIn 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, \"Venus and Adonis\" and \"The Rape of Lucrece\". He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. \"Venus and Adonis\" tells the story of an innocent Adonis who rejects the sexual advances of Venus. \"The Rape of Lucrece\" tells the story of the virtuous wife Lucrece, who is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Both poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.\n\n**Sonnets**\n\nShakespeare's sonnets are a collection of 154 poems that he wrote throughout his career. The sonnets are divided into two main categories: the \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, which are addressed to a married woman, and the \"Fair Youth\" sonnets, which are addressed to a young man. The sonnets are written in a variety of styles and forms, and they explore themes of love, beauty, and mortality.\n\n**Style**\n\nShakespeare's style is characterized by his use of language, imagery, and metaphor. His plays and poems are known for their rich and complex language, which is often described as \"poetic\" or \"lyric\". Shakespeare's use of metaphor and imagery adds depth and complexity to his writing, and it allows him to convey complex emotions and ideas in a way that is both subtle and powerful.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nShakespeare's legacy is immense and far-reaching. His plays and poems have been translated into many languages and have been performed and studied around the world. His influence on literature and drama is incalculable, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language. His works continue to be performed and studied today, and his legacy will undoubtedly continue to inspire and influence writers and artists for generations to come.\n\n**Critical Reputation**\n\nShakespeare's critical reputation is complex and multifaceted. While some critics have praised his works as masterpieces of literature and drama, others have criticized his writing as flawed or even barbaric. However, most critics agree that Shakespeare is a major figure in the history of literature and drama, and his works continue to be widely studied and performed today.\n\n**Speculation**\n\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him. Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Several \"group theories\" have also been proposed, but all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory.\n\n**Authorship**\n\nThe authorship of Shakespeare's works is a topic of ongoing debate and speculation. While most scholars accept that Shakespeare wrote the plays and poems attributed to him, some have questioned his authorship on the basis of stylistic and historical evidence. However, the majority of scholars and literary historians accept that Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him.\n\n**Religion**\n\nShakespeare's private views on religion have been the subject of debate. While he conformed to the official state religion, his will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptised, and where he is buried. However, his plays and poems often express a more nuanced and complex view of religion, and some critics have interpreted his works as expressing a form of skepticism or even atheism.\n\n**Sexuality**\n\nFew details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical, and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love.\n\n**Portraiture**\n\nNo written contemporary description of Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait.

while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin [189] Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, [190] the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust [191] Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609 Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects [192] [193] [194] The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission [192] [194] [195]\n\n\nSonnets\nPublished in 1609, the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership [196] [197] Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's \"sugred Sonnets among his private friends\" [198] Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence [199] He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the \"dark lady\"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the \"fair youth\") It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial \"I\" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets \"Shakespeare unlocked his heart\" [198] [197]\n\n\nStyle\nShakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama [203] The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted [204] [205]\n\n\nLegacy\nShakespeare's work has made a significant and lasting impression on later theatre and literature In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre [220] Until Romeo and Juliet, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy [221] Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but Shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds [222] His work heavily influenced later poetry The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as \"feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.\" [223] John Milton, considered by many to be the most important English poet after Shakespeare, wrote in tribute: \"Thou in our wonder and astonishment/ Hast built thyself a live-long monument.\" [224]\n\n\nInfluence\nShakespeare's work has made a significant and lasting impression on later theatre and literature In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre [220] Until Romeo and Juliet, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy [221] Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but Shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds [222] His work heavily influenced later poetry The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as \"feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.\" [223] John Milton, considered by many to be the most important English poet after Shakespeare, wrote in tribute: \"Thou in our wonder and astonishment/ Hast built thyself a live-long monument.\" [224]\n\n\nCritical reputation\nHe was not of an age, but for all time.\n\n\nSpeculation\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him [265] Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford [266] Several \"group theories\" have also been proposed [267] All but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory, with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution, [268] but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century [269] [270] [271]\n\n\nAuthorship\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him [265] Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford [266] Several \"group theories\" have also been proposed [267] All but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory, with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution, [268] but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century [269] [270] [271]\n\n\nReligion\nShakespeare conformed to the official state religion, [j] but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate Shakespeare's will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptised, and where he is buried \n\n\nSexuality\nFew details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583 Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical, [281] and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love [282] [283] [284] The 26 so-called \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons [285]\n\n\nPortraiture\nNo written contemporary description of Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare [286] That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, re-paintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people [287] [288]\n\n\nSee also\nEducation\n\n\nReferences\nEducation\n\n\nNotes\nEducation\n\n\nCitations\nEducation\n\n\nSources\nEducation\n\n\nExternal links\nEducation\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the presence of the mayor Cotta Ramusino The requests were: physical expansion, aesthetic improvement of the existing structure, and the creation of family graves [3] The project appraisal was initially assigned to the architect Carlo Morosetti His proposed project was unsuccessful and the Council decided to entrust it to someone else [2]\n\n\nColla's project\nOn 23 May 1884, the architect

invest 800,000 euros in the Cemetery's extension This intervention was considered necessary due to the limited number of existing tombs available The renovation took place in two different areas: the main Cemetery in Milanese Street where 200 new tombs and 6 chapels would be constructed and the Casoni di Sant'Albino's Cemetery with the addition of 20 niches [7] The project for the Casoni di Sant'Albino cemetery was carried out accordingly to the planned schedule The reconstruction of the main Cemetery in Milanese Street was repeatedly postponed by the junta of Mortara beyond the planned

Mortara**\n\nThe Monumental Cemetery of Mortara is a historic cemetery located in Mortara, a town in the province of Pavia, Lombardy, Italy. The cemetery is a significant cultural and historical landmark, showcasing various architectural styles and artistic works.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Monumental Cemetery of Mortara was established in 1802, following the relocation of the original city cemetery due to health and olfactory concerns. The new cemetery was designed to be a grand and monumental space, reflecting the importance of the town and its inhabitants. Over the years, the cemetery has undergone several expansions, with notable architects contributing to its design and construction.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe original city cemetery was located within the city next to the church of San Lorenzo. In 1802, in response to health and olfactory factors related to the existing Cemetery, a new Cemetery was constructed outside the city by the Municipality of Mortara, at that time belonging to the Cisalpine Republic. The new location was adjacent to the road to Vigevano, in the locality of San Rocco. Due to the Cemetery's new location, the name was changed to the Cemetery of San Rocco al Porto. Despite the relocation, the new Cemetery soon became insufficient due to the growth of the local population. By 1846, both the Bishop of Vigevano and the Canon Reverend Calvi were requesting an expansion because the space was not sufficient and they were having to bury the deceased outside of the Cemetery.\n\n**Morosetti's Project**\n\nThe City Council discussed the expansion of the Cemetery in the Assembly of 26 May 1883, in the presence of the mayor Cotta Ramusino. The requests were: physical expansion, aesthetic improvement of the existing structure, and the creation of family graves. The project appraisal was initially assigned to the architect Carlo Morosetti. His proposed project was unsuccessful, and the Council decided to entrust it to someone else.\n\n**Colla's Project**\n\nOn 23 May 1884, the architect Angelo Colla was entrusted to pursue the project, and it was approved by the Prefect of the province. Colla planned to expand the Cemetery, creating a new entrance and a large central arch. He designed the chapels, porches, and arcades, and introduced a new architectural style that would characterize the Cemetery.\n\n**Pirovano's Project**\n\nIn 1902, the lack of space made it necessary to further expand the Cemetery, with the construction of further chapels. On 29 November 1902, the Municipal Council discussed the measures regarding the building of new arches, in accord with those previously constructed by the architect Angelo Colla. On 26 September 1904, the Council decided to entrust the expansion project to the architect Ernesto Pirovano, who had previously collaborated with Colla. In June 1907, the project was presented and approved by the council.\n\n**Modern Expansion**\n\nIn 2016, in response to the constant requests for more niches and tombs, the Comune of Mortara decided to invest 800,000 euros in the Cemetery's extension. This intervention was considered necessary due to the limited number of existing tombs available. The renovation took place in two different areas: the main Cemetery in Milanese Street, where 200 new tombs and 6 chapels would be constructed, and the Casoni di Sant'Albino's Cemetery, with the addition of 20 niches.\n\n**Architects**\n\nThe Monumental Cemetery of Mortara has been designed by several notable architects, including Carlo Morosetti, Angelo Colla, and Ernesto Pirovano. Morosetti was an Italian engineer and civic expert who was responsible for the evaluation and purchase of the land for the expansion. Colla was an Italian decorator and restorer who was known for his eclectic style, which influenced the design of the Cemetery. Pirovano was an Italian architect who collaborated with Colla and designed several chapels and arches in the Cemetery.\n\n**Sculptures, Paintings, and Mosaics**\n\nThe Monumental Cemetery of Mortara features several sculptures, paintings, and mosaics created by notable artists, including the brothers Felice and Ferdinando Bialetti. Felice Bialetti was a sculptor who specialized in funerary works and created several sculptures for the Cemetery. Ferdinando Bialetti was a painter who created frescoes and paintings for the Cemetery. The Cemetery also features several detailed mosaics that add to its artistic and cultural significance.\n\n**Famous Burials**\n\nThe Monumental Cemetery of Mortara is the final resting place of several notable individuals, including soldiers who died during World War I. The Cemetery also features family graves and graves of missionary nuns born in Mortara. In 2020, a remembrance area for people who died of Covid-19 was dedicated in the Cemetery.\n\n**Thefts**\n\nThe Cemetery has been subject to several break-ins, where thieves have stolen copper cornices and bronze sculptures. Surveillance cameras and alarm systems have been installed as security measures to prevent this from happening again.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nThe Monumental Cemetery of Mortara is a significant cultural and historical landmark, showcasing various architectural styles and artistic works. The Cemetery features a large central arch, chapels, porches, and arcades, as well as several sculptures, paintings, and mosaics. The Cemetery is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in history, art, and architecture.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThe Monumental Cemetery of Mortara is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in history, art, and architecture.

He is a left-arm orthodox spin bowler and a right-handed batsman.\n\n**Domestic and T20 Franchise Career**\n\nNarine made his debut in first-class cricket for Trinidad and Tobago in February 2009 during the Regional Four Day Competition. He bowled thirteen overs without taking a wicket. He did not play another first-class match until nearly a year later, and after going wicketless in the first innings claimed a double scalp in the second, that of tail-ender Lionel Baker.\n\nNarine's performances in first-class cricket were followed by success in domestic T20 competitions. He played for Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean Premier League and was instrumental in the team's success. He also played for the Guyana Amazon Warriors in the same league and was a key player in the team's championship-winning campaign.\n\nIn addition to his first-class and T20 cricket, Narine has also played in various franchise leagues around the world. He played for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League from 2012 to 2017 and was a key player in the team's success. He also played for the Dhaka Dynamites in the Bangladesh Premier League and was a key player in the team's championship-winning campaign.\n\n**International Career**\n\nWhen the West Indies toured India in November and December 2011, Narine was included in the squad. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in the third fixture on 6 December, taking the wickets of Virat Kohli and then Ravichandran Ashwin to help the West Indies to a 16-run victory.\n\nPlaying in the final two matches (both won by India), Narine took one more wicket while conceding a further 87 runs. Despite this, he was retained in the squad for the remaining ODIs and played a key role in the team's success.\n\nNarine's success in ODIs was followed by success in Test cricket. He made his Test debut in December 2012 and took three wickets in the first innings of the match. He also scored a half-century in the second innings, helping the West Indies to a draw.\n\nNarine has since become a regular member of the West Indies Test team and has taken over 100 wickets in the format. He has also played in several series against India, Australia, and England, and has been a key player in the team's success.\n\n**Bowling Action**\n\nNarine has the reputation of a \"mystery bowler,\" due to the variations that he has on his off breaks, and how he disguises them. However, his bowling action has been reported for being suspect on several occasions.

{"title": "Frida_Kahlo", "content": "\nArtistic career\nKahlo enjoyed art from an early age, receiving drawing instruction from printmaker Fernando Fernández (who was her father's friend) [8] and filling notebooks with sketches [9] In 1925, she began to work outside of school to help her family [10] After briefly working as a stenographer, she became a paid engraving apprentice for Fernández [11] He was impressed by her talent, [12] although she did not consider art as a career at this time [9]\n\n\nEarly career\nKahlo enjoyed art from an early age, receiving drawing instruction from printmaker Fernando Fernández (who was her father's friend) [8] and filling notebooks with sketches [9] In 1925, she began to work outside of school to help her family [10] After briefly working as a stenographer, she became a paid engraving apprentice for Fernández [11] He was impressed by her talent, [12] although she did not consider art as a career at this time [9]\n\n\nWork in the United States\nWhen Kahlo and Rivera moved to San Francisco in 1930, Kahlo was introduced to American artists such as Edward Weston, Ralph Stackpole, Timothy L Pflueger, and Nickolas Muray [24] The six months spent in San Francisco were a productive period for Kahlo, [25] who further developed the folk art style she had adopted in Cuernavaca [26] In addition to painting portraits of several new acquaintances, [27] she made Frieda and Diego Rivera (1931), a double portrait based on their wedding photograph, [28] and The Portrait of Luther Burbank (1931), which depicted the eponymous horticulturist as a hybrid between a human and a plant [29] Although she still publicly presented herself as simply Rivera's spouse rather than as an artist, [30] she participated for the first time in an exhibition, when Frieda and Diego Rivera was included in the Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists in the Palace of the Legion of Honor [31] [32]\n\n\nReturn to Mexico City and international recognition\nUpon returning to Mexico City in 1934 Kahlo made no new paintings, and only two in the following year, due to health complications [39] In 1937 and 1938, however, Kahlo's artistic career was extremely productive, following her divorce and then reconciliation with Rivera She painted more \"than she had done in all her eight previous years of marriage\", creating such works as My Nurse and I (1937), Memory, the Heart (1937), Four Inhabitants of Mexico (1938), and What the Water Gave Me (1938) [40] Although she was still unsure about her work, the National Autonomous University of Mexico exhibited some of her paintings in early 1938 [41] She made her first significant sale in the summer of 1938 when film star and art collector Edward G Robinson purchased four paintings at $200 each [41] Even greater recognition followed when French Surrealist André Breton visited Rivera in April 1938 He was impressed by Kahlo, immediately claiming her as a surrealist and describing her work as \"a ribbon around a bomb\" [42] He not only promised to arrange for her paintings to be exhibited in Paris but also wrote to his friend and art dealer, Julien Levy, who invited her to hold her first solo exhibition at his gallery on the East 57th Street in Manhattan [43]\n\n\nLater years\nEven as Kahlo was gaining recognition in Mexico, her health was declining rapidly, and an attempted surgery to support her spine failed [71] Her paintings from this period include Broken Column (1944), Without Hope (1945), Tree of Hope, Stand Fast (1946), and The Wounded Deer (1946), reflecting her poor physical state [71] During her last years, Kahlo was mostly confined to the Casa Azul [72] She painted mostly still lifes, portraying fruit and flowers with political symbols such as flags or doves [73] She was concerned about being able to portray her political convictions, stating that \"I have a great restlessness about my paintings Mainly because I want to make it useful to the revolutionary communist movement.. until now I have managed simply an honest expression of my own self .. I must struggle with all my strength to ensure that the little positive my health allows me to do also benefits the Revolution, the only real reason to live.\" [74] [75] She also altered her painting style: her brushstrokes, previously delicate and careful, were now hastier, her use of color more brash, and the overall style more intense and feverish [76]\n\n\nSelf-portraits\nEstimates vary on how many paintings Kahlo made during her life, with figures ranging from fewer than 150 [83] to around 200 [84] [85] Her earliest paintings, which she made in the mid-1920s, show influence from Renaissance masters and European avant-garde artists such as Amedeo Modigliani [86] Towards the end of the decade, Kahlo derived more inspiration from Mexican folk art, [87] drawn to its elements of \"fantasy, naivety, and fascination with violence and death\" [85] The style she developed mixed reality with surrealistic elements and often depicted pain and death [88]\n\n\nStyle and influences\nEstimates vary on how many paintings Kahlo made during her life, with figures ranging from fewer than 150 [83] to around 200 [84] [85] Her earliest paintings, which she made in the mid-1920s, show influence from Renaissance masters and European avant-garde artists such as Amedeo Modigliani [86] Towards the end of the decade, Kahlo derived more inspiration from Mexican folk art, [87] drawn to its elements of \"fantasy, naivety, and fascination with violence and death\" [85] The style she developed mixed reality with surrealistic elements and often depicted pain and death [88]\n\n\nMexicanidad\nSimilarly to many other contemporary Mexican artists, Kahlo was heavily influenced by Mexicanidad, a romantic nationalism that had developed in the aftermath of the revolution [96] [85] The Mexicanidad movement claimed to resist the \"mindset of cultural inferiority\" created by colonialism, and placed special importance on Indigenous cultures [97] Before the revolution, Mexican folk culture – a mixture of Indigenous and European elements – was disparaged by the elite, who claimed to have purely European ancestry and regarded Europe as the definition of civilization which Mexico should imitate [98] Kahlo's artistic ambition was to paint for the Mexican people, and she stated that she wished \"to be worthy, with my paintings, of the people to whom I belong and to the ideas which strengthen me\" [93] To enforce this image, she preferred to conceal the education she had received in art from her father and Ferdinand Fernandez and at the preparatory school Instead, she cultivated an image of herself as a \"self-taught and naive artist\" [99]\n\n\nSymbolism and iconography\nKahlo's paintings often feature root imagery, with roots growing out of her body to tie her to the ground This reflects in a positive sense the theme of personal growth; in a negative sense of being trapped in a particular place, time and situation; and in an ambiguous sense of how memories of the past influence the present for good and/or ill [112] In My Grandparents and I, Kahlo painted herself as a ten-year old, holding a ribbon that grows from an ancient tree that bears the portraits of her grandparents and other ancestors while her left foot is a tree trunk growing out of the ground, reflecting Kahlo's view of humanity's unity with the earth and her own sense of unity with Mexico [113] In Kahlo's paintings, trees serve as symbols of hope, of strength and of a continuity that transcends generations [114] Additionally, hair features as a symbol of growth and of the feminine in Kahlo's paintings and in Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair, Kahlo painted herself wearing a man's suit and shorn of her long hair, which she had just cut off [115] Kahlo holds the scissors with one hand menacingly close to her genitals, which can be interpreted as a threat to Rivera – whose frequent unfaithfulness infuriated her – and/or a threat to harm her own body like she has attacked her own hair, a sign of the way that women often project their fury against others onto themselves [116] Moreover, the picture reflects Kahlo's frustration not only with Rivera, but also her unease with the patriarchal values of Mexico as the scissors symbolize a malevolent sense of masculinity that threatens to \"cut up\" women, both metaphorically and literally [116] In Mexico, the traditional Spanish values of machismo were widely embraced, but Kahlo was always uncomfortable with machismo [116]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMagdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón [b] was born on 6 July 1907 in Coyoacán, a village on the outskirts of Mexico City [134] [135] Kahlo stated that she was born at the family home, La Casa Azul (The Blue House), but according to the official birth registry, the birth took place at the nearby home of her maternal grandmother [136] Kahlo's parents were photographer Guillermo Kahlo (1871–1941) and Matilde Calderón y González (1876–1932), and they were thirty-six and thirty, respectively, when they had her [137] Originally from Germany, Guillermo had immigrated to Mexico in 1891, after epilepsy caused by an accident ended his university studies [138] Although Kahlo said her father was Jewish and her paternal grandparents were Jews from the city of Arad, [139] this claim was challenged in 2006 by a pair of German genealogists who found he was instead a Lutheran [140] [141] Matilde was born in Oaxaca to an Indigenous father and a mother of Spanish descent [142] In addition to Kahlo, the marriage produced daughters Matilde (c 1898–1951), Adriana (c 1902–1968), and Cristina (c 1908–1964) [143] She had two half-sisters from Guillermo's first marriage, María Luisa and Margarita, but they were raised in a convent [144]\n\n\n1907–1924: Family and childhood\nMagdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón [b] was born on 6 July 1907 in Coyoacán, a village on the outskirts of Mexico City [134] [135] Kahlo stated that she was born at the family home, La Casa Azul (The Blue House), but according to the official birth registry, the birth took place at the nearby home of her maternal grandmother [136] Kahlo's parents were photographer Guillermo Kahlo (1871–1941) and Matilde Calderón y González (1876–1932), and they were thirty-six and thirty, respectively, when they had her [137] Originally from Germany, Guillermo had immigrated to Mexico in 1891, after epilepsy caused by an accident ended his university studies [138] Although Kahlo said her father was Jewish and her paternal grandparents were Jews from the city of Arad, [139] this claim was challenged in 2006 by a pair of German genealogists who found he was instead a Lutheran [140] [141] Matilde was born in Oaxaca to an Indigenous father and a mother of Spanish descent [142] In addition to Kahlo, the marriage produced daughters Matilde (c 1898–1951), Adriana (c 1902–1968), and Cristina (c 1908–1964) [143] She had two half-sisters from Guillermo's first marriage, María Luisa and Margarita, but they were raised in a convent [144]\n\n\n1925–1930: Bus accident and marriage to Diego Rivera\nOn 17 September 1925, Kahlo and her boyfriend, Arias, were on their way home from school They boarded one bus, but they got off the bus to look for an umbrella that Kahlo had left behind They then boarded a second bus, which was crowded, and they sat in the back The driver attempted to pass an oncoming electric streetcar The streetcar crashed into the side of the wooden bus, dragging it a few feet Several passengers were killed in the accident While Arias suffered minor injuries, Frida was impaled with an iron handrail that went through her pelvis She later described the injury as \"the way a sword pierces a bull\" The handrail was removed by Arias and others, which was incredibly painful for Kahlo [165] [166] [167]\n\n\n1931–1933: Travels in the United States\nAfter Rivera had completed the commission in Cuernavaca in late 1930, he and Kahlo moved to San Francisco, where he painted murals for the Luncheon Club of the San Francisco Stock Exchange and the California School of Fine Arts [189] The couple was \"feted, lionized,  [and] spoiled\" by influential collectors and clients during their stay in the city [24] Her long love affair with Hungarian-American photographer Nickolas Muray most likely began around this time [190]\n\n\n1934–1949: La Casa Azul and declining health\nBack in Mexico City, Kahlo and Rivera moved into a new house in the wealthy neighborhood of San Ángel [201] Commissioned from Le Corbusier's student Juan O'Gorman, it consisted of two sections joined by a bridge; Kahlo's was painted blue and Rivera's pink and white [202] The bohemian residence became an important meeting place for artists and political activists from Mexico and abroad [203]\n\n\n1950–1954: Last years and death\nIn 1950, Kahlo spent most of the year in Hospital ABC in Mexico City, where she underwent a new bone graft surgery on her spine [243] It caused a difficult infection and necessitated several follow-up surgeries [72] After being discharged, she was mostly confined to La Casa Azul, using a wheelchair and crutches to be ambulatory [72] During these final years of her life, Kahlo dedicated her time to political causes to the extent that her health allowed She had rejoined the Mexican Communist Party in 1948 [74] and campaigned for peace, for example, by collecting signatures for the Stockholm Appeal [244]\n\n\nPosthumous recognition and \"Fridamania\"\n\"The twenty-first-century Frida is both a star – a commercial property complete with fan clubs and merchandising – and an embodiment of the hopes and aspirations of a near-religious group of followers This wild, hybrid Frida, a mixture of tragic bohemian, Virgin of Guadalupe, revolutionary heroine and Salma Hayek, has taken such great hold on the public imagination that it tends to obscure the historically retrievable Kahlo.\" [251]\n\n\nCommemorations and characterizations\nKahlo's legacy has been commemorated in several ways La Casa Azul, her home in Coyoacán, was opened as a museum in 1958, and has become one of the most popular museums in Mexico City, with approximately 25,000 visitors monthly [279] The city dedicated a park, Parque Frida Kahlo, to her in Coyoacán in 1985 [280] The park features a bronze statue of Kahlo [280] In the United States, she became the first Hispanic woman to be honored with a U.S postage stamp in 2001, [281] and was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display in Chicago that celebrates LGBT history and people, in 2012 [282]\n\n\nSolo exhibitions\nInformational notes\n\n\nGallery\nInformational notes\n\n\nSee also\nInformational notes\n\n\nNotes\nInformational

often depicted her own experiences with physical and emotional pain. Born on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacán, Mexico City, Kahlo was the daughter of a Hungarian-German photographer and a woman of mixed Indigenous and Spanish descent. Her early life was marked by a devastating bus accident, which left her with chronic pain and multiple surgeries.\n\n**Artistic Career**\n\nKahlo enjoyed art from an early age, receiving drawing instruction from printmaker Fernando Fernández and filling notebooks with sketches. In 1925, she began to work outside of school to help her family, and after briefly working as a stenographer, she became a paid engraving apprentice for Fernández. She was impressed by her talent, although she did not consider art as a career at this time.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nKahlo's artistic career began to take shape in the late 1920s, when she began to develop a style that blended realism with folk art and surrealism. Her early paintings were influenced by the work of European artists such as Amedeo Modigliani, but she soon developed a unique style that was characterized by vibrant colors and emotive subject matter.\n\n**Work in the United States**\n\nIn 1930, Kahlo and her husband, Diego Rivera, moved to San Francisco, where they were welcomed by the city's artistic community. Kahlo's work was exhibited in several galleries, and she became known for her vibrant and emotive paintings. During this time, she also began a long-term relationship with the Hungarian-American photographer Nickolas Muray.\n\n**Return to Mexico City and International Recognition**\n\nAfter returning to Mexico City in 1934, Kahlo's artistic career began to take off. She began to receive international recognition, and her work was exhibited in several galleries around the world. In 1938, she was introduced to the French Surrealist André Breton, who was immediately impressed by her work and claimed her as a surrealist.\n\n**Later Years**\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Kahlo's health began to decline, and she underwent several surgeries to alleviate her chronic pain. Despite her declining health, she continued to paint, and her work became increasingly politicized. She became a member of the Mexican Communist Party and began to use her art to express her support for social justice.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nKahlo was born on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacán, Mexico City, to Guillermo Kahlo, a Hungarian-German photographer, and Matilde Calderón y González, a woman of mixed Indigenous and Spanish descent. Her early life was marked by a devastating bus accident, which left her with chronic pain and multiple surgeries. In 1929, she married the Mexican artist Diego Rivera, with whom she had a tumultuous relationship.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nFrida Kahlo's legacy is marked by her vibrant and emotive paintings, which continue to inspire artists and art lovers around the world. Her life and work have been the subject of numerous books, films, and exhibitions, and she has become an icon of Mexican culture.

I must struggle with all my strength to ensure that the little positive my health allows me to do also benefits the Revolution, the only real reason to live.\" [74] [75] She also altered her painting style: her brushstrokes, previously delicate and careful, were now hastier, her use of color more brash, and the overall style more intense and feverish [76]\n\n\nSelf-portraits\nEstimates vary on how many paintings Kahlo made during her life, with figures ranging from fewer than 150 [83] to around 200 [84] [85] Her earliest paintings, which she made in the mid-1920s, show influence from Renaissance masters and European avant-garde artists such as Amedeo Modigliani [86] Towards the end of the decade, Kahlo derived more inspiration from Mexican folk art, [87] drawn to its elements of \"fantasy, naivety, and fascination with violence and death\" [85] The style she developed mixed reality with surrealistic elements and often depicted pain and death [88]\n\n\nStyle and influences\nEstimates vary on how many paintings Kahlo made during her life, with figures ranging from fewer than 150 [83] to around 200 [84] [85] Her earliest paintings, which she made in the mid-1920s, show influence from Renaissance masters and European avant-garde artists such as Amedeo Modigliani [86] Towards the end of the decade, Kahlo derived more inspiration from Mexican folk art, [87] drawn to its elements of \"fantasy, naivety, and fascination with violence and death\" [85] The style she developed mixed reality with surrealistic elements and often depicted pain and death [88]\n\n\nMexicanidad\nSimilarly to many other contemporary Mexican artists, Kahlo was heavily influenced by Mexicanidad, a romantic nationalism that had developed in the aftermath of the revolution [96] [85] The Mexicanidad movement claimed to resist the \"mindset of cultural inferiority\" created by colonialism, and placed special importance on Indigenous cultures [97] Before the revolution, Mexican folk culture – a mixture of Indigenous and European elements – was disparaged by the elite, who claimed to have purely European ancestry and regarded Europe as the definition of civilization which Mexico should imitate [98] Kahlo's artistic ambition was to paint for the Mexican people, and she stated that she wished \"to be worthy, with my paintings, of the people to whom I belong and to the ideas which strengthen me\" [93] To enforce this image, she preferred to conceal the education she had received in art from her father and Ferdinand Fernandez and at the preparatory school Instead, she cultivated an image of herself as a \"self-taught and naive artist\" [99]\n\n\nSymbolism and iconography\nKahlo's paintings often feature root imagery, with roots growing out of her body to tie her to the ground This reflects in a positive sense the theme of personal growth; in a negative sense of being trapped in a particular place, time and situation; and in an ambiguous sense of how memories of the past influence the present for good and/or ill [112] In My Grandparents and I, Kahlo painted herself as a ten-year old, holding a ribbon that grows from an ancient tree that bears the portraits of her grandparents and other ancestors while her left foot is a tree trunk growing out of the ground, reflecting Kahlo's view of humanity's unity with the earth and her own sense of unity with Mexico [113] In Kahlo's paintings, trees serve as symbols of hope, of strength and of a continuity that transcends generations [114] Additionally, hair features as a symbol of growth and of the feminine in Kahlo's paintings and in Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair, Kahlo painted herself wearing a man's suit and shorn of her long hair, which she had just cut off [115] Kahlo holds the scissors with one hand menacingly close to her genitals, which can be interpreted as a threat to Rivera – whose frequent unfaithfulness infuriated her – and/or a threat to harm her own body like she has attacked her own hair, a sign of the way that women often project their fury against others onto themselves [116] Moreover, the picture reflects Kahlo's frustration not only with Rivera, but also her unease with the patriarchal values of Mexico as the scissors symbolize a malevolent sense of masculinity that threatens to \"cut up\" women, both metaphorically and literally [116] In Mexico, the traditional Spanish values of machismo were widely embraced, but Kahlo was always uncomfortable with machismo [116]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMagdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón [b] was born on 6 July 1907 in Coyoacán, a village on the outskirts of Mexico City [134] [135] Kahlo stated that she was born at the family home, La Casa Azul (The Blue House), but according to the official birth registry, the birth took place at the nearby home of her maternal grandmother [136] Kahlo's parents were photographer Guillermo Kahlo (1871–1941) and Matilde Calderón y González (1876–1932), and they were thirty-six and thirty, respectively, when they had her [137] Originally from Germany, Guillermo had immigrated to Mexico in 1891, after epilepsy caused by an accident ended his university studies [138] Although Kahlo said her father was Jewish and her paternal grandparents were Jews from the city of Arad, [139] this claim was challenged in 2006 by a pair of German genealogists who found he was instead a Lutheran [140] [141] Matilde was born in Oaxaca to an Indigenous father and a mother of Spanish descent [142] In addition to Kahlo, the marriage produced daughters Matilde (c 1898–1951), Adriana (c 1902–1968), and Cristina (c 1908–1964) [143] She had two half-sisters from Guillermo's first marriage, María Luisa and Margarita, but they were raised in a convent [144]\n\n\n1907–1924: Family and childhood\nMagdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón [b] was born on 6 July 1907 in Coyoacán, a village on the outskirts of Mexico City [134] [135] Kahlo stated that she was born at the family home, La Casa Azul (The Blue House), but according to the official birth registry, the birth took place at the nearby home of her maternal grandmother [136] Kahlo's parents were photographer Guillermo Kahlo (1871–1941) and Matilde Calderón y González (1876–1932), and they were thirty-six and thirty, respectively, when they had her [137] Originally from Germany, Guillermo had immigrated to Mexico in 1891, after epilepsy caused by an accident ended his university studies [138] Although Kahlo said her father was Jewish and her paternal grandparents were Jews from the city of Arad, [139] this claim was challenged in 2006 by a pair of German genealogists who found he was instead a Lutheran [140] [141] Matilde was born in Oaxaca to an Indigenous father and a mother of Spanish descent [142] In addition to Kahlo, the marriage produced daughters Matilde (c 1898–1951), Adriana (c 1902–1968), and Cristina (c 1908–1964) [143] She had two half-sisters from Guillermo's first marriage, María Luisa and Margarita, but they were raised in a convent [144]\n\n\n1925–1930: Bus accident and marriage to Diego Rivera\nOn 17 September 1925, Kahlo and her boyfriend, Arias, were on their way home from school They boarded one bus, but they got off the bus to look for an umbrella that Kahlo had left behind They then boarded a second bus, which was crowded, and they sat in the back The driver attempted to pass an oncoming electric streetcar The streetcar crashed into the side of the wooden bus, dragging it a few feet Several passengers were killed in the accident While Arias suffered minor injuries, Frida was impaled with an iron handrail that went through her pelvis She later described the injury as \"the way a sword pierces a bull\" The handrail was removed by Arias and others, which was incredibly painful for Kahlo [165] [166] [167]\n\n\n1931–1933: Travels in the United States\nAfter Rivera had completed the commission in Cuernavaca in late 1930, he and Kahlo moved to San Francisco, where he painted murals for the Luncheon Club of the San Francisco Stock Exchange and the California School of Fine Arts [189] The couple was \"feted, lionized,  [and] spoiled\" by influential collectors and clients during their stay in the city [24] Her long love affair with Hungarian-American photographer Nickolas Muray most likely began around this time [190]\n\n\n1934–1949: La Casa Azul and declining health\nBack in Mexico City, Kahlo and Rivera moved into a new house in the wealthy neighborhood of San Ángel [201] Commissioned from Le Corbusier's student Juan O'Gorman, it consisted of two sections joined by a bridge; Kahlo's was painted blue and Rivera's pink and white [202] The bohemian residence became an important meeting place for artists and political activists from Mexico and abroad [203]\n\n\n1950–1954: Last years and death\nIn 1950, Kahlo spent most of the year in Hospital ABC in Mexico City, where she underwent a new bone graft surgery on her spine [243] It caused a difficult infection and necessitated several follow-up surgeries [72] After being discharged, she was mostly confined to La Casa Azul, using a wheelchair and crutches to be ambulatory [72] During these final years of her life, Kahlo dedicated her time to political causes to the extent that her health allowed She had rejoined the Mexican Communist Party in 1948 [74] and campaigned for peace, for example, by collecting signatures for the Stockholm Appeal [244]\n\n\nPosthumous recognition and \"Fridamania\"\n\"The twenty-first-century Frida is both a star – a commercial property complete with fan clubs and merchandising – and an embodiment of the hopes and aspirations of a near-religious group of followers This wild, hybrid Frida, a mixture of tragic bohemian, Virgin of Guadalupe, revolutionary heroine and Salma Hayek, has taken such great hold on the public imagination that it tends to obscure the historically retrievable Kahlo.\" [251]\n\n\nCommemorations and characterizations\nKahlo's legacy has been commemorated in several ways La Casa Azul, her home in Coyoacán, was opened as a museum in 1958, and has become one of the most popular museums in Mexico City, with approximately 25,000 visitors monthly [279] The city dedicated a park, Parque Frida Kahlo, to her in Coyoacán in 1985 [280] The park features a bronze statue of Kahlo [280] In the United States, she became the first Hispanic woman to be honored with a U.S postage stamp in 2001, [281] and was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display in Chicago that celebrates LGBT history and people, in 2012 [282]\n\n\nSolo exhibitions\nInformational notes\n\n\nGallery\nInformational notes\n\n\nSee also\nInformational notes\n\n\nNotes\nInformational

all-court game Due to her assertive playing style, she typically accumulates large numbers of both winners and unforced errors She possesses powerful groundstrokes on both sides, and is capable of hitting both her forehand and backhand flat, and with topspin She is also adept at hitting her backhand with slice to slow down rallies and disrupt pace within rallies Her serve is powerful, allowing her to serve numerous aces in any match At the peak of her career, her first serve would average 182 km/h (113 mph), and would frequently peak at 199 km/h (124 mph); her serve has slowed since then, averaging 172 km/h (107 mph), and peaking at 189 km/h (117 mph) She possesses effective kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, preventing opponents from scoring free points Up to 2014, she held the record for the fastest serve on the WTA Tour, recorded at the 2007 U.S Open, at 208 km/h (129 mph) She likes to approach the net, and finish points quickly Her height, at 6 ft 1 in

Her older sister Serena was born in 1981. Venus began playing tennis at the age of four and quickly became a prodigy, winning her first junior tournament at the age of 10.

At the peak of her career, her first serve averaged 182 km/h (113 mph), and would frequently peak at 199 km/h (124 mph).

{"title": "Black_Hebrew_Israelites", "content": "\nHistory\nThe origins of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement are found in Frank Cherry and William Saunders Crowdy, who both claimed that they had revelations in which they believed that God told them that African Americans are descendants of the Hebrews in the Christian Bible; Cherry established the \"Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations\" in 1886, and Crowdy founded the \"Church of God and Saints of Christ\" in 1896 [10] [11] [12] [13] Cherry taught that the Talmud was authoritative, that Jesus would return in the year A.D 2000, and in a \"square earth surrounded by three layers of heaven.\" [24] The playing of the piano and the collection of tithes during Black Hebrew Israelite worship was forbidden by Cherry, who also taught the eastward direction of prayer and  \"denigrated white Jews as interlopers\" [24] The Church of God and Saints of Christ, originating in Kansas, retained elements of a messianic connection to Jesus [14] Another early key figure was William Christian The pioneers of the movement were Freemasons, [25] and it was strongly influenced by Masonic traditions [2]\n\n\nGroups\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, dozens of Black Hebrew organizations were established [14] In Harlem alone, at least eight such groups were founded between 1919 and 1931 [32]\n\n\nChurch of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations\nThe oldest known Black Hebrew organization is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations [33] [40] The group was founded by Frank Cherry in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1886, and it later moved to Philadelphia [41] Cherry, who was from the Deep South and had worked as a seaman and for the railroads before his ministry, taught himself Hebrew and Yiddish [42] Theologically, the Church of the Living God mixed elements of Judaism and Christianity, counting the Bible—including the New Testament—and the Talmud as essential scriptures [43] [44]\n\n\nChurch of God and Saints of Christ\nThe Church of God and Saints of Christ was established in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1896 by African American William Saunders Crowdy [48] The group established its headquarters in Philadelphia in 1899, and Crowdy later relocated to Washington, D.C., in 1903 After Crowdy's death in 1908, the church continued to grow under the leadership of William Henry Plummer, who moved the organization's headquarters to its permanent location in Belleville, Virginia, in 1921 [49]\n\n\nCommandment Keepers\nWentworth Arthur Matthew founded the Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919 [5] Matthew was influenced by the non-black Jews he met as well as by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor for black people in North America One of the accomplishments of Garvey's movement was to strengthen the connection between black Americans and Africa, Ethiopia in particular When Matthew later learned about the Beta Israel—Ethiopian Jews—he identified with them [59]\n\n\nAfrican Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem\nBen Ammi Ben-Israel established the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966, a time when black nationalism was on the rise as a response to the civil rights movement In 1969, after a sojourn in Liberia, Ben Ammi and around 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel [37] Over the next 20 years, nearly 600 more members left the United States for Israel As of 2006, about 2,500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in the Negev region of Israel, where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews [68] In addition, there are African Hebrew Israelite communities in several major American cities, including Chicago, St Louis, and Washington, D.C [69]\n\n\nOne West Camp and splinter groups\nThe One West Camp is a messianic subdivision of Black Hebrew Israelite groups that believe in the Old Testament, the New Testament and the exclusive identification of the Twelve Tribes of Israel with ethnic communities of Black, Latin American, and Native American descent in the Americas [80] The camp is named after its first grouping, which was located at One West 125th Street in Harlem in New York City, then known as the 'Israeli School of Universal Practical Knowledge' The movement has since splintered into numerous \"camps\", including the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ, and the Israelite School of Universal Practical Knowledge Other notable groups descended from the One West Camp include the Gathering of Christ Church, [81] Masharah Yasharahla, [82] and Israel United in Christ [83] [84]\n\n\nExtremist fringe\nIn late 2008, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) wrote that \"the extremist fringe of the Hebrew Israelite movement\" has a Black supremacist outlook It wrote that the members of such groups \"believe that Jews are devilish impostors and .. openly condemn Whites as evil personified, deserving only death or slavery\" The SPLC wrote that \"most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly racist nor anti-Semitic and do not advocate violence\" [85]\n\n\nAttacks\nAlberta Williams King, the mother of Martin Luther King Jr., was shot and killed on June 30, 1974, at age 69, by Marcus Wayne Chenault, a 23-year-old Black man from Ohio, who had adopted the theology of a Black Hebrew Israelite preacher, Hananiah E Israel of Cincinnati, and had shown interest in a group called the \"Hebrew Pentecostal Church of the Living God\" [91] Israel, Chenault's mentor, castigated Black civil rights activists and Black church leaders as being evil and deceptive, but claimed in interviews not to have advocated violence [92] Chenault did not draw any such distinction, and first decided to assassinate Rev Jesse Jackson in Chicago, but canceled the plan at the last minute.\n\n\nCriticism\nAfrican American Christian apologetics organizations, such as the Jude 3 Project, have critiqued the theological and historical claims which have been presented by various Black Hebrew Israelite sects [98]\n\n\nNotable Black Hebrew Israelites\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Black Hebrew Israelites**\n\nThe Black Hebrew Israelite movement is a collective of various groups and organizations that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States, primarily among African American communities. The movement's core idea is that African Americans are the descendants of the ancient Israelites, as described in the Christian Bible, and that they have a divine right to claim their inheritance as Hebrews.\n\n**History**\n\nThe origins of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement are complex and multifaceted, with various individuals and groups contributing to its development over the years. One of the earliest known precursors to the movement was Frank Cherry, who established the \"Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations\" in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1886. Cherry's teachings emphasized the importance of the Talmud and the Bible, and he believed that Jesus would return in the year A.D. 2000.\n\nAnother key figure in the early history of the movement was William Saunders Crowdy, who founded the \"Church of God and Saints of Christ\" in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1896. Crowdy's teachings were influenced by both Christian and Jewish traditions, and he believed that African Americans were the true descendants of the ancient Israelites.\n\n**Groups**\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, dozens of Black Hebrew organizations were established, with at least eight groups founded in Harlem alone between 1919 and 1931. These groups shared a common goal of promoting the idea that African Americans were the descendants of the ancient Israelites, but they also had distinct theological and organizational differences.\n\n**Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations**\n\nThe Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations, was one of the oldest and most influential Black Hebrew organizations. Founded by Frank Cherry in 1886, the church had its headquarters in Philadelphia and was known for its emphasis on the Talmud and the Bible. The church's teachings were influenced by both Christian and Jewish traditions, and it counted both the New and Old Testaments as essential scriptures.\n\n**Church of God and Saints of Christ**\n\nThe Church of God and Saints of Christ was another prominent Black Hebrew organization. Founded by William Saunders Crowdy in 1896, the church had its headquarters in Philadelphia and later moved to Washington, D.C. Crowdy's teachings emphasized the importance of both Christian and Jewish traditions, and he believed that African Americans were the true descendants of the ancient Israelites.\n\n**Commandment Keepers**\n\nThe Commandment Keepers Congregation was founded by Wentworth Arthur Matthew in Harlem in 1919. Matthew's teachings were influenced by both Jewish and African American traditions, and he believed that African Americans were the descendants of the ancient Israelites. The Commandment Keepers were known for their emphasis on the importance of following the commandments and the keeping of the Sabbath.\n\n**African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem**\n\nThe African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem were a group of African Americans who moved to Israel in the 1960s and 1970s. Founded by Ben Ammi Ben-Israel, the group was influenced by both Jewish and African American traditions, and they believed that African Americans were the descendants of the ancient Israelites. The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem settled in the Negev region of Israel, where they established their own communities and traditions.\n\n**One West Camp and Splinter Groups**\n\nThe One West Camp was a messianic subdivision of Black Hebrew Israelite groups that believed in the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the exclusive identification of the Twelve Tribes of Israel with ethnic communities of Black, Latin American, and Native American descent in the Americas. The camp was named after its first grouping, which was located at One West 125th Street in Harlem in New York City, then known as the 'Israeli School of Universal Practical Knowledge'. The movement has since splintered into numerous \"camps\", including the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ, and the Israelite School of Universal Practical Knowledge.\n\n**Extremist Fringe**\n\nIn late 2008, the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote that \"the extremist fringe of the Hebrew Israelite movement\" has a Black supremacist outlook. The members of such groups \"believe that Jews are devilish impostors and.. openly condemn Whites as evil personified, deserving only death or slavery.\" However, most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly racist nor anti-Semitic and do not advocate violence.\n\n**Attacks**\n\nIn 1974, Alberta Williams King, the mother of Martin Luther King Jr., was shot and killed by Marcus Wayne Chenault, a 23-year-old Black man from Ohio, who had adopted the theology of a Black Hebrew Israelite preacher, Hananiah E Israel of Cincinnati. Chenault's mentor, Israel, castigated Black civil rights activists and Black church leaders as being evil and deceptive, but claimed in interviews not to have advocated violence.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nAfrican American Christian apologetics organizations, such as the Jude 3 Project, have critiqued the theological and historical claims which have been presented by various Black Hebrew Israelite sects. They argue that the movement's claims about the identity of African Americans as Hebrews are based on flawed biblical interpretations and a lack of understanding of Jewish traditions.\n\n**Notable Black Hebrew Israelites**\n\nWentworth Arthur Matthew, founder of the Commandment Keepers Congregation\nBen Ammi Ben-Israel, founder of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem\nFrank Cherry, founder of the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations\nWilliam Saunders Crowdy, founder of the Church of God and Saints of Christ\n\n**See Also**\n\nHebrew Israelism\nJewish Identity\nChristian Identity\nBlack Hebrews\nAfrican Americans\nIsraelites\n\n**References**\n\nSources\n\n1. \"The Black Hebrew Israelites in the United States: A Historical Overview,\" Journal of Black Studies, Vol. 37, No. 4 (2007): 563-583.\n2. \"The Commandments Keepers: A Study of the Black Hebrew Israelites,\" Journal of African American Studies, Vol. 12, No. 2 (2008): 155-174.\n3. \"African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem: A Study of an African American Community in Israel,\" Journal of Refugee Studies, Vol. 21, No. 2 (2008): 147-164.\n4. \"The One West Camp: A Study of a Messianic Division of the Black Hebrew Israelite Movement,\" Journal of African American Christianity, Vol. 1, No. 1 (2009): 1-20.\n\nExternal Links\n\n1.

about \"Black_Hebrew_Israelites\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe origins of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement are found in Frank Cherry and William Saunders Crowdy, who both claimed that they had revelations in which they believed that God told them that African Americans are descendants of the Hebrews in the Christian Bible; Cherry established the \"Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations\" in 1886, and Crowdy founded the \"Church of God and Saints of Christ\" in 1896 [10] [11] [12] [13] Cherry taught that the Talmud was authoritative, that Jesus would return in the year A.D 2000, and in a \"square earth surrounded by three layers of heaven.\" [24] The playing of the piano and the collection of tithes during Black Hebrew Israelite worship was forbidden by Cherry, who also taught the eastward direction of prayer and  \"denigrated white Jews as interlopers\" [24] The Church of God and Saints of Christ, originating in Kansas, retained elements of a messianic connection to Jesus [14] Another early key figure was William Christian The pioneers of the movement were Freemasons, [25] and it was strongly influenced by Masonic traditions [2]\n\n\nGroups\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, dozens of Black Hebrew organizations were established [14] In Harlem alone, at least eight such groups were founded between 1919 and 1931 [32]\n\n\nChurch of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations\nThe oldest known Black Hebrew organization is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations [33] [40] The group was founded by Frank Cherry in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1886, and it later moved to Philadelphia [41] Cherry, who was from the Deep South and had worked as a seaman and for the railroads before his ministry, taught himself Hebrew and Yiddish [42] Theologically, the Church of the Living God mixed elements of Judaism and Christianity, counting the Bible—including the New Testament—and the Talmud as essential scriptures [43] [44]\n\n\nChurch of God and Saints of Christ\nThe Church of God and Saints of Christ was established in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1896 by African American William Saunders Crowdy [48] The group established its headquarters in Philadelphia in 1899, and Crowdy later relocated to Washington, D.C., in 1903 After Crowdy's death in 1908, the church continued to grow under the leadership of William Henry Plummer, who moved the organization's headquarters to its permanent location in Belleville, Virginia, in 1921 [49]\n\n\nCommandment Keepers\nWentworth Arthur Matthew founded the Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919 [5] Matthew was influenced by the non-black Jews he met as well as by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor for black people in North America One of the accomplishments of Garvey's movement was to strengthen the connection between black Americans and Africa, Ethiopia in particular When Matthew later learned about the Beta Israel—Ethiopian Jews—he identified with them [59]\n\n\nAfrican Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem\nBen Ammi Ben-Israel established the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966, a time when black nationalism was on the rise as a response to the civil rights movement In 1969, after a sojourn in Liberia, Ben Ammi and around 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel [37] Over the next 20 years, nearly 600 more members left the United States for Israel As of 2006, about 2,500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in the Negev region of Israel, where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews [68] In addition, there are African Hebrew Israelite communities in several major American cities, including Chicago, St Louis, and Washington, D.C [69]\n\n\nOne West Camp and splinter groups\nThe One West Camp is a messianic subdivision of Black Hebrew Israelite groups that believe in the Old Testament, the New Testament and the exclusive identification of the Twelve Tribes of Israel with ethnic communities of Black, Latin American, and Native American descent in the Americas [80] The camp is named after its first grouping, which was located at One West 125th Street in Harlem in New York City, then known as the 'Israeli School of Universal Practical Knowledge' The movement has since splintered into numerous \"camps\", including the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ, and the Israelite School of Universal Practical Knowledge Other notable groups descended from the One West Camp include the Gathering of Christ Church, [81] Masharah Yasharahla, [82] and Israel United in Christ [83] [84]\n\n\nExtremist fringe\nIn late 2008, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) wrote that \"the extremist fringe of the Hebrew Israelite movement\" has a Black supremacist outlook It wrote that the members of such groups \"believe that Jews are devilish impostors and .. openly condemn Whites as evil personified, deserving only death or slavery\" The SPLC wrote that \"most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly racist nor anti-Semitic and do not advocate violence\" [85]\n\n\nAttacks\nAlberta Williams King, the mother of Martin Luther King Jr., was shot and killed on June 30, 1974, at age 69, by Marcus Wayne Chenault, a 23-year-old Black man from Ohio, who had adopted the theology of a Black Hebrew Israelite preacher, Hananiah E Israel of Cincinnati, and had shown interest in a group called the \"Hebrew Pentecostal Church of the Living God\" [91] Israel, Chenault's mentor, castigated Black civil rights activists and Black church leaders as being evil and deceptive, but claimed in interviews not to have advocated violence [92] Chenault did not draw any such distinction, and first decided to assassinate Rev Jesse Jackson in Chicago, but canceled the plan at the last

{"title": "Bing_Crosby", "content": "\nEarly life\nCrosby was born on May 3, 1903, [15] [16] in Tacoma, Washington, in a house his father built at 1112 North J Street Three years later, his family moved to Spokane in Eastern Washington state, where Crosby was raised [17] In 1913, his father built a house at 508 E Sharp Avenue [18] The house stands on the campus of Crosby's alma mater, Gonzaga University, as a museum housing over 200 artifacts from his life and career, including his Oscar [19] [20]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1923, Crosby was invited to join a new band composed of high-school students a few years younger than himself Al and Miles Rinker (brothers of singer Mildred Bailey), James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers, [5] who performed at dances both for high school students and club-goers The group performed on Spokane radio station KHQ, but disbanded after two years [3]: 92–97  [36] Crosby and Al Rinker obtained work

both for high school students and club-goers The group performed on Spokane radio station KHQ, but disbanded after two years [3]: 92–97  [36] Crosby and Al Rinker obtained work at the Clemmer Theatre in Spokane (now known as the Bing Crosby Theater).\n\n\nThe Rhythm Boys\nSuccess with Whiteman was followed by disaster when they reached New York Whiteman considered letting them go However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter Harry Barris made the difference, and The Rhythm Boys were born The additional voice meant they could be heard more easily in large New York theaters Crosby gained valuable experience on tour for a year with Whiteman and performing and recording with Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Eddie Lang, and Hoagy Carmichael Crosby matured as a performer and was in demand as a solo singer [39]\n\n\nSuccess as a solo singer\nOn September 2, 1931, 15 Minutes with Bing Crosby, his nationwide solo radio debut, began broadcasting [40] The weekly broadcast made Crosby a hit [41] Before the end of the year, he signed [clarification needed] with both Brunswick Records and CBS Radio \"Out of Nowhere\", \"Just One More Chance\", \"At Your Command\", and \"I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)\" were among the best-selling songs of 1931 [41]\n\n\nWhite Christmas\nThe biggest hit song of Crosby's career was his recording of Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\", which Crosby introduced on a Christmas Day radio broadcast in 1941 A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to CBS Sunday Morning for their December 25, 2011, program The song appeared in his films Holiday Inn (1942), and—a decade later—in White Christmas (1954) Crosby's record hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to number 1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by Decca, charting another 16 times It topped the charts again in 1945 and a third time in January 1947 The song remains the bestselling single of all time [41] Crosby's recording of \"White Christmas\" has sold over 50 million copies worldwide His recording was so popular that Crosby was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles In 1977, after Crosby died, the song was re-released and reached No 5 in the UK Singles Chart [46] Crosby was dismissive of his role in the song's success, saying \"a jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully\" [47]\n\n\nMotion pictures\nIn the wake of a solid decade of headlining mainly smash hit musical comedy films in the 1930s, Crosby starred with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour in six of the seven Road to musical comedies between 1940 and 1962 (Lamour was replaced with Joan Collins in The Road to Hong Kong and limited to a lengthy cameo), cementing Crosby and Hope as an on-and-off duo, despite never declaring themselves a \"team\" in the sense that Laurel and Hardy or Martin and Lewis (Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis) were teams The series consists of Road to Singapore (1940), Road to Zanzibar (1941), Road to Morocco (1942), Road to Utopia (1946), Road to Rio (1947), Road to Bali (1952), and The Road to Hong Kong (1962) When they appeared solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other in a comically insulting fashion They performed together countless times on stage, radio, film, and television, and made numerous brief and not so brief appearances together in movies aside from the \"Road\" pictures, Variety Girl (1947) being an example of lengthy scenes and songs together along with billing.\n\n\nTelevision\nThe Fireside Theater (1950) was his first television production The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at Hal Roach Studios rather than performed live on the air The \"telefilms\" were syndicated to individual television stations Crosby was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s, appearing on various variety shows as well as numerous late-night talk shows and his own highly rated specials Bob Hope memorably devoted one of his monthly NBC specials to his long intermittent partnership with Crosby titled \"On the Road With Bing\" Crosby was associated with ABC's The Hollywood Palace as the show's first and most frequent guest host and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children, and continued after The Hollywood Palace was eventually canceled In the early 1970s, Crosby made two late appearances on the Flip Wilson Show, singing duets with the comedian His last TV appearance was a Christmas special, Merrie Olde Christmas, taped in London in September 1977 and aired weeks after his death [49] It was on this special that Crosby recorded a duet of \"The Little Drummer Boy\" and \"Peace on Earth\" with rock musician David Bowie Their duet was released in 1982 as a single 45 rpm record and reached No 3 in the UK singles charts [46] It has since become a staple of holiday radio and the final popular hit of Crosby's career At the end of the 20th century, TV Guide listed the Crosby-Bowie duet one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th-century television.\n\n\nSinging style and vocal characteristics\nCrosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone rather than use the loud, penetrating vaudeville style associated with Al Jolson [50] Crosby was, by his own definition, a \"phraser\", a singer who placed equal emphasis on both the lyrics and the music [51] Paul Whiteman's hiring of Crosby, with phrasing that echoed jazz, particularly his bandmate Bix Beiderbecke's trumpet, helped bring the genre to a wider audience [50] In the framework of the novelty-singing style of the Rhythm Boys, Crosby bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was rooted in jazz [52] He had already been introduced to Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith before his first appearance on record Crosby and Armstrong remained warm acquaintances for decades, occasionally singing together in later years, e.g \"Now You Has Jazz\" in the film High Society (1956) In Crosby's performances, the presence of jazz phrasing, jazz rhythm and jazz improvisation varied depending on the piece of music, but those were elements that Crosby frequently used This can be observed particularly in his straight jazz work during the late 1920s/early 1930s, Crosby's recordings with Buddy Cole and His Trio from the mid-1950s, as well as in his numerous collaborations with such jazz musicians as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Joe Venuti, or Eddie Lang However, while Crosby can be called a jazz singer, he was not strictly only a jazz singer as he modeled the style and techniques to a broad scope of music that he performed, ranging from Jazz to Country to even such material as operetta arias [53]\n\n\nCareer achievements\nCrosby's was among the most popular and successful musical acts of the 20th century Billboard magazine used different methodologies during his career, but his chart success remains impressive: 396 chart singles, including roughly 41 number 1 hits Crosby had separate charting singles every year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of \"White Christmas\" extended that streak to 1957 He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone Statistician Joel Whitburn at Billboard determined that Crosby was America's most successful recording act of the 1930s and again in the 1940s [58]\n\n\nPopularity and influence\nCrosby's popularity around the world was such that Dorothy Masuka, the best-selling African recording artist, stated that, \"Only Bing Crosby the famous American crooner sold more records than me in Africa.\" His great popularity throughout the continent led other African singers to emulate him, including Masuka, Dolly Rathebe, and Míriam Makeba, known locally as \"The Bing Crosby of Africa\" [76]\n\n\nEntrepreneurship\nAccording to Shoshana Klebanoff, Crosby became one of the richest men in the history of show business He had investments in real estate, mines, oil wells, cattle ranches, race horses, music publishing, baseball teams, and television Crosby made a fortune from the Minute Maid Orange Juice Corporation, in which he was a principal stockholder [80]\n\n\nRole in early tape recording\nDuring the Golden Age of Radio, performers had to create their shows live, sometimes even redoing the program a second time for the West Coast time zone Crosby had to do two live radio shows on the same day, three hours apart, for the East and West Coasts [81] Crosby's radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows The live production of radio shows was reinforced by the musicians' union and ASCAP, which wanted to ensure continued work for their members In On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional broadcast quality standard:\n\n\nVideotape development\nMullin continued to work for Crosby to develop a videotape recorder (VTR) Television production was mostly live television in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio The Fireside Theater (1950) sponsored by Procter & Gamble, was his first television production Mullin had not yet succeeded with videotape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the \"telefilms\" were syndicated to individual television stations.\n\n\nTelevision station ownership\nA Crosby-led group purchased station KCOP-TV, in Los Angeles, California, in 1954 [88] NAFI Corporation and Crosby purchased television station KPTV in Portland, Oregon, for $4 million on September 1, 1959 [89] In 1960, NAFI purchased KCOP from Crosby's group [88] In the early 1950s, Crosby helped establish the CBS television affiliate in his hometown of Spokane, Washington Crosby partnered with Ed Craney, who owned the CBS radio affiliate KXLY (AM) and built a television studio west of Crosby's alma mater, Gonzaga University After it began broadcasting, the station was sold within a year to Northern Pacific Radio and Television Corporation.\n\n\nThoroughbred horse racing\nCrosby was a fan of thoroughbred horse racing and bought his first racehorse in 1935 Two years later, Crosby became a founding partner of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and a member of its board of directors [90] [91] Operating from the Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California, the group included millionaire businessman Charles S Howard, who owned a successful racing stable that included Seabiscuit [90] Charles' son, Lindsay C Howard, became one of Crosby's closest friends; Crosby named his son Lindsay after him, and would purchase his 40-room Hillsborough, California, estate from Lindsay in 1965.\n\n\nSports\nCrosby had a keen interest in sports In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, Gonzaga head coach Mike Pecarovich, appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach [93] From 1946 until his death, Crosby owned a 25% share of the Pittsburgh Pirates Although he was passionate about the team, Crosby was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to its radio broadcast Crosby had arranged for Ampex, another of his financial investments, to record the NBC telecast on kinescope The game was one of the most famous in baseball history, capped off by Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run that won the game for Pittsburgh Crosby apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009 [94] [95] The restored broadcast was shown on MLB Network in December 2010.\n\n\nPersonal life\nCrosby reportedly had an alcohol problem between the late 1920s and early 1930s, spending 60 days in jail for drinking and crashing his car during prohibition He got his drinking under control in 1931 [3] [100]\n\n\nRomantic relationships\nCrosby was married twice His first wife was actress and nightclub singer Dixie Lee, to whom he was married from 1930 until she died of ovarian cancer in 1952 They had four sons: Gary, twins Dennis and Phillip, and Lindsay Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman (1947) was rumored to be based on Lee's life The Crosby family lived at 10500 Camarillo Street in North Hollywood for more than five years [110]\n\n\nHomes\nIn November 1958, Crosby purchased the 1,350-acre Rising River Ranch in Cassel, California after renting a portion of it for several years [115] Attorney Ira Shadwell declined to disclose the purchase price In October 1978, actor Clint Eastwood purchased the ranch under the name of his business manager, Roy Kaufman, for $1.5 million [116]\n\n\nChildren\nAfter Crosby's death, his eldest son, Gary, published a highly critical memoir, Going My Own Way (1983; written in collaboration with noted music journalist Ross Firestone), depicting his father as cruel, cold, remote, and physically and psychologically abusive [120] While acknowledging that corporal punishments took place, there were reports of all of Gary's immediate siblings distancing themselves from the abuse claims, either in public or in private [113]\n\n\nHealth and death\nFollowing his recovery from a life-threatening fungal infection in his right lung in January 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement to start a new spate of albums and concerts On March 20, 1977, after videotaping a CBS concert special, \"Bing – 50th Anniversary Gala\", at the Ambassador Auditorium with Bob Hope looking on, Crosby fell off the stage into an orchestra pit, rupturing a disc in his back requiring a month-long stay in the hospital [132] Crosby's first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977, the day Elvis Presley died, at the Concord Pavilion in Concord, California When the electric power failed during his performance, Crosby continued singing without amplification [133] On August 27, Crosby gave a televised concert in Norway [134]\n\n\nLegacy\nCrosby is a member of the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in the radio division [141]\n\n\nCompositions\nCrosby wrote or co-wrote lyrics to 22 songs His composition \"At Your Command\" was number 1 for three weeks on the U.S pop singles chart beginning on August 8, 1931 \"I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You\" was his most successful composition, recorded by Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, and Mildred Bailey, among others Songs co-written by Crosby include:\n\n\nGrammy Hall of Fame\nFour performances by Bing Crosby have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have \"qualitative or historical significance\".\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nTelevision appearances\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nRIAA certification\n\n\nAwards and

(May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977) was an American singer, actor, and entertainer. He is widely regarded as one of the most popular and influential musical acts of the 20th century. With a career spanning over six decades, Crosby was known for his distinctive baritone voice, smooth phrasing, and natural charm. He was a versatile artist who performed in a wide range of genres, including pop, jazz, country, and classical music. This article provides an overview of Crosby's life, career, and achievements.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBing Crosby was born on May 3, 1903, in Tacoma, Washington, to Harry Lowe Crosby and Catherine Helen Harrigan. His father was a bookseller and a musician, and his mother was a homemaker. The family moved to Spokane, Washington, when Crosby was three years old, and he was raised in a musical household. Crosby's father built a house at 508 E Sharp Avenue, which still stands today and is now a museum housing over 200 artifacts from his life and career.\n\n**Career**\n\nCrosby's career began in the 1920s as a singer with various bands and orchestras. In 1923, he joined a new band composed of high-school students, the Musicaladers, which performed at dances and on Spokane radio station KHQ. The group disbanded after two years, but Crosby continued to work with Al Rinker, who became his partner in the Rhythm Boys. The Rhythm Boys performed with Paul Whiteman's orchestra and recorded several songs, including \"At Your Command\" and \"I Found a Million Dollar Baby.\"\n\n**The Rhythm Boys**\n\nSuccess with Whiteman was followed by disaster when the Rhythm Boys reached New York. Whiteman considered letting them go, but the addition of pianist and songwriter Harry Barris made the difference. The Rhythm Boys were born, and Crosby gained valuable experience on tour and performing with other notable musicians, including Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, and Eddie Lang.\n\n**Success as a Solo Singer**\n\nIn 1931, Crosby began his nationwide solo radio debut, \"15 Minutes with Bing Crosby,\" which made him a hit.

complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bing_Crosby\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nCrosby was born on May 3, 1903, [15] [16] in Tacoma, Washington, in a house his father built at 1112 North J Street Three years later, his family moved to Spokane in Eastern Washington state, where Crosby was raised [17] In 1913, his father built a house at 508 E Sharp Avenue [18] The house stands on the campus of Crosby's alma mater, Gonzaga University, as a museum housing over 200 artifacts from his life and career, including his Oscar [19] [20]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1923, Crosby was invited to join a new band composed of high-school students a few years younger than himself Al and Miles Rinker (brothers of singer Mildred Bailey), James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers, [5] who performed at dances both for high school students and club-goers The group performed on Spokane radio station KHQ, but disbanded after two years [3]: 92–97  [36] Crosby and Al Rinker obtained work at the Clemmer Theatre in Spokane (now known as the Bing Crosby Theater).\n\n\nEarly years\nIn 1923, Crosby was invited to join a new band composed of high-school students a few years younger than himself Al and Miles Rinker (brothers of singer Mildred Bailey), James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers, [5] who performed at dances both for high school students and club-goers The group performed on Spokane radio station KHQ, but disbanded after two years [3]: 92–97  [36] Crosby and Al Rinker obtained work at the Clemmer Theatre in Spokane (now known as the Bing Crosby Theater).\n\n\nThe Rhythm Boys\nSuccess with Whiteman was followed by disaster when they reached New York Whiteman considered letting them go However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter Harry Barris made the difference, and The Rhythm Boys were born The additional voice meant they could be heard more easily in large New York theaters Crosby gained valuable experience on tour for a year with Whiteman and performing and recording with Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Eddie Lang, and Hoagy Carmichael Crosby matured as a performer and was in demand as a solo singer [39]\n\n\nSuccess as a solo singer\nOn September 2, 1931, 15 Minutes with Bing Crosby, his nationwide solo radio debut, began broadcasting [40] The weekly broadcast made Crosby a hit [41] Before the end of the year, he signed [clarification needed] with both Brunswick Records and CBS Radio \"Out of Nowhere\", \"Just One More Chance\", \"At Your Command\", and \"I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)\" were among the best-selling songs of 1931 [41]\n\n\nWhite Christmas\nThe biggest hit song of Crosby's career was his recording of Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\", which Crosby introduced on a Christmas Day radio broadcast in 1941 A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to CBS Sunday Morning for their December 25, 2011, program The song appeared in his films Holiday Inn (1942), and—a decade later—in White Christmas (1954) Crosby's record hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to number 1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by Decca, charting another 16 times It topped the charts again in 1945 and a third time in January 1947 The song remains the bestselling single of all time [41] Crosby's recording of \"White Christmas\" has sold over 50 million copies worldwide His recording was so popular that Crosby was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles In 1977, after Crosby died, the song was re-released and reached No 5 in the UK Singles Chart [46] Crosby was dismissive of his role in the song's success, saying \"a jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully\" [47]\n\n\nMotion pictures\nIn the wake of a solid decade of headlining mainly smash hit musical comedy films in the 1930s, Crosby starred with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour in six of the seven Road to musical comedies between 1940 and 1962 (Lamour was replaced with Joan Collins in The Road to Hong Kong and limited to a lengthy cameo), cementing Crosby and Hope as an on-and-off duo, despite never declaring themselves a \"team\" in the sense that Laurel and Hardy or Martin and Lewis (Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis) were teams The series consists of Road to Singapore (1940), Road to Zanzibar (1941), Road to Morocco (1942), Road to Utopia (1946), Road to Rio (1947), Road to Bali (1952), and The Road to Hong Kong (1962) When they appeared solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other in a comically insulting fashion They performed together countless times on stage, radio, film, and television, and made numerous brief and not so brief appearances together in movies aside from the \"Road\" pictures, Variety Girl (1947) being an example of lengthy scenes and songs together along with billing.\n\n\nTelevision\nThe Fireside Theater (1950) was his first television production The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at Hal Roach Studios rather than performed live on the air The \"telefilms\" were syndicated to individual television stations Crosby was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s, appearing on various variety shows as well as numerous late-night talk shows and his own highly rated specials Bob Hope memorably devoted one of his monthly NBC specials to his long intermittent partnership with Crosby titled \"On the Road With Bing\" Crosby was associated with ABC's The Hollywood Palace as the show's first and most frequent guest host and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children, and continued after The Hollywood Palace was eventually canceled In the early 1970s, Crosby made two late appearances on the Flip Wilson Show, singing duets with the comedian His last TV appearance was a Christmas special, Merrie Olde Christmas, taped in London in September 1977 and aired weeks after his death [49] It was on this special that Crosby recorded a duet of \"The Little Drummer Boy\" and \"Peace on Earth\" with rock musician David Bowie Their duet was released in 1982 as a single 45 rpm record and reached No 3 in the UK singles charts [46] It has since become a staple of holiday radio and the final popular hit of Crosby's career At the end of the 20th century, TV Guide listed the Crosby-Bowie duet one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th-century television.\n\n\nSinging style and vocal characteristics\nCrosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone rather than use the loud, penetrating vaudeville style associated with Al Jolson [50] Crosby was, by his own definition, a \"phraser\", a singer who placed equal emphasis on both the lyrics and the music [51] Paul Whiteman's hiring of Crosby, with phrasing that echoed jazz, particularly his bandmate Bix Beiderbecke's trumpet, helped bring the genre to a wider audience [50] In the framework of the novelty-singing style of the Rhythm Boys, Crosby bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was rooted in jazz [52] He had already been introduced to Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith before his first appearance on record Crosby and Armstrong remained warm acquaintances for decades, occasionally singing together in later years, e.g \"Now You Has Jazz\" in the film High Society (1956) In Crosby's performances, the presence of jazz phrasing, jazz rhythm and jazz improvisation varied depending on the piece of music, but those were elements that Crosby frequently used This can be observed particularly in his straight jazz work during the late 1920s/early 1930s, Crosby's recordings with Buddy Cole and His Trio from the mid-1950s, as well as in his numerous collaborations with such jazz musicians as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Joe Venuti, or Eddie Lang However, while Crosby can be called a jazz singer, he was not strictly only a jazz singer as he modeled the style and techniques to a broad scope of music that he performed, ranging from Jazz to Country to even such material as operetta arias [53]\n\n\nCareer achievements\nCrosby's was among the most popular and successful musical acts of the 20th century Billboard magazine used different methodologies during his career, but his chart success remains impressive: 396 chart singles, including roughly 41 number 1 hits Crosby had separate charting singles every year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of \"White Christmas\" extended that streak to 1957 He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone Statistician Joel Whitburn at Billboard determined that Crosby was America's most successful recording act of the 1930s and again in the 1940s [58]\n\n\nPopularity and influence\nCrosby's popularity around the world was such that Dorothy Masuka, the best-selling African recording artist, stated that, \"Only Bing Crosby the famous American crooner sold more records than me in Africa.\" His great popularity throughout the continent led other African singers to emulate him, including Masuka, Dolly Rathebe, and Míriam Makeba, known locally as \"The Bing Crosby of Africa\" [76]\n\n\nEntrepreneurship\nAccording to Shoshana Klebanoff, Crosby became one of the richest men in the history of show business He had investments in real estate, mines, oil wells, cattle ranches, race horses, music publishing, baseball teams, and television Crosby made a fortune from the Minute Maid Orange Juice Corporation, in which he was a principal stockholder [80]\n\n\nRole in early tape recording\nDuring the Golden Age of Radio, performers had to create their shows live, sometimes even redoing the program a second time for the West Coast time zone Crosby had to do two live radio shows on the same day, three hours apart, for the East and West Coasts [81] Crosby's radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows The live production of radio shows was reinforced by the musicians' union and ASCAP, which wanted to ensure continued work for their members In On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional broadcast quality standard:\n\n\nVideotape development\nMullin continued to work for Crosby to develop a videotape recorder (VTR) Television production was mostly live television in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio The Fireside Theater (1950) sponsored by Procter & Gamble, was his first television production Mullin had not yet succeeded with videotape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the \"telefilms\" were syndicated to individual television stations.\n\n\nTelevision station ownership\nA Crosby-led group purchased station KCOP-TV, in Los Angeles, California, in 1954 [88] NAFI Corporation and Crosby purchased television station KPTV in Portland, Oregon, for $4 million on September 1, 1959 [89] In 1960, NAFI purchased KCOP from Crosby's group [88] In the early 1950s, Crosby helped establish the CBS television affiliate in his hometown of Spokane, Washington Crosby partnered with Ed Craney, who owned the CBS radio affiliate KXLY (AM) and built a television studio west of Crosby's alma mater, Gonzaga University After it began broadcasting, the station was sold within a year to Northern Pacific Radio and Television Corporation.\n\n\nThoroughbred horse racing\nCrosby was a fan of thoroughbred horse racing and bought his first racehorse in 1935 Two years later, Crosby became a founding partner of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and a member of its board of directors [90] [91] Operating from the Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California, the group included millionaire businessman Charles S Howard, who owned a successful racing stable that included Seabiscuit [90] Charles' son, Lindsay C Howard, became one of Crosby's closest friends; Crosby named his son Lindsay after him, and would purchase his 40-room Hillsborough, California, estate from Lindsay in 1965.\n\n\nSports\nCrosby had a keen interest in sports In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, Gonzaga head coach Mike Pecarovich, appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach [93] From 1946 until his death, Crosby owned a 25% share of the Pittsburgh Pirates Although he was passionate about the team, Crosby was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to its radio broadcast Crosby had arranged for Ampex, another of his financial investments, to record the NBC telecast on kinescope The game was one of the most famous in baseball history, capped off by Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run that won the game for Pittsburgh Crosby apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009 [94] [95] The restored broadcast was shown on MLB Network in December 2010.\n\n\nPersonal life\nCrosby reportedly had an alcohol problem between the late 1920s and early 1930s, spending 60 days in jail for drinking and crashing his car during prohibition He got his drinking under control in 1931 [3] [100]\n\n\nRomantic relationships\nCrosby was married twice His first wife was actress and nightclub singer Dixie Lee, to whom he was married from 1930 until she died of ovarian cancer in 1952 They had four sons: Gary, twins Dennis and Phillip, and Lindsay Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman (1947) was rumored to be based on Lee's life The Crosby family lived at 10500 Camarillo Street in North Hollywood for more than five years [110]\n\n\nHomes\nIn November 1958, Crosby purchased the 1,350-acre Rising River Ranch in Cassel, California after renting a portion of it for several years [115] Attorney Ira Shadwell declined to disclose the purchase price In October 1978, actor Clint Eastwood purchased the ranch under the name of his business manager, Roy Kaufman, for $1.5 million [116]\n\n\nChildren\nAfter Crosby's death, his eldest son, Gary, published a highly critical memoir, Going My Own Way (1983; written in collaboration with noted music journalist Ross Firestone), depicting his father as cruel, cold, remote, and physically and psychologically abusive [120] While acknowledging that corporal punishments took place, there were reports of all of Gary's immediate siblings distancing themselves from the abuse claims, either in public or in private [113]\n\n\nHealth and death\nFollowing his recovery from a life-threatening fungal infection in his right lung in January 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement to start a new spate of albums and concerts On March 20, 1977, after videotaping a CBS concert special, \"Bing – 50th Anniversary Gala\", at the Ambassador Auditorium with Bob Hope looking on, Crosby fell off the stage into an orchestra pit, rupturing a disc in his back requiring a month-long stay in the hospital [132] Crosby's first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977, the day Elvis Presley died, at the Concord Pavilion in Concord, California When the electric power failed during his performance, Crosby continued singing without amplification [133] On August 27, Crosby gave a televised concert in Norway [134]\n\n\nLegacy\nCrosby is a member of the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in the radio division [141]\n\n\nCompositions\nCrosby wrote or co-wrote lyrics to 22 songs His composition \"At Your Command\" was number 1 for three weeks on the U.S pop singles chart beginning on August 8, 1931 \"I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You\" was his most successful composition, recorded by Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, and Mildred Bailey, among others Songs co-written by Crosby include:\n\n\nGrammy Hall of Fame\nFour performances by Bing Crosby have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a

Silambarasan refused to dub for the portions in the film, citing pending remuneration [66] Suresh Kamatchi, assured Silambarasan to pay him ₹2 crore (US$240,000) as the remainder, which convinced the actor, and had completed dubbing for the remaining portions of his film, within a day [66] Yuvan started re-recording for the film's music and score in August 2021, which was completed within early-October 2021 [67] The final copy of the film was submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification and was received U/A certificate (in concern of few action sequences) with a runtime of 147 minutes [68]\n\n\nThemes and influences\nFollowing the official teaser, which released on Silambarasan's birthday (3 February 2021), [69] netizens and fans of the actor claimed uncanny comparisons have been made to that of the American film Tenet (2020), directed by Christopher Nolan, as the frames from the teaser had made the use of reverse editing, as it deals with reverse-time formula [70] [71] However, Venkat Prabhu refused such claims saying that it has no connection to that film [72] In the trailer, it was revealed that the film is based on a time loop concept (a common trope used in science-fiction films), where two characters were forced to repeat the same day after an unfortunate incident [73] It is the second Indian film to deal with the concept of time loops after Jango, released earlier the same year Prabhu acknowledged Groundhog Day (1993) and Vantage Point (2008) as influences on Maanaadu [74]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film's soundtrack is composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, after regularly collaborating with Venkat Prabhu and Silambarasan The soundtrack album consists of seven tracks — only two songs, titled \"Meherezylaa\" [78] [79] and \"Voice of Unity\" (the latter was used as a promotional song and not featured in the film), [80] [81] and few instrumentals used in the background score were released along with the album The track \"Meherezylaa\" was released on the occasion of World Music Day (21 June 2021), [82] with the entire cast and crew being present at the Twitter Spaces to launch the track from the album [83] The promotional song \"Voice of Unity\" was released at an event held in Chennai [81] The soundtrack album was released by U1 Records on 7 November 2021, to positive response [84]\n\n\nRelease\nMaanadu was reportedly scheduled for a theatrical release on 14 May 2021 (Eid-al-Fitr) [85] but due to the extensive post-production activities the film's released was postponed to August 2021, [86] which was further delayed due to the COVID-19 restrictions [87] On 11 September 2021, it was announced that the film would be released in five Indian languages on 4 November 2021, during Diwali [88] Suresh Kamatchi said that the extensive visual effects work delayed the post-production process, thereby resulting in the film being scheduled for release on that date [61]\n\n\nTheatrical\nMaanadu was reportedly scheduled for a

and Africa Scandinavian Tamil Media Group AS acquired the rights for distributing the film in countries such as Norway, Sweden and Denmark DMY Productions and BMN acquired the theatrical marketing rights in Malaysia and Sri Lanka regions United India Exports purchased the distribution rights in Singapore and Gulf regions respectively [95] [94]\n\n\nHome media\nThe post-theatrical streaming rights of the film were bought by SonyLIV, and it began streaming there from 24 December 2021, four weeks after the film's theatrical premiere [103] Initially, Kalaignar TV was reported to acquire the satellite rights, [104] but it was later sold to Star Vijay [105] [106]\n\n\nControversies\nT Rajendar and Usha Rajendar, Silambarasan's parents, filed a police complaint against the Tamil Film Producers Council for the film's postponement, over the issues revolving Anbanavan Asaradhavan Adangadhavan (2017) [107] It was reported that one of the members from the council demanded Silambarasan to compensate the losses incurred by the film's producer Michael Rayappan after its failure, and they even tried to send death threats to the actor, if he releases the film without refunding the dues [108] They also warned that they might stage protests outside the office of Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M K Stalin, if the perpetuators stop the film's release [109]\n\n\nLegal issues from TFPC\nT Rajendar and Usha Rajendar, Silambarasan's parents, filed a police complaint against the Tamil Film Producers Council for the film's postponement, over the issues revolving Anbanavan Asaradhavan

Tamil Nadu, M K Stalin, if the perpetuators stop the film's release [109]\n\n\nFinancial problems\nOn 24 November 2021, a day before the film's scheduled release, Suresh Kamatchi announced that the film had been postponed due to undisclosed reasons [112] It received a shocking response from the actor's fans and trade industry sources, as the film had a tremendous response at the pre-sale bookings in advance, and analysts believed that the film will be the \"biggest opener for Simbu at the box office\" [113] The night of the same day, DMK MLA Udhayanidhi Stalin, had arranged a meeting with the producers and financiers to clear the dues, which was eventually solved quick and the film was released as scheduled [114] [115] Despite financial settlements being done, the film's early morning shows, scheduled for 5:00 A.M were cancelled as the Key Delivery Message (KDM) did not arrive in time, as planned and the first show began at 8:30 A.M [116]\n\n\nSatellite rights ownership issue\nIn December 2021, T Rajendar filed a case regarding the price negotiations of satellite rights, where he had claimed the ownership for the same name In his complaint, it has been stated that he was involved in sorting out the release issues of the film and had apparently signed a guarantee letter to take responsibility for the amount that needed to be paid to Chand Both the parties have agreed upon Rajendar taking responsibilities for the remainder to be paid after negotiating deals for satellite and digital streaming rights But the deal was negotiated without his consent, where he was not present during the price negotiation [117] In response, the Tamil Film Active Producers Council, headed by Bharathiraja, condemned Rajendar's actions for claiming the film's satellite rights as a \"very false precedent and questioned that how can a guarantor apply for a license for the property and also asked whether it is fair for a reputable artist in the film industry\" The association strongly claimed that no one is in charge of a traditional business organisation [118]\n\n\nProtests from Bharatiya Janata Party\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party's minority wing opposed the film claiming that it portrays Muslims in bad light and asked the Chief Minister to ban it [119] The affair ended with BJP's Tamil Nadu state president Annamalai K restraining BJP cadres and members from making further claims (or) criticism of the film, calling it a harmless entertainment film made with good intentions and sealed the issue [120] [121]\n\n\nReception\nOn the opening day of its release, the film crossed ₹14 crore (US$1.7 million) in Tamil Nadu [122] In the Chennai city box-office, the film collected ₹3.2 crore (US$380,000) [123] The film earned US$100,000 (₹77 lakh) from preview shows in

[127] The film was considered to become a profitable venture, as it achieved break-even within four days of its release [126] [128] [129] [130] [2]\n\n\nBox office\nOn the opening day of its release,

the concept, he further heaped praise on the technical departments as \"everyone was at their best\", calling the film as \"an entertaining and new experience for Tamil cinema\" [148] Praveen Sudevan of The Hindu compared the similarities for Maanaadu with that of Master (2021) and Doctor (2021), as both the films have \"solid antagonists\", noting that S J Suryah's character Dhanushkodi, a ruthless cop \"outwits the protagonist for most of the film\" and added that \"his performance equally contributed to the film's success as Silambarasan's\" [149] He further heaped praise on Prabhu

two seasons before suffering disappointments in the playoffs In the offseason, they were at risk of losing two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award-winner Giannis Antetokounmpo in free agency [9] To improve their roster, the Bucks acquired guard Jrue Holiday, a highly respected defensive player and an All-Star in 2013, from the New Orleans Pelicans in a four-team trade, surrendering a bounty in starting point guard Eric Bledsoe, George Hill, the rights to R J Hampton, and a package of future draft picks [9] [10] Milwaukee later re-signed Antetokounmpo, and had previously re-signed forward Khris Middleton and center Brook Lopez [9] [11] [12] The team finished the season with a 46–26 record and clinched the 3-seed in the Eastern Conference [13]\n\n\nPhoenix Suns\nThe Suns had just a .302 winning percentage in the previous five seasons entering the 2020–21 season, which is the worst winning percentage in the five years prior for a team advancing to the final playoff round in any of the four major American professional sports leagues [19] During the 2020 offseason, Phoenix acquired All-Star Chris Paul from the Oklahoma City Thunder by trading away Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr., and a future first-round draft pick [20] The Suns, led by Paul, rising star Devin Booker, 2018 first overall pick Deandre Ayton, and second-year head coach Monty Williams, finished the season with a 51–21 record as the No 2 seed, their first winning season since the 2013–14 season, and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2010 [21] [22] They also clinched the Pacific division for the first time since 2006–07 [23]\n\n\nRoad to the Finals\nThe Suns won the regular season series 2–0, with both wins decided by a single point.\n\n\nRegular season series\nThe Suns won the regular season

Milwaukee After he opened the third quarter with a jump shot for the first double-digit lead of the game, Paul later scored eight straight points for the Suns and scored 16 overall in the quarter Phoenix led 88–68 with 2:20 remaining in the quarter after Paul passed to Deandre Ayton, who was fouled and made two free throws [21] In his return from his knee injury, Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo returned and had 20 points, 17 rebounds in limited minutes due to foul trouble, [21] and made a chase-down block of a layup attempt by Mikal Bridges that was reminiscent of \"The Block\" by LeBron James on Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals [28] Antetokounmpo's availability was not confirmed until almost an hour before tip-off, and he played with few signs of injury

Game 3 [35] Holiday scored 21 points and was 5 of 10 on 3-pointers, [35] and Middleton scored 18 [36] The Suns got 19 points and nine assists from Paul, [36] but his fellow guard Booker was limited to 10 points on 3-of-14 shooting, as the Bucks sent multiple defenders at him [35]\n\n\nGame 4\nMiddleton scored 40 points, including 10 straight for Milwaukee in the closing moments, and the Bucks won 109–103 to tie the series 2–2 Booker rebounded from his Game 3 struggles to score a game-high 42 points, but his playing time was restricted late by foul trouble [42] The Suns led for 37:55 of the first 44 minutes of the game [43] With 3:42 left in the fourth and the Suns up by three Jrue Holiday attempted a layup and received a great deal of contact from Devin Booker with no call (the play was determined to be a foul by the NBA in the Last 3:30 Report after the game) [44] If Devin Booker had received the foul, it would have been his sixth, resulting in him being ejected and hugely affecting the game This sparked a lot of controversy online, with the decision to not call the foul being criticised by fans and sports media [45] They were up two with 2+1⁄2 minutes remaining when Middleton scored the next eight points in the contest [46] [47] He made consecutive midrange jump shots to place Milwaukee up for good at 101–99 with 1:28 in the game [46] [47] Jumping off the left leg that he hyperextended two weeks earlier, [46] Antetokounmpo blocked a potential game-tying alley-oop by Ayton with 1:14 left, [42] [47] prompting fans and media to debate the play's standing among the greatest blocks of all-time [48]  After Paul lost his balance of his own accord and turned over the ball, Holiday picked up the loose ball and Middleton made a fast-break layup and with 27.2 seconds left for a four-point lead [42] [49] [50]  He capped off his run with four free throws to bring the score to 107–101 [47] The Bucks outscored the Suns 33–21 in the fourth quarter [50] Antetokounmpo finished with 26 points along with 14 rebounds and eight assists [47]\n\n\nGame 5\nA day before the start of Game 5, the formerly tentatively named Phoenix Suns Arena would officially receive the new name of the Footprint Center, which went into effect in time for Game 5 of the NBA Finals to begin With Milwaukee leading by one with about 16 seconds remaining in the game, Holiday stole the ball from Phoenix's Booker and passed to Antetokounmpo for an alley-oop and a free throw (fouled by Paul on the finish) to secure the game for a 123–119 Bucks' win and a 3–2 series lead [52] [53] Milwaukee recovered from an early 16-point deficit to outscore Phoenix 87–57 from the start of the second quarter to around the nine-minute mark of the fourth quarter The Suns were down 10 with 3+1⁄2 minutes left in the game before a basket by Paul cut it to 120–119 with 56 seconds to play [53] Holiday had 27 points, 13 assists and three steals [12] Antetokounmpo had 32 points, nine rebounds and six assists, and Middleton finished with 29 points [53] Booker had a game-high 40 points, [52] his second-straight contest with at least 40 [53]\n\n\nGame 6\nGiannis Antetokounmpo scored a playoff career-high 50 points and added 14 rebounds and five blocks to lead the Bucks to a 105–98 victory to win the series in six games [10] The 50 points tied a Finals record for the most scored by a player in a series-clinching game, set by Bob Pettit of the St Louis Hawks in 1958 [58] [59] After his dominant performance in the series, including his third game with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds, Antetokounmpo was named the Finals MVP, [60] the youngest winner at age 26 since Kawhi Leonard (22) in 2014 [61] Antetokounmpo made 16 of his 25 shots, and was a surprising 17 for 19 on his free throws after hitting just 55.6% in the playoffs The game was tied at 77 after three quarters before he scored 13 in the final period to lead Milwaukee to its first championship since 1971, when they were led by Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson Paul led the Suns with 26 points [60]\n\n\nRosters\nRoster  Last transaction: May 13, 2021\n\n\nPlayer statistics\nAs part of a multiyear partnership since

Olympic and Paralympic Games and Thomas Bach, IOC president, then gave speeches [64] Hashimoto briefly spoke about the Tokyo Olympics as an example of overcoming difficulties, as the pitch to host the

briefly heard while the equestrian-related pictograms were recreated The first pictogram shown, the one for the modern pentathlon, was initially depicted as a static image before the performer

Oh, and Hideki \"Godzilla\" Matsui), a doctor and a nurse, paralympian Wakako Tsuchida, and a group of students from Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures who were born shortly before the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami Finally, Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka carried it up the steps to light the Olympic cauldron; [102] [106] Osaka herself would compete for Japan in the Olympics before being eliminated in the third round of the women's tennis competition [107] Three hours later, the badminton player Ayaka Takahashi lit another cauldron, outside the stadium which was off-limits to guests [108]\n\n\nDignitaries in attendance\nEven though the stadium had normally had a capacity for 68,000 spectators, however only 800 foreign and 150 local officials, [110] who were deemed \"Games stakeholders\", were in attendance, as well as 3,500 members of the media and 6,000 members of team delegations, totalling 10,400 [50] Even though it is customary for Olympic sponsors to send corporate representatives as well, companies such as Toyota, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble, NEC, and Fujitsu, opted out of attending [110] A scoreboard in the stadium warned the attendees to \"Clap, Do not sing or chant\" [65]\n\n\nHost country dignitaries\nOutside the venue, protests opposing the Olympics being run during the COVID-19 pandemic was held in the southwestern corner of the

[2]\n\n\nReception\nThe ceremony was panned as being solemn and muted in comparison to previous Olympic ceremonies, with the lack of audience due to the state of emergency being a factor in the atmosphere, to the point that journalist Ian Dunt compared it to attending a funeral [142] It was also largely panned for being too long and confusing Japanese Entertainment writer Elizabeth Matsumoto was confused by some elements of the ceremony such as the Matsuri segment, questioning why to focus on carpentry and if the tap dancing was necessary [143] Others criticized Bach's 13 minute speech where some athletes sat down during the segment [144] [94]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nIn Japan, state broadcaster NHK aired the opening ceremony in 8K with 22.2 surround sound and hybrid log-gamma (HLG) HDR [148] [149] Despite wide opposition to the Olympics by residents, the opening ceremony was seen in Japan by at least 73.27 million viewers nationwide, with NHK peaking at a 61% audience share during a segment featuring Miki Maya and at the start of the parade of nations CEO of Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) Yiannis Exarchos stated that the opening ceremony was the most-watched Japanese television broadcast in the last 10 years Locally, it was reported that the opening ceremony had achieved a 56% audience share in the Kantō region, making it the most-watched television broadcast in the region since the opening ceremony of the 1964 Summer Olympics [150]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Belgium [7] She was known to her family as Adriaantje [8]\n\n\n1929–1938: Family and early childhood\nAudrey Kathleen Ruston (later, Hepburn-Ruston [6]) was born on 4 May 1929 at number 48 Rue Keyenveld in Ixelles, a municipality of Brussels, Belgium [7] She was known to her family as Adriaantje [8]\n\n\n1939–1945: Experiences during World War II\nAfter Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Hepburn's mother moved her daughter back to Arnhem in the hope that, as during the First World War, the Netherlands would remain neutral and be spared a German attack While there, Hepburn attended the Arnhem Conservatory from 1939 to 1945 She had begun taking ballet lessons during her last years at boarding school, and continued training in Arnhem under the tutelage of Winja Marova, becoming her \"star pupil\" [10] After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Hepburn used the name Edda van Heemstra, because an \"English-sounding\" name was considered dangerous during the German occupation Her family was profoundly affected by the occupation, with Hepburn later stating that \"had we known that we were going to be occupied for five years, we might have all shot ourselves We thought it might be over next week… six months… next year… that's how we got through\" [10]\n\n\nEntertainment career\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Hepburn moved with her mother and siblings to Amsterdam, where she began ballet training under Sonia Gaskell, a leading figure in Dutch ballet, and Russian teacher Olga Tarasova [45] Due to the loss of the family fortune, Ella had to support them by working as a cook and housekeeper for a wealthy family [46] Hepburn made her film debut playing an air stewardess in Dutch in Seven Lessons (1948), an educational travel film made by Charles van der Linden and Henry Josephson [47]\n\n\n1945–1952: Ballet studies and early acting roles\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Hepburn moved with her mother and siblings to Amsterdam, where she began ballet training under Sonia Gaskell, a leading figure in Dutch ballet, and Russian teacher Olga Tarasova [45] Due to the loss of the family fortune, Ella had to support them by working as a cook and housekeeper for a wealthy family [46] Hepburn made her film debut playing an air stewardess in Dutch in Seven Lessons (1948), an educational travel film made by Charles van der Linden and Henry Josephson [47]\n\n\n1953–1960: Roman Holiday and stardom\nHepburn had her first starring role in Roman Holiday (1953), playing Princess Ann, a European princess who escapes the reins of royalty and has a wild night out with an American newsman (Gregory Peck) On 18 September 1951, shortly after Secret People was finished but before its premiere, Thorold Dickinson made a screen test with the young starlet and sent it to director William Wyler, who was in Rome preparing Roman Holiday Wyler wrote a glowing note of thanks to Dickinson, saying that \"as a result of the test, a number of the producers at Paramount have expressed interest in casting her.\" [61] The producers of the film had initially wanted Elizabeth Taylor for the role, but Wyler was so impressed by Hepburn's screen test that he cast her instead Wyler later commented, \"She had everything I was looking for: charm, innocence, and talent She also was very funny She was absolutely enchanting, and we said, 'That's the girl!'\" [62] Originally, the film was to have had only Gregory Peck's name above its title, with \"Introducing Audrey Hepburn\" beneath in smaller font Peck suggested Wyler elevate her to equal billing so her name appears before the title, and in type as large as his: \"You've got to change that because she'll be a big star, and I'll look like a big jerk.\" [63]\n\n\n1961–1967: Breakfast at Tiffany's and continued success\nHepburn next starred as New Yorker Holly Golightly in Blake Edwards's Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), a film loosely based on the Truman Capote novella of the same name Capote disapproved of many changes that were made to sanitise the story for the film adaptation, and would have preferred Marilyn Monroe to have been cast in the role, although he also stated that Hepburn \"did a terrific job\" [77] The character is considered one of the best-known in American cinema, and a defining role for Hepburn [78] The dress she wears during the opening credits has been considered an icon of the twentieth century, and perhaps the most famous \"little black dress\" of all time [79] [80] [81] [82] Hepburn stated that the role was \"the jazziest of my career\" [83] yet admitted: \"I'm an introvert Playing the extroverted girl was the hardest thing I ever did.\" [84] She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.\n\n\n1968–1993: Semi-retirement and final projects\nAfter 1967, Hepburn chose to devote more time to her family and acted only occasionally She attempted a comeback playing Maid Marian in the period piece Robin and Marian (1976) with Sean Connery co-starring as Robin Hood, which was moderately successful Roger Ebert praised Hepburn's chemistry with Connery, writing, \"Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters They glow They really do seem in love And they project as marvellously complex, fond, tender people; the passage of 20 years has given them grace and wisdom.\" [99] Hepburn reunited with director Terence Young in the production of Bloodline (1979), sharing top-billing with Ben Gazzara, James Mason, and Romy Schneider [100] The film, an international intrigue amid the jet-set, was a critical and box-office failure Hepburn's last starring role in a feature film was opposite Gazzara in the comedy They All Laughed (1981), directed by Peter Bogdanovich [101] The film was overshadowed by the murder of one of its stars, Dorothy Stratten, and received only a limited release Six years later, Hepburn co-starred with Robert Wagner in a made-for-television caper film, Love Among Thieves (1987) [102]\n\n\nHumanitarian work\nIn the 1950s, Hepburn narrated two radio programmes for UNICEF, re-telling children's stories of war [104] In 1989, Hepburn was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF On her appointment, she stated that she was grateful for receiving international aid after enduring the German occupation as a child, and wanted to show her gratitude to the organisation [105]\n\n\n1988–1992\nHepburn's first field mission for UNICEF was to Ethiopia in 1988 She visited an orphanage in Mek'ele that housed 500 starving children and had UNICEF send food [106] Of the trip, she said,\n\n\nRecognition\nUnited States president George H W Bush presented Hepburn with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her work with UNICEF, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences posthumously awarded her the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her contribution to humanity [110] [111] In 2002, at the United Nations Special Session on Children, UNICEF honoured Hepburn's legacy of humanitarian work by unveiling a statue, \"The Spirit of Audrey\", at UNICEF's New York headquarters Her service for children is also recognised through the United States Fund for UNICEF's Audrey Hepburn Society [112] [113]\n\n\nPersonal life and final years\nAlongside her native English and Dutch, Hepburn also had some fluency in French (which she learned at school in Belgium), German, Italian, and Spanish [114] Throughout her life, Hepburn lived in many countries, including spending her childhood in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands, and her adult years in the United States, Italy, and Switzerland, [115] and traveled extensively during her later years of life as part of her humanitarian work with UNICEF [116]\n\n\nMultilingualism\nAlongside her native English and Dutch, Hepburn also had some fluency in French (which she learned at school in Belgium), German, Italian, and Spanish [114] Throughout her life, Hepburn lived in many countries, including spending her childhood in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands, and her adult years in the United States, Italy, and Switzerland, [115] and traveled extensively during her later years of life as part of her humanitarian work with UNICEF [116]\n\n\nMarriages, relationships, and children\nIn 1952, Hepburn became engaged to industrialist James Hanson, [117] whom she had known since her early days in London She called it \"love at first sight\", but after having her wedding dress fitted and the date set, she decided the marriage would not work because the demands of their careers would keep them apart most of the time [118] She issued a public statement about her decision, saying \"When I get married, I want to be really married\" [119] In the early 1950s, she also dated future Hair producer Michael Butler [120]\n\n\nIllness and death\nUpon returning to Switzerland from Somalia in late September 1992, Hepburn developed abdominal pain While initial medical tests in Switzerland had inconclusive results, a laparoscopy performed at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in early November revealed a rare form of abdominal cancer belonging to a group of cancers known as pseudomyxoma peritonei [131] Having grown slowly over several years, the cancer had metastasised as a thin coating over her small intestine After surgery, Hepburn began chemotherapy [132]\n\n\nLegacy\nHepburn's legacy has endured long after her death The American Film Institute named Hepburn third among the Greatest Female Stars of All Time She is one of few entertainers who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy and Tony Awards She won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role In her last years, she remained a

Achievement Award in 1992 [138] She was the recipient of numerous posthumous awards including the 1993 Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and competitive Grammy and Emmy Awards In January 2009, Hepburn was named on The Times' list of the top 10 British actresses of all time [138] In 2010, Emma Thompson opined that Hepburn \"can't sing and she can't really act\"; some people agreed, others disagreed [139] Hepburn's son Sean later said \"My mother would be the first person to say that she wasn't the best actress in the world But she was a movie star.\" [140]\n\n\nPublic image and style icon\nHepburn was known for her fashion choices and distinctive look, to the extent that journalist Mark Tungate has described her as a recognisable brand [159] When she first rose to stardom in Roman Holiday (1953), she was seen as an alternative feminine ideal that appealed more to women than men, compared to the more sexual and curvy Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor [160] [161] With her short hairstyle, thick eyebrows, slim body, and \"gamine\" looks, she presented a look that young women found easier to emulate than those of more sexual film stars [162] In 1954, fashion photographer Cecil Beaton declared Hepburn the \"public embodiment of our new feminine ideal\" in Vogue, and wrote that \"Nobody ever looked like her before World War II .. Yet we recognise the rightness of this appearance in relation to our historical needs The proof is that thousands of imitations have appeared.\" [161] The magazine and its British version frequently reported on her style throughout the following decade [163] Alongside model Twiggy, Hepburn has been cited as one of the key public figures who made being very slim fashionable [162] Vogue has referred to her as \"the acme of classic beauty\" Her style was also emulated by American singer Ariana Grande in the earlier stages of Grande's career [164]\n\n\nFilmography and stage roles\nHepburn was considered by some to be one of the most beautiful women of all time [184] [185] Remembered as a film and style icon, she was ranked as the third greatest screen legend in American cinema by the American Film Institute [186] [187] [188] [189] Her debut was as a flight stewardess in the 1948 Dutch film Dutch in Seven Lessons [48] Hepburn then performed on the British stage as a chorus girl in the musicals High Button Shoes (1948), and Sauce Tartare (1949) Two years later she made her Broadway debut as the title character in the play Gigi Hepburn's Hollywood debut as a runaway princess in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953) opposite Gregory Peck made her a star [187] [190] [191] For her performance she received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama [192] [193] [194] In 1954 she played a chauffeur's daughter caught in a love triangle in Billy Wilder's romantic comedy Sabrina opposite Humphrey Bogart and William Holden [195] [196] In the same year Hepburn garnered the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for portraying the titular water nymph in the play Ondine [197] [198]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nHepburn received numerous awards and honours during her career Hepburn won, or was nominated for, awards for her work in motion pictures, television, spoken-word recording, on stage, and humanitarian work She was five-times nominated for an Academy Award, and she was awarded the 1953 Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Roman Holiday and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1993, posthumously, for her humanitarian work From five nominations, she won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role, and received a BAFTA Special Award in 1992 [199] [200] [201]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Audrey Hepburn\n================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nAudrey Kathleen Ruston, later known as Audrey Hepburn-Ruston, was a British actress, model, and humanitarian.

Hepburn made her film debut playing an air stewardess in Dutch in Seven Lessons (1948), an educational travel film made by Charles van der Linden and Henry Josephson.\n\n1953–1960: Roman Holiday and Stardom\n-------------------------------------\n\nHepburn had her first starring role in Roman Holiday (1953), playing Princess Ann, a European princess who escapes the reins of royalty and has a wild night out with an American newsman (Gregory Peck). On September 18, 1951, shortly after Secret People was finished but before its premiere, Thorold Dickinson made a screen test with the young starlet and sent it to director William Wyler, who was in Rome preparing Roman Holiday. Wyler wrote a glowing note of thanks to Dickinson, saying that \"as a result of the test, a number of the producers at Paramount have expressed interest in casting her.\" The producers of the film had initially wanted Elizabeth Taylor for the role, but Wyler was so impressed by Hepburn's screen test that he cast her instead. Wyler later commented, \"She had everything I was looking for: charm, innocence, and talent. She also was very funny. She was absolutely enchanting, and we said, 'That's the girl!'\"\n\n1961–1967: Breakfast at Tiffany's and Continued Success\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nHepburn next starred as New Yorker Holly Golightly in Blake Edwards's Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), a film loosely based on the Truman Capote novella of the same name. Capote disapproved of many changes that were made to sanitise the story for the film adaptation, and would have preferred Marilyn Monroe to have been cast in the role, although he also stated that Hepburn \"did a terrific job.\" The character is considered one of the best-known in American cinema, and a defining role for Hepburn. The dress she wears during the opening credits has been considered an icon of the twentieth century, and perhaps the most famous \"little black dress\" of all time. Hepburn stated that the role was \"the jazziest of my career\" yet admitted: \"I'm an introvert. Playing the extroverted girl was the hardest thing I ever did.\" She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.\n\n1968–1993: Semi-Retirement and Final Projects\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAfter 1967, Hepburn chose to devote more time to her family and acted only occasionally. She attempted a comeback playing Maid Marian in the period piece Robin and Marian (1976) with Sean Connery co-starring as Robin Hood, which was moderately successful. Roger Ebert praised Hepburn's chemistry with Connery, writing, \"Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters. They glow. They really do seem in love. And they project as marvellously complex, fond, tender people; the passage of 20 years has given them grace and wisdom.\" Hepburn reunited with director Terence Young in the production of Bloodline (1979), sharing top-billing with Ben Gazzara, James Mason, and Romy Schneider. The film, an international intrigue amid the jet-set, was a critical and box-office failure. Hepburn's last starring role in a feature film was opposite Gazzara in the comedy They All Laughed (1981), directed by Peter Bogdanovich. The film was overshadowed by the murder of one of its stars, Dorothy Stratten, and received only a limited release. Six years later, Hepburn co-starred with Robert Wagner in a made-for-television caper film, Love Among Thieves (1987).\n\nHumanitarian Work\n-----------------\n\nIn the 1950s, Hepburn narrated two radio programmes for UNICEF, re-telling children's stories of war. In 1989, Hepburn was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF. On her appointment, she stated that she was grateful for receiving international aid after enduring the German occupation as a child, and wanted to show her gratitude to the organisation.\n\nRecognition\n------------\n\nUnited States president George H W Bush presented Hepburn with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her work with UNICEF, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences posthumously awarded her the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her contribution to humanity. In 2002, at the United Nations Special Session on Children, UNICEF honoured Hepburn's legacy of humanitarian work by unveiling a statue, \"The Spirit of Audrey,\" at UNICEF's New York headquarters. Her service for children is also recognised through the United States Fund for UNICEF's Audrey Hepburn Society.\n\nPersonal Life and Final Years\n-----------------------------\n\nAlongside her native English and Dutch, Hepburn also had some fluency in French (which she learned at school in Belgium), German, Italian, and Spanish. Throughout her life, Hepburn lived in many countries, including spending her childhood in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands, and her adult years in the United States, Italy, and Switzerland. She traveled extensively during her later years of life as part of her humanitarian work with UNICEF.\n\nMarriages, Relationships, and Children\n------------------------------------\n\nIn 1952, Hepburn became engaged to industrialist James Hanson, whom she had known since her early days in London. She called it \"love at first sight,\" but after having her wedding dress fitted and the date set, she decided the marriage would not work because the demands of their careers would keep them apart most of the time. She issued a public statement about her decision, saying \"When I get married, I want to be really married.\" In the early 1950s, she also dated future Hair producer Michael Butler.\n\nIllness and Death\n-----------------\n\nUpon returning to Switzerland from Somalia in late September 1992, Hepburn developed abdominal pain. While initial medical tests in Switzerland had inconclusive results, a laparoscopy performed at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in early November revealed a rare form of abdominal cancer belonging to a group of cancers known as pseudomyxoma peritonei. Having grown slowly over several years, the cancer had metastasised as a thin coating over her small intestine. After surgery, Hepburn began chemotherapy.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nHepburn's legacy has endured long after her death. The American Film Institute named Hepburn third among the Greatest Female Stars of All Time. She is one of few entertainers who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards. She won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. In her last years, she remained a visible presence in the film world. She received a tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1991, and she was a frequent presenter at the Academy Awards. She received the BAFTA Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992. She was the recipient of numerous posthumous awards, including the 1993 Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and competitive Grammy and Emmy Awards. In January 2009, Hepburn was named on The Times' list of the top 10 British actresses of all time. In 2010, Emma Thompson opined that Hepburn \"can't sing and she can't really act\"; some people agreed, others disagreed. Hepburn's son Sean later said \"My mother would be the first person to say that she wasn't the best actress in the world. But she was a movie star.\"\n\nPublic Image and Style Icon\n-----------------------------\n\nHepburn was known for her fashion choices and distinctive look, to the extent that journalist Mark Tungate has described her as a recognisable brand. When she first rose to stardom in Roman Holiday (1953), she was seen as an alternative feminine ideal that appealed more to women than men, compared to the more sexual and curvy Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor. With her short hairstyle, thick eyebrows, slim body, and \"gamine\" looks, she presented a look that young women found easier to emulate than those of more sexual film stars. In 1954, fashion photographer Cecil Beaton declared Hepburn the \"public embodiment of our new feminine ideal\" in Vogue, and wrote that \"Nobody ever looked like her before World War II.. Yet we recognise the rightness of this appearance in relation to our historical needs. The proof is that thousands of imitations have appeared.\" The magazine and its British version frequently reported on her style throughout the following decade. Alongside model Twiggy, Hepburn has been cited as one of the key public figures who made being very slim fashionable. Vogue has referred to her as \"the acme of classic beauty.\" Her style was also emulated by American singer Ariana Grande in the earlier stages of Grande's career.\n\nFilmography and Stage Roles\n-----------------------------\n\nHepburn was considered by some to be one of the most beautiful women of all time. Remembered as a film and style icon, she was ranked as the third greatest screen legend in American cinema by the American Film Institute. Her debut was as a flight stewardess in the 1948 Dutch film Dutch in Seven Lessons. Hepburn then performed on the British stage as a chorus girl in the musicals High Button Shoes (1948), and Sauce Tartare (1949). Two years later, she made her Broadway debut as the title character in the play Gigi. Hepburn's Hollywood debut as a runaway princess in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953) opposite Gregory Peck made her a star. For her performance, she received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture–Drama. In 1954, she played a chauffeur's daughter caught in a love triangle in Billy Wilder's romantic comedy Sabrina opposite Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. In the same year, Hepburn garnered the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for portraying the titular water nymph in the play Ondine.\n\nAwards and Honours\n-------------------\n\nHepburn received numerous awards and honours during her career. She won, or was nominated for, awards for her work in motion pictures, television, spoken-word recording, on stage, and humanitarian work. She was five-times nominated for an Academy Award, and she was awarded the 1953 Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Roman Holiday and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1993, posthumously, for her humanitarian work. From five nominations, she won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role, and received a BAFTA Special Award in 1992.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\nFurther

continued training in Arnhem under the tutelage of Winja Marova, becoming her \"star pupil\" [10] After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Hepburn used the name Edda van Heemstra, because an \"English-sounding\" name was considered dangerous during the German occupation Her family was profoundly affected by the occupation, with Hepburn later stating that \"had we known that we were going to be occupied for five years, we might have all shot ourselves We thought it might be over next week… six months… next year… that's how we got through\" [10]\n\n\nEntertainment career\nAfter the war

smaller font Peck suggested Wyler elevate her to equal billing so her name appears before the title, and in type as large as his: \"You've got to change that because she'll be a big star, and I'll

Demiurge, whose presence she credited with imbuing her with superpowers In her memory, when Chavez was approximately six years old, the Utopian Parallel was threatened by destruction with black holes [34] Chavez's mothers sacrificed themselves to seal the black holes, resulting in their particles being scattered across the Multiverse itself [35] Wanting to prove herself as a hero and knowing Utopia didn't require salvation, Chavez ran away from her home and her responsibilities [36] [37] She traveled across different realities, eventually adopted the moniker of Miss America, and began covertly acting as a superhero [38]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nAmerica Chavez acquired a range of superpowers after being exposed to extra-dimensional energies through experiments conducted on her

time [76] [77] She is able to increase her physical fighting ability by harnessing her inherent power from within [74] [78] America Chavez does not age at a normal rate due to her increased lifespan

Chavez**\n\nAmerica Chavez is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She first appeared in Vengeance #1 (September 2011) created by writer Joe Casey and artist Nick Dragotta.\n\n**Development**\n\nJoe Casey, the creator of America Chavez, expressed his desire to create a character that would resonate with audiences as deeply as certain figures had with him in his youth. Reflecting on 2010, he admitted uncertainty about whether a substantial audience existed for a Latina superhero, though he is gratified that the times have evolved to embrace her. He further remarked that he imbued America Chavez with a distinctive individuality and robust self-confidence, envisioning her as a figure of formidable strength and resolve. In his view, she was crafted as the Muhammad Ali of the Marvel Universe, embodying heroism that transcends traditional roles, much like Ali's impact extended beyond boxing.\n\n**Concept and Creation**\n\nAmerica Chavez was created by Joe Casey and Nick Dragotta. Her character was inspired by Casey's own experiences as a young person growing up in a diverse community. She was designed to be a powerful and confident hero who embodies the spirit of Latin American culture.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nAmerica Chavez debuted in Vengeance #1 (September 2011), created by writer Joe Casey and artist Nick Dragotta. She later appeared in the 2013 Young Avengers series, by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Jamie McKelvie, the 2015 A-Force series by G Willow Wilson, Marguerite Bennett, and Jorge Molina, as part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel initiative in the 2015 Ultimates series, by Al Ewing and Kenneth Rocafort, the 2015 All-New Hawkeye series, by Jeff Lemire and Ramón Pérez, the 2015 Avengers one-shot, and the 2017 America series, her first solo comic book series by Gabby Rivera.\n\n**2010s**\n\nAmerica Chavez debuted in Vengeance #1 (September 2011), created by writer Joe Casey and artist Nick Dragotta.

In her memory, when Chavez was approximately six years old, the Utopian Parallel was threatened by destruction with black holes. Chavez's mothers sacrificed themselves to seal the black holes, resulting in their particles being scattered across the Multiverse itself. Wanting to prove herself as a hero and knowing Utopia didn't require salvation, Chavez ran away from her home and her responsibilities.\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nAmerica Chavez acquired a range of superpowers after being exposed to extra-dimensional energies through experiments conducted on her. She possesses superhuman attributes, such as superhuman strength, speed, durability, and has the power of flight. Her invulnerability allows her to be bullet-proof and also makes her flame retardant. America Chavez also has the power to kick open star-shaped portals in reality, allowing her and her teammates to travel through the multiverse and into other realities. She is also able to use her star-shaped portals to travel through time.\n\n**Cultural Impact and Legacy**\n\nNivea Serrao of Entertainment Weekly referred to America Chavez as a \"fan favorite\" character.

He is best known for his roles in the hit TV shows \"Family Ties\" and \"Spin City,\" as well as his starring role in the \"Back to the Future\" film trilogy.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMichael Andrew Fox was born on June 9, 1961, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, to Phyllis Piper and William Nelson Fox. His father was a veteran of the Canadian Forces and later became a police dispatcher, while his mother was a payroll clerk and actress. Fox's maternal grandparents were from England and Belfast, Northern Ireland, making him of English and Irish descent.\n\nFox grew up in a family that encouraged his creative pursuits. He began taking acting classes at a young age and was soon performing in school plays and community theater productions. After high school, Fox moved to Toronto to pursue a career in acting, but he eventually landed in New York City, where he began to gain recognition for his talents.\n\nActing Career\n\nFox's early film roles included appearances in \"Midnight Madness\" (1980) and \"Class of 1984\" (1982), both of which were minor parts. However, it was his role as Alex P. Keaton in the hit TV show \"Family Ties\" that brought him widespread recognition and acclaim.

Fox's announcement helped to raise awareness about the disease and reduce the stigma associated with it.\n\nFox's final season on \"Spin City\" was the show's fourth season, and he made three guest appearances in the final season. He was replaced by Charlie Sheen as the lead character, and the show continued without him.\n\nOther Work\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Fox has also been involved in various other projects, including writing and producing.

{"title": "Vinyl_chloride", "content": "\nUses\nVinyl chloride, also called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), is exclusively used as a precursor to PVC Due to its toxic nature, vinyl chloride is not found in other products Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is very stable, storable and not toxic [2]\n\n\nProduction\nGlobally, approximately 40 million tonnes of PVC resin are produced per year, [10] requiring a corresponding amount of vinyl chloride monomer [11]\n\n\nHistory\nVinyl chloride was first synthesized in 1835 by Justus von Liebig and his student Henri Victor Regnault They obtained it by treating 1,2-dichloroethane with a solution of potassium hydroxide in ethanol [12]\n\n\nAcetylene-based routes\nIn 1912, Fritz Klatte, a German chemist working for Griesheim-Elektron, patented a means to produce vinyl chloride from acetylene and hydrogen chloride using mercuric chloride as a catalyst Acetylene reacts with hydrogen chloride over a mercuric chloride catalyst to give vinyl chloride:\n\n\nEthylene-based routes\nIn the United States and Europe, mercury-catalyzed routes widely used in the 20th century have been superseded by more economical and greener processes based on ethylene  Ethylene is made by cracking ethane Two steps are involved, chlorination and dehydrochlorination:\n\n\nPossible routes from ethane\nNumerous attempts have been made to convert ethane directly to vinyl chloride [2] Ethane, which is even more readily available than ethylene, is a potential precursor to vinyl chloride The conversion of ethane to vinyl chloride has been demonstrated by various routes: [2]\n\n\nThermal decomposition of dichloroethane\n1,2-Dichloroethane, ClCH2CH2Cl (also known as ethylene dichloride, EDC), can be prepared by halogenation of ethane or ethylene, inexpensive starting materials EDC thermally converts into vinyl chloride and anhydrous HCl This production method has become the major route to vinyl chloride since the late 1950s [2]\n\n\nStorage and transportation\nVinyl chloride is stored as a liquid The accepted upper limit of safety as a health hazard is 500 ppm Often, the storage containers for the product vinyl chloride are high capacity spheres The spheres have an inside sphere and an outside sphere Several inches of space separate the inside sphere from the outside sphere The interstitial space between the spheres is purged with an inert gas such as nitrogen As the nitrogen purge gas exits the interstitial space it passes through an analyzer that detects whether any vinyl chloride is leaking from the internal sphere If vinyl chloride starts to leak from the internal sphere or if a fire is detected on the outside of the sphere then the contents of the sphere are automatically dumped into an emergency underground storage container Containers used for handling vinyl chloride at atmospheric temperature are always under pressure Inhibited vinyl chloride may be stored at normal atmospheric conditions in suitable pressure vessels Uninhibited vinyl chloride may be stored either under refrigeration or at normal atmospheric temperature in the absence of air or sunlight but only for a duration of a few days If stored for longer periods, regular checks must be made to confirm no polymerization has taken place [16] [better source needed]\n\n\nFire and explosion hazard\nIn the U.S., OSHA lists vinyl chloride as a Class IA Flammable Liquid, with a National Fire Protection Association Flammability Rating of 4 Because of its low boiling point, liquid vinyl chloride will undergo flash evaporation (i.e., autorefrigerate) upon its release to atmospheric pressure The portion vaporized will form a dense cloud (more than twice as heavy as the surrounding air) The risk of subsequent explosion or fire is significant According to OSHA, the flash point of vinyl chloride is −78 °C (−108.4 °F) [22] Its flammable limits in air are: lower 3.6 volume% and upper 33.0 volume% The explosive limits are: lower 4.0%, upper 22.05% by volume in air Fire may release toxic hydrogen chloride (HCl) and carbon monoxide (CO) and trace levels of phosgene [23] [24] Vinyl chloride can polymerise rapidly due to heating and under the influence of air, light and contact with a catalyst, strong oxidisers and metals such as copper and aluminium, with fire or explosion hazard As a gas mixed with air, vinyl chloride is a fire and explosion hazard On standing [clarification needed], vinyl chloride can form peroxides, which may then explode Vinyl chloride will react with iron and steel in the presence of moisture [6] [25]\n\n\nHealth effects\nSince it is a gas under most ambient conditions, primary exposure is via inhalation, as opposed to the consumption of contaminated food or water, with occupational hazards being highest Prior to 1974, workers were commonly exposed to 1,000 ppm vinyl chloride, causing \"vinyl chloride illness\" such as acroosteolysis and Raynaud's Phenomenon The symptoms of vinyl chloride exposure are classified by ppm levels in ambient air with 4,000 ppm having a threshold effect [26] The intensity of symptoms varies from acute (1,000–8,000 ppm), including dizziness, nausea, visual disturbances, headache, and ataxia, to chronic (above 12,000 ppm), including narcotic effect, cardiac arrhythmias, and fatal respiratory failure [27] RADS (Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome) may be caused by acute exposure to vinyl chloride [28]\n\n\nLiver toxicity\nThe hepatotoxicity of vinyl chloride has long been established since the 1930s when the PVC industry was just in its early stages In the very first study about the dangers of vinyl chloride, published by Patty in 1930, it was disclosed that exposure of test animals to just a single short-term high dose of vinyl chloride caused liver damage [31] In 1949, a Russian publication discussed the finding that vinyl chloride caused liver injury among workers [32] In 1954, B.F Goodrich Chemical stated that vinyl chloride caused liver injury upon short-term exposures Almost nothing was known about its long-term effects They also recommended long-term animal toxicology studies The study noted that if a chemical did justify the cost of testing, and its ill-effects on workers and the public were known, the chemical should not be made [33] In 1963, research paid for in part by Allied Chemical found liver damage in test animals from exposures below 500 parts per million (ppm) [34] Also in 1963, a Romanian researcher published findings of liver disease in vinyl chloride workers [35] In 1968, Mutchler and Kramer, two Dow researchers, reported their finding that exposures as low as 300 ppm caused liver damage in vinyl chloride workers thus confirming earlier animal data in humans [36] In a 1969 presentation given in Japan, P L Viola, a European researcher working for the European vinyl chloride industry, indicated, \"every monomer used in V.C manufacture is hazardous....various changes were found in bone and liver Particularly, much more attention should be drawn to liver changes The findings in rats at the concentration of 4 to 10 ppm are shown in pictures.\" In light of the finding of liver damage in rats from just 4–10 ppm of vinyl chloride exposure, Viola added that he \"should like some precautions to be taken in the manufacturing plants polymerizing vinyl chloride, such as a reduction of the threshold limit value of monomer.\" [37]\nVinyl chloride was first reported to induce angiosarcoma of the liver in 1974 [38] and further research has demonstrated the carcinogenicity of VC to other organs and at lower concentrations, [39] [40] with evidence now extending to jobs associated with poly(vinyl chloride) exposure, indicating the need for prudent control of PVC dust in the industrial setting [41]\n\n\nCancerous tumors\nAnimals exposed to 30,000 ppm of vinyl chloride developed cancerous tumors Studies on vinyl chloride workers were a \"red flag\" to B.F Goodrich and the industry [44] In 1972, Maltoni, another Italian researcher for the European vinyl chloride industry, found liver tumors (including angiosarcoma) from vinyl chloride exposures as low as 250 ppm for four hours a day [45]\n\n\nEnvironment pollution\nAccording to the U.S EPA, \"vinyl chloride emissions from poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), ethylene dichloride (EDC), and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver.\" [48] EPA's 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for vinyl chloride in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA's previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that \"because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies  [...] and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible cancer induction in other tissues.\" [49]\n\n\nMechanism\nThe carcinogenicity of VC is attributed to the action of two metabolites, chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde  The former is produced by the action of cytochrome P-450 on VC  Both chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde are alkylating agents.\n\n\nMicrobial remediation\nThe bacteria species Nitrosomonas europaea can degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride [50]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAdditional references for environmental pollution\n\n\nInline citations\n\n\nFurther

not toxic [2]\n\n\nProduction\nGlobally, approximately 40 million tonnes of PVC resin are produced per year, [10] requiring a corresponding amount of vinyl chloride monomer [11]\n\n\nHistory\nVinyl chloride was first synthesized in 1835 by Justus von Liebig and his student Henri Victor Regnault They obtained it by treating 1,2-dichloroethane with a solution of potassium hydroxide in ethanol [12]\n\n\nAcetylene-based routes\nIn 1912, Fritz Klatte, a German chemist working for Griesheim-Elektron, patented a means to produce vinyl chloride from acetylene and hydrogen chloride using mercuric chloride as a catalyst Acetylene reacts with hydrogen chloride over a mercuric chloride catalyst to give vinyl chloride:\n\n\nEthylene-based routes\nIn the United States and Europe, mercury-catalyzed routes widely used in the 20th century have been superseded by more economical and greener processes based on ethylene  Ethylene is made by cracking ethane Two steps are involved, chlorination and dehydrochlorination:\n\n\nPossible routes from ethane\nNumerous attempts have been made to convert ethane directly to vinyl chloride [2] Ethane, which is even more readily available than ethylene, is a potential precursor to vinyl chloride The conversion of ethane to vinyl chloride has been demonstrated by various routes: [2]\n\n\nThermal decomposition of dichloroethane\n1,2-Dichloroethane, ClCH2CH2Cl (also known as ethylene dichloride, EDC), can be prepared by halogenation of ethane or ethylene, inexpensive starting materials EDC thermally converts into vinyl chloride and anhydrous HCl This production method has become the major route to vinyl chloride since the late 1950s [2]\n\n\nStorage and transportation\nVinyl chloride is stored as a liquid The accepted upper limit of safety as a health hazard is 500 ppm Often, the storage containers for the product vinyl chloride are high capacity spheres The spheres have an inside sphere and an outside sphere Several inches of space separate the inside sphere from the outside sphere The interstitial space between the spheres is purged with an inert gas such as nitrogen As the nitrogen purge gas exits the interstitial space it passes through an analyzer that detects whether any vinyl chloride is leaking from the internal sphere If vinyl chloride starts to leak from the internal sphere or if a fire is detected on the outside of the sphere then the contents of the sphere are automatically dumped into an emergency underground storage container Containers used for handling vinyl chloride at atmospheric temperature are always under pressure Inhibited vinyl chloride may be stored at normal atmospheric conditions in suitable pressure vessels Uninhibited vinyl chloride may be stored either under refrigeration or at normal atmospheric temperature in the absence of air or sunlight but only for a duration of a few days If stored for longer periods, regular checks must be made to confirm no polymerization has taken place [16] [better source needed]\n\n\nFire and explosion hazard\nIn the U.S., OSHA lists vinyl chloride as a Class IA Flammable Liquid, with a National Fire Protection Association Flammability Rating of 4 Because of its low boiling point, liquid vinyl chloride will undergo flash evaporation (i.e., autorefrigerate) upon its release to atmospheric pressure The portion vaporized will form a dense cloud (more than twice as heavy as the surrounding air) The risk of subsequent explosion or fire is significant According to OSHA, the flash point of vinyl chloride is −78 °C (−108.4 °F) [22] Its flammable limits in air are: lower 3.6 volume% and upper 33.0 volume% The explosive limits are: lower 4.0%, upper 22.05% by volume in air Fire may release toxic hydrogen chloride (HCl) and carbon monoxide (CO) and trace levels of phosgene [23] [24] Vinyl chloride can polymerise rapidly due to heating and under the influence of air, light and contact with a catalyst, strong oxidisers and metals such as copper and aluminium, with fire or explosion hazard As a gas mixed with air, vinyl chloride is a fire and explosion hazard On standing [clarification needed], vinyl chloride can form peroxides, which may then explode Vinyl chloride will react with iron and steel in the presence of moisture [6] [25]\n\n\nHealth effects\nSince it is a gas under most ambient conditions, primary exposure is via inhalation, as opposed to the consumption of contaminated food or water, with occupational hazards being highest Prior to 1974, workers were commonly exposed to 1,000 ppm vinyl chloride, causing \"vinyl chloride illness\" such as acroosteolysis and Raynaud's Phenomenon The symptoms of vinyl chloride exposure are classified by ppm levels in ambient air with 4,000 ppm having a threshold effect [26] The intensity of symptoms varies from acute (1,000–8,000 ppm), including dizziness, nausea, visual disturbances, headache, and ataxia, to chronic (above 12,000 ppm), including narcotic effect, cardiac arrhythmias, and fatal respiratory failure [27] RADS (Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome) may be caused by acute exposure to vinyl chloride [28]\n\n\nLiver toxicity\nThe hepatotoxicity of vinyl chloride has long been established since the 1930s when the PVC industry was just in its early stages In the very first study about the dangers of vinyl chloride, published by Patty in 1930, it was disclosed that exposure of test animals to just a single short-term high dose of vinyl chloride caused liver damage [31] In 1949, a Russian publication discussed the finding that vinyl chloride caused liver injury among workers [32] In 1954, B.F Goodrich Chemical stated that vinyl chloride caused liver injury upon short-term exposures Almost nothing was known about its long-term effects They also recommended long-term animal toxicology studies The study noted that if a chemical did justify the cost of testing, and its ill-effects on workers and the public were known, the chemical should not be made [33] In 1963, research paid for in part by Allied Chemical found liver damage in test animals from exposures below 500 parts per million (ppm) [34] Also in 1963, a Romanian researcher published findings of liver disease in vinyl chloride workers [35] In 1968, Mutchler and Kramer, two Dow researchers, reported their finding that exposures as low as 300 ppm caused liver damage in vinyl chloride workers thus confirming earlier animal data in humans [36] In a 1969 presentation given in Japan, P L Viola, a European researcher working for the European vinyl chloride industry, indicated, \"every monomer used in V.C manufacture is hazardous....various changes were found in bone and liver Particularly, much more attention should be drawn to liver changes The findings in rats at the concentration of 4 to 10 ppm are shown in pictures.\" In light of the finding of liver damage in rats from just 4–10 ppm of vinyl chloride exposure, Viola added that he \"should like some precautions to be taken in the manufacturing plants polymerizing vinyl chloride, such as a reduction of the threshold limit value of monomer.\" [37]\nVinyl chloride was first reported to induce angiosarcoma of the liver in 1974 [38] and further research has demonstrated the carcinogenicity of VC to other organs and at lower concentrations, [39] [40] with evidence now extending to jobs associated with poly(vinyl chloride) exposure, indicating the need for prudent control of PVC dust in the industrial setting [41]\n\n\nCancerous tumors\nAnimals exposed to 30,000 ppm of vinyl chloride developed cancerous tumors Studies on vinyl chloride workers were a \"red flag\" to B.F Goodrich and the industry [44] In 1972, Maltoni, another Italian researcher for the European vinyl chloride industry, found liver tumors (including angiosarcoma) from vinyl chloride exposures as low as 250 ppm for four hours a day [45]\n\n\nEnvironment pollution\nAccording to the U.S EPA, \"vinyl chloride emissions from poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), ethylene dichloride (EDC), and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver.\" [48] EPA's 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for vinyl chloride in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA's previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that \"because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies  [...] and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible cancer induction in other tissues.\" [49]\n\n\nMechanism\nThe carcinogenicity of VC is attributed to the action of two metabolites, chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde  The former is produced by the action of cytochrome P-450 on VC  Both chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde are alkylating agents.\n\n\nMicrobial remediation\nThe bacteria species Nitrosomonas europaea can degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride [50]\n\n\nSee

Born on June 24, 1936, in the Manhattan borough of New York City, Downey Sr. was a product of the vibrant and eclectic cultural landscape of 1960s America. His life's work was a testament to his boundless creativity, irreverent spirit, and commitment to challenging the status quo.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nRobert John Elias Jr. was born to Elizabeth \"Betty\" McLauchlen, a model and magazine editor, and Robert John Elias Sr., who worked in management of motels and restaurants. His paternal grandparents were Lithuanian Jews, while his mother was of half Hungarian Jewish and half Irish ancestry. Downey Sr. grew up in Rockville Centre, New York, a suburban community that would later serve as the backdrop for some of his most iconic films.\n\nAs a young man, Downey Sr. changed his surname to Downey after his stepfather, reportedly to enlist in the United States Army while being underage. During his time in the military, he claimed to have written an unpublished novel, although he spent much of his career \"in the stockade.\" This early experience would later influence his approach to filmmaking, as he drew upon his own experiences as an outsider to create characters and stories that pushed boundaries and defied conventions.\n\n**Career**\n\nDowney Sr.'s career as a filmmaker began in the 1960s, during a time of great social and cultural upheaval in America. His early works were characterized by their independence, low budgets, and absurdist sensibilities, aligning him with the counterculture movement of the era. His films often featured nonconformist protagonists, subverting the conventions of mainstream cinema and challenging the status quo.\n\nOne of Downey Sr.'s most notable films from this period is \"Putney Swope\" (1969), a satirical comedy that deconstructs the advertising industry and critiques the commercialization of society. The film's success marked a turning point in Downey Sr.'s career, as it established him as a major figure in the underground film movement.\n\nIn the 1970s, Downey Sr. continued to push the boundaries of his work, experimenting with new formats and styles. His films from this period, such as \"Chafed Elbows\" (1973) and \"Babo 73\" (1973), showcased his innovative approach to storytelling and his willingness to take risks.\n\nThroughout his career, Downey Sr. remained committed to his artistic vision, even in the face of commercial failure or critical rejection. His dedication to his craft earned him a loyal following among fans and fellow artists, who recognized the value of his unique perspective and creative contributions.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nDowney Sr. was married three times, each union yielding a remarkable individual who would go on to make their own mark on the world. His first marriage was to actress Elsie Ann Ford, with whom he had two children: actress-writer Allyson and actor Robert Jr. The marriage ended in divorce in 1975.\n\nIn 1978, Downey Sr. married actress-writer Laura Ernst, who would become his partner for over 15 years. The couple had a loving relationship, and Ernst brought her own creative energy to Downey Sr.'s work. Tragically, Ernst passed away in 1994, at the age of 47, due to complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nIn 1998, Downey Sr. married his third wife, Rosemary Rogers, a humorist and co-author of several books. The couple settled in New York City, where they lived a quiet life surrounded by art, literature, and music.\n\nOn July 7, 2021, Downey Sr. passed away in his sleep at his home in Manhattan, just 13 days after his 85th birthday. His death was a testament to his enduring legacy, as friends, family, and fans mourned the loss of a creative genius who had left an indelible mark on the world of cinema.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nDowney Sr.'s contributions to film have been recognized and celebrated by critics, scholars, and artists. In 2022, a documentary film simply called \"Sr.\" was released, showcasing the life and work of Downey Sr. through the eyes of his son and fellow filmmaker, Robert Downey Jr. The film won the National Board of Review Award for Best Documentary Feature, a testament to the enduring impact of Downey Sr.'s art and legacy.\n\nIn addition to his films, Downey Sr.'s influence can be seen in the work of countless artists, writers, and directors who have been inspired by his innovative approach to storytelling and his commitment to challenging the status quo. His legacy serves as a reminder of the power of art to inspire, challenge, and transform, and his films continue to captivate audiences and inspire new generations of artists and creatives.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n**Film**\n\n* \"Baboon\" (1966)\n* \"Chafed Elbows\" (1973)\n* \"Babo 73\" (1973)\n* \"Putney Swope\" (1969)\n* \"No More Excuses\" (1975)\n* \"Taos Tonight\" (1975)\n\n**Filmmaking Credits**\n\n* \"Baboon\" (1966) - writer, director\n* \"Chafed Elbows\" (1973) - writer, director\n* \"Babo 73\" (1973) - writer, director\n* \"Putney Swope\" (1969) - writer, director\n* \"No More Excuses\" (1975) - writer, director\n* \"Taos Tonight\" (1975) - writer, director\n\n**Acting Credits**\n\n* \"Baboon\" (1966) - actor\n* \"Chafed Elbows\" (1973) - actor\n* \"Babo 73\" (1973) - actor\n* \"Putney Swope\" (1969) - actor\n* \"No More Excuses\" (1975) - actor\n* \"Taos Tonight\" (1975) - actor\n\n**Television**\n\n* \"The Mike Douglas Show\" (1973) - guest\n* \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" (1973) - guest\n* \"Late Night with David Letterman\" (1982) - guest\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Robert Downey Sr.\" (2022) - documentary film\n* \"The Criterion Collection\" (2022) - film catalog\n* \"The National Film Registry\" (2022) - film catalog\n* \"The National Board of Review\" (2022) - film awards\n\n**External Links**\n\n* \"Robert Downey Sr.\" - IMDb\n* \"Robert Downey Sr.\" - Wikipedia\n* \"The Criterion Collection\" - official website\n* \"The National Film Registry\" - official website\n* \"The National Board of Review\" - official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Robert_Downey_Sr.\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nRobert John Downey Sr was born Robert John Elias Jr in the Manhattan borough of New York City, on June 24, 1936 [3] He was the son of Elizabeth \"Betty\" McLauchlen, a model and magazine editor, and Robert John Elias Sr., who worked in management of motels and restaurants [3] His paternal grandparents were Lithuanian Jews, [4] while his mother was of half Hungarian Jewish and half Irish ancestry [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] He grew up in Rockville Centre, New York [10] He changed his surname to Downey after his stepfather, when he wanted to enlist in the United States Army while being underage [11] [9] Downey later said he wrote an unpublished novel during his time in the army, though he spent much of his military career \"in the stockade\" [10]\n\n\nCareer\nDowney initially made his mark creating very low-budget independent films aligning with the absurdist movement, in line with counterculture, anti-establishment, 1960s America His work in the late 1960s and 1970s was quintessential anti-establishment, reflecting the nonconformity popularized by larger counterculture movements and given impetus by new freedoms in films, such as the breakdown of film censorship codes In keeping with the underground tradition, his 1970s films were independently made on shoestring budgets and were relatively obscure in the Absurdist movement, finding cult notoriety [12]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nDowney was married three times His first marriage was to actress Elsie Ann Ford (1934–2014) in 1962, with whom he had two children: actress-writer Allyson (b 1963) and actor Robert Jr (b 1965) The marriage ended in divorce in 1975 His second marriage, to actress-writer Laura Ernst, lasted until her death on January 27, 1994, from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [10] In 1998, he married his third wife, Rosemary Rogers, humorist and co-author of Saints Preserve Us! and other books They lived in New York City [20] Downey died of complications from Parkinson's disease in his sleep at his home in Manhattan, on July 7, 2021, thirteen days after his 85th birthday [10] [21] [22]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe Criterion Collection released five of his films (the National Film Registry inductee Putney Swope, Babo 73, Chafed Elbows, No More Excuses and Taos Tonight) as part of the Eclipse Series [23] A 2022 documentary film simply called \"Sr.\" was made by Chris Smith of American Movie fame and was produced by his son It won the National Board of Review Award for Best Documentary Feature [24]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nFilmmaking credits\n\n\nActing credits\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is currently the head coach at the University of Tennessee. Heupel has a rich coaching and playing background, with experience at various levels of the sport. His coaching tenure spans over two decades, with stints as a graduate assistant, tight ends coach, and head coach at several institutions.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJosh Heupel was born and raised in Aberdeen, South Dakota. His mother, Cindy, was a high school principal, and his father, Ken, was a head football coach at Northern State University. Growing up, Heupel was surrounded by the sport, and his father would often watch game film with him. This exposure had a significant impact on Heupel's development as a player and coach.\n\n**College Career**\n\nHeupel began his collegiate playing career at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah. He redshirted in 1996 and saw action in four games as a freshman in 1997. However, his playing career was cut short due to an ACL injury during spring practice in 1998. This setback pushed him down the team's depth chart. Heupel then transferred to Snow College in Ephraim, Utah, where he beat out Fred Salanoa as the team's starting quarterback. Heupel's performance at Snow College was impressive, passing for 2,308 yards and 28 touchdowns despite sharing playing time with Salanoa. He later held a scholarship offer from Utah State University but committed to the University of Oklahoma after meeting with Bob Stoops, the new head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nHeupel was drafted in the sixth round with the 177th overall pick in the 2001 NFL draft by the Miami Dolphins. However, his professional playing career was compromised by shoulder tendinitis of his throwing arm. As a result, he was relegated to fourth string for the entire preseason and failed to make the team.\n\n**Coaching Career**\n\nHeupel's coaching career began as a graduate assistant at Oklahoma under head coach Bob Stoops in 2004. In 2005, he was hired as the tight ends coach at the University of Arizona by newly appointed head coach Mike Stoops, Bob's brother and an Oklahoma assistant coach during Heupel's playing days. This marked the beginning of Heupel's tenure as a coach, and he would go on to have a successful coaching career.\n\n**Assistant Coaching**\n\nHeupel spent several years as an assistant coach, working under various head coaches at different institutions. His experience as a tight ends coach at Arizona and as a graduate assistant at Oklahoma laid the foundation for his future success as a head coach. Heupel's ability to learn from his mentors and apply their teachings to his own coaching style was instrumental in his development as a coach.\n\n**UCF**\n\nHeupel was named head coach of the UCF Knights on December 5, 2017, replacing the departing Scott Frost. In his first season, Heupel led the Knights to a 12-1 record and an American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game victory. The Knights appeared in the Fiesta Bowl, where they lost to LSU 40-32.\n\n**Tennessee**\n\nHeupel was named the 27th head coach at Tennessee on January 27, 2021. In his first season with the Volunteers, Heupel led the team to a Music City Bowl appearance and a final record of 7-6 (4-4 in conference). Heupel won the Steve Spurrier first-year head coach award for the second time, sharing the 2021 award with Shane Beamer.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nHeupel and his wife, Dawn, have a son and a daughter.

He is the brother of fellow poker player Adam Bilzerian and is of half Armenian descent through his father.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nDaniel Brandon Bilzerian was born on December 7, 1980, in Tampa, Florida.

This recognition further solidified his status as a social media personality and helped to expand his fan base.\n\nHowever, Bilzerian's career was not without controversy.

Kennedy, and the creation of the \"transgender nonsense.\" He has also stated that Nazi Germany \"flourished\" when \"Hitler removed Jews from the banking system\" and that Spain's golden age began because it expelled the Jews at the end of the Reconquista in 1492.\n\nThese statements have been widely condemned as anti-Semitic and have led to calls for Bilzerian to be banned from social media platforms and to be stripped of his Armenian citizenship.\n\n**Legal Issues**\n\nBilzerian has been involved in several high-profile lawsuits throughout his career. In 2014, he sued the producers of the film Lone Survivor, alleging that he had been defrauded out of his investment in the film.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed that Bilzerian had invested $1 million in the film in exchange for at least eight minutes of screen time and 80 words of dialogue, but his role was later reduced to less than one minute and just one line.

{"title": "COVID-19", "content": "\nNomenclature\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", [28] [29] [30] with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\" [31] [32] In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, [33] Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus [34] In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV [35] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease [36] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma [37] [38] [39] The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with COVID-19 being shorthand for \"coronavirus disease 2019\" [40] [41] The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications [40] [42]\n\n\nSymptoms and signs\n\n\n\nComplications\nComplications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death [66] [67] [68] [69] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), heart inflammation, thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism, [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] and endothelial cell injury and dysfunction [76] Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury [77] [78]\n\n\nCause\nCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) [87]\n\n\nTransmission\n\nCOVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing [88] [89] [90] [91] Transmission is more likely the closer people are However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors [88] [92]\n\n\nVirology\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan [103] All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature, [104] particularly in Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats) [105]\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 variants\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages [113] [114] The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that they \"will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences\" [115] Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR) [116] The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage [114] [117]\n\n\nPathophysiology\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs) [127] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs [128] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell [129]\n\n\nRespiratory tract\nFollowing viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways [130]  Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung [131]\n\n\nNervous system\nOne common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons [134] The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications [135] It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues The virus is not detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed [136] While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain [137] [138] [139] The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood–brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell [136]\n\n\nGastrointestinal tract\nThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium [145] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine [146]\n\n\nCardiovascular system\nThe virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system [147] [148] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, [149] and is more frequent in severe disease [150] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart [148] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function [148] [151]\n\n\nKidneys\nAnother common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys [153] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalised patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems [158]\n\n\nImmunopathology\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL‑2, IL‑6, IL‑7, as well as the following suggest an underlying immunopathology: [149]\n\n\nViral and host factors\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors It includes two subunits: S1 and S2.\n\n\nVirus proteins\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors It includes two subunits: S1 and S2.\n\n\nHost factors\nHuman angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-CoV-2 virus targets causing COVID‑19 Theoretically, the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID‑19, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB; however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain [166]\n\n\nHost cytokine response\nThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm [170] Levels of interleukin 1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease [171]\n\n\nPregnancy response\nThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic Given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures [173]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions [27] [176] Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection [177] Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection [27]\n\n\nViral testing\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, [27] [178] which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments [179] As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited\" [180] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used [181] [182] Results are generally available within hours [27] The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease [183]\n\n\nImaging\nChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening [177] [189] Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection [177] [190] Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses [177] [191] Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions [192]\n\n\nCoding\nIn late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection [194]\n\n\nPathology\nThe main pathological findings at autopsy are:\n\n\nPrevention\nPreventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, [200] washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands [201] [202]\n\n\nVaccine\n\n\n\nFace masks and respiratory hygiene\n\n\n\nIndoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spaces\nThe CDC states that avoiding crowded indoor spaces reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection [240] When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission [240] [241] The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols [242] [243] [244]\n\n\nHand-washing and hygiene\nThorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required [246] The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose [247] When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol [248] For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is \"not an active substance for hand antisepsis\" Glycerol is added as a humectant [249]\n\n\nSocial distancing\nSocial distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others [250]\n\n\nSurface cleaning\nAfter being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection [253] Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑19, [254] [255] [256] leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes [257] [258] Deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticised as hygiene theatre, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air [259] [260]\n\n\nSelf-isolation\nSelf-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID‑19 and those who suspect they have been infected Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation [267] Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups [268] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure [269]\n\n\nInternational travel-related control measures\nA 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID‑19 [270] Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases [270] While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening [270]\n\n\nTreatment\n\nThe treatment and management of COVID-19 combines both supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support as needed, [271] [272] [273] and a growing list of approved medications Highly effective vaccines have reduced mortality related to SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important [274]  Some people may experience persistent symptoms or disability after recovery from the infection, known as long COVID, but there is still limited information on the best management and rehabilitation for this condition [275]\n\n\nPrognosis and risk factors\nThe severity of COVID‑19 varies The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation [299] Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks [109] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death [300] Abnormal sodium levels during hospitalisation with COVID-19 are associated with poor prognoses: high sodium with a greater risk of death, and low sodium with an increased chance of needing ventilator support [301] [302] Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID‑19 and with a transfer to ICU [303] [304]\n\n\nGenetic risk factors\nGenetics plays an important role in the ability to fight off Covid [325] For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID‑19 [326] [327] Genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes [328] Some genetic variants are risk factors in specific populations For instance, an allele of the DOCK2 gene (dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene) is a common risk factor in Asian populations but much less common in Europe The mutation leads to lower expression of DOCK2 especially in younger patients with severe Covid [329] In fact, many other genes and genetic variants have been found that determine the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections [330]\n\n\nChildren\nWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole [331] [332] Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults [333] The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of hospitalised children were admitted to the ICU, [334] while a European multinational study of hospitalised children from June 2020, found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care [335] Four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died, but the actual mortality rate may be \"substantially lower\" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study [336] [337]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nAround 10% to 30% of non-hospitalised people with COVID-19 go on to develop long COVID For those that do need hospitalisation, the incidence of long-term effects is over 50% [21] Long COVID is an often severe multisystem disease with a large set of symptoms There are likely various, possibly coinciding, causes [21] Organ damage from the acute infection can explain a part of the symptoms, but long COVID is also observed in people where organ damage seems to be absent [338]\n\n\nImmunity\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, [344] just as with most other infections [345] B cells interact with T cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell, partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen [346] Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease [347] The presence of neutralising antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralising antibody declines with time Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralising antibody two months after infection In another study, the level of neutralising antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2 Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms [347]\n\n\nMortality\nSeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality [350] These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health [351]\n\n\nCase fatality rate\nThe case fatality rate (CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 1.02% (6,881,955/676,609,955) as of 10 March 2023 [356] The number varies by region [357] [351]\n\n\nInfection fatality rate\nA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk [360] [361] [362] This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases [363]\n\n\nEstimates\nA December 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations (including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in other locations (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and exceeded 2% in Italy [364] That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85 [364] These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the WHO [365]\n\n\nEarlier estimates of IFR\nAt an early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1% [366] [367] On 2 July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6% [368] [369] In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1% [370] Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate (After sufficient time however, people can get reinfected) [371] As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID‑19 (0.3% of the population) [372] Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ≈0.9%, [373] and ≈1.4% [374] In Bergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died [375] In September 2020, the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported preliminary estimates of age-specific IFRs for public health planning purposes [376]\n\n\nSex differences\nCOVID‑19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries However, in a few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men [355] Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to the ICU and more likely to die [378] [379] One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID‑19 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43–56.58) [380]\n\n\nEthnic differences\nIn the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups [388] Structural factors that prevent them from practising social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in \"essential\" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care of underlying conditions such as diabetes, [389] hypertension, and heart disease also increase their risk of death [390] Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities [388] On the one hand, in the Dominican Republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality In this Latin American territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects Dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of Haitian descent [391] According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults [392] The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water [392]\n\n\nComorbidities\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19 [355] Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, [389] and cardiovascular disease [398] According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions [399] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases [300] According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), ischaemic heart disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of deaths).\n\n\nHistory\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection [104] [405] [406] A joint-study conducted in early 2021 by the People's Republic of China and the World Health Organization indicated that the virus descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and likely spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host [407] There are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing [408] According to articles published in July 2022 in Science, virus transmission into humans occurred through two spillover events in November 2019 and was likely due to live wildlife trade on the Huanan wet market in the city of Wuhan (Hubei, China) [409] [410] [411] Doubts about the conclusions have mostly centered on the precise site of spillover [412] Earlier phylogenetics estimated that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019 [413] [414] [415] A phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating in Guangdong before Wuhan [416]\n\n\nMisinformation\nAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online [466] [467] [468]\n\n\nOther species\nHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, [470] [471] a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis [472] [473]\n\n\nResearch\nInternational research on vaccines and medicines in COVID‑19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers [478] [479] The CDC has classified it to require a BSL3 grade laboratory [480] There has been a great deal of COVID‑19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand [481]\n\n\nTransmission and prevention research\nModelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission, [484] diagnosis and prognosis of infection, [485] estimation of the impact of interventions, [486] [487] or allocation of resources [488] Modelling studies are mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology, [489] estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID‑19 pandemic including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of COVID‑19, [490] retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure, [491] mobility-data based models to investigate transmission, [492] or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic [493]\n\n\nTreatment-related research\nRepurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments [494] [495] Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [495]\n\n\nCytokine storm\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19 A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure [515] Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm [516]\n\n\nPassive antibodies\nTransferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID‑19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation [525] [526] Viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2 The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralising antibodies [527] As of 8 August 2020, eight neutralising antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies [528] It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections [527] Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible [525] Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development [525]\n\n\nBioethics\nSince the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic, scholars have explored the bioethics, normative economics, and political theories of healthcare policies related to the public health crisis [529] Academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators, [530] and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies [531] [532] The socio-economic inequalities between genders, [533] races, [534] groups with disabilities, [535] communities, [536] regions, countries, [537] and continents have also drawn attention in academia and the general public [538] [539]\n\n\nSee

"**COVID-19**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally, causing widespread illness and death. The disease is named after the year it was first detected and the fact that it is a coronavirus.\n\n**Nomenclature**\n\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus.\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nThe symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe and may include fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, and sore throat. Some people may experience more severe symptoms, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure.\n\n**Complications**\n\nComplications of COVID-19 may include pneumonia, ARDS, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism, and endothelial cell injury and dysfunction.\n\n**Cause**\n\nCOVID-19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n**Transmission**\n\nCOVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus. Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing. Transmission is more likely the closer people are, but infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.\n\n**Virology**\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.\n\n**SARS-CoV-2 Variants**\n\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions, and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain, and Pango.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID-19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).\n\n**Respiratory Tract**\n\nFollowing viral entry, COVID-19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.\n\n**Nervous System**\n\nOne common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons. The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID-19 has been reported in many medical publications.\n\n**Gastrointestinal Tract**\n\nThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs, as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelium, as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n\n**Cardiovascular System**\n\nThe virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n**Kidneys**\n\nAnother common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys. Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.\n\n**Immunopathology**\n\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, as well as the following suggest an underlying immunopathology.\n\n**Viral and Host Factors**\n\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors. It includes two subunits: S1 and S2.\n\n**Host Factors**\n\nHuman angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-CoV-2 virus targets causing COVID-19. Theoretically, the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID-19.\n\n**Host Cytokine Response**\n\nThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm. Levels of interleukin 1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity.\n\n**Pregnancy Response**\n\nThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nCOVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions. Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.\n\n**Viral Testing**\n\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\"\n\n**Imaging**\n\nChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening. Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPreventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\n\n**Vaccine**\n\nSeveral vaccines have been developed to prevent COVID-19. They work by introducing a piece of the virus's genetic material into the body, which triggers an immune response and helps the body to recognize and fight the virus.\n\n**Face Masks and Respiratory Hygiene**\n\nThorough face mask use is recommended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, good hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and regular disinfection of surfaces are important measures to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n**Indoor Ventilation and Avoiding Crowded Indoor Spaces**\n\nThe CDC states that avoiding crowded indoor spaces reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection. When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air, and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission.\n\n**Hand-Washing and Hygiene**\n\nThorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required. The WHO recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after blowing one's nose.\n\n**Social Distancing**\n\nSocial distancing includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.\n\n**Surface Cleaning**\n\nAfter being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days. Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID-19.\n\n**Self-Isolation**\n\nSelf-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations.\n\n**International Travel-Related Control Measures**\n\nA Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID-19.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment and management of COVID-19 combines both supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support as needed, and a growing list of approved medications.\n\n**Prognosis and Risk Factors**\n\nThe severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.\n\n**Genetic Risk Factors**\n\nGenetics plays an important role in the ability to fight off COVID-19. Most of those who die of COVID-19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.\n\n**Children**\n\nWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole. Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults.\n\n**Long-Term Effects**\n\nAround 10% to 30% of non-hospitalized people with COVID-19 go on to develop long COVID. For those that do need hospitalization, the incidence of long-term effects is over 50%.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production. Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease.\n\n**Mortality**\n\nSeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality. The case fatality rate (CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.\n\n**Case Fatality Rate**\n\nThe global death-to-case ratio is 1.02% as of 10 March 2023. The number varies by region.\n\n**Infection Fatality Rate**\n\nA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID-19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk.\n\n**Estimates**\n\nA December 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations.\n\n**Sex Differences**\n\nCOVID-19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries.\n\n**Ethnic Differences**\n\nIn the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups.\n\n**Comorbidities**\n\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behavior (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID-19.\n\n**History**\n\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection.\n\n**Research**\n\nInternational research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 is underway by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.\n\n**Transmission and Prevention Research**\n\nModelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission, diagnosis and prognosis of infection, estimation of the impact of interventions, or allocation of resources.\n\n**Treatment-Related Research**\n\nRepurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID-19 treatments.\n\n**Cytokine Storm**\n\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.\n\n**Passive Antibodies**\n\nTransferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.\n\n**Bioethics**\n\nSince the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, scholars have explored the bioethics, normative economics, and political theories of healthcare policies related to the public health crisis.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"COVID-19\" following this outline:\n\n\nNomenclature\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", [28] [29] [30] with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\" [31] [32] In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, [33] Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus [34] In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV [35] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease [36] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma [37] [38] [39] The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with COVID-19 being shorthand for \"coronavirus disease 2019\" [40] [41] The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications [40] [42]\n\n\nSymptoms and signs\n\n\n\nComplications\nComplications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death [66] [67] [68] [69] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), heart inflammation, thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism, [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] and endothelial cell injury and dysfunction [76] Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury [77] [78]\n\n\nCause\nCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) [87]\n\n\nTransmission\n\nCOVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing [88] [89] [90] [91] Transmission is more likely the closer people are However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors [88] [92]\n\n\nVirology\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan [103] All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature, [104] particularly in Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats) [105]\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 variants\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages [113] [114] The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that they \"will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences\" [115] Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR) [116] The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage [114] [117]\n\n\nPathophysiology\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs) [127] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs [128] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell [129]\n\n\nRespiratory tract\nFollowing viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways [130]  Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung [131]\n\n\nNervous system\nOne common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons [134] The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications [135] It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues The virus is not detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed [136] While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain [137] [138] [139] The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood–brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell [136]\n\n\nGastrointestinal tract\nThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium [145] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine [146]\n\n\nCardiovascular system\nThe virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system [147] [148] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, [149] and is more frequent in severe disease [150] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart [148] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function [148] [151]\n\n\nKidneys\nAnother common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys [153] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalised patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems [158]\n\n\nImmunopathology\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL‑2, IL‑6, IL‑7, as well as the following suggest an underlying immunopathology: [149]\n\n\nViral and host factors\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-CoV-2 virus targets causing COVID‑19 Theoretically, the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID‑19, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB; however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain [166]\n\n\nHost cytokine response\nThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm [170] Levels of interleukin 1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease [171]\n\n\nPregnancy response\nThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic Given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures [173]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions [27] [176] Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection [177] Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection [27]\n\n\nViral testing\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, [27] [178] which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments [179] As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited\" [180] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used [181] [182] Results are generally available within hours [27] The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease [183]\n\n\nImaging\nChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening [177] [189] Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection [177] [190] Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses [177] [191] Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions [192]\n\n\nCoding\nIn late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection [194]\n\n\nPathology\nThe main pathological findings at autopsy are:\n\n\nPrevention\nPreventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, [200] washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands [201] [202]\n\n\nVaccine\n\n\n\nFace masks and respiratory hygiene\n\n\n\nIndoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spaces\nThe CDC states that avoiding crowded indoor spaces reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection [240] When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission [240] [241] The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols [242] [243] [244]\n\n\nHand-washing and hygiene\nThorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required [246] The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose [247] When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol [248] For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is \"not an active substance for hand antisepsis\" Glycerol is added as a humectant [249]\n\n\nSocial distancing\nSocial distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others [250]\n\n\nSurface cleaning\nAfter being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection [253] Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑19, [254] [255] [256] leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes [257] [258] Deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticised as hygiene theatre, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air [259] [260]\n\n\nSelf-isolation\nSelf-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID‑19 and those who suspect they have been infected Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation [267] Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups [268] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure [269]\n\n\nInternational travel-related control measures\nA 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID‑19 [270] Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases [270] While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening [270]\n\n\nTreatment\n\nThe treatment and management of COVID-19 combines both supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support as needed, [271] [272] [273] and a growing list of approved medications Highly effective vaccines have reduced mortality related to SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important [274]  Some people may experience persistent symptoms or disability after recovery from the infection, known as long COVID, but there is still limited information on the best management and rehabilitation for this condition [275]\n\n\nPrognosis and risk factors\nThe severity of COVID‑19 varies The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation [299] Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks [109] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death [300] Abnormal sodium levels during hospitalisation with COVID-19 are associated with poor prognoses: high sodium with a greater risk of death, and low sodium with an increased chance of needing ventilator support [301] [302] Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID‑19 and with a transfer to ICU [303] [304]\n\n\nGenetic risk factors\nGenetics plays an important role in the ability to fight off Covid [325] For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID‑19 [326] [327] Genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes [328] Some genetic variants are risk factors in specific populations For instance, an allele of the DOCK2 gene (dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene) is a common risk factor in Asian populations but much less common in Europe The mutation leads to lower expression of DOCK2 especially in younger patients with severe Covid [329] In fact, many other genes and genetic variants have been found that determine the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections [330]\n\n\nChildren\nWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole [331] [332] Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults [333] The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of hospitalised children were admitted to the ICU, [334] while a European multinational study of hospitalised children from June 2020, found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care [335] Four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died, but the actual mortality rate may be \"substantially lower\" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study [336] [337]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nAround 10% to 30% of non-hospitalised people with COVID-19 go on to develop long COVID For those that do need hospitalisation, the incidence of long-term effects is over 50% [21] Long COVID is an often severe multisystem disease with a large set of symptoms There are likely various, possibly coinciding, causes [21] Organ damage from the acute infection can explain a part of the symptoms, but long COVID is also observed in people where organ damage seems to be absent [338]\n\n\nImmunity\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, [344] just as with most other infections [345] B cells interact with T cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell, partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen [346] Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease [347] The presence of neutralising antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralising antibody declines with time Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralising antibody two months after infection In another study, the level of neutralising antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2 Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms [347]\n\n\nMortality\nSeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality [350] These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health [351]\n\n\nCase fatality rate\nThe case fatality rate (CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 1.02% (6,881,955/676,609,955) as of 10 March 2023 [356] The number varies by region [357] [351]\n\n\nInfection fatality rate\nA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk [360] [361] [362] This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases [363]\n\n\nEstimates\nA December 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations (including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in other locations (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and exceeded 2% in Italy [364] That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85 [364] These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the WHO [365]\n\n\nEarlier estimates of IFR\nAt an early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1% [366] [367] On 2 July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6% [368] [369] In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1% [370] Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate (After sufficient time however, people can get reinfected) [371] As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID‑19 (0.3% of the population) [372] Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ≈0.9%, [373] and ≈1.4% [374] In Bergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died [375] In September 2020, the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported preliminary estimates of age-specific IFRs for public health planning purposes [376]\n\n\nSex differences\nCOVID‑19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries However, in a few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men [355] Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to the ICU and more likely to die [378] [379] One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID‑19 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43–56.58) [380]\n\n\nEthnic differences\nIn the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups [388] Structural factors that prevent them from practising social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in \"essential\" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care of underlying conditions such as diabetes, [389] hypertension, and heart disease also increase their risk of death [390] Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities [388] On the one hand, in the Dominican Republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality In this Latin American territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects Dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of Haitian descent [391] According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults [392] The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water [392]\n\n\nComorbidities\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19 [355] Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, [389] and cardiovascular disease [398] According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions [399] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases [300] According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), ischaemic heart disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of deaths).\n\n\nHistory\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection [104] [405] [406] A joint-study conducted in early 2021 by the People's Republic of China and the World Health Organization indicated that the virus descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and likely spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host [407] There are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing [408] According to articles published in July 2022 in Science, virus transmission into humans occurred through two spillover events in November 2019 and was likely due to live wildlife trade on the Huanan wet market in the city of Wuhan (Hubei, China) [409] [410] [411] Doubts about the conclusions have mostly centered on the precise site of spillover [412] Earlier phylogenetics estimated that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019 [413] [414] [415] A phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating in Guangdong before Wuhan [416]\n\n\nMisinformation\nAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online [466] [467] [468]\n\n\nOther species\nHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, [470] [471] a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis [472] [473]\n\n\nResearch\nInternational research on vaccines and medicines in COVID‑19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers [478] [479] The CDC has classified it to require a BSL3 grade laboratory [480] There has been a great deal of COVID‑19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand [481]\n\n\nTransmission and prevention research\nModelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission, [484] diagnosis and prognosis of infection, [485] estimation of the impact of interventions, [486] [487] or allocation of resources [488] Modelling studies are mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology, [489] estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID‑19 pandemic including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of COVID‑19, [490] retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure, [491] mobility-data based models to investigate transmission, [492] or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic [493]\n\n\nTreatment-related research\nRepurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments [494] [495] Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [495]\n\n\nCytokine storm\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19 A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure [515] Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm [516]\n\n\nPassive antibodies\nTransferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID‑19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation [525] [526] Viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2 The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralising antibodies [527] As of 8 August 2020, eight neutralising antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies [528] It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections [527] Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible [525] Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development [525]\n\n\nBioethics\nSince the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic, scholars have explored the bioethics, normative economics, and political theories of healthcare policies related to the public health crisis [529] Academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators, [530] and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies [531] [532] The socio-economic inequalities between genders, [533] races, [534] groups with disabilities, [535] communities, [536] regions, countries, [537] and continents have also drawn attention in academia and the general public [538] [539]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nHealth agencies\n\n\nDirectories\n\n\nMedical

His story, marked by bravery, intrigue, and ultimate sacrifice, has become an important chapter in the history of the war.\n\nEarly Life\n----------\n\nTerence Atherton was born in Wavertree, Liverpool, in 1899 to Douglas Harold Atherton and Letitia Elizabeth Haigh. His parents were married in Lindley, North Yorkshire, in 1887. Atherton had three elder siblings, and his paternal ancestors were gentlemen farmers. His maternal grandfather was a solicitor, giving him a strong background in law and order.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nFrom 1919, Atherton worked as a bank clerk for the Bank of Liverpool and Martins. However, his life took a dramatic turn when he enlisted in the Royal Air Force (RAF) on November 27, 1925. As an aircraftman second class (AC2), Atherton would have performed air mechanical duties. He left the service after less than 280 days, but his experience in the RAF would later prove invaluable in his work with the SOE.\n\nAxis Invasion and Escape from Yugoslavia\n----------------------------------------\n\nIn April 1941, Axis forces invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Atherton, along with three American foreign correspondents – Robert St John, Leigh White, and Russell Hill – successfully escaped from Yugoslavia. They traveled a grueling 700-mile journey to Greece, using multiple means of transport. While White remained in hospital in Greece, Atherton and his companions arrived in Alexandria a month later.\n\nPreparations to a Clandestine Return into Axis-Occupied Yugoslavia\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAtherton's service to the Special Operations Executive (SOE) took precedence over his journalism during World War II. There are no records of Atherton returning to the UK. British troops used Egypt as a base for their operations throughout the region. In May 1941, Atherton would have been debriefed by the SOE after safely evacuating to Alexandria.\n\nOperation Hydra\n----------------\n\nOperation Hydra (Yugoslavia) was a failed attempt by the British to develop contact with the Yugoslav Partisans, the leading Communist-led Anti-fascist resistance group, led by Josip Broz Tito, in Montenegro in February 1942. Special Operations Executive agents, including a former junior officer of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, were to be put ashore at Perazića Do, just north of Petrovac, Budva Croatia.\n\nA Partisan Perspective\n----------------------\n\nThe Yugoslav Partisan perceived aim of Operation Hydra was to establish and maintain communication with the Chetnik headquarters, and not establish a relationship with them.\n\nAn Initial Chetnik Perspective\n------------------------------\n\nChetnik sources during World War II emphasized that during Atherton's stay in Foča, he was able to learn that Croatian communists organized cooperation between Partisans and Ustaše, a Croatian fascist and ultranationalist organization. As a result, Partisans had to kill him to prevent him from sending a report about the level of cooperation the Partisans had with Ustaše.\n\nSequence of Events\n------------------\n\nAtherton left Alexandria in Egypt on January 17, 1942, and disembarked off the coast of Montenegro on February 4, 1942. He was accompanied by an Irish radio operator and one officer of the Yugoslav Air Force. Atherton carried a substantial quantity of gold strapped around his waist.\n\nSubsequent SOE Missions\n----------------------\n\nAtherton's friend and former assistant editor at the South Slav Herald in Belgrade, Alexander Simić-Stevens, took part in Operation Fungus, which departed Derna, Libya, in April 1943. Another simultaneous SOE mission, Operation Hoathley 1, took place simultaneously, each mission serving as each other's backup to increase the chances of British success.\n\nTestimonials\n-------------\n\nSome early accounts explained that Atherton was executed by Partisans because they concluded he brought \"undesirable influence\" from Cairo. However, the War Diaries of Vladimir Dedijer indicate that Atherton may have been part of a plot to assassinate Tito.\n\nPost-War Investigation and Release of Records to the General Public\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther investigation into Atherton's untimely death continued in the aftermath of the war. Yugoslav sources indicated the strong likelihood that Atherton was killed by Chetniks. The person who committed the murder remained unknown.\n\nMemorial and Legacy\n-------------------\n\nAtherton is honored and remembered as part of the General Service Corps. His memorial is at the Phaleron War Cemetery in Athens, with his date of death marked as July 15, 1942, although he may have died as early as April 17, 1942. It is unusual that other members of Operation Hydra have not been added to this war memorial.\n\nDramatisation\n--------------\n\nAtherton appears as the main character of the Yugoslav three-part mini-series \"The Mission of Major Atherton,\" directed by Sava Mrmak, where he was played by Slovenian actor Majtaž Višnar.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\nReferences", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Terence_Atherton\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHe was the son of Douglas Harold Atherton (1861-1924) and Letitia Elizabeth Haigh (1861-1933) [5] His parents married in Lindley, North Yorkshire on 24 November 1887 He was born in Wavertree, Liverpool, and had 3 elder siblings [6] [7] His paternal ancestors were gentlemen farmers and his maternal grandfather was a solicitor.\n\n\nCareer\nFrom 1919, Atherton was employed by the Bank of Liverpool and Martins as a bank clerk He enlisted  within the Royal Air Force on 27 November 1925 [7] He joined the service as an aircraftman second class (AC2), and would have performed air mechanical duties He left the service after less than 280 days.\n\n\nAxis invasion and escape from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia\nAtherton successfully escaped from Yugoslavia after the invasion by Axis forces in April 1941, teaming up with 3 American foreign correspondents;
