He first appeared in Detective Comics #596, created by writer Denny O'Neil and artist Dick Giordano.\n\nFictional Character Biography\n\nBrian Durlin is the spoiled heir to an enormous fortune who moves to Gotham City to become a vigilante. He is determined to follow in the footsteps of Batman, but his lack of concern for the well-being of others soon becomes apparent. Batman discourages Durlin from continuing his vigilante activities, warning him that his reckless behavior could put innocent lives at risk.\n\nHowever, Durlin is undeterred and decides to use his wealth and resources to fund a life of crime. He adopts the alias \"Savant\" and begins to use his genius-level intellect to blackmail and manipulate others. He is assisted by Aleksandr Creote, an ex-KGB agent with a talent for hand-to-hand combat.\n\nSavant's motives for becoming a blackmailer are driven by a desire for power and control. He is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals, even if it means putting others in harm's way. His actions are a stark contrast to those of Batman, who is driven by a sense of justice and a desire to protect the innocent.\n\nDespite his questionable morals, Savant is a formidable opponent. He possesses a range of skills that make him a threat to Batman and other heroes in the DC Universe. His genius-level intellect allows him to outwit his opponents and stay one step ahead of the law.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nSavant possesses a range of abilities that make him a formidable opponent. His genius-level intellect allows him to think several steps ahead of his opponents, making him a master strategist. He is also an expert in martial arts, able to use his skills to take down opponents with ease.\n\nIn addition to his physical abilities, Savant is also a skilled computer operator. He is able to use his knowledge of computer systems to hack into secure databases and gain access to sensitive information. His multilingual skills also allow him to communicate with people from all over the world.\n\nHowever, Savant's abilities are not without their drawbacks. He suffers from a neuro-chemical imbalance that causes his memory to be distorted. He often experiences non-linear memory, where events from his past occur out of order. This can make it difficult for him to recall specific events or keep track of time.\n\nDespite this, Savant has learned to use his condition to his advantage. He has developed techniques to manipulate his memories and make it difficult for others to extract information from him. He has even used his condition to resist interrogation, making it appear to last for hours instead of days.\n\nIn other media\n\nSavant has appeared in various forms of media, including comic books, television shows, and video games. He is a relatively minor character in the DC Universe, but his appearances are often notable for their complexity and nuance.\n\nIn the comic book series \"Detective Comics,\" Savant is a recurring villain who is driven by a desire for power and control. He is a formidable opponent for Batman and other heroes, using his intellect and skills to outwit them at every turn.\n\nIn the television show \"Batman: The Animated Series,\" Savant appears in an episode where he is hired by the villainous Riddler to help him commit a crime. However, Savant's condition causes him to become confused and disoriented, making it difficult for him to carry out the plan.\n\nOverall, Savant is a complex and nuanced character in the DC Universe. His abilities and condition make him a formidable opponent, but his motives and actions are often questionable. His appearances in various forms of media have made him a notable character in the DC Universe, and his legacy continues to be felt to this day.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Savant_(DC_Comics)\" following this outline:\n\n\nFictional character biography\nBrian Durlin is the spoiled heir to an enormous fortune who moves to Gotham City to become a vigilante After Batman discourages him because of his lack of care to protect others, Durlin becomes a blackmailer known as Savant He is assisted by ex-KGB agent Aleksandr Creote.\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nSavant possesses genius-level intellect and is an expert at martial arts, computer operation, and multilingualism [citation needed] However, he also exhibits non-linear memory due to a neuro-chemical imbalance, [citation needed] which causes his recollection of events to occur out of order and leaves him with a distorted sense of time While this has allowed him to resist an interrogation attempt, making it appear to last hours instead of days for him, he was left believing it happened five minutes prior and was in constant agony for two years afterward [citation needed]\n\n\nIn other media\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

(The Beauty of Life) that shared pro-Trump views and conspiracy theories such as QAnon At that time, The BL had spent at least $510,698 on Facebook advertising [117] Hundreds of the ads were removed for violations of Facebook's advertising rules By December 2019, the BL network of pages had 28 million Facebook followers, according to Snopes [118]\n\n\nRemoval of TruthMedia from Facebook\nOn August 6, 2020, Facebook removed hundreds of fake accounts by a digital company called TruthMedia that promoted Epoch Times and NTD content and pro-Trump conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and protests in the United States [123] [124] The operation included 303 Facebook accounts, 181 pages, 44 Facebook groups and 31 Instagram accounts, [125] which in total were followed by more than 2 million people [124] Snopes and NBC News reported that TruthMedia had ties to the Epoch Media Group, [126] [124] but Stephen Gregory, publisher of The Epoch Times, denied this [124]\n\n\nSafeChat\nIn March 2021, Politico reported that SafeChat, a social media platform rife with disinformation and conspiracy theories about President Joe Biden that is popular with Trump supporters and Chinese dissidents, was closely linked to The Epoch Times and Falun Gong [127]\n\n\nCensorship by the Chinese government\nIn some cases The Epoch Times operates in a hostile overseas environment, in which \"overseas Chinese media companies choosing to remain independent or publish non-approved content become the targets of an aggressive campaign of elimination or control\" [128] In one instance, Chinese diplomatic officials made threats against media for reporting Falun Gong-related content; in other cases, advertisers and distributors have been threatened for supporting The Epoch Times [129] Communist Party authorities have been accused of resorting to \"militant methods\" against the paper and its staff, including attacking staff and destroying computer equipment [128]\n\n\nWhite House controversies\nIn April 2006, a reporter with temporary Epoch Times press credentials unfurled a protest banner and heckled China's leader Hu Jintao at a summit with President George W Bush, shouting, \"Stop him from killing!\" and \"Evil people will die early\", prompting Chinese officials to refuse to attend a ceremonial lunch in protest [140] [141] The Epoch Times later disassociated itself from the reporter [142]\n\n\nAssessments\nMing Xia, a political science professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, wrote in 2007 that The Epoch Times represents part of Falun Gong's strategic effort to expand to non-practitioners, and \"embed itself into the large civil society for influence and legitimacy\" [37] In 2018, he stated that The Epoch Times staff \"are not professional journalists and do not follow the protocols professional journalists abide by\" [52]\n\n\nLitigation\nThe Epoch Times and its co-founder Dana Cheng sued Maine Beacon reporter Dan Neumann for defamation after Neumann reported on Cheng's promotion of conspiracy theories about the January 6 Capitol attack in June 2021 In October 2022, the paper lost an effort to revive the lawsuit, with the judges finding that the alleged defamatory reporting was substantially true [158]\n\n\nAwards\nIn 2014, the newspaper's reporting won several journalism awards, which The New York Times later described as indicative of The Epoch Times \"edging closer to Mr Li's vision of a respectable news outlet\", before it changed course in 2015 and 2016 to focus on viral content and a \"Trump pivot\"

Maddison then scored from a rebound after Brentford's goalkeeper Luke Daniels failed to hold on to Barnes' shot, giving Leicester City a 3-1 win.\n\n## Background\n\nThis was Chelsea's fifteenth FA Cup Final appearance and their fourth in the last five seasons, having missed out in 2019. However, they won only one of those four, beating Manchester United 1-0 in 2018. They had lost 2020's final to Arsenal. Chelsea had won eight finals, seven of those occurring since 1997. Leicester City appeared in four FA Cup Finals prior to 2021, losing them all; their most recent appearance was in 1969, when they were defeated 1-0 by Manchester City.\n\nIn the clubs' 118 previous meetings, Chelsea won 57, Leicester City won 27, and the remaining 34 were drawn. Leicester City had never beaten Chelsea in their seven previous FA Cup ties, although two had gone to a replay. Their most recent meeting was in the 2020-21 Premier League on 19 January 2021, where Leicester won 2-0 with goals from Wilfred Ndidi and Maddison.\n\n## Pre-match\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, crowds at football matches in England had not exceeded 8,000 since March 2020. The Football Association planned for the FA Cup Final to be part of a pilot scheme to allow fans to attend. The English Football League had delayed the 2021 EFL Cup Final, hoping to admit supporters under the same scheme.\n\n## Ticketing and attendance\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, crowds at football matches in England had not exceeded 8,000 since March 2020.

Chelsea started the match the dominant side, but Antonio Rüdiger's 15th-minute shot from 30 yards went wide of Leicester City's goal. Timothy Castagne then sent in a low cross which Jamie Vardy struck towards the Chelsea goal, but the ball was blocked by Reece James. In the 20th minute, Thiago Silva was adjudged to have handled the ball after Leicester City's Iheanacho tried to get past him. Tielemans' resulting free kick was headed over the Chelsea crossbar by Çağlar Söyüncü from around 6 yards.\n\nMidway through the first half, rain began to heavily fall. Chelsea continued to dominate the match, but Leicester City defended well and prevented Chelsea from scoring. The first half ended 0-0, with both teams creating chances but neither able to break the deadlock.\n\n## Second half\n\nNo substitutions were made during the interval. Chelsea kicked off the second half. Eight minutes in, after Leicester City had dominated, Chelsea's N'Golo Kanté delivered a cross, but Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel easily caught Alonso's weak header. Schmeichel then saved Azpilicueta's shot. In the 63rd minute, Luke Thomas passed to Tielemans, whose strike from distance flew into the top-left corner of Chelsea's goal, giving Leicester City a 1-0 lead. Despite claims from Chelsea that there had been a handball during the build-up, the goal stood. Chelsea's Ziyech then shot, but his strike was deflected out for a corner, which came to nothing.\n\nMidway through the second half, Iheanacho was replaced by Maddison before Chelsea made a double-substitution, with Ziyech and Alonso coming off for Christian Pulisic and Chilwell. With 19 minutes remaining, Mount went down after being tackled by Söyüncü, but Chelsea's claims for a penalty were denied by the referee.\n\n## Details\n\n* Man of the Match: Youri Tielemans (Leicester City)\n* Attendance: 20,000\n* Referee: Craig Pawson\n\n## Post-match\n\nAs President of The Football Association, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, presented the FA Cup to Schmeichel, Leicester City's captain. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the presentation took place on the pitch instead of in the Royal Box. Players and managers of both clubs picked up their own medals. The FA did not punish Leicester players Choudhury and Fofana for parading the flag of Palestine during the post-match celebrations. This was despite it being claimed that such an action was against The FA's rules on political statements.\n\nThe 2021 FA Cup Final was a significant moment in English football history, marking the first time Leicester City had won the competition in their 138-year history. The match was played in front of a restricted attendance due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, but the atmosphere was still electric. The victory marked a major achievement for the Leicester City team and manager Brendan Rodgers, who had led the team to the final in his first season in charge.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2021_FA_Cup_final\" following this outline:\n\n\nRoute to the final\nAs a Premier League team, Chelsea entered the competition in the third round where they played at home at Stamford Bridge against League Two side Morecambe, whom had been affected by a COVID-19 outbreak at the club prior to the match [1] Mason Mount opened the scoring in the 18th minute with a 25-yard (23 m) strike before Timo Werner made it 2–0 to Chelsea before half-time from close range  Callum Hudson-Odoi scored four minutes after the interval and Kai Havertz made it 4–0 after heading in a cross from César Azpilicueta [2] In the fourth round, they played Championship side Luton Town at home  Chelsea were 2–0 ahead inside 17 minutes with two goals from Tammy Abraham  Jordan Clark reduced the deficit, scoring after an error from Kepa Arrizabalaga, but Abraham completed his hat-trick in the 74th minute  Werner missed a late penalty and the match ended 3–1 to Chelsea [3]\n\n\nChelsea\nAs a Premier League team, Chelsea entered the competition in the third round where they played at home at Stamford Bridge against League Two side Morecambe, whom had been affected by a COVID-19 outbreak at the club prior to the match [1] Mason Mount opened the scoring in the 18th minute with a 25-yard (23 m) strike before Timo Werner made it 2–0 to Chelsea before half-time from close range  Callum Hudson-Odoi scored four minutes after the interval and Kai Havertz made it 4–0 after heading in a cross from César Azpilicueta [2] In the fourth round, they played Championship side Luton Town at home  Chelsea were 2–0 ahead inside 17 minutes with two goals from Tammy Abraham  Jordan Clark reduced the deficit, scoring after an error from Kepa Arrizabalaga, but Abraham completed his hat-trick in the 74th minute  Werner missed a late penalty and the match ended 3–1 to Chelsea [3]\n\n\nLeicester City\nAs a Premier League team, Leicester City started in the third round, playing Championship team Stoke City away at the Bet365 Stadium  The home side's Sam Vokes struck his shot over the crossbar before James Justin opened the scoring for Leicester in the 34th minute  Marc Albrighton doubled the lead fourteen minutes into the second half before strikes from Ayoze Pérez and Harvey Barnes secured a 4–0 victory [7] In the fourth round, they played Championship side Brentford at the Brentford Community Stadium  Mads Bech Sørensen put the home side ahead after seven minutes to give them a 1–0 half-time lead  Within a minute of the restart, Cengiz Ünder scored from a James Maddison pass to level the score  Youri Tielemans was then fouled in the Brentford penalty area and scored the resulting penalty to make it 2–1 to Leicester City  Maddison then scored from a rebound after Brentford's goalkeeper Luke Daniels failed to hold on to Barnes' shot, to give Leicester City a 3–1 win [8]\n\n\nBackground\nThis was Chelsea's fifteenth FA Cup Final appearance and their fourth in the last five seasons, having missed out in 2019 However, they won only one of those four, beating Manchester United 1–0 in 2018 They had lost 2020's final to Arsenal [12] Chelsea had won eight finals, seven of those occurred since 1997 Leicester City appeared in four FA Cup Finals prior to 2021, losing them all;

he was of plausible, but unconfirmed, Aromanian origin [2] The Beizadea's grandfather, Logothete Grigorașcu Sturdza, enshrined a legend according to which the family was a branch of the Hungarian Thurzós, and that it ultimately had Dalmatian origins [3] Reportedly, Grigore did not favor this claim, but instead regarded himself as a descendant of Vlad the Impaler [4] His contemporary, the genealogist and polemicist Constantin Sion, lists the Sturdzas as native Moldavians from Putna County [5]\n\n\nOrigins and childhood\nAs reported by scholar Moses Gaster, Grigore's family, the Sturdzas, were \"long and intimately associated with the government first of Moldavia and afterwards of Rumania.\" Their origin, Gaster speculates, was in the Empire of Trebizond, whence they settled Moldavia and Wallachia during the 17th century [1] Other sources indicate that the first known Sturdza actually lived in Moldavia during the mid-16th-century reigns of Alexandru Lăpușneanu;

according to literary historian Radu Cernătescu, this activity was satirized by Vasile Alecsandri in his 1840 play, Farmazonul din Hârlău (\"The Freemason of Hârlău\"), with Beizadea reflected in its main character, Pestriț (\"Mottled\") [41]\n\n\n1848 Revolution\nDespite such acts of generosity, the Beizadea was mostly known for his outstanding cruelty Writer I C Severeanu reports that Sturdza not only kept Romani slaves, but actually shot and killed one of them for oversalting his soup [62] Sion describes the young Sturdza, \"that famous thief\", as \"heartless, cruel, unmerciful, and so very wolfish\" [63] As Ionescu reported, the Beizadea had a plan of taking in his care \"all the estates of Roman County\", to emerge as the \"elephant\" of Moldavian agriculture [64] Sturdza also began holding land to his own name: at Cristești, he used, and sometimes lived in, a giant durmast oak with a view of the Ceahlău Massif [65]\n\n\nCrimean War\nBy the time of the revolution, Beizadea Grigore had focused on his military career, and held a general's rank in the Moldavian militia [1] [89] Building on his personal friendship with Reşid Pasha at the peak of Tanzimat reforms, [90] he transferred to a Colonel's posting in the Ottoman army in 1852 [91] As Muklis Pasha (also Muhlis Basha and other variants), Sturdza was assigned to the Turkish Cossack cavalry in December 1853, [92] some two months into the Crimean War This unit was also set up to include Wallachian revolutionary deportees, to whom the Porte had granted partial amnesty [93] Sturdza fought with distinction in Wallachia, beginning with the Battle of Oltenița; [94] he was then involved in the engagements at Cetate, displaying \"rather insane courage\" as a mounted sniper, who took aim at enemy officers while fired upon by the Russian artillery [95] He also ignored his superiors' orders and, in August 1854, made a trip to Russian-abandoned Bucharest, where he found his wife's home \"almost spared of bullets and robbers.\" [96]\n\n\n1858–1859 election\nSamples of diplomatic correspondence indicate that, in July 1856, the Beizadea had real chances of being appointed Caimacam (regent) of Moldavia, losing only narrowly to Teodor Balș, himself replaced in February 1857 by Bogoridi's son, Nicolae Vogoride [113] In April 1857, at Iași, Sturdza handed the final act on Moldavia's frontier to Vogoride [114] The waning of Russian influence now allowed room for the National Party, which supported a political unification of Moldavia and Wallachia, and their emancipation as an independent country In 1855, this group opened a Masonic Lodge in Iași, which, by 1857, was secretly debating candidacies for the Moldavian throne Grigore Sturdza's support by the great boyar families was seen as an obstacle by the Nationals, who regarded him as a \"Phanariote\"; while the group was adamant that they would never support Sturdza, they remained for a while divided between putting up Alecsandri and Costache Negri as their rival candidates [115]\n\n\nPolish plot and Central Commission\nImmediately after the election, Sturdza Jr and Panu reemerged as Cuza supporters The former raised the idea of a Cuza candidacy in Bucharest \"before anything official had been stated on this issue\" [146] Both he and Panu wrote articles hinting that Cuza should invade Wallachia and seize the throne in Bucharest; Strudza's piece saw print in the National Party mouthpiece, Stéoa Dunărei [147] Cuza's subsequent election in Wallachia effectively federated the two countries, as the \"United Principalities\"; he was crowned Domnitor in both capitals \"Muklis\" went on public record with his praise of the union as \"something worthy of Romania's most glorious times\", asking that both Divans meet for a common session in Focșani [146] More secretly, he began to organize for resistance The National Party's V A Urechia claimed that young Sturdza being furious of his father's interference, which had prevented him from swinging the \"old boyar\" vote He reports that the former Pasha intended to use his Ottoman connections to prevent Cuza from ever gaining international recognition, and also that he was arming \"vagabonds\", ready to \"storm into that Mr Cuza's palace\" [148]\n\n\n\"Monstrous coalition\"\nUnlike other Moldavian delegates on the commission, Sturdza fully supported establishing the national capital in Bucharest; as he put it, Iași lacked was both insufficiently bourgeois and insufficiently Romanian [173] He then stood in the Romanian Assembly of Deputies, representing the right-wing opposition to Cuza's egalitarian policies As noted by Xenopol, he was the \"most progressive\" right-winger, endorsing public schooling, mass recruitment, and the land value tax, as well as an increased salary for the Moldavian Prime Minister, who was by then his nominal rival Kogălniceanu [174] In January 1861, he objected as other conservatives passed a motion of no confidence against Kogălniceanu's administration, arguing that the accusations of corruption brought up against the head of government were unfounded [175] Sturdza's flirtation with liberalism ended when it came to land reform—as the \"landowners' main champion\", [176] from May 1862 he was an outspoken opponent of attempts to dispossess boyars and the gentry at the benefit of peasants [177] He upheld a rival project provided for common land in rural communities, with family allotments of, at most, 15 square kilometers [178] Attempting to solve peasant destitution by other means, he set up his own lands in Iași County to function as model farms, introducing fallow techniques that more than doubled the expected output [179] He continued to live as an aristocrat—in 1861, he dueled with, and killed, Costin Vârnav over a dance-floor scuffle [180]\n\n\n1866 events\nThe political unrest was briefly ended that same month by Cuza's self-coup In August 1865, at a time of mounting discontent, representatives of this regime allegedly raided Sturdza's home in Perieni, \"but without success.\" [200] Cuza's reign was finally brought to an end by the \"monstrous coalition\" counter-coup of February 1866 Over the following months of unrest, Romania (as the Principalities were now formally known) selected Carol of Hohenzollern, a Prussian subject, as their new Domnitor His predecessor's abdication created the terrain for active separatism, which was promoted by Russia's agents in Moldavia An April report in the Transylvanian press had it that \"prince Gregoriu Sturza, under the condition of a foreign prince, has renounced his candidacy, but under other circumstances he will use any means to see himself on the throne.\" [201]\n\n\n\"White\" politico\nIn January 1870 the Beizadea, backed by 65 Assembly deputies, presented a motion to grant Carol a gift of 300 thousand francs As reported by opposition papers, this was in fact a disguised gift for the Domnitor's wife, Elisabeth of Wied [211] In February, the anti-\"Red\" government coalition, headed by Golescu-Negru, reportedly considered reappointing him Prefect of Iași [212] The troubled year 1871 signaled Sturdza's political rise as the leader of an arch-conservative caucus The defeat of conspiratorial \"Reds\" following incidents known as the \"Republic of Ploiești\" was consecrated in the May 1871 election On April 18, Sturdza helped organize the conservative caucus in Iași, which met at his home; it included \"about a hundred people\", with his former enemy Epureanu as their leader Addressing the gathering, the Beizadea outlined a plan for modifying the Constitution to solidify Carol's rule and ensure continuity These ideas were also embraced by Epureanu and Iacob Negruzzi, who also spoke on the occasion—the latter's address was perceived by journalist as an endorsement of absolute monarchy [213]\n\n\nNational-Democratic leader\nSturdza adopted controversial stances during the Romanian War of Independence, which saw Romania aligned with Russia against the Ottomans In order to obtain recognition for its separation from the Ottoman realm, Romania had to consider emancipating its non-Orthodox residents; and enduring controversy focused on the extent of Jewish emancipation Sturdza sided with Conservative Generals Gheorghe Manu and Ion Emanuel Florescu They proposed that naturalization could only be fast-tracked in individual cases, and with an Assembly supermajority [235] Upon the end of the war in 1878, Romanians were faced with a Russian demand to relinquish southern Bessarabia, in exchange for Northern Dobruja Nationalists were generally indignant, and Carol threatened to abdicate during February 1878; as reported by Politische Correspondenz, this suited Russia, which had Sturdza as its favorite candidate for the throne [236] The issue was settled in Romania's detriment by the Treaty of Berlin, which was signed in July 1878 Over the following months, Sturdza was acknowledged as a proponent of Balkan federalism—though not necessarily of a Balkan state to include Romania [237]\n\n\nBZD Club\nIn January 1882, Grigore Sturdza was being labeled a \"Slavophile\" by the Austrian press, which reported on his \"conventicles\" of Iași in connection with a visit by Miroslav Hubmajer, known for having fought in an anti-Austrian rebellion in 1875 [261] The Beizadea remained unrelenting in his critique of Brătianu's foreign policies, exposing Austria-Hungary for using the Danube Commission to limit Romania's navigation rights [262] His speeches drew attention from a Junimist poet-journalist, Mihai Eminescu In an 1882 piece, he declared his admiration for Sturdza's \"so very clear, so very beautiful\" Romanian oratory, stripped of neologisms and verbosity Eminescu mused that the effect of using \"good, direct, informal Romanian\", or what he termed the \"old language\", was like introducing pagans to Christian music by Palestrina [263]\n\n\nRetirement\nSturdza was finally attracted into the PNL during the general elections of November 1895—at the time, the group was turning right-wing under the chairmanship of a relative, D A Sturdza [288] Sturdza and his BZD partisans presented themselves on the PNL list for the Assembly, which effectively ended their prospects of ever returning into the Conservative fold [289] With 171 votes, he was the third winner on the PNL list for Iași's 1st College, behind Ștefan C Șendrea and Toma Stelian [290] In early 1896, Sturdza and his followers tried to mediate between PNL leaders and the breakaway faction of Nicolae Fleva: \"The Beizadea keeps pleading for reconciliation, since he is very much keen on maintaining his prevalence at Iași.\" [291] As reported by the opposition newspaper Epoca, by early May 1898 the PNL majority had pledged 1.5 million lei to Sturdza, as compensation for his 1854 expropriation Epoca noted that this was in fact a \"baksheesh\" [97] The same source also reported that, later that month, the Beizadea was attempting to rejoin the opposition, since the other Sturdza would not honor his promise [292] He still had his own thoughts on European affairs, and in December 1896 insisted that \"Romania should find support in Russia\" This remark was disputed by Foreign Minister Constantin Stoicescu, who noted that the country needed to remain neutral in the Oriental crises [293] The Beizadea's political irrelevancy was signaled in 1898 by cartoonist Nicolae Petrescu Găină, who depicted him as an Ottoman relic, adding the caption: \"He was once something, what can he be now?\" [294]\n\n\nDeath\nSturdza's fortune grew to immense proportions after lawyer I C Barozzi, working on his behalf, discovered that Prince Mihail had hidden some 45 million lei in bullion on his various estates; Grigore was owed a third of this wealth [308] At some point between 1893 and 1899, the Beizadea bought himself a villa on Bucharest's Calea Victoriei, but never lived in it, finally presenting is to his other lawyer, Constantin Dissescu, for services performed in the family trial [312] Sturdza also commissioned a German architect, Julius Reinecke, to construct the Sturdza Palace of Bucharest This building was infamous for its extreme eclecticism and its overall uselessness, [308] [313] its \"immense rooms\" only meant to be used for racing \"a bicycle  [Sturdza] had invented\", and for various acrobatics [270] He \"barely lived inside the place, after having spent on it more than he could handle.\" [314] According to Radu Rosetti, the Palace is also a testament to its sponsor's \"utter lack of artistic taste\" [274] It was the scene of family dramas, which played during the Beizadea's final years In January 1895, Sturdza forced his adoptive son, also named Grigore, to marry Maria Feodosiev-Cantacuzino In love with Gizela Boga, the daughter of a shoemaker, [308] he killed his lover, then committed suicide, some three weeks into his marriage [315] Their daughter, known as Olga Boga [316] (sometimes rendered as Bogza), was subsequently \"raised, provided for, and married off by Beizadea Grigore\", [317] who also legally adopted her [308]\n\n\nLegacy\nAs Foaia Populară magazine put it, \" [Sturdza's] death was much like his life: he died with a light conscience, effortlessly, at peace.\" The Bucharest funeral of \"Romania's greatest-ever philanthropist\" involved \"the entire capital city, with everyone wishing to display their mourning.\" [323] Memoirist Rudolf Șuțu additionally notes: \"With him we lost the very last gentleman of that fine race of gentleman of the heart, and gentlemen of the mind, standing for old Moldavia He was a prince not only through his birthright and his blood, but more than everything though his natural intelligence, through his acquiring of a solid culture, through the charms of his great loving heart\" [324] The funeral oration was delivered by Macedonski [325]\n\n\nNotes\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Grigore Sturdza**\n\nGrigore Sturdza (1812-1895) was a prominent figure in the history of Moldavia and Romania, known for his complex and dynamic personality, his influential role in politics and society, and his numerous contributions to the country's development.\n\n**Biography**\n\nGrigore's family, the Sturdzas, were \"long and intimately associated with the government first of Moldavia and afterwards of Rumania.\" Their origin, speculatively, was in the Empire of Trebizond, whence they settled Moldavia and Wallachia during the 17th century.

Reportedly, Grigore did not favor this claim, but instead regarded himself as a descendant of Vlad the Impaler. His contemporary, the genealogist and polemicist Constantin Sion, lists the Sturdzas as native Moldavians from Putna County.\n\n**Origins and Childhood**\n\nAs reported by scholar Moses Gaster, Grigore's family, the Sturdzas, were \"long and intimately associated with the government first of Moldavia and afterwards of Rumania.\" Their origin, Gaster speculates, was in the Empire of Trebizond, whence they settled Moldavia and Wallachia during the 17th century. Other sources indicate that the first known Sturdza actually lived in Moldavia during the mid-16th-century reigns of Alexandru Lăpușneanu; he was of plausible, but unconfirmed, Aromanian origin. The Beizadea's grandfather, Logothete Grigorașcu Sturdza, enshrined a legend according to which the family was a branch of the Hungarian Thurzós, and that it ultimately had Dalmatian origins. Reportedly, Grigore did not favor this claim, but instead regarded himself as a descendant of Vlad the Impaler. His contemporary, the genealogist and polemicist Constantin Sion, lists the Sturdzas as native Moldavians from Putna County.\n\n**Training**\n\nGrigore began service in the Moldavian princely militia in August 1834, when he became a cavalry cadet. He was much impressed by the experience, which shaped his lifelong belief in militarism. Around coronation time, he and his elder brother Dimitrie were being tutored at Miroslava school by a Professor Victor de Lincourt. In September 1834, their father sent them to study in the Kingdom of France—alongside Mihail Kogălniceanu and other young boyars, and with Lincourt as a chaperon, they were assigned to a school in Lunéville. This path mirrored Mihail's own schooling and, in addition, was selected in order to prevent Grigore and Dimitrie from being educated in Russia. It was also designed to avoid Paris, which was the center of radical politics ever since the July Revolution: \"youth from good families  [had] to learn French, the language of diplomacy, and receive a good instruction, were carefully kept out of any contact with the liberal or revolutionary spirit.\" The news was finally communicated to the Russian Emperor, Nicholas I, who was indignant that his subordinate's sons were being educated in liberal France, and pondered having Sturdza dethroned. Another factor which made stay in France unlikely was an illegal duel, in which Grigore wounded his colleague Lippmann.\n\n**Countess Dash affair**\n\nNikolay Girs, who served in 1841 as Dragoman for the Russian Consulate in Iași, describes Dimitrie as a \"gentle and harmless young fella\" who dedicated himself to training horses. By contrast, Grigore was a man of \"boundless pride\", who \"inspired fear on all people, including to his authoritarian father\". This judgement was partly replicated by the Austrian agent Stokera, who found the elder Sturdza sibling to be \"rather poor with the spirit\", also arguing that, at this stage, Grigore was committed to Moldavia's \"Russian party\". Despite his lack of seniority, Grigore was being groomed to succeed Mihail on the princely throne. Reportedly, he asked his father to allow him a relocation to Paris, which he found to be warmer and more intellectually prestigious, as well as more sexually liberated, than Berlin. Reportedly, in 1839 the future \"Muklis\" had also joined the Turkish Freemasonry, and, with his personal example, helped spark recruitment into the less developed Moldavian Freemasonry; according to literary historian Radu Cernătescu, this activity was satirized by Vasile Alecsandri in his 1840 play, Farmazonul din Hârlău (\"The Freemason of Hârlău\"), with Beizadea reflected in its main character, Pestriț (\"Mottled\").\n\n**1848 Revolution**\n\nDespite such acts of generosity, the Beizadea was mostly known for his outstanding cruelty. Writer I C Severeanu reports that Sturdza not only kept Romani slaves, but actually shot and killed one of them for oversalting his soup. Sion describes the young Sturdza, \"that famous thief\", as \"heartless, cruel, unmerciful, and so very wolfish\". As Ionescu reported, the Beizadea had a plan of taking in his care \"all the estates of Roman County\", to emerge as the \"elephant\" of Moldavian agriculture. Sturdza also began holding land to his own name: at Cristești, he used, and sometimes lived in, a giant durmast oak with a view of the Ceahlău Massif.\n\n**Crimean War**\n\nBy the time of the revolution, Beizadea Grigore had focused on his military career, and held a general's rank in the Moldavian militia. Building on his personal friendship with Reşid Pasha at the peak of Tanzimat reforms, he transferred to a Colonel's posting in the Ottoman army in 1852. As Muklis Pasha (also Muhlis Basha and other variants), Sturdza was assigned to the Turkish Cossack cavalry in December 1853, some two months into the Crimean War. This unit was also set up to include Wallachian revolutionary deportees, to whom the Porte had granted partial amnesty. Sturdza fought with distinction in Wallachia, beginning with the Battle of Oltenița; he was then involved in the engagements at Cetate, displaying \"rather insane courage\" as a mounted sniper, who took aim at enemy officers while fired upon by the Russian artillery. He also ignored his superiors' orders and, in August 1854, made a trip to Russian-abandoned Bucharest, where he found his wife's home \"almost spared of bullets and robbers\".\n\n**1858–1859 election**\n\nSamples of diplomatic correspondence indicate that, in July 1856, the Beizadea had real chances of being appointed Caimacam (regent) of Moldavia, losing only narrowly to Teodor Balș, himself replaced in February 1857 by Bogoridi's son, Nicolae Vogoride. In April 1857, at Iași, Sturdza handed the final act on Moldavia's frontier to Vogoride. The waning of Russian influence now allowed room for the National Party, which supported a political unification of Moldavia and Wallachia, and their emancipation as an independent country. In 1855, this group opened a Masonic Lodge in Iași, which, by 1857, was secretly debating candidacies for the Moldavian throne. Grigore Sturdza's support by the great boyar families was seen as an obstacle by the Nationals, who regarded him as a \"Phanariote\"; while the group was adamant that they would never support Sturdza, they remained for a while divided between putting up Alecsandri and Costache Negri as their rival candidates.\n\n**Polish plot and Central Commission**\n\nImmediately after the election, Sturdza Jr and Panu reemerged as Cuza supporters. The former raised the idea of a Cuza candidacy in Bucharest \"before anything official had been stated on this issue\". Both he and Panu wrote articles hinting that Cuza should invade Wallachia and seize the throne in Bucharest; Strudza's piece saw print in the National Party mouthpiece, Stéoa Dunărei. Cuza's subsequent election in Wallachia effectively federated the two countries, as the \"United Principalities\"; he was crowned Domnitor in both capitals \"Muklis\" went on public record with his praise of the union as \"something worthy of Romania's most glorious times\", asking that both Divans meet for a common session in Focșani. More secretly, he began to organize for resistance. The National Party's V A Urechia claimed that young Sturdza being furious of his father's interference, which had prevented him from swinging the \"old boyar\" vote. He reports that the former Pasha intended to use his Ottoman connections to prevent Cuza from ever gaining international recognition, and also that he was arming \"vagabonds\", ready to \"storm into that Mr Cuza's palace\".\n\n**\"Monstrous coalition\"**\n\nUnlike other Moldavian delegates on the commission, Sturdza fully supported establishing the national capital in Bucharest; as he put it, Iași lacked was both insufficiently bourgeois and insufficiently Romanian. He then stood in the Romanian Assembly of Deputies, representing the right-wing opposition to Cuza's egalitarian policies. As noted by Xenopol, he was the \"most progressive\" right-winger, endorsing public schooling, mass recruitment, and the land value tax, as well as an increased salary for the Moldavian Prime Minister, who was by then his nominal rival Kogălniceanu. In January 1861, he objected as other conservatives passed a motion of no confidence against Kogălniceanu's administration, arguing that the accusations of corruption brought up against the head of government were unfounded. Sturdza's flirtation with liberalism ended when it came to land reform—as the \"landowners' main champion\", from May 1862 he was an outspoken opponent of attempts to dispossess boyars and the gentry at the benefit of peasants. He upheld a rival project provided for common land in rural communities, with family allotments of, at most, 15 square kilometers. Attempting to solve peasant destitution by other means, he set up his own lands in Iași County to function as model farms, introducing fallow techniques that more than doubled the expected output. He continued to live as an aristocrat—in 1861, he dueled with, and killed, Costin Vârnav over a dance-floor scuffle.\n\n**1866 events**\n\nThe political unrest was briefly ended that same month by Cuza's self-coup. In August 1865, at a time of mounting discontent, representatives of this regime allegedly raided Sturdza's home in Perieni, \"but without success\". Cuza's reign was finally brought to an end by the \"monstrous coalition\" counter-coup of February 1866. Over the following months of unrest, Romania (as the Principalities were now formally known) selected Carol of Hohenzollern, a Prussian subject, as their new Domnitor. His predecessor's abdication created the terrain for active separatism, which was promoted by Russia's agents in Moldavia. An April report in the Transylvanian press had it that \"prince Gregoriu Sturza, under the condition of a foreign prince, has renounced his candidacy, but under other circumstances he will use any means to see himself on the throne\".\n\n**\"White\" politico**\n\nIn January 1870 the Beizadea, backed by 65 Assembly deputies, presented a motion to grant Carol a gift of 300 thousand francs. As reported by opposition papers, this was in fact a disguised gift for the Domnitor's wife, Elisabeth of Wied. In February, the anti-\"Red\" government coalition, headed by Golescu-Negru, reportedly considered reappointing him Prefect of Iași. The troubled year 1871 signaled Sturdza's political rise as the leader of an arch-conservative caucus. The defeat of conspiratorial \"Reds\" following incidents known as the \"Republic of Ploiești\" was consecrated in the May 1871 election. On April 18, Sturdza helped organize the conservative caucus in Iași, which met at his home; it included \"about a hundred people\", with his former enemy Epureanu as their leader. Addressing the gathering, the Beizadea outlined a plan for modifying the Constitution to solidify Carol's rule and ensure continuity. These ideas were also embraced by Epureanu and Iacob Negruzzi, who also spoke on the occasion—the latter's address was perceived by journalist as an endorsement of absolute monarchy.\n\n**National-Democratic leader**\n\nSturdza adopted controversial stances during the Romanian War of Independence, which saw Romania aligned with Russia against the Ottomans. In order to obtain recognition for its separation from the Ottoman realm, Romania had to consider emancipating its non-Orthodox residents; and enduring controversy focused on the extent of Jewish emancipation. Sturdza sided with Conservative Generals Gheorghe Manu and Ion Emanuel Florescu. They proposed that naturalization could only be fast-tracked in individual cases, and with an Assembly supermajority. Upon the end of the war in 1878, Romanians were faced with a Russian demand to relinquish southern Bessarabia, in exchange for Northern Dobruja. Nationalists were generally indignant, and Carol threatened to abdicate during February 1878; as reported by Politische Correspondenz, this suited Russia, which had Sturdza as its favorite candidate for the throne. The issue was settled in Romania's detriment by the Treaty of Berlin, which was signed in July 1878. Over the following months, Sturdza was acknowledged as a proponent of Balkan federalism—though not necessarily of a Balkan state to include Romania.\n\n**BZD Club**\n\nIn January 1882, Grigore Sturdza was being labeled a \"Slavophile\" by the Austrian press, which reported on his \"conventicles\" of Iași in connection with a visit by Miroslav Hubmajer, known for having fought in an anti-Austrian rebellion in 1875. The Beizadea remained unrelenting in his critique of Brătianu's foreign policies, exposing Austria-Hungary for using the Danube Commission to limit Romania's navigation rights. His speeches drew attention from a Junimist poet-journalist, Mihai Eminescu. In an 1882 piece, he declared his admiration for Sturdza's \"so very clear, so very beautiful\" Romanian oratory, stripped of neologisms and verbosity. Eminescu mused that the effect of using \"good, direct, informal Romanian\", or what he termed the \"old language\", was like introducing pagans to Christian music by Palestrina.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nSturdza was finally attracted into the PNL during the general elections of November 1895—at the time, the group was turning right-wing under the chairmanship of a relative, D A Sturdza. Sturdza and his BZD partisans presented themselves on the PNL list for the Assembly, which effectively ended their prospects of ever returning into the Conservative fold. With 171 votes, he was the third winner on the PNL list for Iași's 1st College, behind Ștefan C Șendrea and Toma Stelian. In early 1896, Sturdza and his followers tried to mediate between PNL leaders and the breakaway faction of Nicolae Fleva: \"The Beizadea keeps pleading for reconciliation, since he is very much keen on maintaining his prevalence at Iași\". As reported by the opposition newspaper Epoca, by early May 1898 the PNL majority had pledged 1.5 million lei to Sturdza, as compensation for his 1854 expropriation. Epoca noted that this was in fact a \"baksheesh\". The same source also reported that, later that month, the Beizadea was attempting to rejoin the opposition, since the other Sturdza would not honor his promise. He still had his own thoughts on European affairs, and in December 1896 insisted that \"Romania should find support in Russia\". This remark was disputed by Foreign Minister Constantin Stoicescu, who noted that the country needed to remain neutral in the Oriental crises. The Beizadea's political irrelevancy was signaled in 1898 by cartoonist Nicolae Petrescu Găină, who depicted him as an Ottoman relic, adding the caption: \"He was once something, what can he be now?\"\n\n**Death**\n\nSturdza's fortune grew to immense proportions after lawyer I C Barozzi, working on his behalf, discovered that Prince Mihail had hidden some 45 million lei in bullion on his various estates; Grigore was owed a third of this wealth. At some point between 1893 and 1899, the Beizadea bought himself a villa on Bucharest's Calea Victoriei, but never lived in it, finally presenting it to his other lawyer, Constantin Dissescu, for services performed in the family trial. Sturdza also commissioned a German architect, Julius Reinecke, to construct the Sturdza Palace of Bucharest. This building was infamous for its extreme eclecticism and its overall uselessness, with \"immense rooms\" only meant to be used for racing \"a bicycle  [Sturdza] had invented\", and for various acrobatics. He \"barely lived inside the place, after having spent on it more than he could handle\". According to Radu Rosetti, the Palace is also a testament to its sponsor's \"utter lack of artistic taste\". It was the scene of family dramas, which played during the Beizadea's final years. In January 1895, Sturdza forced his adoptive son, also named Grigore, to marry Maria Feodosiev-Cantacuzino. In love with Gizela Boga, the daughter of a shoemaker, he killed his lover, then committed suicide, some three weeks into his marriage. Their daughter, known as Olga Boga (sometimes rendered as Bogza), was subsequently \"raised, provided for, and married off by Beizadea Grigore\", who also legally adopted her.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nAs Foaia Populară magazine put it, \" [Sturdza's] death was much like his life: he died with a light conscience, effortlessly, at peace\".

as he put it, Iași lacked was both insufficiently bourgeois and insufficiently Romanian [173] He then stood in the Romanian Assembly of Deputies, representing the right-wing opposition to Cuza's egalitarian policies As noted by Xenopol, he was the \"most progressive\" right-winger, endorsing public schooling, mass recruitment, and the land value tax, as well as an increased salary for the Moldavian Prime Minister, who was by then his nominal rival Kogălniceanu [174] In January 1861, he objected as other conservatives passed a motion of no confidence against Kogălniceanu's administration, arguing that the accusations of corruption brought up against the head of government were unfounded [175] Sturdza's flirtation with liberalism ended when it came to land reform—as the \"landowners' main champion\", [176] from May 1862 he was an outspoken opponent of attempts to dispossess boyars and the gentry at the benefit of peasants [177] He upheld a rival project provided for common land in rural communities, with family allotments of, at most, 15 square kilometers [178] Attempting to solve peasant destitution by other means, he set up his own lands in Iași County to function as model farms, introducing fallow techniques that more than doubled the expected output [179] He continued to live as an aristocrat—in 1861, he dueled with, and killed, Costin Vârnav over a dance-floor scuffle [180]\n\n\n1866 events\nThe political unrest was briefly ended that same month by Cuza's self-coup In August 1865, at a time of mounting discontent, representatives of this regime allegedly raided Sturdza's home in Perieni, \"but without success.\" [200] Cuza's reign was finally brought to an end by the \"monstrous coalition\" counter-coup of February 1866 Over the following months of unrest, Romania (as the Principalities were now formally known) selected Carol of Hohenzollern, a Prussian subject, as their new Domnitor His predecessor's abdication created the terrain for active separatism, which was promoted by Russia's agents in Moldavia An April report in the Transylvanian press had it that \"prince Gregoriu Sturza, under the condition of a foreign prince, has renounced his candidacy, but under other circumstances he will use any means to see himself on the throne.\" [201]\n\n\n\"White\" politico\nIn January 1870 the Beizadea, backed by 65 Assembly deputies, presented a motion to grant Carol a gift of 300 thousand francs As reported by opposition papers, this was in fact a disguised gift for the Domnitor's wife, Elisabeth of Wied [211] In February, the anti-\"Red\" government coalition, headed by Golescu-Negru, reportedly considered reappointing him Prefect of Iași [212] The troubled year 1871 signaled Sturdza's political rise as the leader of an arch-conservative caucus The defeat of conspiratorial \"Reds\" following incidents known as the \"Republic of Ploiești\" was consecrated in the May 1871 election On April 18, Sturdza helped organize the conservative caucus in Iași, which met at his home; it included \"about a hundred people\", with his former enemy Epureanu as their leader Addressing the gathering, the Beizadea outlined a plan for modifying the Constitution to solidify Carol's rule and ensure continuity These ideas were also embraced by Epureanu and Iacob Negruzzi, who also spoke on the occasion—the latter's address was perceived by journalist as an endorsement of absolute monarchy [213]\n\n\nNational-Democratic leader\nSturdza adopted controversial stances during the Romanian War of Independence, which saw Romania aligned with Russia against the Ottomans In order to obtain recognition for its separation from the Ottoman realm, Romania had to consider emancipating its non-Orthodox residents; and enduring controversy focused on the extent of Jewish emancipation Sturdza sided with Conservative Generals Gheorghe Manu and Ion Emanuel Florescu They proposed that naturalization could only be fast-tracked in individual cases, and with an Assembly supermajority [235] Upon the end of the war in 1878, Romanians were faced with a Russian demand to relinquish southern Bessarabia, in exchange for Northern Dobruja Nationalists were generally indignant, and Carol threatened to abdicate during February 1878; as reported by Politische Correspondenz, this suited Russia, which had Sturdza as its favorite candidate for the throne [236] The issue was settled in Romania's detriment by the Treaty of Berlin, which was signed in July 1878 Over the following months, Sturdza was acknowledged as a proponent of Balkan federalism—though not necessarily of a Balkan state to include Romania [237]\n\n\nBZD Club\nIn January 1882, Grigore Sturdza was being labeled a \"Slavophile\" by the Austrian press, which reported on his \"conventicles\" of Iași in connection with a visit by Miroslav Hubmajer, known for having fought in an anti-Austrian rebellion in 1875 [261] The Beizadea remained unrelenting in his critique of Brătianu's foreign policies, exposing Austria-Hungary for using the Danube Commission to limit Romania's navigation rights [262] His speeches drew attention from a Junimist poet-journalist, Mihai Eminescu In an 1882 piece, he declared his admiration for Sturdza's \"so very clear, so very beautiful\" Romanian oratory, stripped of neologisms and verbosity Eminescu mused that the effect of using \"good, direct, informal Romanian\", or what he termed the \"old language\", was like introducing pagans to Christian music by Palestrina [263]\n\n\nRetirement\nSturdza was finally attracted into the PNL during the general elections of November 1895—at the time, the group was turning right-wing under the chairmanship of a relative, D A Sturdza [288] Sturdza and his BZD partisans presented themselves on the PNL list for the Assembly, which effectively ended their prospects of ever returning into the Conservative fold [289] With 171 votes, he was the third winner on the PNL list for Iași's 1st College, behind Ștefan C Șendrea and Toma Stelian [290] In early 1896, Sturdza and his followers tried to mediate between PNL leaders and the breakaway faction of Nicolae Fleva: \"The Beizadea keeps pleading for reconciliation, since he is very much keen on maintaining his prevalence at Iași.\" [291] As reported by the opposition newspaper Epoca, by early May 1898 the PNL majority had pledged 1.5 million lei to Sturdza, as compensation for his 1854 expropriation Epoca noted that this was in fact a \"baksheesh\" [97] The same source also reported that, later that month, the Beizadea was attempting to rejoin the opposition, since the other Sturdza would not honor his promise [292] He still had his own thoughts on European affairs, and in December 1896 insisted that \"Romania should find support in Russia\" This remark was disputed by Foreign Minister Constantin Stoicescu, who noted that the country needed to remain neutral in the Oriental crises [293] The Beizadea's political irrelevancy was signaled in 1898 by cartoonist Nicolae Petrescu Găină, who depicted him as an Ottoman relic, adding the caption: \"He was once something, what can he be now?\" [294]\n\n\nDeath\nSturdza's fortune grew to immense proportions after lawyer I C Barozzi, working on his behalf, discovered that Prince Mihail had hidden some 45 million lei in bullion on his various estates; Grigore was owed a third of this wealth [308] At some point between 1893 and 1899, the Beizadea bought himself a villa on Bucharest's Calea Victoriei, but never lived in it, finally presenting is to his other lawyer, Constantin Dissescu, for services performed in the family trial [312] Sturdza also commissioned a German architect, Julius Reinecke, to construct the Sturdza Palace of Bucharest This building was infamous for its extreme eclecticism and its overall uselessness, [308] [313] its \"immense rooms\" only meant to be used for racing \"a bicycle  [Sturdza] had invented\", and for various acrobatics [270] He \"barely lived inside the place, after having spent on it more than he could handle.\" [314] According to Radu Rosetti, the Palace is also a testament to its sponsor's \"utter lack of artistic taste\" [274] It was the scene of family dramas, which played during the Beizadea's final years In January 1895, Sturdza forced his adoptive son, also named Grigore, to marry Maria Feodosiev-Cantacuzino In love with Gizela Boga, the daughter of a shoemaker, [308] he killed his lover, then committed suicide, some three weeks into his marriage [315] Their daughter, known as Olga Boga [316] (sometimes rendered as Bogza), was subsequently \"raised, provided for, and married off by Beizadea Grigore\", [317] who also legally adopted her [308]\n\n\nLegacy\nAs Foaia Populară magazine put it, \" [Sturdza's] death was much like his life: he died with a light conscience, effortlessly, at peace.\" The Bucharest funeral of \"Romania's greatest-ever philanthropist\" involved \"the entire capital city, with everyone wishing to display their mourning.\" [323] Memoirist Rudolf Șuțu additionally notes: \"With him we lost the very last gentleman of that fine race of gentleman of the heart, and gentlemen of the mind, standing for old Moldavia He was a prince not only through his birthright and his blood, but more than everything though his natural intelligence, through his acquiring of a solid culture, through the charms of his great loving heart\" [324] The funeral oration was delivered by Macedonski [325]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Winter_War", "content": "\nBackground\nUntil the early 19th century, Finland was the eastern part of the Kingdom of Sweden From 21 February 1808 to 17 September 1809, the Russian Empire waged the Finnish War against the Kingdom of Sweden, ostensibly to protect the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg Eventually Russia conquered and annexed Finland, and converted it into an autonomous buffer state [44] The resulting Grand Duchy of Finland enjoyed wide autonomy within Russia until the end of the 19th century, when Russia began attempts to assimilate Finland as part of a general policy to strengthen the central government and unify the Empire by Russification Those attempts were aborted because of Russia's internal strife, but they ruined Russia's relationship with Finland In addition, support increased in Finland for self-determination movements [45]\n\n\nFinnish-Soviet relations and politics\nUntil the early 19th century, Finland was the eastern part of the Kingdom of Sweden From 21 February 1808 to 17 September 1809, the Russian Empire waged the Finnish War against the Kingdom of Sweden, ostensibly to protect the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg Eventually Russia conquered and annexed Finland, and converted it into an autonomous buffer state [44] The resulting Grand Duchy of Finland enjoyed wide autonomy within Russia until the end of the 19th century, when Russia began attempts to assimilate Finland as part of a general policy to strengthen the central government and unify the Empire by Russification Those attempts were aborted because of Russia's internal strife, but they ruined Russia's relationship with Finland In addition, support increased in Finland for self-determination movements [45]\n\n\nJustification\nSoviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin regarded it a disappointment that the Soviet Union could not halt the Finnish Revolution [55] He thought that the pro-Finland movement in Karelia posed a direct threat to Leningrad and that the area and defences of Finland could be used to invade the Soviet Union or restrict fleet movements [56] Soviet propaganda then painted Finland's leadership as a \"vicious and reactionary fascist clique\" Field Marshal Mannerheim and Väinö Tanner, the leader of the Finnish Social Democratic Party, were targeted for particular scorn [57] When Stalin gained absolute power through the Great Purge of 1938, the Soviets changed their foreign policy toward Finland and began to pursue the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia that had been lost during the chaos of the October Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War almost two decades earlier [58] Soviet leaders believed that the old empire's extended borders provided territorial security and wanted Leningrad, only 32 km (20 mi) from the Finnish border, to enjoy a similar level of security against the rising power of Nazi Germany [59] [60]\n\n\nNegotiations\nIn April 1938, NKVD agent Boris Yartsev contacted Finnish Foreign Minister Rudolf Holsti and Finnish Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, stating that the Soviets did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather \"advance to meet the enemy\" Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad, but Finland refused [61] [62]\n\n\nShelling of Mainila and Soviet intentions\nOn 26 November 1939, an incident was reported near the Soviet village of Mainila, near the border with Finland A Soviet border guard post had been shelled by an unknown party resulting, according to Soviet reports, in the deaths of four and injuries of nine border guards Research conducted by several Finnish and Russian historians later concluded that the shelling was a false flag operation since there were no artillery units there, and it was carried out from the Soviet side of the border by an NKVD unit with the purpose of providing the Soviets with a casus belli and a pretext to withdraw from the non-aggression pact [85] [86] [F 9] Soviet war games held in March 1938 and 1939 had been based on a scenario in which border incidents taking place at the village of Mainila would spark the war [89]\n\n\nSoviet intentions\nIn 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated at a meeting with military historians that the Soviets had launched the Winter War to \"correct mistakes\" made in determining the border with Finland after 1917 [93] Opinion on the scale of the initial Soviet invasion decision is divided The puppet Finnish communist government and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocol is used as proof that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland [F 10]\n\n\nOpposing forces\nBefore the war, Soviet leadership had expected total victory within a few weeks The Red Army had just completed the invasion of eastern Poland at a cost of fewer than 4,000 casualties after Germany attacked Poland from the west Stalin's expectations of a quick Soviet triumph were backed up by politician Andrei Zhdanov and military strategist Kliment Voroshilov, but other generals were more reserved Red Army Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov advocated a narrow-front assault right on the Karelian isthmus [109] Additionally, Shaposhnikov argued for a fuller build-up, extensive fire support and logistical preparations, a rational order of battle and the deployment of the army's best units Zhdanov's military commander, Kirill Meretskov, reported, \"The terrain of coming operations is split by lakes, rivers, swamps, and is almost entirely covered by forests... The proper use of our forces will be difficult\" These doubts were not reflected in Meretskov's troop deployments, and he publicly announced that the Finnish campaign would take two weeks at most Soviet soldiers had even been warned not to cross the border mistakenly into Sweden [110]\n\n\nSoviet military plan\nBefore the war, Soviet leadership had expected total victory within a few weeks The Red Army had just completed the invasion of eastern Poland at a cost of fewer than 4,000 casualties after Germany attacked Poland from the west Stalin's expectations of a quick Soviet triumph were backed up by politician Andrei Zhdanov and military strategist Kliment Voroshilov, but other generals were more reserved Red Army Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov advocated a narrow-front assault right on the Karelian isthmus [109] Additionally, Shaposhnikov argued for a fuller build-up, extensive fire support and logistical preparations, a rational order of battle and the deployment of the army's best units Zhdanov's military commander, Kirill Meretskov, reported, \"The terrain of coming operations is split by lakes, rivers, swamps, and is almost entirely covered by forests... The proper use of our forces will be difficult\" These doubts were not reflected in Meretskov's troop deployments, and he publicly announced that the Finnish campaign would take two weeks at most Soviet soldiers had even been warned not to cross the border mistakenly into Sweden [110]\n\n\nSoviet order of battle\nSoviet generals were impressed by the success of German Blitzkrieg tactics, but they had been tailored to conditions in Central Europe, with its dense well-mapped network of paved roads Armies fighting there had recognised supply and communications centres, which could be easily targeted by armoured vehicle regiments Finnish Army centres, in contrast, were deep inside the country There were no paved roads, and even gravel or dirt roads were scarce Most of the terrain consisted of trackless forests and swamps The war correspondent John Langdon-Davies observed the landscape: \"Every acre of its surface was created to be the despair of an attacking military force\" [120] Waging Blitzkrieg in Finland was a highly-difficult proposition, and according to Trotter, the Red Army failed to meet the level of tactical co-ordination and local initiative that would be required to execute such tactics in Finland [121]\n\n\nFinnish order of battle\nThe Finnish strategy was dictated by geography The 1,340 km (830 mi) border with the Soviet Union was mostly impassable except along a handful of unpaved roads In prewar calculations, the Finnish Defence Command, which had established its wartime headquarters at Mikkeli, [127] had estimated seven Soviet divisions on the Karelian Isthmus and no more than five along the whole border north of Lake Ladoga In the estimation, the manpower ratio would have favoured the attacker by three to one The true ratio was much higher, however, since for example, 12 Soviet divisions were deployed north of Lake Ladoga [132]\n\n\nSoviet invasion\nOn 30 November 1939, Soviet forces invaded Finland with 21 divisions, totalling 450,000 men, and bombed Helsinki, [128] [135] killing about 100 citizens and destroying more than 50 buildings In response to international criticism, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov stated that the Soviet Air Force was not bombing Finnish cities but rather dropping humanitarian aid to the starving Finnish population; the bombs were sarcastically dubbed Molotov bread baskets by Finns [136] [137] The Finnish statesman J K Paasikivi commented that the Soviet attack without a declaration of war violated three separate non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu, which was signed in 1920, the non-aggression pact between Finland and the Soviet Union, which was signed in 1932 and again in 1934; and also the Covenant of the League of Nations, which the Soviet Union signed in 1934 [88] Field Marshal C.G.E Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defence Forces after the Soviet attack In a further reshuffling, Aimo Cajander's caretaker cabinet was replaced by Risto Ryti and his cabinet, with Väinö Tanner as foreign minister because of opposition to Cajander's prewar politics [138] Finland brought the matter of the Soviet invasion before the League of Nations The League expelled the Soviet Union on 14 December 1939 and exhorted its members to aid Finland [139] [140]\n\n\nStart of invasion and political operations\nOn 30 November 1939, Soviet forces invaded Finland with 21 divisions, totalling 450,000 men, and bombed Helsinki, [128] [135] killing about 100 citizens and destroying more than 50 buildings In response to international criticism, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov stated that the Soviet Air Force was not bombing Finnish cities but rather dropping humanitarian aid to the starving Finnish population; the bombs were sarcastically dubbed Molotov bread baskets by Finns [136] [137] The Finnish statesman J K Paasikivi commented that the Soviet attack without a declaration of war violated three separate non-aggression

the Soviet invasion before the League of Nations The League expelled the Soviet Union on 14 December 1939 and exhorted its members to aid Finland [139] [140]\n\n\nFirst battles and Soviet advance to Mannerheim Line\nThe array of Finnish defence structures that during the war started to be called the Mannerheim Line was located on the Karelian Isthmus approximately 30 to 75 km (19 to 47 mi) from the Soviet border The Red Army soldiers on the Isthmus numbered 250,000, facing 130,000 Finns [143] The Finnish command deployed a defence in depth of about 21,000 men in the area in front of the Mannerheim Line to delay and damage the Red Army before it reached the line [144] In combat, the most severe cause of confusion among Finnish soldiers was Soviet tanks The Finns had few anti-tank weapons and insufficient training in modern anti-tank tactics According to Trotter, the favoured Soviet armoured tactic was a simple frontal charge, the weaknesses of which could be exploited The Finns learned that at close range, tanks could be dealt with in many ways; for example, logs and crowbars jammed into the bogie wheels would often immobilise a tank Soon, Finns fielded a better ad hoc weapon, the Molotov cocktail, a glass bottle filled with flammable liquids and with a simple hand-lit fuse Molotov cocktails were eventually mass-produced by the Finnish Alko alcoholic-beverage corporation and bundled with matches with which to light them 80 Soviet tanks were destroyed in the border zone engagements [145]\n\n\nOperations from December to January\nThe winter of 1939–40 was exceptionally cold with the Karelian Isthmus experiencing a record low temperature of −43 °C (−45 °F) on 16 January 1940 [151] At the beginning of the war, only those Finnish soldiers who were in active service had uniforms and weapons The rest had to make do with their own clothing, which for many soldiers was their normal winter clothing with a semblance of insignia added Finnish soldiers were skilled in cross-country skiing [152] The cold, snow, forest, and long hours of darkness were factors that the Finns could use to their advantage The Finns dressed in layers, and the ski troopers wore a lightweight white snow cape This snow-camouflage made the ski troopers almost invisible so that they could more easily execute guerrilla attacks against Soviet columns At the beginning of the war, Soviet tanks were painted in standard olive drab and men dressed in regular khaki uniforms Not until late January 1940 did the Soviets paint their equipment white and issue snowsuits to their infantry [153]\n\n\nWeather conditions\nThe winter of 1939–40 was exceptionally cold with the Karelian Isthmus experiencing a record low temperature of −43 °C (−45 °F) on 16 January 1940 [151] At the

tactics The Red Army was superior in numbers and material, but Finns used the advantages of speed, manoeuvre warfare and economy of force Particularly on the Ladoga Karelia front and during the Battle of Raate Road, the Finns isolated smaller portions of numerically superior Soviet forces With Soviet forces divided into smaller groups, the Finns dealt with them individually and attacked from all sides [155]\n\n\nBattles of the Mannerheim Line\nThe terrain on the Karelian Isthmus did not allow guerrilla tactics, so the Finns were forced to resort to the more conventional Mannerheim Line, with its flanks protected by large bodies of water Soviet propaganda claimed that it was as strong as or even stronger than the Maginot Line Finnish historians, for their part, have belittled the line's strength, insisting that it was mostly conventional trenches and log-covered dugouts [157] The Finns had built 221 strong-points along the Karelian Isthmus, mostly in the early 1920s Many were extended in the late 1930s Despite these defensive preparations, even the most fortified section of the Mannerheim Line had only one reinforced-concrete bunker per kilometre Overall, the line was weaker than similar lines in mainland Europe [158] According to the Finns, the real strength of the line was the \"stubborn defenders with a lot of sisu\" – a Finnish idiom roughly translated as \"guts, fighting spirit\" [157]\n\n\nBattles in Ladoga Karelia and North Karelia\nThe strength of the Red Army north of Lake Ladoga in Ladoga Karelia surprised the Finnish Headquarters Two Finnish divisions were deployed there, the 12th Division led by Lauri Tiainen and the 13th Division led by Hannu Hannuksela They also had a support group of three brigades, bringing their total strength to over 30,000 The Soviets deployed a division for almost every road leading west to the Finnish border The 8th Army was led by Ivan Khabarov, who was replaced by Grigory Shtern on 13 December [163] The Soviets' mission was to destroy the Finnish troops in the area of Ladoga Karelia and advance into the area between Sortavala and Joensuu within 10 days The Soviets had a 3:1 advantage in manpower and a 5:1 advantage in artillery, as well as air supremacy [164]\n\n\nBattles in Kainuu\nThe Suomussalmi–Raate engagement was a double operation [176] which would later be used by military academics as a classic example of what well-led troops and innovative tactics can do against a much larger adversary Suomussalmi was a municipality of 4,000 with long lakes, wild forests and few roads The Finnish command believed that the Soviets would not attack there, but the Red Army committed two divisions to the Kainuu area with orders to cross the wilderness, capture the city of Oulu and effectively cut Finland in two There were two roads leading to Suomussalmi from the frontier: the northern Juntusranta road and the southern Raate road [177]\n\n\nBattles in Finnish Lapland\nThe Finnish area of Lapland, bestriding the Arctic Circle, is sparsely developed, with little daylight and persistent snow-cover during winter; the Finns expected nothing more than raiding parties and reconnaissance patrols Instead, the Soviets sent full divisions [183] On 11 December, the Finns rearranged the defence of Lapland and detached the Lapland Group from the North Finland Group The group was placed under the command of Kurt Wallenius [184]\n\n\nAerial warfare\nThe USSR enjoyed air superiority throughout the war The Soviet Air Force, supporting the Red Army's invasion with about 2,500 aircraft (the most common type being Tupolev SB), was not as effective as the Soviets might have hoped The material damage by the bomb raids was slight as Finland offered few valuable targets for strategic bombing For example, the city of Tampere was one of the most important targets because it was an important railway junction, and also housed State Aircraft Factory and the Tampere Linen and Iron Industry premises, which manufactured munitions and weapons, including grenade launchers [187] [188] Often, targets were village depots with little value The country had few modern highways in the interior, therefore making the railways the main targets for bombers Rail tracks were cut thousands of times but the Finns hastily repaired them and service resumed within a matter of hours [10] The Soviet Air Force learned from its early mistakes, and by late February instituted more effective tactics [189]\n\n\nSoviet Air Force\nThe USSR enjoyed air superiority throughout the war The Soviet Air

beginning of the war, Finland had a small air force, with only 114 combat planes fit for duty Missions were limited, and fighter aircraft were mainly used to repel Soviet bombers Strategic bombings doubled as opportunities for military reconnaissance Old-fashioned and few in number, aircraft offered little support for Finnish ground troops In spite of losses, the number of planes in the Finnish Air Force rose by over 50 per cent by the end of the war [192] The Finns received shipments of British, French, Italian, Swedish and American aircraft [193]\n\n\nNaval warfare\nThere was little naval activity during the Winter War The Baltic Sea began to freeze over by the end of December, impeding the movement of warships; by mid-winter, only ice breakers and submarines could still move The other reason for low naval activity was the nature of Soviet Navy forces in the area The Baltic Fleet was a coastal defence force which did not have the training, logistical structure, or landing craft to undertake large-scale operations The Baltic Fleet possessed two battleships, one heavy cruiser, almost 20 destroyers, 50 motor torpedo boats, 52 submarines, and other miscellaneous vessels The Soviets used naval bases in Paldiski, Tallinn and Liepāja for their operations [195]\n\n\nNaval activity\nThere was little naval activity during the Winter War The Baltic Sea began to freeze over by the end

(6.0 in) guns being the most numerous Finland attempted to modernise its old guns and installed a number of new batteries, the largest of which featured a 305 mm (12.0 in) gun battery on the island of Kuivasaari in front of Helsinki, originally intended to block the Gulf of Finland to Soviet ships with the help of batteries on the Estonian side [198]\n\n\nSoviet breakthrough in February\nJoseph Stalin was not pleased with the results of December 1939 in the Finnish campaign The Red Army had been humiliated in defeats by smaller Finnish forces By the third week of the war, Soviet propaganda was already working to explain the failures of the Soviet military to the populace: blaming bad terrain and harsh climate, and falsely claiming that the Mannerheim Line was stronger than the Maginot Line, and that the Americans had sent 1,000 of their best pilots to Finland However, the Soviets were confronted with the unavoidable reality of the poor performance of their troops against the Finns Stalin in particular was concerned about the effects of the war on Soviet reputation [201] In late December, the Soviets decided to reduce their strategic objectives and focused on bringing the war to an end [202]\n\n\nRed Army reforms and offensive preparations\nJoseph Stalin was not pleased with the results of December 1939 in the Finnish campaign The Red Army had been humiliated in defeats by

decided to reduce their strategic objectives and focused on bringing the war to an end [202]\n\n\nSoviet offensive on the Karelian Isthmus\nAlthough the Karelian Isthmus front was less active in January than in December, the Soviets increased bombardments, wearing down the defenders and softening their fortifications During daylight hours, the Finns took shelter inside their fortifications from the bombardments and repaired damage during the night The situation led quickly to war exhaustion among the Finns, who lost over 3,000 soldiers in trench warfare The Soviets also made occasional small infantry assaults with one or two companies [206] Because of the shortage of ammunition, Finnish artillery emplacements were under orders to fire only against directly threatening ground attacks On 1 February, the Soviets further escalated their artillery and air bombardments [205]\n\n\nPeace negotiations\nAlthough the Finns attempted to re-open negotiations with Moscow by every means during the war, the Soviets did not respond In early January, Finnish communist Hella Wuolijoki contacted the Finnish Government She offered to contact Moscow through the Soviet Union's ambassador to Sweden, Alexandra Kollontai Wuolijoki departed for Stockholm and met Kollontai secretly at a hotel On 29 January, Molotov put an end to the puppet Terijoki Government and recognized the Ryti–Tanner government as the legal government of Finland, informing it that the USSR was willing to negotiate peace [39] [212]\n\n\nEnd of war in March\nOn 5 March, the Red Army advanced 10 to 15 km (6.2 to 9.3 mi) past the Mannerheim Line and entered the suburbs of Viipuri The same day, the Red Army established a beachhead on the Western Gulf of Viipuri The Finns proposed an armistice on 6 March, but the Soviets, wanting to keep the pressure on the Finnish government, declined the offer The Finnish peace delegation travelled to Moscow via Stockholm and arrived on 7 March They were disappointed to find that Stalin was not present during peace negotiations, likely due to the Red Army's humiliation by the Finns [216] The Soviets had further demands, as their military position was strong and improving On 9 March, the Finnish military situation on the Karelian Isthmus was dire, as troops were experiencing heavy casualties Artillery ammunition was exhausted and weapons were wearing out The Finnish government, realizing that the hoped-for Franco-British military expedition would not arrive in time, as Norway and Sweden had not given the Allies right of passage, had little choice but to accept the Soviet terms [219] Finnish President Kyösti Kallio resisted the idea of giving up any territory to the Soviet Union, but eventually agreed to sign the Moscow Peace Treaty When he signed the document, the tormented president uttered the well-known words: \"Let the hand wither that signs this monstrous treaty!\" [220]\n\n\nMoscow Peace Treaty\nThe Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in Moscow on 12 March 1940 A cease-fire took effect the next day at noon Leningrad time, 11 a.m Helsinki time [221] [222] With it, Finland ceded the Karelian Isthmus and most of Ladoga Karelia The area included Viipuri (Finland's second-largest city  [Population Register] or fourth-largest city  [Church and Civil Register], depending on the census data [223]), much of Finland's industrialised territory, and significant land still held by Finland's military – all in all, nine per cent of Finnish territory The ceded territory included 13 per cent of Finland's economic assets [224] 12 per cent of Finland's population, 422,000 to 450,000 Karelians, were evacuated and lost their homes [225] [226] [227] Finland also ceded a part of the region of Salla, the Rybachy Peninsula in the Barents Sea, and four islands in the Gulf of Finland The Hanko peninsula was leased to the Soviet Union as a military base for 30 years The region of Petsamo, captured by the Red Army during the war, was returned to Finland according to the treaty [228]\n\n\nForeign support\nWorld opinion largely supported the Finnish cause, and the Soviet aggression was generally deemed unjustified World War II had not yet directly affected France, the United Kingdom or the United States; the Winter War was practically the only conflict in Europe at that time and thus held major world interest Several foreign organisations sent material aid, and many countries granted credit and military materiel to Finland Nazi Germany allowed arms to pass through its territory to Finland, but after a Swedish newspaper made this public, Adolf Hitler initiated a policy of silence towards Finland, as part of improved German–Soviet relations following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact [231]\n\n\nForeign

overtures from the anti-Soviet Russian All-Military Union (ROVS) for aid Nevertheless, Mannerheim eventually agreed to establish a small Russian detachment (Russkaya narodnaya armiya, RNA) of 200 men after being introduced to Boris Bazhanov, a high-ranking ROVS member, in person in January 1940 The project was deemed top secret, and was under the auspices of the intelligence division of the Finnish army headquarters [235]\n\n\nFranco-British intervention plans\nFrance had been one of the earliest supporters of Finland during the Winter War The French saw an opportunity to weaken Germany's resource imports via a Finnish counteroffensive, as both Sweden and the Soviet Union were strategic trading partners to Germany France had another motive, preferring to have a major war in a remote part of Europe rather than on French soil France planned to re‑arm the Polish exile units and transport them to the Finnish Arctic port of Petsamo Another proposal was a massive air strike with Turkish co-operation against the Caucasus oil fields [236]\n\n\nAftermath and casualties\nThe 105-day war had a profound and depressing effect in Finland Meaningful international support was minimal and arrived late, and the German blockade had prevented most armament shipments [244] The 15-month period between the Winter War and Operation Barbarossa, part of which was the Continuation War, was later called the Interim Peace [228] After the end of the war, the situation of the Finnish Army on the Karelian Isthmus became a subject of debate in Finland Orders had already been issued to prepare a retreat to the next line of defence in the Taipale sector Estimates of how long the Red Army could have been delayed by retreat-and-stand operations varied from a few days to a few weeks, [245] [246] or to a couple of months at most [247]\n\n\nFinland\nThe 105-day war had a profound and depressing effect in Finland Meaningful international support was minimal and arrived late, and the German

commissars was reduced, and old-fashioned ranks and forms of discipline were reintroduced Clothing, equipment and tactics for winter operations were improved Not all of the reforms had been completed when Germans initiated Operation Barbarossa 14 months later [256]\n\n\nGermany\nThe Winter War was a political success for the Germans Both the Red Army and the League of Nations were humiliated, and the Anglo-French Supreme War Council had been revealed to be chaotic and powerless The German policy of neutrality was unpopular in the homeland, and relations with Italy had suffered After the Moscow Peace Treaty, Germany improved its ties with Finland, and within two weeks, Finnish-German relations were at the top of the agenda [264] [36] More importantly, the very poor performance of the Red Army convinced Hitler that an invasion of the Soviet Union would be successful In June 1941, Hitler declared, \"we have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down\" [265]\n\n\nAllies\nThe Winter War laid bare the disorganisation and ineffectiveness of the Red Army and that of the Allies The Anglo-French Supreme War Council was unable to formulate a workable plan, revealing its unsuitability to make effective war in either Britain or France This failure led to the collapse of the Third Daladier Government in France and the nomination of Paul Reynaud as the new Prime Minister of France [266]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n\n\nEnglish\n\n\nFinnish, Russian and other

1939 to March 1940. The war was the result of a long-standing dispute between the two nations over the border between Finland and the Soviet Union, which had been established after the Finnish War in 1808-1809. The Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, sought to expand its territory and secure its borders, while Finland, led by President Kyösti Kallio, sought to maintain its independence and sovereignty.\n\n**Background**\n\nUntil the early 19th century, Finland was the eastern part of the Kingdom of Sweden. From 21 February 1808 to 17 September 1809, the Russian Empire waged the Finnish War against the Kingdom of Sweden, ostensibly to protect the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg. Eventually, Russia conquered and annexed Finland, and converted it into an autonomous buffer state. The resulting Grand Duchy of Finland enjoyed wide autonomy within Russia until the end of the 19th century, when Russia began attempts to assimilate Finland as part of a general policy to strengthen the central government and unify the Empire by Russification. Those attempts were aborted because of Russia's internal strife, but they ruined Russia's relationship with Finland. In addition, support increased in Finland for self-determination movements.\n\n**Finnish-Soviet relations and politics**\n\nUntil the early 19th century, Finland was the eastern part of the Kingdom of Sweden.

Those attempts were aborted because of Russia's internal strife, but they ruined Russia's relationship with Finland. In addition, support increased in Finland for self-determination movements.\n\n**Justification**\n\nSoviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin regarded it a disappointment that the Soviet Union could not halt the Finnish Revolution. He thought that the pro-Finland movement in Karelia posed a direct threat to Leningrad and that the area and defences of Finland could be used to invade the Soviet Union or restrict fleet movements. Soviet propaganda then painted Finland's leadership as a \"vicious and reactionary fascist clique\" Field Marshal Mannerheim and Väinö Tanner, the leader of the Finnish Social Democratic Party, were targeted for particular scorn. When Stalin gained absolute power through the Great Purge of 1938, the Soviets changed their foreign policy toward Finland and began to pursue the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia that had been lost during the chaos of the October Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War almost two decades earlier.\n\n**Soviet intentions**\n\nIn 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated at a meeting with military historians that the Soviets had launched the Winter War to \"correct mistakes\" made in determining the border with Finland after 1917. Opinion on the scale of the initial Soviet invasion decision is divided. The puppet Finnish communist government and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocol is used as proof that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland.\n\n**Opposing forces**\n\nBefore the war, Soviet leadership had expected total victory within a few weeks. The Red Army had just completed the invasion of eastern Poland at a cost of fewer than 4,000 casualties after Germany attacked Poland from the west. Stalin's expectations of a quick Soviet triumph were backed up by politician Andrei Zhdanov and military strategist Kliment Voroshilov, but other generals were more reserved. Red Army Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov advocated a narrow-front assault right on the Karelian isthmus. Additionally, Shaposhnikov argued for a fuller build-up, extensive fire support and logistical preparations, a rational order of battle and the deployment of the army's best units. Zhdanov's military commander, Kirill Meretskov, reported, \"The terrain of coming operations is split by lakes, rivers, swamps, and is almost entirely covered by forests... The proper use of our forces will be difficult\" These doubts were not reflected in Meretskov's troop deployments, and he publicly announced that the Finnish campaign would take two weeks at most.\n\n**Soviet military plan**\n\nBefore the war, Soviet leadership had expected total victory within a few weeks.

Two Finnish divisions were deployed there, the 12th Division led by Lauri Tiainen and the 13th Division led by Hannu Hannuksela. They also had a support group of three brigades, bringing their total strength to over 30,000. The Soviets deployed a division for almost every road leading west to the Finnish border.\n\n**Battles in Kainuu**\n\nThe Suomussalmi–Raate engagement was a double operation, which would later be used by military academics as a classic example of what well-led troops and innovative tactics can do against a much larger adversary. Suomussalmi was a municipality of 4,000 with long lakes, wild forests and few roads. The Finnish command believed that the Soviets would not attack there, but the Red Army committed two divisions to the Kainuu area with orders to cross the wilderness, capture the city of Oulu and effectively cut Finland in two.\n\n**Battles in Finnish Lapland**\n\nThe Finnish area of Lapland, bestriding the Arctic Circle, is sparsely developed, with little daylight and persistent snow-cover during winter; the Finns expected nothing more than raiding parties and reconnaissance patrols. Instead, the Soviets sent full divisions. On 11 December, the Finns rearranged the defence of Lapland and detached the Lapland Group from the North Finland Group. The group was placed under the command of Kurt Wallenius.\n\n**Aerial warfare**\n\nThe USSR enjoyed air superiority throughout the war.

The Baltic Fleet was a coastal defence force which did not have the training, logistical structure, or landing craft to undertake large-scale operations.\n\n**Coastal artillery**\n\nFinnish coastal artillery batteries defended important harbours and naval bases. Most batteries were left over from the Imperial Russian period, with 152 mm guns being the most numerous. Finland attempted to modernise its old guns and installed a number of new batteries, the largest of which featured a 305 mm gun battery on the island of Kuivasaari in front of Helsinki, originally intended to block the Gulf of Finland to Soviet ships with the help of batteries on the Estonian side.\n\n**Soviet breakthrough in February**\n\nJoseph Stalin was not pleased with the results of December 1939 in the Finnish campaign. The Red Army had been humiliated in defeats by smaller Finnish forces. By the third week of the war, Soviet propaganda was already working to explain the failures of the Soviet military to the populace: blaming bad terrain and harsh climate, and falsely claiming that the Mannerheim Line was stronger than the Maginot Line, and that the Americans had sent 1,000 of their best pilots to Finland.\n\n**Red Army reforms and offensive preparations**\n\nThe Soviet General Staff Supreme Command (Stavka) met in April 1940, reviewed the lessons of the Finnish campaign and recommended reforms. The role of frontline political commissars was reduced, and old-fashioned ranks and forms of discipline were reintroduced. Clothing, equipment and tactics for winter operations were improved. Not all of the reforms had been completed when Germans initiated Operation Barbarossa 14 months later.\n\n**Germany**\n\nThe Winter War was a political success for the Germans. Both the Red Army and the League of Nations were humiliated, and the Anglo-French Supreme War Council had been revealed to be chaotic and powerless. German policy of neutrality was unpopular in the homeland, and relations with Italy had suffered. After the Moscow Peace Treaty, Germany improved its ties with Finland, and within two weeks, Finnish-German relations were at the top of the agenda.\n\n**Allies**\n\nThe Winter War laid bare the disorganisation and ineffectiveness of the Red Army and that of the Allies. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council was unable to formulate a workable plan, revealing its unsuitability to make effective war in either Britain or France. This failure led to the collapse of the Third Daladier Government in France and the nomination of Paul Reynaud as the new Prime Minister of France.\n\n**See also**\n\nThe Winter War is a subject of study in military academies around the world.\n\n**Explanatory notes**\n\nThe Winter War is often seen as a precursor to the Continuation War and World War II.\n\n**Citations**\n\nThis article uses some information from Wikipedia, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n\n**General and cited references**\n\n* \"The Winter War, 1939-1940\".

eastern part of the Kingdom of Sweden From 21 February 1808 to 17 September 1809, the Russian Empire waged the Finnish War against the Kingdom of Sweden, ostensibly to protect the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg Eventually Russia conquered and annexed Finland, and converted it into an autonomous buffer state [44] The resulting Grand Duchy of Finland enjoyed wide autonomy within Russia until the end of the 19th century, when Russia began attempts to assimilate Finland as part of a general policy to strengthen the central government and unify the Empire by Russification Those attempts were aborted because of Russia's internal strife, but they ruined Russia's relationship with Finland In addition, support increased in Finland for self-determination movements [45]\n\n\nFinnish-Soviet relations and politics\nUntil the early 19th century, Finland was the eastern part of the Kingdom of Sweden From 21 February 1808 to 17 September 1809, the Russian Empire waged the Finnish War against the Kingdom of Sweden, ostensibly to protect the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg Eventually Russia conquered and annexed Finland, and converted it into an autonomous buffer state [44] The resulting Grand Duchy of Finland enjoyed wide autonomy within Russia until the end of the 19th century, when Russia began attempts to assimilate Finland as part of a general policy to strengthen the central government and unify the Empire by Russification Those attempts were aborted because of Russia's internal strife, but they ruined Russia's relationship with Finland In addition, support increased in Finland for self-determination movements [45]\n\n\nJustification\nSoviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin regarded it a disappointment that the Soviet Union could not halt the Finnish Revolution [55] He thought that the pro-Finland movement in Karelia posed a direct threat to Leningrad and that the area and defences of Finland could be used to invade the Soviet Union or restrict fleet movements [56] Soviet propaganda then painted Finland's leadership as a \"vicious and reactionary fascist clique\" Field Marshal Mannerheim and Väinö Tanner, the leader of the Finnish Social Democratic Party, were targeted for particular scorn [57] When Stalin gained absolute power through the Great Purge of 1938, the Soviets changed their foreign policy toward Finland and began to pursue the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia that had been lost during the chaos of the October Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War almost two decades earlier [58] Soviet leaders believed that the old empire's extended borders provided territorial security and wanted Leningrad, only 32 km (20 mi) from the Finnish border, to enjoy a similar level of security against the rising power of Nazi Germany [59] [60]\n\n\nNegotiations\nIn April 1938, NKVD agent Boris Yartsev contacted Finnish Foreign Minister Rudolf Holsti and Finnish Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, stating that the Soviets did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather \"advance to meet the enemy\" Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad, but Finland refused [61] [62]\n\n\nShelling of Mainila and Soviet intentions\nOn 26 November 1939, an incident was reported near the Soviet village of Mainila, near the border with Finland A Soviet border guard post had been shelled by an unknown party resulting, according to Soviet reports, in the deaths of four and injuries of nine border guards Research conducted by several Finnish and Russian historians later concluded that the shelling was a false flag operation since there were no artillery units there, and it was carried out from the Soviet side of the border by an NKVD unit with the purpose of providing the Soviets with a casus belli and a pretext to withdraw from the non-aggression pact [85] [86] [F 9] Soviet war games held in March 1938 and 1939 had been based on a scenario in which border incidents taking place at the village of Mainila would spark the war [89]\n\n\nSoviet intentions\nIn 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated at a meeting with military historians that the Soviets had launched the Winter War to \"correct mistakes\" made in determining the border with Finland after 1917 [93] Opinion on the scale of the initial Soviet invasion decision is divided The puppet Finnish communist government and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocol is used as proof that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland [F 10]\n\n\nOpposing forces\nBefore the war, Soviet leadership had expected total victory within a few weeks The Red Army had just completed the invasion of eastern Poland at a cost of fewer than 4,000 casualties after Germany attacked Poland from the west Stalin's expectations of a quick Soviet triumph were backed up by politician Andrei Zhdanov and military strategist Kliment Voroshilov, but other generals were more reserved Red Army Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov advocated a narrow-front assault right on the Karelian isthmus [109] Additionally, Shaposhnikov argued for a fuller build-up, extensive fire support and logistical preparations, a rational order of battle and the deployment of the army's best units Zhdanov's military commander, Kirill Meretskov, reported, \"The terrain of coming operations is split by lakes, rivers, swamps, and is almost entirely covered by forests... The proper use of our forces will be difficult\" These doubts were not reflected in Meretskov's troop deployments, and he publicly announced that the Finnish campaign would take two weeks at most Soviet soldiers had even been warned not to cross the border mistakenly into Sweden [110]\n\n\nSoviet military plan\nBefore the war, Soviet leadership had expected total victory within a few weeks The Red Army had just completed the invasion of eastern Poland at a cost of fewer than 4,000 casualties after Germany attacked Poland from the west Stalin's expectations of a quick Soviet triumph were backed up by politician Andrei Zhdanov and military strategist Kliment Voroshilov, but other generals were more reserved Red Army Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov advocated a narrow-front assault right on the Karelian isthmus [109] Additionally, Shaposhnikov argued for a fuller build-up, extensive fire support and logistical preparations, a rational order of battle and the deployment of the army's best units Zhdanov's military commander, Kirill Meretskov, reported, \"The terrain of coming operations is split by lakes, rivers, swamps, and is almost entirely covered by forests... The proper use of our forces will be difficult\" These doubts were not reflected in Meretskov's troop deployments, and he publicly announced that the Finnish campaign would take two weeks at most Soviet soldiers had even been warned not to cross the border mistakenly into Sweden [110]\n\n\nSoviet order of battle\nSoviet generals were impressed by the success of German Blitzkrieg tactics, but they had been tailored to conditions in Central Europe, with its dense well-mapped network of paved roads Armies fighting there had recognised supply and communications centres, which could be easily targeted by armoured vehicle regiments Finnish Army centres, in contrast, were deep inside the country There were no paved roads, and even gravel or dirt roads were scarce Most of the terrain consisted of trackless forests and swamps The war correspondent John Langdon-Davies observed the landscape: \"Every acre of its surface was created to be the despair of an attacking military force\" [120] Waging Blitzkrieg in Finland was a highly-difficult proposition, and according to Trotter, the Red Army failed to meet the level of tactical co-ordination and local initiative that would be required to execute such tactics in Finland [121]\n\n\nFinnish order of battle\nThe Finnish strategy was dictated by geography The 1,340 km (830 mi) border with the Soviet Union was mostly impassable except along a handful of unpaved roads In prewar calculations, the Finnish Defence Command, which had established its wartime headquarters at Mikkeli, [127] had estimated seven Soviet divisions on the Karelian Isthmus and no more than five along the whole border north of Lake Ladoga In the estimation, the manpower ratio would have favoured the attacker by three to one The true ratio was much higher, however, since for example, 12 Soviet divisions were deployed north of Lake Ladoga [132]\n\n\nSoviet invasion\nOn 30 November 1939, Soviet forces invaded Finland with 21 divisions, totalling 450,000 men, and bombed Helsinki, [128] [135] killing about 100 citizens and destroying more than 50 buildings In response to international criticism, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov stated that the Soviet Air Force was not bombing Finnish cities but rather dropping humanitarian aid to the starving Finnish population; the bombs were sarcastically dubbed Molotov bread baskets by Finns [136] [137] The Finnish statesman J K Paasikivi commented that the Soviet attack without a declaration of war violated three separate non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu, which was signed in 1920, the non-aggression pact between Finland and the Soviet Union, which was signed in 1932 and again in 1934; and also the Covenant of the League of Nations, which the Soviet Union signed in 1934 [88] Field Marshal C.G.E Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defence Forces after the Soviet attack In a further reshuffling, Aimo Cajander's caretaker cabinet was replaced by Risto Ryti and his cabinet, with Väinö Tanner as foreign minister because of opposition to Cajander's prewar politics [138] Finland brought the matter of the Soviet invasion before the League of Nations The League expelled the Soviet Union on 14 December 1939 and exhorted its members to aid Finland [139] [140]\n\n\nStart of invasion and political operations\nOn 30 November 1939, Soviet forces invaded Finland with 21 divisions, totalling 450,000 men, and bombed Helsinki, [128] [135] killing about 100 citizens and destroying more than 50 buildings In response to international criticism, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov stated that the Soviet Air Force was not bombing Finnish cities but rather dropping humanitarian aid to the starving Finnish population; the bombs were

the Soviet invasion before the League of Nations The League expelled the Soviet Union on 14 December 1939 and exhorted its members to aid Finland [139] [140]\n\n\nFirst battles and Soviet advance to Mannerheim Line\nThe array of Finnish defence structures that during the war started to be called the Mannerheim Line was located on the Karelian Isthmus approximately 30 to 75 km (19 to 47 mi) from the Soviet border The Red Army soldiers on the Isthmus numbered 250,000, facing 130,000 Finns [143] The Finnish command deployed a defence in depth of about 21,000 men in the area in front of the Mannerheim Line to delay and damage the Red Army before it reached the line [144] In combat, the most severe cause of confusion among Finnish soldiers was Soviet tanks The Finns had few anti-tank weapons and insufficient training in modern anti-tank tactics According to Trotter, the favoured Soviet armoured tactic was a simple frontal charge, the weaknesses of which could be exploited The Finns learned that at close range, tanks could be dealt with in many ways; for example, logs and crowbars jammed into the bogie wheels would often immobilise a tank Soon, Finns fielded a better ad hoc weapon, the Molotov cocktail, a glass bottle filled with flammable liquids and with a simple hand-lit fuse Molotov cocktails were eventually mass-produced by the Finnish Alko alcoholic-beverage corporation and bundled with matches with which to light them 80 Soviet tanks were destroyed in the border zone engagements [145]\n\n\nOperations from December to January\nThe winter of 1939–40 was exceptionally cold with the Karelian Isthmus experiencing a record low temperature of −43 °C (−45 °F) on 16 January 1940 [151] At the beginning of the war, only those Finnish soldiers who were in active service had uniforms and weapons The rest had to make do with their own clothing, which for many soldiers was their normal winter clothing with a semblance of insignia added Finnish soldiers were skilled in cross-country skiing [152] The cold, snow, forest, and long hours of darkness were factors that the Finns could use to their advantage The Finns dressed in layers, and the ski troopers wore a lightweight white snow cape This snow-camouflage made the ski troopers almost invisible so that they could more easily execute guerrilla attacks against Soviet columns At the beginning of the war, Soviet tanks were painted in standard olive drab and men dressed in regular khaki uniforms Not until late January 1940 did the Soviets paint their equipment white and issue snowsuits to their infantry [153]\n\n\nWeather conditions\nThe winter of 1939–40 was exceptionally cold with the Karelian Isthmus experiencing a record low temperature of −43 °C (−45 °F) on 16 January 1940 [151] At the

Soviets paint their equipment white and issue snowsuits to their infantry [153]\n\n\nFinnish guerrilla tactics\nIn battles from Ladoga Karelia to the Arctic port of Petsamo, the Finns used guerrilla tactics The Red Army was superior in numbers and material, but Finns used the advantages of speed, manoeuvre warfare and economy of force Particularly on the Ladoga Karelia front and during the Battle of Raate Road, the Finns isolated smaller portions of numerically superior Soviet forces With Soviet forces divided into smaller groups, the Finns dealt with them individually and attacked from all sides [155]\n\n\nBattles of the Mannerheim Line\nThe terrain on the Karelian Isthmus did not allow guerrilla tactics, so the Finns were forced to resort to the more conventional Mannerheim Line, with its flanks protected by large bodies of water Soviet propaganda claimed that it was as strong as or even stronger than the Maginot Line Finnish historians, for their part, have belittled the line's strength, insisting that it was mostly conventional trenches and log-covered dugouts [157] The Finns had built 221 strong-points along the Karelian Isthmus, mostly in the early 1920s Many were extended in the late 1930s Despite these defensive preparations, even the most fortified section of the Mannerheim Line had only one reinforced-concrete bunker per kilometre Overall, the line was weaker than similar lines in mainland Europe [158] According to the Finns, the real strength of the line was the \"stubborn defenders with a lot of sisu\" – a Finnish idiom roughly translated as \"guts, fighting spirit\" [157]\n\n\nBattles in Ladoga Karelia and North Karelia\nThe strength of the Red Army north of Lake Ladoga in Ladoga Karelia surprised the Finnish Headquarters Two Finnish divisions were deployed there, the 12th Division led by Lauri Tiainen and the 13th Division led by Hannu Hannuksela They also had a support group of three brigades, bringing their total strength to over 30,000 The Soviets deployed a division for almost every road leading west to the Finnish border The 8th Army was led by Ivan Khabarov, who was replaced by Grigory Shtern on 13 December [163] The Soviets' mission was to destroy the Finnish troops in the area of Ladoga Karelia and advance into the area between Sortavala and Joensuu within 10 days The Soviets had a 3:1 advantage in manpower and a 5:1 advantage in artillery, as well as air supremacy [164]\n\n\nBattles in Kainuu\nThe Suomussalmi–Raate engagement was a double operation [176] which would later be used by military academics as a classic example of what well-led troops and innovative tactics can do against a much larger adversary Suomussalmi was a municipality of 4,000 with long lakes, wild forests and few roads The Finnish command believed that the Soviets would not attack there, but the Red Army committed two divisions to the Kainuu area with orders to cross the wilderness, capture the city of Oulu and effectively cut Finland in two There were two roads leading to Suomussalmi from the frontier: the northern Juntusranta road and the southern Raate road [177]\n\n\nBattles in Finnish Lapland\nThe Finnish area of Lapland, bestriding the Arctic Circle, is sparsely developed, with little daylight and persistent snow-cover during winter; the Finns expected nothing more than raiding parties and reconnaissance patrols Instead, the Soviets sent full divisions [183] On 11 December, the Finns rearranged the defence of Lapland and detached the Lapland Group from the North Finland Group The group was placed under the command of Kurt Wallenius [184]\n\n\nAerial warfare\nThe USSR enjoyed air superiority throughout the war The Soviet Air Force, supporting the Red Army's invasion with about 2,500 aircraft (the most common type being Tupolev SB), was not as effective as the Soviets might have hoped The material damage by the bomb raids was slight as Finland offered few valuable targets for strategic bombing For example, the city of Tampere was one of the most important targets because it was an important railway junction, and also housed State Aircraft Factory and the Tampere Linen and Iron Industry premises, which manufactured munitions and weapons, including grenade launchers [187] [188] Often, targets were village depots with little value The country had few modern highways in the interior, therefore making the railways the main targets for bombers Rail tracks were cut thousands of times but the Finns hastily repaired them and service resumed within a matter of hours [10] The Soviet Air Force learned from its early mistakes, and by late February instituted more effective tactics [189]\n\n\nSoviet Air Force\nThe USSR enjoyed air superiority throughout the war The Soviet Air

beginning of the war, Finland had a small air force, with only 114 combat planes fit for duty Missions were limited, and fighter aircraft were mainly used to repel Soviet bombers Strategic bombings doubled as opportunities for military reconnaissance Old-fashioned and few in number, aircraft offered little support for Finnish ground troops In spite of losses, the number of planes in the Finnish Air Force rose by over 50 per cent by the end of the war [192] The Finns received shipments of British, French, Italian, Swedish and American aircraft [193]\n\n\nNaval warfare\nThere was little naval activity during the Winter War The Baltic Sea began to freeze over by the end of December, impeding the movement of warships; by mid-winter, only ice breakers and submarines could still move The other reason for low naval activity was the nature of Soviet Navy forces in the area The Baltic Fleet was a coastal defence force which did not have the training, logistical structure, or landing craft to undertake large-scale operations The Baltic Fleet possessed two battleships, one heavy cruiser, almost 20 destroyers, 50 motor torpedo boats, 52 submarines, and other miscellaneous vessels The Soviets used naval bases in Paldiski, Tallinn and Liepāja for their operations [195]\n\n\nNaval activity\nThere was little naval activity during the Winter War The Baltic Sea began to freeze over by the end

(6.0 in) guns being the most numerous Finland attempted to modernise its old guns and installed a number of new batteries, the largest of which featured a 305 mm (12.0 in) gun battery on the island of Kuivasaari in front of Helsinki, originally intended to block the Gulf of Finland to Soviet ships with the help of batteries on the Estonian side [198]\n\n\nSoviet breakthrough in February\nJoseph Stalin was not pleased with the results of December 1939 in the Finnish campaign The Red Army had been humiliated in defeats by smaller Finnish forces By the third week of the war, Soviet propaganda was already working to explain the failures of the Soviet military to the populace: blaming bad terrain and harsh climate, and falsely claiming that the Mannerheim Line was stronger than the Maginot Line, and that the Americans had sent 1,000 of their best pilots to Finland However, the Soviets were confronted with the unavoidable reality of the poor performance of their troops against the Finns Stalin in particular was concerned about the effects of the war on Soviet reputation [201] In late December, the Soviets decided to reduce their strategic objectives and focused on bringing the war to an end [202]\n\n\nRed Army reforms and offensive preparations\nJoseph Stalin was not pleased with the results of December 1939 in the Finnish campaign The Red Army had been humiliated in defeats by

decided to reduce their strategic objectives and focused on bringing the war to an end [202]\n\n\nSoviet offensive on the Karelian Isthmus\nAlthough the Karelian Isthmus front was less active in January than in December, the Soviets increased bombardments, wearing down the defenders and softening their fortifications During daylight hours, the Finns took shelter inside their fortifications from the bombardments and repaired damage during the night The situation led quickly to war exhaustion among the Finns, who lost over 3,000 soldiers in trench warfare The Soviets also made occasional small infantry assaults with one or two companies [206] Because of the shortage of ammunition, Finnish artillery emplacements were under orders to fire only against directly threatening ground attacks On 1 February, the Soviets further escalated their artillery and air bombardments [205]\n\n\nPeace negotiations\nAlthough the Finns attempted to re-open negotiations with Moscow by every means during the war, the Soviets did not respond In early January, Finnish communist Hella Wuolijoki contacted the Finnish Government She offered to contact Moscow through the Soviet Union's ambassador to Sweden, Alexandra Kollontai Wuolijoki departed for Stockholm and met Kollontai secretly at a hotel On 29 January, Molotov put an end to the puppet Terijoki Government and recognized the Ryti–Tanner government as the legal government of Finland, informing it that the USSR was willing to negotiate peace [39] [212]\n\n\nEnd of war in March\nOn 5 March, the Red Army advanced 10 to 15 km (6.2 to 9.3 mi) past the Mannerheim Line and entered the suburbs of Viipuri The same day, the Red Army established a beachhead on the Western Gulf of Viipuri The Finns proposed an armistice on 6 March, but the Soviets, wanting to keep the pressure on the Finnish government, declined the offer The Finnish peace delegation travelled to Moscow via Stockholm and arrived on 7 March They were disappointed to find that Stalin was not present during peace negotiations, likely due to the Red Army's humiliation by the Finns [216] The Soviets had further demands, as their military position was strong and improving On 9 March, the Finnish military situation on the Karelian Isthmus was dire, as troops were experiencing heavy casualties Artillery ammunition was exhausted and weapons were wearing out The Finnish government, realizing that the hoped-for Franco-British military expedition would not arrive in time, as Norway and Sweden had not given the Allies right of passage, had little choice but to accept the Soviet terms [219] Finnish President Kyösti Kallio resisted the idea of giving up any territory to the Soviet Union, but eventually agreed to sign the Moscow Peace Treaty When he signed the document, the tormented president uttered the well-known words: \"Let the hand wither that signs this monstrous treaty!\" [220]\n\n\nMoscow Peace Treaty\nThe Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in Moscow on 12 March 1940 A cease-fire took effect the next day at noon Leningrad time, 11 a.m Helsinki time [221] [222] With it, Finland ceded the Karelian Isthmus and most of Ladoga Karelia The area included Viipuri (Finland's second-largest city  [Population Register] or fourth-largest city  [Church and Civil Register], depending on the census data [223]), much of Finland's industrialised territory, and significant land still held by Finland's military – all in all, nine per cent of Finnish territory The ceded territory included 13 per cent of Finland's economic assets [224] 12 per cent of Finland's population, 422,000 to 450,000 Karelians, were evacuated and lost their homes [225] [226] [227] Finland also ceded a part of the region of Salla, the Rybachy Peninsula in the Barents Sea, and four islands in the Gulf of Finland The Hanko peninsula was leased to the Soviet Union as a military base for 30 years The region of Petsamo, captured by the Red Army during the war, was returned to Finland according to the treaty [228]\n\n\nForeign support\nWorld opinion largely supported the Finnish cause, and the Soviet aggression was generally deemed unjustified World War II had not yet directly affected France, the United Kingdom or the United States; the Winter War was practically the only conflict in Europe at that time and thus held major world interest Several foreign organisations sent material aid, and many countries granted credit and military materiel to Finland Nazi Germany allowed arms to pass through its territory to Finland, but after a Swedish newspaper made this public, Adolf Hitler initiated a policy of silence towards Finland, as part of improved German–Soviet relations following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact [231]\n\n\nForeign

overtures from the anti-Soviet Russian All-Military Union (ROVS) for aid Nevertheless, Mannerheim eventually agreed to establish a small Russian detachment (Russkaya narodnaya armiya, RNA) of 200 men after being introduced to Boris Bazhanov, a high-ranking ROVS member, in person in January 1940 The project was deemed top secret, and was under the auspices of the intelligence division of the Finnish army headquarters [235]\n\n\nFranco-British intervention plans\nFrance had been one of the earliest supporters of Finland during the Winter War The French saw an opportunity to weaken Germany's resource imports via a Finnish counteroffensive, as both Sweden and the Soviet Union were strategic trading partners to Germany France had another motive, preferring to have a major war in a remote part of Europe rather than on French soil France planned to re‑arm the Polish exile units and transport them to the Finnish Arctic port of Petsamo Another proposal was a massive air strike with Turkish co-operation against the Caucasus oil fields [236]\n\n\nAftermath and casualties\nThe 105-day war had a profound and depressing effect in Finland Meaningful international support was minimal and arrived late, and the German blockade had prevented most armament shipments [244] The 15-month period between the Winter War and Operation Barbarossa, part of which was the Continuation War, was later called the Interim Peace [228] After the end of the war, the situation of the Finnish Army on the Karelian Isthmus became a subject of debate in Finland Orders had already been issued to prepare a retreat to the next line of defence in the Taipale sector Estimates of how long the Red Army could have been delayed by retreat-and-stand operations varied from a few days to a few weeks, [245] [246] or to a couple of months at most [247]\n\n\nFinland\nThe 105-day war had a profound and depressing effect in Finland Meaningful international support was minimal and arrived late, and the German

most [247]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nThe Soviet General Staff Supreme Command (Stavka) met in April 1940, reviewed the lessons of the Finnish campaign and recommended reforms The role of frontline political commissars was reduced, and old-fashioned ranks and forms of discipline were reintroduced Clothing, equipment and tactics for winter operations were improved Not all of the reforms had been completed when Germans initiated Operation Barbarossa 14 months later [256]\n\n\nGermany\nThe Winter War was a political success for the Germans Both the Red Army and the League of Nations were humiliated, and the Anglo-French Supreme War Council had been revealed to be chaotic and powerless The German policy of neutrality was unpopular in the homeland, and relations with Italy had suffered After the Moscow Peace Treaty, Germany improved its ties with Finland, and within two weeks, Finnish-German relations were at the top of the agenda [264] [36] More importantly, the very poor performance of the Red Army convinced Hitler that an invasion of the Soviet Union would be successful In June 1941, Hitler declared, \"we have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down\" [265]\n\n\nAllies\nThe Winter War laid bare the disorganisation and ineffectiveness of the Red Army and that of the Allies The Anglo-French Supreme War Council was unable to formulate a workable plan, revealing its unsuitability to make effective war in either Britain or France This failure led to the collapse of the Third Daladier Government in France and the nomination of Paul Reynaud as the new Prime Minister of France [266]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n\n\nEnglish\n\n\nFinnish, Russian and other

Diab described it as a \"beautiful score that is Egyptian, but it's international at its core, it's universal\" [58] Nazih's themes for Moon Knight and Harrow \"chase [d] one another and sometimes collided\" [124]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first footage of the series debuted on Disney+ Day on November 12, 2021 [128] [129] A trailer was then released on January 17, 2022, during the 2021–22 NFL playoffs, [130] with James Whitbrook at Gizmodo noting that it gave a full look at the character following the brief Disney+ Day footage He said the costume was faithful to the comic book version, \"albeit more textured-looking\" [130] Daniel Chin from The Ringer highlighted the use of the song \"Day 'n' Nite\" by Kid Cudi, and felt that Moon Knight was \"shaping up to be one of  [Marvel's] darkest and most distinctive projects to date\", due to its darker tone, incorporation of horror elements, depiction of violence, and how the series introduced a new character into the MCU rather than focus on previously established characters [131] Richard Newby at The Hollywood Reporter felt the trailer was \"relish [ing]\" in the general audience's lack of knowledge about the character by maintaining a sense of mystery He also felt the series looked like it would be one of the darkest and most original projects from Marvel Studios, [72] which was echoed by his colleagues Aaron Couch and Borys Kit, who said the trailer suggested \"something unlike any other Marvel show\" [132] Isaac's British accent for the Steven Grant identity received mixed responses from viewers, and Isaac himself made fun of it in a video where he and Hawke reacted to the trailer Isaac later said the accent was intentionally unconvincing [4] The trailer was viewed over 75 million times in 24 hours, which was better than trailers for Marvel Studios' other Disney+ series, except The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's Super Bowl LV trailer which had 125 million views Additionally, its social engagement of 263,000 mentions were the highest of any Disney+ Marvel series for their first content release [132] An additional trailer aired during Super Bowl LVI on February 13, [133] which continued to keep the series mysterious while depicting its \"darker sensibilities\", according to Screen Rant's Rachel Labonte [134] Ben F Silverio of /Film said the shots of Moon Knight's cape \"flung out into the shape of a crescent moon\" and the character catching his moon-shaped weapons were the \"coolest\" [135] RelishMix reported the trailer had 9.49 million views in 24 hours across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram [136]\n\n\nRelease\nMoon Knight debuted on Disney+ on March 30, 2022 [146] It consists of six episodes, [55] releasing weekly until May 4 [147] A special screening occurred on March 16 at Cine Capitol in Madrid, [148] and on March 17 at the British Museum in London, [149] with the red carpet premiere on March 22 at El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles [150] [151] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU [152]\n\n\nStreaming\nMoon Knight debuted on Disney+ on March 30, 2022 [146] It consists of six episodes, [55] releasing weekly until May 4 [147] A special screening occurred on March 16 at Cine Capitol in Madrid, [148] and on March 17 at the British Museum in London, [149] with the red carpet premiere on March 22 at El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles [150] [151] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU [152]\n\n\nHome media\nMoon Knight was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 30, 2024, with SteelBook packaging and concept art cards Bonus features include the featurette \"Egyptology\";

Diab described it as a \"beautiful score that is Egyptian, but it's international at its core, it's universal\" [58] Nazih's themes for Moon Knight and Harrow \"chase [d] one another and sometimes collided\" [124]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first footage of the series debuted on Disney+ Day on November 12, 2021 [128] [129] A trailer was then released on January 17, 2022, during the 2021–22 NFL playoffs, [130] with James Whitbrook at Gizmodo noting that it gave a full look at the character following the brief Disney+ Day footage He said the costume was faithful to the comic book version, \"albeit more textured-looking\" [130] Daniel Chin from The Ringer highlighted the use of the song \"Day 'n' Nite\" by Kid Cudi, and felt that Moon Knight was \"shaping up to be one of  [Marvel's] darkest and most distinctive projects to date\", due to its darker tone, incorporation of horror elements, depiction of violence, and how the series introduced a new character into the MCU rather than focus on previously established characters [131] Richard Newby at The Hollywood Reporter felt the trailer was \"relish [ing]\" in the general audience's lack of knowledge about the character by maintaining a sense of mystery He also felt the series looked like it would be one of the darkest and most original projects from Marvel Studios, [72] which was echoed by his colleagues Aaron Couch and Borys Kit, who said the trailer suggested \"something unlike any other Marvel show\" [132] Isaac's British accent for the Steven Grant identity received mixed responses from viewers, and Isaac himself made fun of it in a video where he and Hawke reacted to the trailer Isaac later said the accent was intentionally unconvincing [4] The trailer was viewed over 75 million times in 24 hours, which was better than trailers for Marvel Studios' other Disney+ series, except The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's Super Bowl LV trailer which had 125 million views Additionally, its social engagement of 263,000 mentions were the highest of any Disney+ Marvel series for their first content release [132] An additional trailer aired during Super Bowl LVI on February 13, [133] which continued to keep the series mysterious while depicting its \"darker sensibilities\", according to Screen Rant's Rachel Labonte [134] Ben F Silverio of /Film said the shots of Moon Knight's cape \"flung out into the shape of a crescent moon\" and the character catching his moon-shaped weapons were the \"coolest\" [135] RelishMix reported the trailer had 9.49 million views in 24 hours across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram [136]\n\n\nRelease\nMoon Knight debuted on Disney+ on March 30, 2022 [146] It consists of six episodes, [55] releasing weekly until May 4 [147] A special screening occurred on March 16 at Cine Capitol in Madrid, [148] and on March 17 at the British Museum in London, [149] with the red carpet premiere on March 22 at El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles [150] [151] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU [152]\n\n\nStreaming\nMoon Knight debuted on Disney+ on March 30, 2022 [146] It consists of six episodes, [55] releasing weekly until May 4 [147] A special screening occurred on March 16 at Cine Capitol in Madrid, [148] and on March 17 at the British Museum in London, [149] with the red carpet premiere on March 22 at El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles [150] [151] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU [152]\n\n\nHome media\nMoon Knight was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 30, 2024, with SteelBook packaging and concept art cards Bonus features include the featurette \"Egyptology\";

Franklin**\n\nC.L. Franklin was a prominent American Baptist minister, civil rights activist, and father of the legendary singer Aretha Franklin. He was a prominent figure in Detroit's African American community, and his life was marked by both personal and professional triumphs, as well as challenges and tragedies.\n\n**Life**\n\nClarence LaVaughn Walker was born in Bolivar County, Mississippi, to sharecroppers Willie and Rachel (née Pittman) Walker. His father, Willie, was a World War I veteran who taught Clarence to salute when he returned from service in 1919. However, Willie abandoned the family when Clarence was just four years old. The next year, Rachel married Henry Franklin, whose surname the family adopted. This marked the beginning of Clarence's life under the name C.L. Franklin.\n\nFranklin's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. His family struggled to make ends meet, and he often had to rely on the charity of others to get by. Despite these challenges, Franklin's parents instilled in him a strong sense of faith and a commitment to social justice. These values would shape his life and work as a minister and civil rights activist.\n\n**Ministerial Career**\n\nFranklin's ministerial career began in the 1930s, when he was ordained as a Baptist minister. He quickly gained a reputation as a powerful and charismatic preacher, known for his ability to connect with his congregation and inspire them to action. Franklin's sermons often focused on issues of social justice and equality, and he was a vocal advocate for civil rights and human rights.\n\nFranklin's ministry took him to various churches in the South, where he worked to empower African Americans and promote social change. He was a key figure in the Civil Rights Movement, working closely with other prominent activists such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Franklin's ministry expanded to include television and radio appearances. He was a popular guest on TV shows and radio programs, using his platform to spread his message of love and social justice.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nFranklin's personal life was marked by both love and tragedy. He married his first wife, Alene Gaines, in 1934, when he was just 18 years old. However, the marriage ended in divorce in 1936. Franklin then married gospel singer Barbara Siggers in 1936, with whom he had four children: Erma, Cecil, Aretha, and Carolyn.\n\nFranklin's family life was not without its challenges. He fathered a daughter, Carl Ellan Kelley, by Mildred Jennings, a 12-year-old member of his congregation. Carl Ellan was born in 1940, during Franklin's tenure at New Salem Baptist Church in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n**Assault, Death, and Legacy**\n\nOn June 10, 1979, Franklin was shot twice at point-blank range during what was believed to have been an attempted robbery at his home on Detroit's West Side.

The paper was created by a group of dissenters from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also known as the Mormons, who were opposed to the teachings and practices of Joseph Smith, the church's founder and leader.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn 1830, Joseph Smith, then 24 years old, published the Book of Mormon, which he claimed was an English translation of ancient golden plates he had received from an angel. The same year, he organized the Church of Christ, which was later renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Smith and his followers sought to establish a theocratic community under his leadership, or \"Zion,\" first in Kirtland, Ohio, and later in Independence, Missouri.\n\n**Origins**\n\nDespite being married to Emma Hale since 1827, Smith had been secretly marrying his followers, including women who were already married to other men. This practice, known as polygamy, was considered adultery and was a crime in the United States. Smith's secret marriages led to accusations of adultery, which ultimately contributed to the creation of the Nauvoo Expositor.\n\n**Key Stone Store meeting**\n\nIn mid-March 1844, Joseph Jackson attempted to recruit two Nauvoo men, Marenus G. Eaton and Abiathar Williams, with stories about Smith's alleged mistreatment of women. The pair attended a meeting in the back room of a grocery store, where they were joined by William Law, Robert D. Foster, and others. This meeting marked the beginning of the dissenters' efforts to expose Smith's alleged wrongdoings.\n\n**General conference and exaltation**\n\nOn April 6, 1844, Law notified Smith and some members of the Twelve that he desired an investigation before the Church General Conference. Smith, however, refused to hold an investigation, which further enraged the dissenters.\n\n**Continued strife**\n\nOn April 13, Smith questioned Robert Foster in Municipal Court, accusing him of abusing Smith's character and conspiring against his peace and safety. Foster declined to testify, and Smith brought charges against him.\n\n**Expositor announced**\n\nOn April 28, the anti-polygamist dissenters held a meeting, where they announced their intention to publish a newspaper, the Nauvoo Expositor. William Law and Charles Ivins were reportedly named to leadership.\n\n**Criminal indictment of Joseph Smith**\n\nOn May 23, a grand jury from the Hancock County Circuit Court issued a criminal indictment against Smith on charges of perjury, based on the statements of Joseph Jackson and Robert Foster. A second indictment, for \"fornication and adultery,\" was issued based on the statements of William and Wilson Law, who swore that Smith had been living with Maria Lawrence in an open state of adultery.\n\n**Contents**\n\nThe only issue of the Nauvoo Expositor, dated June 7, 1844, was a four-page publication. In addition to more mundane content, such as poetry and marriage announcements, it contained a statement from the \"Seceders from the Church at Nauvoo\" and sworn statements from multiple individuals attesting to the teaching of \"the plurality of wives.\" The Expositor also included a prospectus from the publishers, advocating for major reforms, including the repeal of the Nauvoo City Charter.\n\n**Prospectus from publishers**\n\nIn their prospectus, the publishers vowed to \"decry moral imperfections\" wherever found, \"whether in the Plebeian, Patrician, or self-constituted monarch.\" They also stated that they would maintain their belief in \"the religion of the Latter Day Saints, as originally taught by Joseph Smith.\"\n\n**Statement from seceders**\n\nThe preamble to the Expositor established that the authors were seceding from the church because they believed Smith had departed from the original teachings of the faith.\n\n**Affidavits**\n\nThe Expositor contained affidavits alleging that Smith had received a revelation authorizing certain men to have more wives than one at a time. Statements were made by William Law, his wife Jane, and Austin Cowles.\n\n**Reception and destruction**\n\nThe destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor was a pivotal event in the history of the LDS Church. On June 10, 1844, a group of men, including Smith's brother-in-law, William Marks, and other church leaders, destroyed the printing press and the only issue of the Expositor. The destruction was carried out by a mob, and it was widely condemned by outsiders.\n\n**Aftermath of the destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor**\n\nSeeking relief from the state courts, Francis M. Higbee, one of the Expositor's publishers, gave a sworn statement about the events of June 10. Non-Mormons in Hancock County were infuriated when they heard of the news of the destruction of the Expositor, believing that it was an example of Mormon disregard for their laws. Many of them, including the neighboring newspapers, Quincy Whig and Warsaw Signal, called for the arrest of the Mormon leaders.\n\n**First arrest attempt**\n\nConstable David Bettisworth was tasked with arresting Smith and conveying him to the Hancock County Court. On June 12, Bettisworth served Smith with the warrant. Rather than return with Bettisworth to the Hancock County Court, Smith instead petitioned the Municipal Court of Nauvoo to dismiss the charges.\n\n**Martial law in Nauvoo**\n\nSmith declared martial law on June 18 and called out the Nauvoo Legion, an organized city militia of about 5,000 men. On June 20, the Warsaw Signal reported that recent travelers had been told they could not leave the city without a pass.\n\n**Surrender and killing of the Smiths**\n\nOn June 25, 1844, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, along with the other fifteen co-defendants, surrendered to Bettisworth on the original charge of inciting a riot. An arraignment was held on the rioting charge, and Justice Robert F. Smith granted bail of $500 for each of the defendants.\n\n**Succession**\n\nSometime between June 23 and June 27, 1844, Smith reportedly stated that \"if he and Hyrum were taken away, Samuel H. Smith would be his successor.\" In a meeting on July 10, 1844, Samuel H. Smith reminded the group that he was Joseph's designee as president if both Joseph and Hyrum had died.\n\n**Murder trial**\n\nFive individuals were indicted for Smith's death: Thomas C. Sharp, publisher of the Warsaw Signal; Levi Williams, commander of the 59th Regiment of the Illinois militia; Mark Aldrich, commander of the Warsaw Independent Battalion; William N. Grover, captain of the Warsaw Rifle Company; and Jacob C. Davis, commander of the Warsaw Cadets. All were acquitted.\n\n**Repeal of Nauvoo Charter and Exodus**\n\nAt the next session of the Illinois state legislature, the following December, the Nauvoo Charter was repealed by a vote of 25–14 in the Senate and 75–31 in the House. This disincorporated the City of Nauvoo and dissolved its municipal institutions. Nauvoo municipal assets were court-ordered to be placed in receivership.\n\n**Mormon views**\n\nWhile most scholars agree that the destruction of the press was illegal, some Mormons have defended the destruction of the Expositor by Smith and the council, while other Mormons view the destruction as illegal.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n* April 6, 1844: William Law notifies Joseph Smith and some members of the Twelve that he desires an investigation before the Church General Conference.\n* April 13, 1844: Smith questions Robert Foster in Municipal Court, accusing him of abusing Smith's character and conspiring against his peace and safety.\n* April 28, 1844: The anti-polygamist dissenters hold a meeting, where they announce their intention to publish a newspaper, the Nauvoo Expositor.\n* May 23, 1844: A grand jury from the Hancock County Circuit Court issues a criminal indictment against Smith on charges of perjury.\n* June 7, 1844: The Nauvoo Expositor is published.\n* June 10, 1844: The printing press and the only issue of the Expositor are destroyed by a mob.\n* June 12, 1844: Constable David Bettisworth serves Smith with a warrant.\n* June 18, 1844: Smith declares martial law and calls out the Nauvoo Legion.\n* June 20, 1844: The Warsaw Signal reports that recent travelers had been told they could not leave the city without a pass.\n* June 25, 1844: Joseph and Hyrum Smith surrender to Bettisworth on the original charge of inciting a riot.\n* July 10, 1844: Samuel H.

eighteenth birthday in New York City [68]\n\n\n2009–2010: Graffiti and mixtapes\nIn 2008, Brown began work on his third studio album, announced to be called Graffiti, promising to experiment with a different musical direction inspired by singers Prince and Michael Jackson He stated, \"I wanted to change it up and really be different Like my style nowadays, I don't try to be typical urban I want to be like how Prince, Michael and Stevie Wonder were They can cross over to any genre of music.\" [80] Following the domestic violence scandal involving Brown and his then-girlfriend Rihanna on February 8, 2009, a major part of mass media took positions against the singer The scandal also caused Brown to lose significant endorsements, including the one with Doublemint, with some music stations across the United States briefly banning Brown's songs [81] The singer later participated in numerous television appearances during the year to express himself publicly about it He spoke about it to ABC News: \"I never ever had problems with anger No, no domestic violence with any of my past girlfriends or any altercations I never was that kind of person I look at it, and it's really, like really difficult It's like, 'How could I be that person?'\" [82] In the 2017 self-documentary, Welcome to My Life, Brown says his reputation dropped sharply after his 2009 assault on Rihanna, \"I went from being on top of the world, number one songs, being kind of like America's sweetheart, to being public enemy number one.\" [83] Graffiti's lead single \"I Can Transform Ya\" was released on September 29, 2009 The song peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart \"Crawl\" was released as the album's second single on November 23, 2009 The song reached number 53 on the Billboard

exception of the song \"I'll Go\", written and produced by Brian Kennedy and James Fauntleroy) He said that his decision to entirely direct and write his albums and songs came from the fact that he wanted to give his \"own perspective of the music  [he] wanted to make\" and by his wanting to \"verbalize whatever  [he] was going through\" Critics noted that with the album's sound Brown aimed to expand his music beyond the genres of his previous works [84] According to Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times, the album is made of an \"upbeat\" part, that \"can be considered the sonic sequel to \"Forever\"\", mixed with power ballads, observed to express his remorse and feelings following the Rihanna incident [85] The album, compared to its two predecessors, was a commercial and critical failure, debuting at number 7 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 102,000 copies in its first week, [86] and receiving generally negative reviews from critics [71] Despite this, Graffiti was nominated for two Grammy Awards; including one for the Best Contemporary R&B Album and the other for the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for the track, \"Take My Time\" featuring

It also reached number one on the US Hot Rap Songs chart [93] The single became the best-selling rap song of 2011, as well as one of all-time best-selling singles in the United States Stereogum while critiquing Brown's public image during a review, praised his musical ability and the track, stating that \"It brings me no joy to report that “Look At Me Now” is a 10\" [94]\n\n\n2013–2015: X and Royalty\nAfter concluding his Carpe Diem Tour in 2012, Brown's next studio album started to develop On February 15, 2013, the singer unofficially released the song \"Home\", where he expresses a reflection on the dark side of fame, and how the only moment of respite from that thought is when he returns to the neighborhood where he grew up with people who knew him from the start [107] On March 26, 2013, Brown announced the release of X, in various interviews and listening sessions [108] In an interview with Ebony, Brown spoke of taking his music in a different direction and changing his

Tupac, Lil' Wayne and Rakim as his hip hop influences [269]\n\n\nMusical style\nBrown's musical style typically blends the traditional sound of R&B with different influences from other genres, most importantly pop and hip hop [135] His pure side of R&B is densely shown throughout his discography, being exemplified by songs like \"No BS\", \"Don't Judge Me\", \"Back to Sleep\" and \"WE (Warm Embrace)\" Music critics have commended Brown's musical contribution, recognizing his versatility, [270] [271] and considering him an evolver of R&B music [272] Lyana Robertson of Vibe, talking about his introduction to the genre, said: \"As traditional R&B flourished around him, the young singer began an evolution of the genre\" She saw his debut single \"Run It!\" as a \"prelude to what Brown would continue to do for the next decade: relentlessly disrupt the constructs of rhythm and blues.\" By his second album Exclusive, she says he was \"tapping more electric up-tempos, swimming deep in hip-hop waters and annihilating the pop arena\" Describing the Grammy Award winning F.A.M.E as \"his most diverse offering to date\", containing songs that mixed many genres including R&B, pop, hip hop, dancehall, rock and Europop, she remarked \"There was no level of musical flexibility comparable There still isn't.\" [272] F.A.M.E is considered to be the album that defined Brown's musical style and persona [273] Fortune was noted for featuring a more electronic musical direction, containing genres such as house music and EDM [274] According to AllMusic, different tracks of the X album

having some introspections over the dark side of fame [15] [280] Along with his vocal and dancing abilities, his songwriting is considered to be one of the things that distincts him for the better compared to other R&B singers of his time [281] American media executive and radio personality Ebro Darden stated that Brown is the \"most all-around talented person in R&B Trey Songz is talented, but he can't dance like Chris Brown Usher is probably the only one that could come close to him, but he doesn't have the songwriting abilities that Chris Brown has\" [282]\n\n\nVoice\nBrown possesses a light lyric tenor voice, which spans three and a half octaves, rising from the bass F♯ (F2) to its peak at the soprano C♯.(C♯6) [286] [better source needed] His vocal ability was first recognized by

music career [53]\n\n\n2005–2006: Chris Brown and acting debut\nAfter signing to Jive Records in 2004, Brown began recording his self-titled debut studio album in February 2005 By May, there were 50 songs already recorded, 14 of which were picked to the final track listing [40] He has worked with producers and songwriters Scott Storch, Cool & Dre, Sean Garrett, Jazze Pha, and others, and has said that they \"really believed in  [him]\" [56] Brown co-wrote half of the tracks [40] \"I write about the things that 16 year olds go through every day,\" he said in 2009 \"Like you just got in trouble for sneaking your girl into the house, or you can't drive, so you steal a car or something.\" [57] The whole album took less than eight weeks to produce [57] In 2023, Brown described working on his first album as a \"learning experience\", recalling that he felt \"insecure\" about releasing \"Run It!\" as his first single [44]\n\n\n2007–2008: Exclusive\nIn January 2007, Brown landed a small role as a band geek in the fourth season of the American television series The O.C. [66] Brown then made his film debut in Stomp the Yard, alongside Ne-Yo, Meagan Good and Columbus Short on January 12, 2007 [67] In April 2007, Brown was the opening act for Beyoncé, on the Australian leg of her The Beyoncé Experience tour On July 9, 2007, Brown was featured in an episode of MTV's My Super Sweet 16 (for the event, it was retitled: Chris Brown: My Super 18) celebrating his eighteenth birthday in New York City [68]\n\n\n2009–2010: Graffiti and mixtapes\nIn 2008, Brown began work on his third studio album, announced to be called Graffiti, promising to experiment with a different musical direction inspired by singers Prince and Michael Jackson He stated, \"I wanted to change it up and really be different Like my style nowadays, I don't try to be typical urban I want to be like how Prince, Michael and Stevie Wonder were They can cross over to any genre of music.\" [80] Following the domestic violence scandal involving Brown and his then-girlfriend Rihanna on February 8, 2009, a major part of mass media took positions against the singer The scandal also caused Brown to lose significant endorsements, including the one with Doublemint, with some music stations across the United States briefly banning Brown's songs [81] The singer later participated in numerous television appearances during the year to express himself publicly about it He spoke about it to ABC News: \"I never ever had problems with anger No, no domestic violence with any of my past girlfriends or any altercations I never was that kind of person I look at it, and it's really, like really difficult It's like, 'How could I be that person?'\" [82] In the 2017 self-documentary, Welcome to My Life, Brown says his reputation dropped sharply after his 2009 assault on Rihanna, \"I went from being on top of the world, number one songs, being kind of like America's sweetheart, to being public enemy number one.\" [83] Graffiti's lead single \"I Can Transform Ya\" was released on

exception of the song \"I'll Go\", written and produced by Brian Kennedy and James Fauntleroy) He said that his decision to entirely direct and write his albums and songs came from the fact that he wanted to give his \"own perspective of the music  [he] wanted to make\" and by his wanting to \"verbalize whatever  [he] was going through\" Critics noted that with the album's sound Brown aimed to expand his music beyond the genres of his previous works [84] According to Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times, the album is made of an \"upbeat\" part, that \"can be considered the sonic sequel to \"Forever\"\", mixed with power ballads, observed to express his remorse and feelings following the Rihanna incident [85] The album, compared to its two predecessors, was a commercial and critical failure, debuting at number 7 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 102,000 copies in its first week, [86] and receiving generally negative reviews from critics [71] Despite this, Graffiti was nominated for two Grammy Awards; including one for the Best Contemporary R&B Album and the other for the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for the track, \"Take My Time\" featuring

It'\", [264] while Billboard complimented his appearance by calling it \"a modern way to channel the King of Pop\" [265] Usher is also another influence who comes across as a more contemporary figure

then Chris Brown couldn't exist\" [267] Other influences include Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Ginuwine, Phil Collins, Bobby Brown and R Kelly [268] He has cited Naughty by Nature, Tupac, Lil' Wayne and

Tupac, Lil' Wayne and Rakim as his hip hop influences [269]\n\n\nMusical style\nBrown's musical style typically blends the traditional sound of R&B with different influences from other genres, most importantly pop and hip hop [135] His pure side of R&B is densely shown throughout his discography, being exemplified by songs like \"No BS\", \"Don't Judge Me\", \"Back to Sleep\" and \"WE (Warm Embrace)\" Music critics have commended Brown's musical contribution, recognizing his versatility, [270] [271] and considering him an evolver of R&B music [272] Lyana Robertson of Vibe, talking about his introduction to the genre, said: \"As traditional R&B flourished around him, the young singer began an evolution of the genre\" She saw his debut single \"Run It!\" as a \"prelude to what Brown would continue to do for the next decade: relentlessly disrupt the constructs of rhythm and blues.\" By his second album Exclusive, she says he was \"tapping more electric up-tempos, swimming deep in hip-hop waters and annihilating the pop arena\" Describing the Grammy Award winning F.A.M.E as \"his most diverse offering to date\", containing songs that mixed many genres including R&B, pop, hip hop, dancehall, rock and Europop, she remarked \"There was no level of musical flexibility comparable There still isn't.\" [272] F.A.M.E is considered to be the album that defined Brown's musical style and persona [273] Fortune was noted for featuring a more electronic musical direction, containing genres such as house music and EDM [274] According to AllMusic, different tracks of the X album are \"soul-driven\", while on others \"Brown combines memorable hooks with some stellar production work on rubbery disco-funk\" [275] Disco and funk are also showcased on singles like \"Zero\" and

typically considered to be \"emotional\" or \"hedonistic\" [12] [13] [14] His songs mainly cover themes of sex, desire, regret, romantic love, heartbreak, recklessness and internal conflict, also having some introspections over the dark side of fame [15] [280] Along with his vocal and dancing abilities, his songwriting is considered to be one of the things that distincts him for the better compared to other R&B singers of his time [281] American media executive and radio personality Ebro Darden stated that Brown is the \"most all-around talented person in R&B Trey Songz is talented, but he can't dance like Chris Brown Usher is probably the only one that could come close to him, but he doesn't have the songwriting abilities that Chris Brown has\" [282]\n\n\nVoice\nBrown possesses a light lyric tenor voice, which spans three and a half octaves, rising from the bass F♯ (F2) to its peak at the soprano C♯.(C♯6) [286] [better source needed] His vocal ability was first recognized by his mother at a young age, as Brown tells People magazine \"I was 11 and watching Usher perform 'My Way', and I started trying to mimic it My mom was like, 'You can sing?' And I was like, 'Well, yeah, Mama.'\" subsequently leading to the start of his career [18] \"Take You Down\" most notably earned him a Grammy award nomination for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2009 [287]\n\n\nDancing\nBrown's dancing abilities and stage presence are widely praised, [301] [302] receiving broad comparisons to those of Michael Jackson [303] [304] [305] According to Brown, he taught himself how to dance by imitating Jackson's moves since childhood, then developing his own distinct style throughout his career [40] Brown also mentioned MC Hammer as an inspiration to his dancing style [44] Most of his music videos feature complex choreographies, [306] including the \"futuristic\" \"Turn Up the Music\", [307] the Jackson-inspired choreography of \"Fine China\", \"Zero\", where he displayed different dancing styles, including popping and his \"signature spin move\", [306] \"Party\", where he showcased his remarked footwork, [308] and \"Heat\", described by The Source as a \"silky smooth choreography that shows Brown's unmatchable dancing talent\" [309] [306] [310] Some of his most notable dancing live performances include his \"Thriller\" recreation at the 2006 World Music Awards, his medley at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed a choreography that included flying parts, and his 2015 freestyled dancing over Future's \"March Madness\" at the Vestival The Hague Malieveld, that included an acclaimed front-flip [311] [312] [313]\n\n\nStreet art\nAside from his musical career, Brown was noted for markedly producing graffiti

rehab by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to fulfill the terms of his probation for the Rihanna incident [388] While at the rehab facility, Brown was formally diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder [389] The rehab facility stated that Brown will require close supervision by a physician \"to ensure his bipolar mental health condition remains stable It is not uncommon for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II to use substances to self-medicate their biochemical mood swings and trauma triggers\" [390] The clinical team at the rehab facility also attributed Brown's aggression to his untreated mental health disorder, severe sleep deprivation, inappropriate self-medicating and untreated PTSD [390] [391]\n\n\nLegal issues\nAt around

denied them entry without a warrant [427]  When they returned with one, Brown refused them entry and began what news sources referred to as a \"standoff\" with the LAPD, including the robbery-homicide division and SWAT team During this time, Brown was seen posting videos on Instagram, in which he rails against the police and the media coverage of the activity at his house He denounced media reports that he was \"barricaded\" inside his house, complained about the helicopters flying overhead, and called the police \"idiots\" and \"the worst gang in the world.\" He said that he was innocent and \"What I do care about is you are defacing   [sic] my name and my character and integrity\" [427] Brown was arrested and later released from jail on $250,000 bail [428] On September 1, 2016, Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, stated that there was no standoff and that, with regard to the LAPD search, \"nothing was found to corroborate her statement.\" [429] Charges were later dropped after prosecutors declined to arraign Brown on the felony charges [430] Brown later sued the accuser for defamation, prevailing in the lawsuit, after it was ruled that the defendant brought to court false and defamatory statements about Brown, through her incriminating text messages where she said that \"Brown kicked  [her] out of his house because  [she] called his friend jewelry fake\" and she was \"going to set him up and call the cops and say that he tried to shoot  [her]\" [431] Brown later told Good Morning America: \"My character’s been defaced I’m glad that all my real supporters know me

His father, Mikhail Brin, is a retired mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother, Eugenia Brin, is a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Brin's family moved to the United States when he was six years old, and he grew up in Maryland. He developed an interest in computers and mathematics at an early age and began programming at the age of 6.\n\nBrin attended the University of Maryland, where he studied mathematics and computer science. He graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 1993 and then moved to Stanford University, where he began pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science. During his time at Stanford, Brin met his future business partner, Larry Page, and the two men began working together on various projects.\n\n**Search Engine Development**\n\nIn 1996, Brin and Page began working on a search engine project that would eventually become Google. The two men seemed to disagree on most subjects, but after spending time together, they \"became intellectual soul-mates and close friends.\" Brin's focus was on developing data mining systems, while Page's was on extending \"the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other papers.\" Together, they authored a paper titled \"The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine,\" which would become a seminal work in the field of search engine technology.\n\nBrin and Page's search engine, initially called \"Backrub,\" used a unique algorithm that analyzed the link structure of the web to determine the importance of a web page. The algorithm, which was later dubbed PageRank, played a crucial role in the success of Google and revolutionized the way people search for information online.\n\n**Other Interests**\n\nIn June 2008, Brin invested $4.5 million in Space Adventures, a Virginia-based space tourism company. Brin's investment was part of a larger effort to promote space exploration and development. In an interview, Brin stated that he was interested in space travel because it offered a unique opportunity to explore new frontiers and push the boundaries of human knowledge.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBrin was raised Jewish, but is not religious. He has stated that he is an atheist and does not believe in the existence of a higher power. Brin is married to Anne Wojcicki, a biotech entrepreneur, and the couple has two children together. Brin is known for his frugal lifestyle and has stated that he drives a Honda Civic and lives in a modest house in Silicon Valley.\n\n**Awards and Accolades**\n\nBrin and Google have received numerous awards and accolades for their innovative work in search engine technology. In 1998, PC Magazine praised Google in the Top 100 Web Sites and Search Engines. In 1999, Google was awarded the Technical Excellence Award for Innovation in Web Application Development.

In 2001, Google was awarded Outstanding Search Service, Best Image Search Engine, Best Design, Most Webmaster Friendly Search Engine, and Best Search Feature at the Search Engine Watch Awards.\n\n**2002–2009**\n\nDuring this period, Brin was a featured speaker at the World Economic Forum and the Technology, Entertainment and Design Conference. Brin continued to play a leading role in the development of Google and its various products and services. In 2004, Brin announced the launch of Google Maps, a mapping service that used satellite imagery and GPS data to provide users with detailed maps of the world.

Some of the best Ukrainian players of the beginning of the 1990s, including Andrei Kanchelskis, Viktor Onopko, Sergei Yuran, Yuriy Nikiforov, Ilya Tsymbalar, and Oleg Salenko, chose to play for Russia.\n\n**First official games (Prokopenko)**\n\nSoon after being accepted to FIFA and UEFA as a full member in 1992, Ukraine selected its first manager by members of a coaching council. The council consisted of Anatoliy Puzach, Yevhen Kucherevskyi, Yevhen Lemeshko, Yukhym Shkolnykov, and Viktor Prokopenko. Viktor Prokopenko eventually became the manager of the national team.\n\n**Euro 1996 qualification (Bazylevych)**\n\nUkraine appointed Oleh Bazylevych as the head coach of the national team in 1993. Bazylevych made his debut with the national team in a friendly match against Israel, which ended in a 1–1 draw. Under Bazylevych's leadership, Ukraine won its first match against Lithuania and later lost to Croatia.\n\n**1998–2004: near misses**\n\nFollowing the expiration of a year-long contract with Konkov, the Federation appointed Sabo as the head coach of the national team. Sabo received a preliminary agreement that Lobanovsky would become available following his contract with Kuwait.\n\n**2006 World Cup**\n\nAfter Euro 2004 qualifying, Ukraine appointed Oleg Blokhin as the head coach of the national team. Under Blokhin's leadership, Ukraine qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup by finishing top of Group 2. This was the first successful qualification campaign for Ukraine.\n\n**2006–2012**\n\nAfter the World Cup, Ukraine was placed in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group B, along with Italy and France. Ukraine had a poor performance in the group, finishing fourth. Due to the bleak performance of the national team, Oleg Blokhin resigned and signed with the recently established FC Moscow.\n\n**2014–present**\n\nDrawn into UEFA Group H for 2014 World Cup qualification, Ukraine qualified for yet another playoff. Ukraine beat France at home 2–0 but suffered a 3–0 loss away. Blokhin stepped down due to health concerns in the autumn of 2012. Andriy Bal and later Oleksandr Zavarov took over as the head coach of the national team. Mykhailo Fomenko was appointed as the head coach by the end of 2012.\n\n**Stadiums**\n\nMost matches are held at the Olimpiyskyi National Sports Complex in Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\n**Home venue record**\n\nSince Ukraine's first fixture (29 April 1992 vs Hungary), they have played their home games at 11 different stadiums.\n\n**Kits and sponsors**\n\nOn 29 March 2010, Ukraine debuted a new Adidas kit.

musician. She is best known for her work as a member of the rock band Fleetwood Mac and for her successful solo career.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\nStevie Nicks was born on May 26, 1948, in Phoenix, Arizona, to Jess and Barbara Nicks. She is of German, English, Welsh, and Irish ancestry. Nicks grew up in a musical family and was exposed to a wide range of music from an early age. She began writing songs and playing music in her teenage years, and she formed a band with her friends and classmates.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Nicks was part of a band called Fritz, which played in various clubs and venues in the Los Angeles area. After Fritz disbanded in 1972, Nicks and her friend Lindsey Buckingham continued to write and perform music together. They eventually formed a duo, Buckingham Nicks, and released an album of the same name in 1973.\n\n**Buckingham Nicks and Fleetwood Mac**\n\nAfter the success of the Rumours album and tour in 1977 to 1978, Fleetwood Mac began recording their third album with Nicks and Buckingham, Tusk, in the spring of 1978. This was a turning point in Nicks's career, as she had amassed a large backlog of songs that she had been unable to record with Fleetwood Mac because of the constraint of having to accommodate three songwriters on each album. Tusk was released on October 19, 1979, and it was a commercial success, but it was also a challenging and experimental album that pushed the boundaries of rock music.\n\nMirage was recorded in late 1981 and early 1982, and it was released in 1982. This album was a departure from the more experimental sound of Tusk, and it featured a more polished and commercial sound. Nicks's songwriting skills continued to evolve, and she began to explore new themes and styles in her music.\n\n**Backup Vocals and Duets**\n\nWhile working on Tusk, Nicks sang backup on virtually every track of Not Shy, recorded by musician Walter Egan, a friend of both Nicks and Buckingham. \"Magnet and Steel\", inspired by Nicks, prominently featured her backup vocals and became a hit single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart during the summer of 1978. Lindsey Buckingham also produced the album, playing guitar and providing backing vocals on some of the tracks. Nicks recorded the hit duets \"Whenever I Call You Friend\" with Kenny Loggins in 1978, and \"Gold\" with John Stewart in 1979. During 1981, Nicks made occasional guest appearances with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on their Hard Promises tour.\n\n**Solo Career**\n\nNicks wrote and recorded demos for a solo project during Tusk sessions in 1979 and the Tusk world tour of 1979-80. Nicks, Danny Goldberg, and Paul Fishkin founded Modern Records to record and release Nicks's material. Nicks's first solo album, Bella Donna, was released in 1981, and it was a commercial success, featuring several hit singles, including \"Edge of Seventeen\" and \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\". Nicks continued to tour and record music throughout the 1980s, releasing several successful albums, including The Wild Heart and Rock a Little.\n\n**Tango in the Night, The Other Side of the Mirror, and Behind the Mask**\n\nIn late 1985, Fleetwood Mac began work on Tango in the Night, but due to her promotional schedule for the Rock a Little album and subsequent tour, Nicks was mostly unavailable to work on the album with the band except for a few weeks following her stay at the Betty Ford Center in 1986 (which was the inspiration for the song \"Welcome to the Room...Sara\"). She sent the band demos of her songs to work on in her absence. The album was released in April 1987 and became the band's second-highest selling album ever, behind Rumours.\n\nThe Other Side of the Mirror was released in 1989, and it was a commercial success, featuring several hit singles, including \"Rooms on Fire\" and \"Rooms on Fire\". Behind the Mirror was released in 1990, and it was a departure from the more experimental sound of Tango in the Night, featuring a more polished and commercial sound.\n\n**Timespace, Street Angel, and Trouble in Shangri-La**\n\nOn the 10th anniversary of her solo career debut, Nicks released Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks on September 3, 1991. The following year, Fleetwood Mac also released a four-disc box set, 25 Years – The Chain, which included \"Silver Springs\".

major figure in popular music since the late 1990s. Born Shawn Corey Carter on December 4, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York City, Jay-Z rose to fame with his debut album \"Reasonable Doubt\" in 1996. Over the years, he has released numerous critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums, collaborated with top artists, and established himself as a successful entrepreneur in various industries.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nJay-Z was born in the Marcy Houses, a public housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood. His father, Adnis Reeves, abandoned the family when Jay-Z was 11 years old. Jay-Z and his three older siblings were raised by his mother, Gloria Carter. In his lyrics, Jay-Z claims to have shot his older brother Eric in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry when he was 12 years old.\n\nJay-Z attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School in Brooklyn, where he became involved in the local hip-hop scene. He was influenced by soul artists such as Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway, whose music he would often listen to with his parents. Jay-Z's early exposure to music helped shape his style and lyrical content.\n\n**Career**\n\nJay-Z began his music career in the late 1980s, making cameo appearances on several of Jaz-O's early recordings. He gained recognition as a rapper in the early 1990s, particularly with his battles with LL Cool J. Jay-Z first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on Big Daddy Kane's 1994 album \"Daddy's Home.\" He has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period, although Kane explains that Jay-Z did not fill the traditional hype man role.\n\nIn 1995, Jay-Z, along with Damon \"Dame\" Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke, created Roc-A-Fella Records as an independent label.

portraying Dalits in poor light and for referring to a Christian priest in a derogatory manner [71] [72] [73] The protagonist, likely Dalit, is referred to by dominant caste and Brahmin characters as \"panni munji\" (pig face) and \"sandala\" (a casteist slur) The protagonist loses control of a situation and brings an excrement-covered dog in contact with a Brahmin family who apparently cannot tolerate even well-bathed animals Carnatic vocalist and activist T M Krishna called the film \"truly disgusting, insensitive, casteist and body shaming Nothing to laugh about We cannot make films like

[72] He became eligible to return on January 19, 2021 [73] [74]\n\n\nReturn from suspension\nAfter the two-year hiatus due to his USADA suspension, Dillashaw was scheduled to face Cory Sandhagen on May 8, 2021, at UFC on ESPN 24 [77] However, Dillashaw announced on April 27 that he had to pull out of the fight due to a cut he received from a headbutt in training [78] The pair was rescheduled and served as the main headliner for UFC on ESPN: Sandhagen vs Dillashaw on July 24, 2021 [79] Dillashaw won the fight via split decision [80] The decision was seen as somewhat controversial, with many fans, fighters, and media members expressing their belief that Sandhagen won the bout 17 of 23 media outlets scored the bout as a victory for Sandhagen [81] During the fight, Dillashaw suffered a knee injury which kept him out of action over the next year [82]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDillashaw married Rebecca, in June 2014 [89] In October 2015, Dillashaw left Team Alpha Male and moved his camp to Denver, Colorado, to train with his head coach, former UFC fighter Duane Ludwig [90] It was later confirmed that Dillashaw had left Team Alpha Male as a result of a number of disagreements, including use of PEDs and accusations of injuring team mates on a number of occasions in training Accusations included forcing promising Ultimate Fighter winner, Chris Holdsworth (6-0), to retire at the age of 27 due to concussions sustained from Dillashaw using illegal knees on a downed opponent during practice  [91]\n\n\nChampionships and achievements\n [100]\n\n\nAmateur wrestling\n [100]\n\n\nMixed

{"title": "Christopher_Columbus", "content": "\nEarly life\nColumbus's early life is obscure, but scholars believe he was born in the Republic of Genoa between 25 August and 31 October 1451 [12] His father was Domenico Colombo, a wool weaver who worked in Genoa and Savona, and owned a cheese stand at which young Christopher worked His mother was Susanna Fontanarossa [13] He had three brothers—Bartholomew, Giovanni Pellegrino, and Giacomo (also called Diego) [14]—as well as a sister, Bianchinetta [15] Bartholomew ran a cartography workshop in Lisbon for at least part of his adulthood [16]\n\n\nQuest for Asia\nUnder the Mongol Empire's hegemony over Asia and the Pax Mongolica, Europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage on the Silk Road to India, parts of East Asia, including China and Maritime Southeast Asia, which were sources of valuable goods With the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, the Silk Road was closed to Christian traders [42]\n\n\nBackground\nUnder the Mongol Empire's hegemony over Asia and the Pax Mongolica, Europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage on the Silk Road to India, parts of East Asia, including China and Maritime Southeast Asia, which were sources of valuable goods With the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, the Silk Road was closed to Christian traders [42]\n\n\nGeographical considerations\nDespite a popular misconception to the contrary, nearly all educated Westerners of Columbus's time knew that the Earth is spherical, a concept that had been understood since antiquity [54] The techniques of celestial navigation, which uses the position of the Sun and the stars in the sky, had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners [55] [56]\n\n\nNautical considerations\nThough Columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated Europe from the Far East and about the distance that each degree represented, he did take advantage of the trade winds, which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the Atlantic Ocean He planned to first sail to the Canary Islands before continuing west with the northeast trade wind [74] Part of the return to Spain would require traveling against the wind using an arduous sailing technique called beating, during which progress is made very slowly [75] To effectively make the return voyage, Columbus would need to follow the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where he would be able to catch the \"westerlies\" that blow eastward to the coast of Western Europe [76]\n\n\nQuest for financial support for a voyage\nBy about 1484, Columbus proposed his planned voyage to King John II of Portugal [79] The king submitted Columbus's proposal to his advisors, who rejected it, correctly, on the grounds that Columbus's estimate for a voyage of 2,400 nmi was only a quarter of what it should have been [80] In 1488, Columbus again appealed to the court of Portugal, and John II again granted him an audience That meeting also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards Bartolomeu Dias returned to Portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa (near the Cape of Good Hope) [81] [82]\n\n\nAgreement with the Spanish crown\nColumbus waited at King Ferdinand's camp until Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, in January 1492 A council led by Isabella's confessor, Hernando de Talavera, found Columbus's proposal to reach the Indies implausible Columbus had left for France when Ferdinand intervened, [e] first sending Talavera and Bishop Diego Deza to appeal to the queen [89] Isabella was finally convinced by the king's clerk Luis de Santángel, who argued that Columbus would take his ideas elsewhere, and offered to help arrange the funding Isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch Columbus, who had traveled 2 leagues (over 10 km) toward Córdoba [88]\n\n\nVoyages\nBetween 1492 and 1504, Columbus completed four round-trip voyages between Spain and the Americas, each voyage being sponsored by the Crown of Castile On his first voyage he reached the Americas, initiating the European exploration and colonization of the continent, as well as the Columbian exchange His role in history is thus important to the Age of Discovery, Western history, and human history writ large [96]\n\n\nFirst voyage (1492–1493)\nOn the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera with three ships The largest was a carrack, the Santa María, owned and captained by Juan de la Cosa, and under Columbus's direct command [103] The other two were smaller caravels, the Pinta and the Niña, [104] piloted by the Pinzón brothers [103] Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands There he restocked provisions and made repairs then departed from San Sebastián de La Gomera on 6 September, [105] for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean.\n\n\nSecond voyage (1493–1496)\nOn 24 September 1493, Columbus sailed from Cádiz with 17 ships, and supplies to establish permanent colonies in the Americas He sailed with nearly 1,500 men, including sailors, soldiers, priests, carpenters, stonemasons, metalworkers, and farmers Among the expedition members were Alvarez Chanca, a physician who wrote a detailed account of the second voyage; Juan Ponce de León, the first governor of Puerto Rico and Florida; the father of Bartolomé de las Casas; Juan de la Cosa, a cartographer who is credited with making the first world map depicting the New World; and Columbus's youngest brother Diego [138] The fleet stopped at the Canary Islands to take on more supplies, and set sail again on 7 October, deliberately taking a more southerly course than on the first voyage [139]\n\n\nThird voyage (1498–1500)\nOn 30 May 1498, Columbus left with six ships from Sanlúcar, Spain The fleet called at Madeira and the Canary Islands, where it divided in two, with three ships heading for Hispaniola and the other three vessels, commanded by Columbus, sailing south to the Cape Verde Islands and then westward across the Atlantic It is probable that this expedition was intended at least partly to confirm rumors of a large continent south of the Caribbean Sea, that is, South America [163]\n\n\nFourth voyage (1502–1504)\nOn 9 May 1502, [190] Columbus left Cádiz with his flagship Santa María and three other vessels The ships were crewed by 140 men, including his brother Bartholomew as second in command and his son Fernando [191] He sailed to Asilah on the Moroccan coast to rescue Portuguese soldiers said to be besieged by the Moors The siege had been lifted by the time they arrived, so the Spaniards stayed only a day and continued on to the Canary Islands [192]\n\n\nLater life, illness, and death\nColumbus had always claimed that the conversion of non-believers was one reason for his explorations, and he grew increasingly religious in his later years [208] Probably with the assistance of his son Diego and his friend the Carthusian monk Gaspar Gorricio, Columbus produced two books during his later years: a Book of Privileges (1502), detailing and documenting the rewards from the Spanish Crown to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled, and a Book of Prophecies (1505), in which passages from the Bible were used to place his achievements as an explorer in the context of Christian eschatology [209]\n\n\nLocation of remains\nColumbus's remains were first buried at the Chapel of Wonders at the Convent of St Francis, Valladolid, [221] but were then moved to the monastery of La Cartuja in Seville (southern Spain) by the will of his son Diego [222] They may have been exhumed in 1513 and interred at the Seville Cathedral In about 1536, the remains of both Columbus and his son Diego were moved to a cathedral in Colonial Santo Domingo, in the present-day Dominican Republic; Columbus had requested to be buried on the island [223] By some accounts, in 1793, when France took over the entire island of Hispaniola, Columbus's remains were moved to Havana, Cuba [224] [225] After Cuba became independent following the Spanish–American War in 1898, at least some of these remains were moved back to the Seville Cathedral, [221] [226] where they were placed on an elaborate catafalque.\n\n\nCommemoration\nThe figure of Columbus was not ignored in the British colonies during the colonial era: Columbus became a unifying symbol early in the history of the colonies that became the United States when Puritan preachers began to use his life story as a model for a \"developing American spirit\" [236] In the spring of 1692, Puritan preacher Cotton Mather described Columbus's voyage as one of three shaping events of the modern age, connecting Columbus's voyage and the Puritans' migration to North America, seeing them together as the key to a grand design [237]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe voyages of Columbus are considered a turning point in human history, [253] marking the beginning of globalization and accompanying demographic, commercial, economic, social, and political changes [254]\n\n\nOriginality of discovery of America\nThough Christopher Columbus came to be considered the European discoverer of America in Western popular culture, his historical legacy is more nuanced [272] After settling Iceland, the Norse settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century [273] Norsemen are believed to have then set sail from Greenland and Iceland to become the first known Europeans to reach the North American mainland, nearly 500 years before Columbus reached the Caribbean [274] The 1960s discovery of a Norse settlement dating to c 1000 AD at L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, partially corroborates accounts within the Icelandic sagas of Erik the Red's colonization of Greenland and his son Leif Erikson's subsequent exploration of a place he called Vinland [275]\n\n\nAmerica as a distinct land\nHistorians have traditionally argued that Columbus remained convinced until his death that his journeys had been along the east coast of Asia as he originally intended [284] [240] (excluding arguments such as Anderson's) [32] On his third voyage he briefly referred to South America as a \"hitherto unknown\" continent, [f] while also rationalizing that it was the Earthly Paradise (Eden) located \"at the end of the Orient\" [167] Columbus continued to claim in his later writings that he had reached Asia; in a 1502 letter to Pope Alexander VI, he asserts that Cuba is the east coast of Asia [45] On the other hand, in a document in the Book of Privileges (1502), Columbus refers to the New World as the Indias Occidentales ('West Indies'), which he says \"were unknown to all the world\" [285]\n\n\nShape of the Earth\nWashington Irving's 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many Catholic theologians insisted that the Earth was flat, [286] but this is a popular misconception which can be traced back to 17th-century Protestants campaigning against Catholicism [287] In fact, the spherical shape of the Earth had been known to scholars since antiquity, and was common knowledge among sailors, including Columbus [288] Coincidentally, the oldest surviving globe of the Earth, the Erdapfel, was made in 1492, just before Columbus's return to Europe from his first voyage As such it contains no sign of the Americas and yet demonstrates the common belief in a spherical Earth [289]\n\n\nCriticism and defense\nColumbus has been criticized both for his brutality and for initiating the depopulation of the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, whether by imported diseases or intentional violence According to scholars of Native American history, George Tinker and Mark Freedman, Columbus was responsible for creating a cycle of \"murder, violence, and slavery\" to maximize exploitation of the Caribbean islands' resources, and that Native deaths on the scale at which they occurred would not have been caused by new diseases alone Further, they describe the proposition that disease and not genocide caused these deaths as \"American holocaust denial\" [297] Historian Kris Lane disputes whether it is appropriate to use the term \"genocide\" when the atrocities were not Columbus's intent, but resulted from his decrees, family business goals, and negligence [298] Other scholars defend Columbus's actions or allege that the worst accusations against him are not based in fact while others claim that \"he has been blamed for events far beyond his own reach or knowledge\" [299]\n\n\nBrutality\nSome historians have criticized Columbus for initiating the widespread colonization of the Americas and for abusing its native population [301] [115] [302] [303] On St Croix, Columbus's friend Michele da Cuneo—according to his own account—kept an indigenous woman he captured, whom Columbus \"gave to  [him]\", then brutally raped her [304] [r] [s]\n\n\nDepopulation\nAround the turn of the 21st century, estimates for the pre-Columbian population of Hispaniola ranged between 250,000 and two million, [158] [320] [321] [t] but genetic analysis published in late 2020 suggests that smaller figures are more likely, perhaps as low as 10,000–50,000 for Hispaniola and Puerto Rico combined [322] [323] Based on the previous figures of a few hundred thousand, some have estimated that a third or more of the natives in Haiti were dead within the first two years of Columbus's governorship [115] [158] Contributors to depopulation included disease, warfare, and harsh enslavement [324] [325] Indirect evidence suggests that some serious illness may have arrived with the 1,500 colonists who accompanied Columbus' second expedition in 1493 [324] Charles C Mann writes that \"It was as if the suffering these diseases had caused in Eurasia over the past millennia were concentrated into the span of decades.\" [326] A third of the natives forced to work in gold and silver mines died every six months [327] [328] Within three to six decades, the surviving Arawak population numbered only in the hundreds [327] [158] [329] The indigenous population of the Americas overall is thought to have been reduced by about 90% in the century after Columbus's arrival [330] Among indigenous peoples, Columbus is often viewed as a key agent of genocide [331] Samuel Eliot Morison, a Harvard University historian and author of a multivolume biography on Columbus, writes, \"The cruel policy initiated by Columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide.\" [332]\n\n\nNavigational expertise\nBiographers and historians have a wide range of opinions about Columbus's expertise and experience navigating and captaining ships One scholar lists some European works ranging from the 1890s to 1980s that support Columbus's experience and skill as among the best in Genoa, while listing some American works over a similar timeframe that portray the explorer as an untrained entrepreneur, having only minor crew or passenger experience prior to his noted journeys [343] According to Morison, Columbus's success in utilizing the trade winds might owe significantly to luck [344]\n\n\nPhysical appearance\nContemporary descriptions of Columbus, including those by his son Fernando and Bartolomé de las Casas, describe him as taller than average, with light skin (often sunburnt), blue or hazel eyes, high cheekbones and freckled face, an aquiline nose, and blond to reddish hair and beard (until about the age of 30, when it began to whiten) [345] [346] One Spanish commentator described his eyes using the word garzos, now usually translated as \"light blue\", but it seems to have indicated light grey-green or hazel eyes to Columbus's contemporaries The word rubios can mean \"blond\", \"fair\", or \"ruddy\" [347] Although an abundance of artwork depicts Columbus, no authentic contemporary portrait is known [348]\n\n\nSee also\nWhile I was in the boat, I captured a very beautiful Carib woman, whom the said Lord Admiral gave to me When I had taken her to my cabin she was naked—as was their custom I was

Bartholomew ran a cartography workshop in Lisbon for at least part of his adulthood [16]\n\n\nQuest for Asia\nUnder the Mongol Empire's hegemony over Asia and the Pax Mongolica, Europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage on the Silk Road to India, parts of East Asia, including China and Maritime Southeast Asia, which were sources of valuable goods With the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, the Silk Road was closed to Christian traders [42]\n\n\nBackground\nUnder the Mongol Empire's hegemony over Asia and the Pax Mongolica, Europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage on the Silk Road to India, parts of East Asia, including China and Maritime Southeast Asia, which were sources of valuable goods With the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, the Silk Road was closed to Christian traders [42]\n\n\nGeographical considerations\nDespite a popular misconception to the contrary, nearly all educated Westerners of Columbus's time knew that the Earth is spherical, a concept that had been understood since antiquity [54] The techniques of celestial navigation, which uses the position of the Sun and the stars in the sky, had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners [55] [56]\n\n\nNautical considerations\nThough Columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated Europe from the Far East and about the distance that each degree represented, he did take advantage of the trade winds, which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the Atlantic Ocean He planned to first sail to the Canary Islands before continuing west with the northeast trade wind [74] Part of the return to Spain would require traveling against the wind using an arduous sailing technique called beating, during which progress is made very slowly [75] To effectively make the return voyage, Columbus would need to follow the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where he would be able to catch the \"westerlies\" that blow eastward to the coast of Western Europe [76]\n\n\nQuest for financial support for a voyage\nBy about 1484, Columbus proposed his planned voyage to King John II of Portugal [79] The king submitted Columbus's proposal to his advisors, who rejected it, correctly, on the grounds that Columbus's estimate for a voyage of 2,400 nmi was only a quarter of what it should have been [80] In 1488, Columbus again appealed to the court of Portugal, and John II again granted him an audience That meeting also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards Bartolomeu Dias returned to Portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa (near the Cape of Good Hope) [81] [82]\n\n\nAgreement with the Spanish crown\nColumbus waited at King Ferdinand's camp until Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, in January 1492 A council led by Isabella's confessor, Hernando de Talavera, found Columbus's proposal to reach the Indies implausible Columbus had left for France when Ferdinand intervened, [e] first sending Talavera and Bishop Diego Deza to appeal to the queen [89] Isabella was finally convinced by the king's clerk Luis de Santángel, who argued that Columbus would take his ideas elsewhere, and offered to help arrange the funding Isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch Columbus, who had traveled 2 leagues (over 10 km) toward Córdoba [88]\n\n\nVoyages\nBetween 1492 and 1504, Columbus completed four round-trip voyages between Spain and the Americas, each voyage being sponsored by the Crown of Castile On his first voyage he reached the Americas, initiating the European exploration and colonization of the continent, as well as the Columbian exchange His role in history is thus important to the Age of Discovery, Western history, and human history writ large [96]\n\n\nFirst voyage (1492–1493)\nOn the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera with three ships The largest was a carrack, the Santa María, owned and captained by Juan de la Cosa, and under Columbus's direct command [103] The other two were smaller caravels, the Pinta and the Niña, [104] piloted by the Pinzón brothers [103] Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands There he restocked provisions and made repairs then departed from San Sebastián de La Gomera on 6 September, [105] for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean.\n\n\nSecond voyage (1493–1496)\nOn 24 September 1493, Columbus sailed from Cádiz with 17 ships, and supplies to establish permanent colonies in the Americas He sailed with nearly 1,500 men, including sailors, soldiers, priests, carpenters, stonemasons, metalworkers, and farmers Among the expedition members were Alvarez Chanca, a physician who wrote a detailed account of the second voyage; Juan Ponce de León, the first governor of Puerto Rico and Florida; the father of Bartolomé de las Casas; Juan de la Cosa, a cartographer who is credited with making the first world map depicting the New World; and Columbus's youngest brother Diego [138] The fleet stopped at the Canary Islands to take on more supplies, and set sail again on 7 October, deliberately taking a more southerly course than on the first voyage [139]\n\n\nThird voyage (1498–1500)\nOn 30 May 1498, Columbus left with six ships from Sanlúcar, Spain The fleet called at Madeira and the Canary Islands, where it divided in two, with three ships heading for Hispaniola and the other three vessels, commanded by Columbus, sailing south to the Cape Verde Islands and then westward across the Atlantic It is probable that this expedition was intended at least partly to confirm rumors of a large continent south of the Caribbean Sea, that is, South America [163]\n\n\nFourth voyage (1502–1504)\nOn 9 May 1502, [190] Columbus left Cádiz with his flagship Santa María and three other vessels The ships were crewed by 140 men, including his brother Bartholomew as second in command and his son Fernando [191] He sailed to Asilah on the Moroccan coast to rescue Portuguese soldiers said to be besieged by the Moors The siege had been lifted by the time they arrived, so the Spaniards stayed only a day and continued on to the Canary Islands [192]\n\n\nLater life, illness, and death\nColumbus had always claimed that the conversion of non-believers was one reason for his explorations, and he grew increasingly religious in his later years [208] Probably with the assistance of his son Diego and his friend the Carthusian monk Gaspar Gorricio, Columbus produced two books during his later years: a Book of Privileges (1502), detailing and documenting the rewards from the Spanish Crown to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled, and a Book of Prophecies (1505), in which passages from the Bible were used to place his achievements as an explorer in the context of Christian eschatology [209]\n\n\nLocation of remains\nColumbus's remains were first buried at the Chapel of Wonders at the Convent of St Francis, Valladolid, [221] but were then moved to the monastery of La Cartuja in Seville (southern Spain) by the will of his son Diego [222] They may have been exhumed in 1513 and interred at the Seville Cathedral In about 1536, the remains of both Columbus and his son Diego were moved to a cathedral in Colonial Santo Domingo, in the present-day Dominican Republic; Columbus had requested to be buried on the island [223] By some accounts, in 1793, when France took over the entire island of Hispaniola, Columbus's remains were moved to Havana, Cuba [224] [225] After Cuba became independent following the Spanish–American War in 1898, at least some of these remains were moved back to the Seville Cathedral, [221] [226] where they were placed on an elaborate catafalque.\n\n\nCommemoration\nThe figure of Columbus was not ignored in the British colonies during the colonial era: Columbus became a unifying symbol early in the history of the colonies that became the United States when Puritan preachers began to use his life story as a model for a \"developing American spirit\" [236] In the spring of 1692, Puritan preacher Cotton Mather described Columbus's voyage as one of three shaping events of the modern age, connecting Columbus's voyage and the Puritans' migration to North America, seeing them together as the key to a grand design [237]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe voyages of Columbus are considered a turning point in human history, [253] marking the beginning of globalization and accompanying demographic, commercial, economic, social, and political changes [254]\n\n\nOriginality of discovery of America\nThough Christopher Columbus came to be considered the European discoverer of America in Western popular culture, his historical legacy is more nuanced [272] After settling Iceland, the Norse settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century [273] Norsemen are believed to have then set sail from Greenland and Iceland to become the first known Europeans to reach the North American mainland, nearly 500 years before Columbus reached the Caribbean [274] The 1960s discovery of a Norse settlement dating to c 1000 AD at L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, partially corroborates accounts within the Icelandic sagas of Erik the Red's colonization of Greenland and his son Leif Erikson's subsequent exploration of a place he called Vinland [275]\n\n\nAmerica as a distinct land\nHistorians have traditionally argued that Columbus remained convinced until his death that his journeys had been along the east coast of Asia as he originally intended [284] [240] (excluding arguments such as Anderson's) [32] On his third voyage he briefly referred to South America as a \"hitherto unknown\" continent, [f] while also rationalizing that it was the Earthly Paradise (Eden) located \"at the end of the Orient\" [167] Columbus continued to claim in his later writings that he had reached Asia; in a 1502 letter to Pope Alexander VI, he asserts that Cuba is the east coast of Asia [45] On the other hand, in a document in the Book of Privileges (1502), Columbus refers to the New World as the Indias Occidentales ('West Indies'), which he says \"were unknown to all the world\" [285]\n\n\nShape of the Earth\nWashington Irving's 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many Catholic theologians insisted that the Earth was flat, [286] but this is a popular misconception which can be traced back to 17th-century Protestants campaigning against Catholicism [287] In fact, the spherical shape of the Earth had been known to scholars since antiquity, and was common knowledge among sailors, including Columbus [288] Coincidentally, the oldest surviving globe of the Earth, the Erdapfel, was made in 1492, just before Columbus's return to Europe from his first voyage As such it contains no sign of the Americas and yet demonstrates the common belief in a spherical Earth [289]\n\n\nCriticism and defense\nColumbus has been criticized both for his brutality and for initiating the depopulation of the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, whether by imported diseases or intentional violence According to scholars of Native American history, George Tinker and Mark Freedman, Columbus was responsible for creating a cycle of \"murder, violence, and slavery\" to maximize exploitation of the Caribbean islands' resources, and that Native deaths on the scale at which they occurred would not have been caused by new diseases alone Further, they describe the proposition that disease and not genocide caused these deaths as \"American holocaust denial\" [297] Historian Kris Lane disputes whether it is appropriate to use the term \"genocide\" when the atrocities were not Columbus's intent, but resulted from his decrees, family business goals, and negligence [298] Other scholars defend Columbus's actions or allege that the worst accusations against him are not based in fact while others claim that \"he has been blamed for events far beyond his own reach or knowledge\" [299]\n\n\nBrutality\nSome historians have criticized Columbus for initiating the widespread colonization of the Americas and for abusing its native population [301] [115] [302] [303] On St Croix, Columbus's friend Michele da Cuneo—according to his own account—kept an indigenous woman he captured, whom Columbus \"gave to  [him]\", then brutally raped her [304] [r] [s]\n\n\nDepopulation\nAround the turn of the 21st century, estimates for the pre-Columbian population of Hispaniola ranged between 250,000 and two million, [158] [320] [321] [t] but genetic analysis published in late 2020 suggests that smaller figures are more likely, perhaps as low as 10,000–50,000 for Hispaniola and Puerto Rico combined [322] [323] Based on the previous figures of a few hundred thousand, some have estimated that a third or more of the natives in Haiti were dead within the first two years of Columbus's governorship [115] [158] Contributors to depopulation included disease, warfare, and harsh enslavement [324] [325] Indirect evidence suggests that some serious illness may have arrived with the 1,500 colonists who accompanied Columbus' second expedition in 1493 [324] Charles C Mann writes that \"It was as if the suffering these diseases had caused in Eurasia over the past millennia were concentrated into the span of decades.\" [326] A third of the natives forced to work in gold and silver mines died every six months [327] [328] Within three to six decades, the surviving Arawak population numbered only in the hundreds [327] [158] [329] The indigenous population of the Americas overall is thought to have been reduced by about 90% in the century after Columbus's arrival [330] Among indigenous peoples, Columbus is often viewed as a key agent of genocide [331] Samuel Eliot Morison, a Harvard University historian and author of a multivolume biography on Columbus, writes, \"The cruel policy initiated by Columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide.\" [332]\n\n\nNavigational expertise\nBiographers and historians have a wide range of opinions about Columbus's expertise and experience navigating and captaining ships One scholar lists some European works ranging from the 1890s to 1980s that support Columbus's experience and skill as among the best in Genoa, while listing some American works over a similar timeframe that portray the explorer as an untrained entrepreneur, having only minor crew or passenger experience prior to his noted journeys [343] According to Morison, Columbus's success in utilizing the trade winds might owe significantly to luck [344]\n\n\nPhysical appearance\nContemporary descriptions of Columbus, including those by his son Fernando and Bartolomé de las Casas, describe him as taller than average, with light skin (often sunburnt), blue or hazel eyes, high cheekbones and freckled face, an aquiline nose, and blond to reddish hair and beard (until about the age of 30, when it began to whiten) [345] [346] One Spanish commentator described his eyes using the word garzos, now usually translated as \"light blue\", but it seems to have indicated light grey-green or hazel eyes to Columbus's contemporaries The word rubios can mean \"blond\", \"fair\", or \"ruddy\" [347] Although an abundance of artwork depicts Columbus, no authentic contemporary portrait is known [348]\n\n\nSee also\nWhile I was in the boat, I captured a very beautiful Carib woman, whom the said Lord Admiral

It is a complex structure that houses various openings and glands, and its anatomy and function vary among different species.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe vulval vestibule is a shallow, triangular area located at the base of the vulva, between the labia minora. It is a critical region that allows for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The structures opening in the vulval vestibule are the urethra (urinary meatus), vagina, Bartholin's glands, and Skene's glands. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body, while the vagina is the muscular tube that connects the cervix to the outside of the body. Bartholin's glands, also known as vulvar vestibular glands, are two small glands located on either side of the vaginal opening that produce a lubricating fluid to help with vaginal intercourse. Skene's glands, also known as paraurethral glands, are a pair of small glands that produce a fluid that helps to lubricate the urethra and vagina.\n\nThe vulval vestibule is lined with a mucous membrane that is similar to the lining of the vagina and cervix. This membrane helps to keep the area moist and lubricated, which is essential for vaginal intercourse and the passage of urine. The vulval vestibule also contains many nerve endings, which can make it a sensitive area.\n\n## Other Animals\n\nThe anatomy of the vulval vestibule varies among different species. In most female placentals, the vestibule is a tubular and internal structure that is not visible from the outside. However, in great apes, including humans, the vestibule is a more complex structure that is visible from the outside. In some rodents, the vestibule is also visible and plays a critical role in reproduction.\n\nIn many species, the vulval vestibule is a highly sensitive area that is rich in nerve endings. This sensitivity is thought to be an adaptation that helps to detect potential threats or predators. In some species, the vulval vestibule is also involved in the production of pheromones, which are chemical signals that help to attract mates.\n\n## Clinical Significance\n\nThe vulval vestibule is a common site of pain and discomfort in women. Vulvar vestibular pain, also known as vulvodynia, is a chronic condition that affects millions of women worldwide. The condition is characterized by persistent pain in the vulval vestibule, which can be severe and debilitating.\n\nA study by the University of Michigan found that about 28% of biological women have experienced vulvar vestibular pain in the past, and about 8% had the pain in the last six months. The exact causes of vulvar vestibular pain are not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including hormonal changes, nerve sensitivity, and inflammation.\n\nVulvar vestibular pain can be a significant source of distress and disability for women. It can interfere with daily activities, including work and social relationships, and can have a negative impact on mental health. Treatment for vulvar vestibular pain typically involves a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and alternative therapies, such as physical therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe vulval vestibule is a complex and highly sensitive region of the female external genitalia. Its anatomy and function vary among different species, and it plays a critical role in the reproductive and urinary systems. Vulvar vestibular pain is a common and debilitating condition that affects millions of women worldwide. Further research is needed to understand the causes and mechanisms of vulvar vestibular pain and to develop effective treatments for this condition.\n\n## References\n\nThis article incorporates text in the public domain from page 1264 of the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918).", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vulval_vestibule\" following this outline:\n\n\nStructure\nStructures opening in the vulval vestibule are the urethra (urinary meatus), vagina, Bartholin's glands, and Skene's glands [1]\n\n\nOther animals\nExcept for great apes (including humans) and some rodents, the vestibule in most female placentals (urogenital sinus) is a tubular and internal structure [3] [4]\n\n\nClinical significance\nThe prevalence of pain at the vulvar vestibule is relatively common A study by the University of Michigan found that about 28% of biological women have experienced vulvar vestibular pain in the past, and about 8% had the pain in the last six months [5]\n\n\nReferences\n This article incorporates text in the public domain from page 1264 of the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders in the history of the sport, known for his bravery, leadership, and exceptional defensive skills.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBorn in Romford, Adams grew up in Dagenham and was a pupil at Hunters Hall Primary School from 1971 to 1978 and then Eastbrook Comprehensive School from 1978 to 1983. His cousin is fellow professional footballer Steve MacKenzie.\n\n**Club Career**\n\nAdams signed for Arsenal as a schoolboy in 1980 and made his first-team debut on 5 November 1983 against Sunderland aged 17. He accidentally put his shorts on back to front in the changing room before the match, and with virtually his first touch of the ball during the game, he gave it away, leading to Sunderland's opening goal. Additionally, Adams had a goal disallowed during his debut.\n\nAdams became a regular player in the 1986–87 season, winning his first major trophy that season when playing in the Football League Cup Final win over Liverpool at Wembley.\n\n**1983–1989: Early Career and Anfield Title**\n\nIn 1989, Adams signed a new contract with Arsenal, which was expected to keep him at the club until 1994. However, the 1990–91 season was a significant one for Adams, as he formed a partnership with Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn, and Steve Bould in the club's defence. This partnership, known as the \"famous back four,\" was renowned for its well-disciplined use of the offside trap.\n\nThe backline achieved legendary status with its unyielding resilience, remaining formidable for over a decade. Arsenal notably conceded just 18 goals during their title-winning 1990–91 league season, and the four players amassed over 2,000 appearances for the club.\n\n**1996–2002: Wenger's Arrival and Retirement**\n\nWhen French manager Arsène Wenger arrived at Arsenal in 1996, Adams was one of the first players to be singed to a new contract. Wenger praised Adams, stating, \"When I first came to Arsenal, I realised the back four were all university graduates in the art of defending. As for Tony Adams, I consider him to be a doctor of defence.\"\n\nUnder Wenger's guidance, Adams developed his skills as a ball-playing centre-back, and he became known for his ability to carry the ball out from the back, as well as his penchant for undertaking individual runs.\n\n**Style of Play**\n\nDescribed as a \"stopper\" (or man–marking defender) by his contemporaries, Adams played as a centre-back. A tall, brave, rugged, physical, and committed defender, his main traits were his leadership, aerial prowess, and his ability to read the game and time his tackles. While initially he was not known to be the most gifted player on the ball from a technical standpoint, he developed this aspect of his game under Wenger.\n\nHowever, Adams was also known for his lack of pace. Despite this, he remained a dominant force in the Arsenal defence, and his leadership and experience were invaluable to the team.\n\n**International Career**\n\nAdams made his debut for England against Spain in 1987. He played in UEFA Euro 1988, where England lost all three games, but Adams scored one of England's two goals in the tournament in a 3–1 defeat to the Soviet Union. He was the first player to represent England who had been born after the 1966 World Cup win.\n\n**Managerial and Coaching Career**\n\nAfter starting a sports science degree at Brunel University, Adams became the manager of Wycombe Wanderers on 5 November 2003. He took over the team that were in last place in the Football League Second Division (third tier). On his debut three days later, he won 4–1 at home to Swindon Town in the first round of the FA Cup. After a 2–1 loss at Tranmere Rovers on 12 April 2004 left the Chairboys 12 points inside the relegation zone with four games remaining, Adams said that his team would carry on fighting; unbeknown to the club, they were already relegated as two teams above them still had to play each other.\n\n**Outside Football**\n\nAdams married Jane Shae in 1992, after they met at a nightclub in Islington. They had two children together, a son and a daughter. They divorced in 1997 amid the couple's substance abuse.\n\nAfter his recovery from alcoholism, Adams married Poppy Teacher in 2004 and had three children with her. Poppy is a fifth-generation descendant of whisky firm founder William Teacher.\n\n**Playing Statistics**\n\nAdams made 669 appearances for Arsenal, scoring 48 goals.\n\n**Managerial Statistics**\n\nAdams managed Wycombe Wanderers from 2003 to 2004.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tony_Adams\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Romford, Adams grew up in Dagenham and was a pupil at Hunters Hall Primary School from 1971 to 1978 and then Eastbrook Comprehensive School from 1978 to 1983 [4] His cousin is fellow professional footballer Steve MacKenzie [5]\n\n\nClub career\nAdams signed for Arsenal as a schoolboy in 1980, [citation needed] and made his first-team debut on 5 November 1983 against Sunderland aged 17 [6] [7] He accidentally put his shorts on back to front in the changing room before the match Then, with virtually his first touch of the ball during the game, he gave it away, leading to Sunderland's opening goal Additionally, Adams had a goal disallowed during his debut [6] Adams became a regular player in the 1986–87 season, winning his first major trophy that season when playing in the Football League Cup Final win over Liverpool at Wembley [7]\n\n\n1983–1989: Early career and Anfield title\nAdams signed for Arsenal as a schoolboy in 1980, [citation needed] and made his first-team debut on 5 November 1983 against Sunderland aged 17 [6] [7] He accidentally put his shorts on back to front in the changing room before the match Then, with virtually his first touch of the ball during the game, he gave it away, leading to Sunderland's opening goal Additionally, Adams had a goal disallowed during his debut [6] Adams became a regular player in the 1986–87 season, winning his first major trophy that season when playing in the Football League Cup Final win over Liverpool at Wembley [7]\n\n\n1989–1996: Arsenal's famous back four\nTogether with Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and Steve Bould, Adams was part of the \"famous back four\" that lined up in Arsenal's defence, which under George Graham was renowned for its well-disciplined use of the offside trap [9] The backline achieved legendary status with its unyielding resilience, remaining formidable for over a decade Arsenal notably conceded just 18 goals during their title-winning 1990–91 league season, and the four players amassed over 2,000 appearances for the club [10]\n\n\n1996–2002: Wenger's arrival and retirement\n\"When I first came to Arsenal, I realised the back four were all university graduates in the art of defending As for Tony Adams, I consider him to be a doctor of defence.\"\n\n\nInternational career\nAdams made his debut for England against Spain in 1987, [7] and played in UEFA Euro 1988 England lost all three games, but Adams scored one of England's two goals in the tournament in a 3–1 defeat to the Soviet Union He was the first player to represent England who had been born after the 1966 World Cup win.\n\n\nStyle of play\nDescribed as a \"stopper\" (or man–marking defender) by Tom Sheen of The Guardian in 2014, Adams played as a centre-back A tall, brave, rugged, physical, and committed defender, his main traits were his leadership, aerial prowess, and his ability to read the game and time his tackles While initially he was not known to be the most gifted player on the ball from a technical standpoint, he developed this aspect of his game under Wenger, and he later excelled as a ball-playing centre-back, in which he became known for his ability to carry the ball out from the back, as well as his penchant for undertaking individual runs [23] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] However, he was also known for his lack of pace [36] [37]\n\n\nManagerial and coaching career\nAfter starting a sports science degree at Brunel University, Adams became the manager of Wycombe Wanderers on 5 November 2003 He took over the team that were in last place in the Football League Second Division (third tier) [38] On his debut three days later, he won 4–1 at home to Swindon Town in the first round of the FA Cup [39] After a 2–1 loss at Tranmere Rovers on 12 April 2004 left the Chairboys 12 points inside the relegation zone with four games remaining, Adams said that his team would carry on fighting;

{"title": "Cryptocurrency", "content": "\nHistory\nIn 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash [10] [11] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash, [12] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments Digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party.\n\n\nFormal definition\nAccording to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions: [33]\n\n\nAltcoins\nAfter the early innovation of bitcoin in 2008 and the early network effect gained by bitcoin, tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other digital assets that were not bitcoin became collectively known during the 2010s as alternative cryptocurrencies, [35] [36] [37] or, \"altcoins\" [38]\nSometimes the term \"alt coins\" was used, [39] [40] or disparagingly, \"shitcoins\" [41] Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal described altcoins in 2020 as \"alternative versions of Bitcoin\" [42] given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers A Polytechnic University of Catalonia thesis in 2021 used a broader description, including not only alternative versions of bitcoin but every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin \"As of early 2020, there were more than 5,000 cryptocurrencies Altcoin is the combination of two words \"alt\" and \"coin\" and includes all alternatives to bitcoin.\" [38]: 14 \n\n\nStablecoins\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power [48] Notably, these designs are not foolproof, as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg For example, on 11 May 2022, Terra's stablecoin UST fell from $1 to 26 cents [49] [50] The subsequent failure of Terraform Labs resulted in the loss of nearly $40B invested in the Terra and Luna coins [51] In September 2022, South Korean prosecutors requested the issuance of an Interpol Red Notice against the company's founder, Do Kwon [52] In Hong Kong, the expected regulatory framework for stablecoins in 2023/24 is being shaped and includes a few considerations [53]\n\n\nMemecoins\nMemecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that originated from Internet memes or jokes The most notable example is Dogecoin, a memecoin featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the Doge meme [54] Memecoins are known for extreme volatility; for example, the record-high value for a Dogecoin was 73 cents, but that had plunged to 13 cents by mid-2024 [54] Scams are prolific among memecoins [54]\n\n\nPhysical crypto\nPhysical cryptocurrency coins have been made as promotional items and some have become collectibles [55] Some of these have a private key embedded in them to access crypto worth a few dollars There have also been attempts to issue bitcoin “bank notes” [56]\n\n\nArchitecture\nCryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate that is defined when the system is created and that is publicly stated In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency [citation needed] In the case of cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks, or corporate entities that hold asset value measured in it The underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by Satoshi Nakamoto [58]\n\n\nBlockchain\nThe validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography [58] [60] Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, [60] a timestamp, and transaction data [61] By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data It is \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\" [62] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.\n\n\nNodes\nA node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network The node supports the cryptocurrency's network through either relaying transactions, validation, or hosting a copy of the blockchain In terms of relaying transactions, each network computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports When a transaction is made, the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is known.\n\n\nTimestamping\nCryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \"prove\" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.\n\n\nMining\nOn a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized hardware such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt [65] This arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since bitcoin was introduced in 2009 [65] Mining is measured by hash rate, typically in TH/s [66] A 2023 IMF working paper found that crypto mining could generate 450 million tons of CO2 emissions by 2027, accounting for 0.7 percent of global emissions, or 1.2 percent of the world total [67]\n\n\nGPU price rise\nAn increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards (GPU) in 2017 [77] The computing power of GPUs makes them well-suited to generating hashes Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners, such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock [78] A GTX 1070 Ti, which was released at a price of $450, sold for as much as $1,100 Another popular card, the GTX 1060 (6 GB model), was released at an MSRP of $250 and sold for almost $500 RX 570 and RX 580 cards from AMD were out of stock for almost a year Miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new GPUs as soon as they are available [79]\n\n\nMining accelerator chips\nNumerous companies developed dedicated crypto-mining accelerator chips, capable of price-performance far higher than that of CPU or GPU mining At one point, Intel marketed its own brand of crypto accelerator chip, named Blockscale [81]\n\n\nWallets\nA cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private \"keys\" (address) or seed, which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency [82] With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.\n\n\nAnonymity\nBitcoin is pseudonymous, rather than anonymous; the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person but rather to one or more specific keys (or \"addresses\") [84] Thereby, bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain [85] Still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users [86]\n\n\nEconomics\nCryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the Internet.\n\n\nBlock rewards\nProof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances [90]\n\n\nTransaction fees\nTransaction fees (sometimes also referred to as miner fees or gas fees) for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time, versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction [94] The ability for the holder to be allowed to set the fee manually often depends on the wallet software used, and central exchanges for cryptocurrency (CEX) usually do not allow the customer to set a custom transaction fee for the transaction [citation needed] Their wallet software, such as Coinbase Wallet, however, might support adjusting the fee [95]\n\n\nExchanges\nCryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies [102] for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.\n\n\nAtomic swaps\nAtomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency without the need for a trusted third party, such as an exchange [104]\n\n\nATMs\nJordan Kelley, founder of Robocoin, launched the first bitcoin ATM in the United States on 20 February 2014 The kiosk installed in Austin, Texas, is similar to bank ATMs but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities [105]\n\n\nInitial coin offerings\nAn initial coin offering (ICO) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S and Canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an \"investment contract\" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of \"tokens\") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often bitcoin or Ether [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nPrice trends\nThe market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation The total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by bitcoin accounting for at least 50% of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to bitcoin Bitcoin's value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as blockchain rewards coded into the architecture technology of bitcoin itself The cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the \"halving\", which is when the block rewards received from bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of bitcoin As the date reaches near of a halving (twice thus far historically) the cryptocurrency market cap increases, followed by a downtrend [110]\n\n\nVolatility\nCryptocurrency prices are much more volatile than established financial assets such as stocks For example, over one week in May 2022, bitcoin lost 20% of its value and Ethereum lost 26%, while Solana and Cardano lost 41% and 35% respectively The falls were attributed to warnings about inflation By comparison, in the same week, the Nasdaq tech stock index fell 7.6 per cent and the FTSE 100 was 3.6 per cent down [114]\n\n\nDatabases\nThere are also centralized databases, outside of blockchains, that store crypto market data Compared to the blockchain, databases perform fast as there is no verification process Four of the most popular cryptocurrency market databases are CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, BraveNewCoin, and Cryptocompare [119]\n\n\nSocial and political aspects\nAccording to Alan Feuer of The New York Times, libertarians and anarcho-capitalists were attracted to the philosophical idea behind bitcoin Early bitcoin supporter Roger Ver said: \"At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state.\" [120] Economist Paul Krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are \"something of a cult\" based in \"paranoid fantasies\" of government power [121]\n\n\nIncreasing regulation\nThe rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has defined cryptocurrency-related services as \"virtual asset service providers\" (VASPs) and recommended that they be regulated with the same money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements as financial institutions [127]\n\n\nChina\nIn September 2017, China banned ICOs to cause abnormal return from cryptocurrency decreasing during announcement window The liquidity changes by banning ICOs in China was temporarily negative while the liquidity effect became positive after news [135]\n\n\nCook Islands\nIn April 2024, TVNZ's 1 News reported that the Cook Islands government was proposing legislation that would allow \"recovery agents\" to use various means including hacking to investigate or find cryptocurrency that may have been used for illegal means or is the \"proceeds of crime.\" The Tainted Cryptocurrency Recovery Bill was drafted by two lawyers hired by US-based debt collection company Drumcliffe The proposed legislation was criticised by Cook Islands Crown Law's deputy solicitor general David Greig, who described it as \"flawed\" and said that some provisions were \"clearly unconstitutional\" The Cook Islands Financial Services Development Authority described Drumcliffe's involvement as a conflict of interest [139]\n\n\nEl Salvador\nOn 9 June 2021, El Salvador announced that it will adopt bitcoin as legal tender, becoming the first country to do so [140]\n\n\nIndia\nAt present, India neither prohibits nor allows investment in the cryptocurrency market In 2020, the Supreme Court of India had lifted the ban on cryptocurrency, which was imposed by the Reserve Bank of India [141] [142] [143] [144] Since then, an investment in cryptocurrency is considered legitimate, though there is still ambiguity about the issues regarding the extent and payment of tax on the income accrued thereupon and also its regulatory regime But it is being contemplated that the Indian Parliament will soon pass a specific law to either ban or regulate the cryptocurrency market in India [145] Expressing his public policy opinion on the Indian cryptocurrency market to a well-known online publication, a leading public policy lawyer and Vice President of SAARCLAW (South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Law) Hemant Batra has said that the \"cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence, it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment\" [146] He mooted regulating the cryptocurrency market rather than completely banning it He favoured following IMF and FATF guidelines in this regard.\n\n\nSouth Africa\nSouth Africa, which has seen a large number of scams related to cryptocurrency, is said to be putting a regulatory timeline in place that will produce a regulatory framework [147] The largest scam occurred in April 2021, where the two founders of an African-based cryptocurrency exchange called Africrypt, Raees Cajee and Ameer Cajee, disappeared with $3.8 billion worth of bitcoin [148] Additionally, Mirror Trading International disappeared with $170 million worth of cryptocurrency in January 2021 [148]\n\n\nSouth Korea\nIn March 2021, South Korea implemented new legislation to strengthen their oversight of digital assets This legislation requires all digital asset managers, providers and exchanges to be registered with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit in order to operate in South Korea [149] Registering with this unit requires that all exchanges are certified by the Information Security Management System and that they ensure all customers have real name bank accounts It also requires that the CEO and board members of the exchanges have not been convicted of any crimes and that the exchange holds sufficient levels of deposit insurance to cover losses arising from hacks [149]\n\n\nSwitzerland\nSwitzerland was one of the first countries to implement the FATF's Travel Rule FINMA, the Swiss regulator, issued its own guidance to VASPs in 2019 The guidance followed the FATF's Recommendation 16, however with stricter requirements According to FINMA's [150] requirements, VASPs need to verify the identity of the beneficiary of the transfer.\n\n\nTurkey\nOn 30 April 2021, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey banned the use of cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets for making purchases on the grounds that the use of cryptocurrencies for such payments poses significant transaction risks [151]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, as of 10 January 2021, all cryptocurrency firms, such as exchanges, advisors and professionals that have either a presence, market product or provide services within the UK market must register with the Financial Conduct Authority Additionally, on 27 June 2021, the financial watchdog demanded that Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, [152] cease all regulated activities in the UK [153]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn 2021, 17 states in the US passed laws and resolutions concerning cryptocurrency regulation [154] This led the Securities and Exchange Commission to start considering what steps to take On 8 July 2021, Senator Elizabeth Warren, part of the Senate Banking Committee, wrote to the chairman of the SEC and demanded answers on cryptocurrency regulation due to the increase in cryptocurrency exchange use and the danger this posed to consumers On 5 August 2021, the chairman, Gary Gensler, responded to Warren's letter and called for legislation focused on \"crypto trading, lending and DeFi platforms,\" because of how vulnerable investors could be when they traded on crypto trading platforms without a broker He also argued that many tokens in the crypto market may be unregistered securities without required disclosures or market oversight Additionally, Gensler did not hold back in his criticism of stablecoins These tokens, which are pegged to the value of fiat currencies, may allow individuals to bypass important public policy goals related to traditional banking and financial systems, such as anti-money laundering, tax compliance, and sanctions [155]\n\n\nLegality\nThe legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them At least one study has shown that broad generalizations about the use of bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated and that blockchain analysis is an effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool [164] While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade, [165] others have banned or restricted it According to the Library of Congress in 2021,\nan \"absolute ban\" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in 9 countries:\nAlgeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, and the United Arab Emirates An \"implicit ban\" applies in another 39 countries or regions, which include: Bahrain, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Gabon, Georgia, Guyana, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lesotho, Macau, Maldives, Mali, Moldova, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Republic of Congo, Saudi Arabia, Sengeal, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Togo, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Qatar and Vietnam [166] In the United States and Canada, state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American Securities Administrators Association, are investigating \"Bitcoin scams\" and ICOs in 40 jurisdictions [167]\n\n\nAdvertising bans\nCryptocurrency advertisements have been banned on the following platforms:\n\n\nU.S. tax status\nOn 25 March 2014, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes Therefore, virtual currencies are considered commodities subject to capital gains tax [178]\n\n\nLegal concerns relating to an unregulated global economy\nAs the popularity and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of bitcoin in 2009, [179] so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society Concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals [180]\n\n\nLoss, theft, and fraud\nIn February 2014, the world's largest bitcoin exchange, Mt Gox, declared bankruptcy Likely due to theft, the company claimed that it had lost nearly 750,000 bitcoins belonging to their clients This added up to approximately 7% of all bitcoins in existence, worth a total of $473 million Mt Gox blamed hackers, who had exploited the transaction malleability problems in the network The price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February [183]\n\n\nMoney laundering\nAccording to blockchain data company Chainalysis, criminals laundered US$8,600,000,000 worth of cryptocurrency in 2021, up by 30% from the previous year [209] The data suggests that rather than managing numerous illicit havens, cybercriminals make use of a small group of purpose built centralized exchanges for sending and receiving illicit cryptocurrency In 2021, those exchanges received 47% of funds sent by crime linked addresses [210] Almost $2.2bn worth of cryptocurrencies was embezzled from DeFi protocols in 2021, which represents 72% of all cryptocurrency theft in 2021.\n\n\nDarknet markets\nProperties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of online black markets, such as Silk Road [180] The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then In the year following the initial shutdown of Silk Road, the number of prominent dark markets increased from four to twelve, while the amount of drug listings increased from 18,000 to 32,000 [180]\n\n\nWash trades\nVarious studies have found that crypto-trading is rife with wash trading Wash trading is a process, illegal in some jurisdictions, involving buyers and sellers being the same person or group, and may be used to manipulate the price of a cryptocurrency or inflate volume artificially Exchanges with higher volumes can demand higher premiums from token issuers [218] A study from 2019 concluded that up to 80% of trades on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges could be wash trades [218] A 2019 report by Bitwise Asset Management claimed that 95% of all bitcoin trading volume reported on major website CoinMarketCap had been artificially generated, and of 81 exchanges studied, only 10 provided legitimate volume figures [219]\n\n\nAs a tool to evade sanctions\nIn 2022, cryptocurrencies attracted attention when Western nations imposed severe economic sanctions on Russia in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine in February However, American sources warned in March that some crypto-transactions could potentially be used to evade economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus [220]\n\n\nImpacts and analysis\nThe Bank for International Settlements summarized several criticisms of cryptocurrencies in Chapter V of their 2018 annual report The criticisms include the lack of stability in their price, the high energy consumption, high and variable transactions costs, the poor security and fraud at cryptocurrency exchanges, vulnerability to debasement (from forking), and the influence of miners [222] [223] [224]\n\n\nSpeculation, fraud, and adoption\nCryptocurrencies have been compared to Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes [225] and economic bubbles, [226] such as housing market bubbles [227] Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management stated in 2017 that digital currencies were \"nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it\", and compared them to the tulip mania (1637), South Sea Bubble (1720), and dot-com bubble (1999), which all experienced profound price booms and busts [228]\n\n\nNon-fungible tokens\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent art, collectibles, gaming, etc Like crypto, their data is stored on the blockchain NFTs are bought and traded using cryptocurrency The Ethereum blockchain was the first place where NFTs were implemented, but now many other blockchains have created their own versions of NFTs.\n\n\nBanks\nAccording to Vanessa Grellet, renowned panelist in blockchain conferences, [241] there was an increasing interest from traditional stock exchanges in crypto-assets at the end of the 2010s, while crypto-exchanges such as Coinbase were gradually entering the traditional financial markets This convergence marked a significant trend where conventional financial actors were adopting blockchain technology to enhance operational efficiency, while the crypto world introduced innovations like Security Token Offering (STO), enabling new ways of fundraising Tokenization, turning assets such as real estate, investment funds, and private equity into blockchain-based tokens, had the potential to make traditionally illiquid assets more accessible to investors Despite the regulatory risks associated with such developments, major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, were actively working on blockchain initiatives, exemplified by the creation of Quorum, a private blockchain platform [242]\n\n\nEnvironmental effects\nMining for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies requires enormous amounts of electricity and consequently comes with a large carbon footprint due to causing greenhouse gas emissions [248] Proof-of-work blockchains such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero were estimated to have added between 3 million and 15 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in the period from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2017 [249] By November 2018, bitcoin was estimated to have an annual energy consumption of 45.8TWh, generating 22.0 to 22.9 million tons of CO2, rivalling nations like Jordan and Sri Lanka [250] By the end of 2021, bitcoin was estimated to produce 65.4 million tons of CO2, as much as Greece, [251] and consume between 91 and 177 terawatt-hours annually [252] [253]\n\n\nTechnological limitations\nThere are also purely technical elements to consider For example, technological advancement in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin result in high up-front costs to miners in the form of specialized hardware and software [268] Cryptocurrency transactions are normally irreversible after a number of blocks confirm the transaction Additionally, cryptocurrency private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware, data loss or the destruction of the physical media This precludes the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets [269]\n\n\nAcademic studies\nIn September 2015, the establishment of the peer-reviewed academic journal Ledger (ISSN 2379-5980) was announced It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the University of Pittsburgh [270]\n\n\nAid agencies\nA number of aid agencies have started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies, including UNICEF [273] Christopher Fabian, principal adviser at UNICEF Innovation, said the children's fund would uphold donor protocols, meaning that people making donations online would have to pass checks before they were allowed to deposit funds [274] [275]\n\n\nCriticism\nBitcoin has been characterized as a speculative bubble by eight winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences: Paul Krugman, [279] Robert J Shiller, [280] Joseph Stiglitz, [281] Richard Thaler, [282] James Heckman, [283] Thomas Sargent, [283] Angus Deaton, [283] and Oliver Hart; [283] and by central bank officials including Alan Greenspan, [284] Agustín Carstens, [285] Vítor Constâncio, [286] and Nout Wellink [287]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Cryptocurrency\n\n## Introduction\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, numerous other cryptocurrencies have been created, each with its own unique features and uses.\n\n## History\n\nIn 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash. Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash, an early form of cryptographic electronic payments. Digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party.\n\n## Formal Definition\n\nAccording to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:\n\n* A decentralized control system\n* A peer-to-peer network\n* A cryptographic algorithm for security\n* A decentralized, distributed ledger system\n* A use of digital signatures for transaction validation\n* A system for verifying the integrity of transactions\n\n## Altcoins\n\nAfter the early innovation of bitcoin in 2008 and the early network effect gained by bitcoin, tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other digital assets that were not bitcoin became collectively known during the 2010s as alternative cryptocurrencies, or \"altcoins.\" Sometimes the term \"alt coins\" was used, or disparagingly, \"shitcoins.\" Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal described altcoins in 2020 as \"alternative versions of Bitcoin\" given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers.\n\n## Stablecoins\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power. Notably, these designs are not foolproof, as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg. For example, on 11 May 2022, Terra's stablecoin UST fell from $1 to 26 cents.\n\n## Memecoins\n\nMemecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that originated from Internet memes or jokes. The most notable example is Dogecoin, a memecoin featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the Doge meme. Memecoins are known for extreme volatility; for example, the record-high value for a Dogecoin was 73 cents, but that had plunged to 13 cents by mid-2024.\n\n## Physical Crypto\n\nPhysical cryptocurrency coins have been made as promotional items and some have become collectibles. Some of these have a private key embedded in them to access crypto worth a few dollars. There have also been attempts to issue bitcoin \"bank notes.\"\n\n## Architecture\n\nCryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate that is defined when the system is created and that is publicly stated. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency. In the case of cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks, or corporate entities that hold asset value measured in it.\n\n## Blockchain\n\nThe validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.\n\n## Nodes\n\nA node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. A node supports the cryptocurrency's network through either relaying transactions, validation, or hosting a copy of the blockchain.\n\n## Timestamping\n\nCryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \"prove\" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.\n\n## Mining\n\nOn a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized hardware such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt.\n\n## GPU Price Rise\n\nAn increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards (GPU) in 2017. The computing power of GPUs makes them well-suited to generating hashes. Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners, such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock.\n\n## Mining Accelerator Chips\n\nNumerous companies developed dedicated crypto-mining accelerator chips, capable of price-performance far higher than that of CPU or GPU mining.\n\n## Wallets\n\nA cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private \"keys\" (address) or seed, which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.\n\n## Anonymity\n\nBitcoin is pseudonymous, rather than anonymous; the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person but rather to one or more specific keys (or \"addresses\"). Thereby, bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain.\n\n## Economics\n\nCryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the Internet.\n\n## Block Rewards\n\nProof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners. There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances.\n\n## Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees (sometimes also referred to as miner fees or gas fees) for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time, versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction.\n\n## Exchanges\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.\n\n## Atomic Swaps\n\nAtomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency without the need for a trusted third party, such as an exchange.\n\n## ATMs\n\nThe first bitcoin ATM was installed in the United States on 20 February 2014, in Austin, Texas. The kiosk is similar to bank ATMs but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities.\n\n## Initial Coin Offerings\n\nAn initial coin offering (ICO) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation.

Additionally, cryptocurrency private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware, data loss or the destruction of the physical media. This precludes the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets.\n\n## Academic Studies\n\nIn September 2015, the establishment of the peer-reviewed academic journal Ledger (ISSN 2379-5980) was announced. It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n## Aid Agencies\n\nA number of aid agencies have started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies, including UNICEF. Christopher Fabian, principal adviser at UNICEF Innovation, said the children's fund would uphold donor protocols, meaning that people making donations online would have to pass checks before they were allowed to deposit funds.\n\n## Criticism\n\nBitcoin has been characterized as a speculative bubble by eight winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences: Paul Krugman, Robert J Shiller, Joseph Stiglitz, Richard Thaler, James Heckman, Thomas Sargent, Angus Deaton, and Oliver Hart; and by central bank officials including Alan Greenspan, Agustín Carstens, Vítor Constâncio, and Nout Wellink.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cryptocurrency\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash [10] [11] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash, [12] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments Digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party.\n\n\nFormal definition\nAccording to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions: [33]\n\n\nAltcoins\nAfter the early innovation of bitcoin in 2008 and the early network effect gained by bitcoin, tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other digital assets that were not bitcoin became collectively known during the 2010s as alternative cryptocurrencies, [35] [36] [37] or, \"altcoins\" [38]\nSometimes the term \"alt coins\" was used, [39] [40] or disparagingly, \"shitcoins\" [41] Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal described altcoins in 2020 as \"alternative versions of Bitcoin\" [42] given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers A Polytechnic University of Catalonia thesis in 2021 used a broader description, including not only alternative versions of bitcoin but every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin \"As of early 2020, there were more than 5,000 cryptocurrencies Altcoin is the combination of two words \"alt\" and \"coin\" and includes all alternatives to bitcoin.\" [38]: 14 \n\n\nStablecoins\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power [48] Notably, these designs are not foolproof, as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg For example, on 11 May 2022, Terra's stablecoin UST fell from $1 to 26 cents [49] [50] The subsequent failure of Terraform Labs resulted in the loss of nearly $40B invested in the Terra and Luna coins [51] In September 2022, South Korean prosecutors requested the issuance of an Interpol Red Notice against the company's founder, Do Kwon [52] In Hong Kong, the expected regulatory framework for stablecoins in 2023/24 is being shaped and includes a few considerations [53]\n\n\nMemecoins\nMemecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that originated from Internet memes or jokes The most notable example is Dogecoin, a memecoin featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the Doge meme [54] Memecoins are known for extreme volatility; for example, the record-high value for a Dogecoin was 73 cents, but that had plunged to 13 cents by mid-2024 [54] Scams are prolific among memecoins [54]\n\n\nPhysical crypto\nPhysical cryptocurrency coins have been made as promotional items and some have become collectibles [55] Some of these have a private key embedded in them to access crypto worth a few dollars There have also been attempts to issue bitcoin “bank notes” [56]\n\n\nArchitecture\nCryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate that is defined when the system is created and that is publicly stated In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency [citation needed] In the case of cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks, or corporate entities that hold asset value measured in it The underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by Satoshi Nakamoto [58]\n\n\nBlockchain\nThe validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography [58] [60] Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, [60] a timestamp, and transaction data [61] By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data It is \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\" [62] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.\n\n\nNodes\nA node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network The node supports the cryptocurrency's network through either relaying transactions, validation, or hosting a copy of the blockchain In terms of relaying transactions, each network computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports When a transaction is made, the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is known.\n\n\nTimestamping\nCryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \"prove\" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.\n\n\nMining\nOn a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized hardware such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt [65] This arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since bitcoin was introduced in 2009 [65] Mining is measured by hash rate, typically in TH/s [66] A 2023 IMF working paper found that crypto mining could generate 450 million tons of CO2 emissions by 2027, accounting for 0.7 percent of global emissions, or 1.2 percent of the world total [67]\n\n\nGPU price rise\nAn increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards (GPU) in 2017 [77] The computing power of GPUs makes them well-suited to generating hashes Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners, such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock [78] A GTX 1070 Ti, which was released at a price of $450, sold for as much as $1,100 Another popular card, the GTX 1060 (6 GB model), was released at an MSRP of $250 and sold for almost $500 RX 570 and RX 580 cards from AMD were out of stock for almost a year Miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new GPUs as soon as they are available [79]\n\n\nMining accelerator chips\nNumerous companies developed dedicated crypto-mining accelerator chips, capable of price-performance far higher than that of CPU or GPU mining At one point, Intel marketed its own brand of crypto accelerator chip, named Blockscale [81]\n\n\nWallets\nA cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private \"keys\" (address) or seed, which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency [82] With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.\n\n\nAnonymity\nBitcoin is pseudonymous, rather than anonymous; the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person but rather to one or more specific keys (or \"addresses\") [84] Thereby, bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain [85] Still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users [86]\n\n\nEconomics\nCryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the Internet.\n\n\nBlock rewards\nProof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances [90]\n\n\nTransaction fees\nTransaction fees (sometimes also referred to as miner fees or gas fees) for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time, versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction [94] The ability for the holder to be allowed to set the fee manually often depends on the wallet software used, and central exchanges for cryptocurrency (CEX) usually do not allow the customer to set a custom transaction fee for the transaction [citation needed] Their wallet software, such as Coinbase Wallet, however, might support adjusting the fee [95]\n\n\nExchanges\nCryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies [102] for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.\n\n\nAtomic swaps\nAtomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency without the need for a trusted third party, such as an exchange [104]\n\n\nATMs\nJordan Kelley, founder of Robocoin, launched the first bitcoin ATM in the United States on 20 February 2014 The kiosk installed in Austin, Texas, is similar to bank ATMs but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities [105]\n\n\nInitial coin offerings\nAn initial coin offering (ICO) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S and Canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an \"investment contract\" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of \"tokens\") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often bitcoin or Ether [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nPrice trends\nThe market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation The total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by bitcoin accounting for at least 50% of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to bitcoin Bitcoin's value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as blockchain rewards coded into the architecture technology of bitcoin itself The cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the \"halving\", which is when the block rewards received from bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of bitcoin As the date reaches near of a halving (twice thus far historically) the cryptocurrency market cap increases, followed by a downtrend [110]\n\n\nVolatility\nCryptocurrency prices are much more volatile than established financial assets such as stocks For example, over one week in May 2022, bitcoin lost 20% of its value and Ethereum lost 26%, while Solana and Cardano lost 41% and 35% respectively The falls were attributed to warnings about inflation By comparison, in the same week, the Nasdaq tech stock index fell 7.6 per cent and the FTSE 100 was 3.6 per cent down [114]\n\n\nDatabases\nThere are also centralized databases, outside of blockchains, that store crypto market data Compared to the blockchain, databases perform fast as there is no verification process Four of the most popular cryptocurrency market databases are CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, BraveNewCoin, and Cryptocompare [119]\n\n\nSocial and political aspects\nAccording to Alan Feuer of The New York Times, libertarians and anarcho-capitalists were attracted to the philosophical idea behind bitcoin Early bitcoin supporter Roger Ver said: \"At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state.\" [120] Economist Paul Krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are \"something of a cult\" based in \"paranoid fantasies\" of government power [121]\n\n\nIncreasing regulation\nThe rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has defined cryptocurrency-related services as \"virtual asset service providers\" (VASPs) and recommended that they be regulated with the same money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements as financial institutions [127]\n\n\nChina\nIn September 2017, China banned ICOs to cause abnormal return from cryptocurrency decreasing during announcement window The liquidity changes by banning ICOs in China was temporarily negative while the liquidity effect became positive after news [135]\n\n\nCook Islands\nIn April 2024, TVNZ's 1 News reported that the Cook Islands government was proposing legislation that would allow \"recovery agents\" to use various means including hacking to investigate or find cryptocurrency that may have been used for illegal means or is the \"proceeds of crime.\" The Tainted Cryptocurrency Recovery Bill was drafted by two lawyers hired by US-based debt collection company Drumcliffe The proposed legislation was criticised by Cook Islands Crown Law's deputy solicitor general David Greig, who described it as \"flawed\" and said that some provisions were \"clearly unconstitutional\" The Cook Islands Financial Services Development Authority described Drumcliffe's involvement as a conflict of interest [139]\n\n\nEl Salvador\nOn 9 June 2021, El Salvador announced that it will adopt bitcoin as legal tender, becoming the first country to do so [140]\n\n\nIndia\nAt present, India neither prohibits nor allows investment in the cryptocurrency market In 2020, the Supreme Court of India had lifted the ban on cryptocurrency, which was imposed by the Reserve Bank of India [141] [142] [143] [144] Since then, an investment in cryptocurrency is considered legitimate, though there is still ambiguity about the issues regarding the extent and payment of tax on the income accrued thereupon and also its regulatory regime But it is being contemplated that the Indian Parliament will soon pass a specific law to either ban or regulate the cryptocurrency market in India [145] Expressing his public policy opinion on the Indian cryptocurrency market to a well-known online publication, a leading public policy lawyer and Vice President of SAARCLAW (South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Law) Hemant Batra has said that the \"cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence, it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment\" [146] He mooted regulating the cryptocurrency market rather than completely banning it He favoured following IMF and FATF guidelines in this regard.\n\n\nSouth Africa\nSouth Africa, which has seen a large number of scams related to cryptocurrency, is said to be putting a regulatory timeline in place that will produce a regulatory framework [147] The largest scam occurred in April 2021, where the two founders of an African-based cryptocurrency exchange called Africrypt, Raees Cajee and Ameer Cajee, disappeared with $3.8 billion worth of bitcoin [148] Additionally, Mirror Trading International disappeared with $170 million worth of cryptocurrency in January 2021 [148]\n\n\nSouth Korea\nIn March 2021, South Korea implemented new legislation to strengthen their oversight of digital assets This legislation requires all digital asset managers, providers and exchanges to be registered with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit in order to operate in South Korea [149] Registering with this unit requires that all exchanges are certified by the Information Security Management System and that they ensure all customers have real name bank accounts It also requires that the CEO and board members of the exchanges have not been convicted of any crimes and that the exchange holds sufficient levels of deposit insurance to cover losses arising from hacks [149]\n\n\nSwitzerland\nSwitzerland was one of the first countries to implement the FATF's Travel Rule FINMA, the Swiss regulator, issued its own guidance to VASPs in 2019 The guidance followed the FATF's Recommendation 16, however with stricter requirements According to FINMA's [150] requirements, VASPs need to verify the identity of the beneficiary of the transfer.\n\n\nTurkey\nOn 30 April 2021, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey banned the use of cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets for making purchases on the grounds that the use of cryptocurrencies for such payments poses significant transaction risks [151]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, as of 10 January 2021, all cryptocurrency firms, such as exchanges, advisors and professionals that have either a presence, market product or provide services within the UK market must register with the Financial Conduct Authority Additionally, on 27 June 2021, the financial watchdog demanded that Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, [152] cease all regulated activities in the UK [153]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn 2021, 17 states in the US passed laws and resolutions concerning cryptocurrency regulation [154] This led the Securities and Exchange Commission to start considering what steps to take On 8 July 2021, Senator Elizabeth Warren, part of the Senate Banking Committee, wrote to the chairman of the SEC and demanded answers on cryptocurrency regulation due to the increase in cryptocurrency exchange use and the danger this posed to consumers On 5 August 2021, the chairman, Gary Gensler, responded to Warren's letter and called for legislation focused on \"crypto trading, lending and DeFi platforms,\" because of how vulnerable investors could be when they traded on crypto trading platforms without a broker He also argued that many tokens in the crypto market may be unregistered securities without required disclosures or market oversight Additionally, Gensler did not hold back in his criticism of stablecoins These tokens, which are pegged to the value of fiat currencies, may allow individuals to bypass important public policy goals related to traditional banking and financial systems, such as anti-money laundering, tax compliance, and sanctions [155]\n\n\nLegality\nThe legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them At least one study has shown that broad generalizations about the use of bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated and that blockchain analysis is an effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool [164] While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade, [165] others have banned or restricted it According to the Library of Congress in 2021,\nan \"absolute ban\" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in 9 countries:\nAlgeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, and the United Arab Emirates An \"implicit ban\" applies in another 39 countries or regions, which include: Bahrain, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Gabon, Georgia, Guyana, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lesotho, Macau, Maldives, Mali, Moldova, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Republic of Congo, Saudi Arabia, Sengeal, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Togo, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Qatar and Vietnam [166] In the United States and Canada, state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American Securities Administrators Association, are investigating \"Bitcoin scams\" and ICOs in 40 jurisdictions [167]\n\n\nAdvertising bans\nCryptocurrency advertisements have been banned on the following platforms:\n\n\nU.S. tax status\nOn 25 March 2014, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes Therefore, virtual currencies are considered commodities subject to capital gains tax [178]\n\n\nLegal concerns relating to an unregulated global economy\nAs the popularity and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of bitcoin in 2009, [179] so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society Concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals [180]\n\n\nLoss, theft, and fraud\nIn February 2014, the world's largest bitcoin exchange, Mt Gox, declared bankruptcy Likely due to theft, the company claimed that it had lost nearly 750,000 bitcoins belonging to their clients This added up to approximately 7% of all bitcoins in existence, worth a total of $473 million Mt Gox blamed hackers, who had exploited the transaction malleability problems in the network The price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February [183]\n\n\nMoney laundering\nAccording to blockchain data company Chainalysis, criminals laundered US$8,600,000,000 worth of cryptocurrency in 2021, up by 30% from the previous year [209] The data suggests that rather than managing numerous illicit havens, cybercriminals make use of a small group of purpose built centralized exchanges for sending and receiving illicit cryptocurrency In 2021, those exchanges received 47% of funds sent by crime linked addresses [210] Almost $2.2bn worth of cryptocurrencies was embezzled from DeFi protocols in 2021, which represents 72% of all cryptocurrency theft in 2021.\n\n\nDarknet markets\nProperties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of online black markets, such as Silk Road [180] The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then In the year following the initial shutdown of Silk Road, the number of prominent dark markets increased from four to twelve, while the amount of drug listings increased from 18,000 to 32,000 [180]\n\n\nWash trades\nVarious studies have found that crypto-trading is rife with wash trading Wash trading is a process, illegal in some jurisdictions, involving buyers and sellers being the same person or group, and may be used to manipulate the price of a cryptocurrency or inflate volume artificially Exchanges with higher volumes can demand higher premiums from token issuers [218] A study from 2019 concluded that up to 80% of trades on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges could be wash trades [218] A 2019 report by Bitwise Asset Management claimed that 95% of all bitcoin trading volume reported on major website CoinMarketCap had been artificially generated, and of 81 exchanges studied, only 10 provided legitimate volume figures [219]\n\n\nAs a tool to evade sanctions\nIn 2022, cryptocurrencies attracted attention when Western nations imposed severe economic sanctions on Russia in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine in February However, American sources warned in March that some crypto-transactions could potentially be used to evade economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus [220]\n\n\nImpacts and analysis\nThe Bank for International Settlements summarized several criticisms of cryptocurrencies in Chapter V of their 2018 annual report The criticisms include the lack of stability in their price, the high energy consumption, high and variable transactions costs, the poor security and fraud at cryptocurrency exchanges, vulnerability to debasement (from forking), and the influence of miners [222] [223] [224]\n\n\nSpeculation, fraud, and adoption\nCryptocurrencies have been compared to Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes [225] and economic bubbles, [226] such as housing market bubbles [227] Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management stated in 2017 that digital currencies were \"nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it\", and compared them to the tulip mania (1637), South Sea Bubble (1720), and dot-com bubble (1999), which all experienced profound price booms and busts [228]\n\n\nNon-fungible tokens\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent art, collectibles, gaming, etc Like crypto, their data is stored on the blockchain NFTs are bought and traded using cryptocurrency The Ethereum blockchain was the first place where NFTs were implemented, but now many other blockchains have created their own versions of NFTs.\n\n\nBanks\nAccording to Vanessa Grellet, renowned panelist in blockchain conferences, [241] there was an increasing interest from traditional stock exchanges in crypto-assets at the end of the 2010s, while crypto-exchanges such as Coinbase were gradually entering the traditional financial markets This convergence marked a significant trend where conventional financial actors were adopting blockchain technology to enhance operational efficiency, while the crypto world introduced innovations like Security Token Offering (STO), enabling new ways of fundraising Tokenization, turning assets such as real estate, investment funds, and private equity into blockchain-based tokens, had the potential to make traditionally illiquid assets more accessible to investors Despite the regulatory risks associated with such developments, major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, were actively working on blockchain initiatives, exemplified by the creation of Quorum, a private blockchain platform [242]\n\n\nEnvironmental effects\nMining for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies requires enormous amounts of electricity and consequently comes with a large carbon footprint due to causing greenhouse gas emissions [248] Proof-of-work blockchains such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero were estimated to have added between 3 million and 15 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in the period from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2017 [249] By November 2018, bitcoin was estimated to have an annual energy consumption of 45.8TWh, generating 22.0 to 22.9 million tons of CO2, rivalling nations like Jordan and Sri Lanka [250] By the end of 2021, bitcoin was estimated to produce 65.4 million tons of CO2, as much as Greece, [251] and consume between 91 and 177 terawatt-hours annually [252] [253]\n\n\nTechnological limitations\nThere are also purely technical elements to consider For example, technological advancement in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin result in high up-front costs to miners in the form of specialized hardware and software [268] Cryptocurrency transactions are normally irreversible after a number of blocks confirm the transaction Additionally, cryptocurrency private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware, data loss or the destruction of the physical media This precludes the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets [269]\n\n\nAcademic studies\nIn September 2015, the establishment of the peer-reviewed academic journal Ledger (ISSN 2379-5980) was announced It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the University of Pittsburgh [270]\n\n\nAid agencies\nA number of aid agencies have started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies, including UNICEF [273] Christopher Fabian, principal adviser at UNICEF Innovation, said the children's fund would uphold donor protocols, meaning that people making donations online would have to pass checks before they were allowed to deposit funds [274] [275]\n\n\nCriticism\nBitcoin has been characterized as a speculative bubble by eight winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences: Paul Krugman, [279] Robert J Shiller, [280] Joseph Stiglitz, [281] Richard Thaler, [282] James Heckman, [283] Thomas Sargent, [283] Angus Deaton, [283] and Oliver Hart; [283] and by central bank officials including Alan Greenspan, [284] Agustín Carstens, [285] Vítor Constâncio, [286] and Nout Wellink [287]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

He is one of the richest individuals in India, with an estimated net worth of over $120 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGautam Adani was born on June 24, 1962, in a Gujarati Jain family to Shantilal Adani and Shantaben Adani in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. He has seven siblings. His parents had migrated from the town of Tharad in the northern part of Gujarat. His father was a small textile merchant who struggled to make ends meet. Adani's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, which would later shape his business acumen and drive.\n\n## Childhood and Education\n\nAdani's family moved to a small house in Ahmedabad, where he spent his early childhood. He attended the local school and was an average student. However, he showed a keen interest in business and entrepreneurship from a young age. After completing his secondary education, Adani joined the Gujarat University, where he studied commerce. However, he dropped out of college to pursue his business interests.\n\n## Early Career\n\nAdani's entry into the business world was facilitated by his elder brother, Mahasukhbhai Adani, who had started a plastics unit in Ahmedabad. In 1978, Adani moved to Mumbai to work as a diamond sorter for Mahendra Brothers. However, he soon became involved in his brother's business and began to learn the intricacies of the plastics industry. In 1981, Adani's brother bought a plastics unit in Ahmedabad, and he was invited to manage the operations. This venture turned out to be Adani's gateway to global trading through polyvinyl chloride (PVC) imports.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 1985, Adani started importing primary polymers for small-scale industries. He soon realized the potential of the Indian market and began to expand his business. In 1988, he established Adani Exports, now known as Adani Enterprises, the holding company of the Adani Group. Originally, the company dealt in agricultural and power commodities. However, after the economic liberalization policies were introduced in 1991, Adani started to expand his business into trading of metals, textiles, and agro-products.\n\n## Adani Group\n\nIn 1994, the Government of Gujarat announced the managerial outsourcing of the Mundra Port. Adani's company was one of the bidders for the contract. In 1995, Adani obtained the contract and began to develop the port. The Mundra Port is now one of the largest private ports in India and a key hub for the Adani Group's logistics and transportation business.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nAdani has been involved in several controversies throughout his career. In 2002, he was arrested by the Delhi Police in execution of a non-bailable warrant (NBW) following a cheating complaint by a top official of M S Shoes. However, the court withdrew the NBW the next day after the court was informed that the parties were negotiating for a compromise.\n\n## OCCRP Report\n\nIn 2023, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reported that it had documents which prove how the Adani Group used individuals and front companies to buy and sell Adani stocks, thus bypassing Indian securities laws that seek to prevent share price manipulation. The OCCRP named two individuals, Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling, as being responsible for stock trading in and on behalf of Adani Group stocks amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n**Political Views**\n\nAdani has maintained a close relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. This has led to allegations of cronyism, as Adani's firms have won many Indian energy and infrastructure government contracts. An Indian government auditor accused Modi in 2012 of giving low-cost fuel from a Gujarat state-run gas company to Adani and other businesspeople.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nAdani is married to Priti Adani. The couple has two sons, Karan, who is CEO of Adani Ports & SEZ, and Jeet. Adani prefers to keep his personal life away from the media.\n\n## Philanthropy\n\nAdani's wife, Priti Adani, has been the chairperson of the Adani Foundation since she founded it in 1996. The Adani Foundation is the corporate social responsibility (philanthropy) arm of the Adani Group and has a presence in 18 states of India. The foundation focuses on education, healthcare, and community development projects.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGautam Adani is a self-made business magnate who has built a vast conglomerate through his vision and entrepreneurial skills. He has been involved in several controversies, but his success has been unprecedented. Adani's legacy will be remembered for generations to come, and his impact on the Indian economy and society will be felt for a long time.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gautam_Adani\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAdani was born on 24 June 1962 in a Gujarati Jain family to Shantilal Adani (father) and Shantaben Adani (mother) in Ahmedabad, Gujarat [1] [18] He has 7 siblings His parents had migrated from the town of Tharad in the northern part of Gujarat [19] His father was a small textile merchant [20]\n\n\nCareer\nAs a teenager, Adani moved to Mumbai in 1978 to work as a diamond sorter for Mahendra Brothers [23] In 1981, his elder brother Mahasukhbhai Adani bought a plastics unit in Ahmedabad and invited him to manage the operations This venture turned out to be Adani's gateway to global trading through polyvinyl chloride (PVC) imports [21] In 1985, he started importing primary polymers for small-scale industries In 1988, Adani established Adani Exports, now known as Adani Enterprises, the holding company of the Adani Group Originally, the company dealt in agricultural and power commodities [21] In 1991, the economic liberalisation policies turned out to be favourable for his company and he started expanding the businesses into trading of metals, textiles, and agro products [21] [24]\n\n\nAdani Group\nIn 1994, the Government of Gujarat announced managerial outsourcing of the Mundra Port and in 1995, Adani obtained the contract [6]\n\n\nControversies\nIn 2002, Adani was arrested by Delhi Police in execution of a non-bailable warrant (NBW), following a cheating complaint by a top official of M S Shoes The court withdrew the NBW the next day after the court was informed that the parties were negotiating for a compromise [40]\n\n\nOCCRP Report\nThe Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reported in August 2023 that it had documents which prove how the Adani Group used individuals and front companies to buy and sell Adani stocks thus bypassing Indian securities laws that seek to prevent share price manipulation The OCCRP named two individuals — Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling — as being responsible for stock trading in and on behalf of Adani Group stocks amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars [55] [56]\n\n\nPolitical views\nAdani prefers to keep his personal life away from the media [57] but is widely known for being close to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party [3] [37] This has led to allegations of cronyism as his firms have won many Indian energy and infrastructure government contracts [9] An Indian government auditor accused Modi in 2012 of giving low cost fuel from a Gujarat state-run gas company to Adani and other businesspeople [58]\n\n\nPersonal life\nGautam Adani is married to Priti Adani The couple have two sons, Karan, who is CEO of Adani Ports & SEZ [61] [62]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nAdani's wife, Priti Adani, has been the chairperson of the Adani Foundation since she founded it in 1996 [67] [68]  This is the corporate social responsibility (philanthropy) arm of the Adani Group and has a presence in 18 states of India [68]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Paulo [7] The middle child of a wealthy Brazilian family, he was born to landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva and his wife Neide Joanna Senna da Silva; he had an older sister, Viviane, and a younger brother, Leonardo [8] [9] He was left-handed [10] [11] [better source needed] Senna's mother was the granddaughter of Italian immigrants, while his father was born to a Spanish mother (from Tíjola, Province of Almería) and a Brazilian father from São Paulo [12]\n\n\nFormula One career\nIn 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg [29] Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season [29]\n\n\nToleman (1984)\nIn 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg [29] Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season [29]\n\n\n1983–1984: testing and debut season\nIn 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg [29] Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season [29]\n\n\nLotus (1985–1987)\nSenna was partnered in his first year at Lotus-Renault by Italian driver Elio de Angelis He had dominated testing times at Rio, although he retired with electrical issues during the race weekend Although the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was quick and nimble, particularly on tight and bumpy circuits and perhaps had the best suspension of any car that year, the car was unreliable and Senna made a few mistakes out of inexperience At the second round of the season, the Portuguese Grand Prix, Senna took the first pole position of his Formula 1 career He converted it into his first victory in the race, which was held in very wet conditions, winning by over a minute from the Ferrari of Michele Alboreto, [43] and lapping everyone up to and including third placed Patrick Tambay The race was the first Grand Slam of Senna's career, as he also set the fastest lap of the race He later argued it was the best drive of his career, [44] an opinion shared by race engineer Steve Hallam, who recognised Senna's \"truly special\" talent [45]\n\n\n1985: first pole positions and wins\nSenna was partnered in his first year at Lotus-Renault by Italian driver Elio de Angelis He had dominated testing times at Rio, although he retired with electrical issues during the race weekend Although the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was quick and nimble, particularly on tight and bumpy circuits and perhaps had the best suspension of any car that year, the car was unreliable and Senna made a few mistakes out of inexperience At the second round of the season, the Portuguese Grand Prix, Senna took

was the best drive of his career, [44] an opinion shared by race engineer Steve Hallam, who recognised Senna's \"truly special\" talent [45]\n\n\n1986: eight pole positions and eight podiums\nDe Angelis was replaced at Lotus by Scotland's Johnny Dumfries after Senna vetoed Derek Warwick from joining the team, saying that Lotus could not run competitive cars for two top drivers at the same time Senna allegedly pushed for his former flatmate and fellow Brazilian Maurício Gugelmin to join the team as a pure number two driver, but the team's major sponsor John Player & Sons (JPS) insisted on a British driver, which led to the signing of Dumfries Senna later admitted \"It was bad, bad Until then I had a good relationship with Derek.\" [50] Senna started the season well, coming second in Brazil behind the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet, and winning the Spanish Grand Prix by just 0.014s from Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races [51] Although the 98T was like the 97T which came before it, a quick car with superiority on tight, bumpy circuits but plagued with poor reliability, particularly in the second half of the season it saw him drift behind the Williams pairing of Mansell and Piquet, as well as defending and eventual champion Alain Prost Nonetheless, Senna was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the Detroit Grand Prix, thus finishing the season fourth in the driver's standings again, with a total of 55 points The 1986 Formula One cars were the most powerful cars in history, with Senna's 98T producing over 1,300 bhp (969 kW; 1,318 PS) in qualifying and 850 bhp (634 kW; 862 PS) in the race [52]\n\n\n1987: last season at Lotus\nTeam Lotus had a new engine deal in 1987, running the same turbocharged Honda V6 engines as Williams had used to win the previous year's Constructors' Championship, and with them came a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, Satoru Nakajima, who was a test driver employed directly by Honda The team guaranteed Senna contractually preferential treatment over Nakajima in the allocation of equipment [55] Senna started the season with mixed fortunes: a podium at the San Marino Grand Prix was tempered by controversy at the following race at Spa-Francorchamps, where he collided with Mansell, and afterward in the pits an irate Mansell grabbed Senna by the throat and had to be restrained by Lotus mechanics [56] [57] Senna then won two races in a row, which helped him take the lead in the World Championship: the ensuing Monaco Grand Prix (the first of his record six victories at the Principality) and the Detroit Grand Prix, his second victory in two years at the angular Michigan street circuit, [58] and the first ever for an active suspension Formula One car [59]\n\n\nMcLaren (1988–1993)\nIn 1988, due to the relationship he had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, Senna joined the McLaren team [63] The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years [64] The experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main opposition from Ferrari, Williams, Benetton, and Lotus.\n\n\n1988: first world championship\nIn 1988, due to the relationship he had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, Senna joined the McLaren team [63] The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years [64] The experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main opposition from Ferrari, Williams, Benetton, and Lotus.\n\n\n1989: runner-up to Alain Prost\nIn 1989, the rivalry between Senna and Prost intensified into numerous battles on the track and a psychological war off it [67] [page needed] Some controversy also arose after the French GP press conference when Ron Dennis declared that they found consistent differences between the Honda engines from Prost and Senna, to the detriment of Prost [68] Tension and mistrust between the two drivers increased when Senna overtook Prost at the restart of the San Marino Grand Prix, a move which Prost claimed violated a pre-race agreement (Senna denied the existence of any agreement, although Prost's story was backed up by John Hogan of the team's major sponsor, Marlboro) A discussion between the two drivers and Dennis during a test session at the Pembrey circuit in Wales served to effectively confirm Senna and Prost's personal animosity to Dennis and the team.\n\n\n1990: second world championship\nIn 1990, Senna took a commanding lead in the championship with six wins, two second-places, and three thirds With Prost gone to Ferrari, he also had a new teammate in Austrian driver and friend Gerhard Berger Among his victories were the opening round on the wide streets of Phoenix, in which he diced for the lead for several laps with Jean Alesi's Tyrrell before coming out on top, and in Germany, where he fought Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini throughout the race for the win Senna won six races, including another Monaco win.\n\n\n1991: youngest back-to-back and three-time world champion\nIn 1991, Senna became the youngest ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, the likes of which littered the team's history, was no longer a serious competitor.\n\n\n1992: unsuccessful challenge to the Williams FW14B\nIn 1992, Senna's determination to win manifested itself in dismay at McLaren's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering FW14B car [94] The FW14B, thanks in part to its aerodynamic-enhancing active suspension and powerful Renault V10 engine was much faster and efficient than any other car that season McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings A delay occurred in getting the new MP4/7A model running (it was McLaren's first car with a semi-automatic gearbox and it debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) and in addition to lacking active suspension, the new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while its Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit [95] Even so, Senna scored wins in Monaco, Hungary, and Italy that year Senna finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, and Benetton's Michael Schumacher [96] [97]\n\n\n1993: final wins and last season at McLaren\nFor 1993, attempts were made by McLaren boss Ron Dennis to secure a supply of the dominant Renault V10 engines that Williams had found great success with But McLaren was forced to take a customer supply of Ford V8 engines, which were two specifications behind that of Ford's then factory team, Benetton [105] McLaren hoped to make up for the inferior horsepower with mechanical sophistication, including an effective active suspension system – although the system itself proved difficult at times, especially for new teammate Michael Andretti [106]\n\n\nWilliams (1994)\nFor 1994, Senna was able to finally join the Williams team after Prost retired [124] and was reportedly paid a $20 million salary [125] Senna was assigned car number 2, with teammate Damon Hill running car number 0 due to Prost, who would have been assigned number 1 had he returned, retiring With Senna's arrival, a new sponsor came as well Rothmans International came aboard as the primary backer for Williams, with Senna being one of their first drivers in the familiar white and navy livery [citation needed]\n\n\n1994: final pole positions and last season\nFor 1994, Senna was able to finally join the Williams team after Prost retired [124] and was reportedly paid a $20 million salary [125] Senna was assigned car number 2, with teammate Damon Hill running car number 0 due to Prost, who would have been assigned number 1 had he returned, retiring With Senna's arrival, a new sponsor came as well Rothmans International came aboard as the primary backer for Williams, with Senna being one of their first drivers in the familiar white and navy livery [citation needed]\n\n\nSeason controversies and end\nThe 1994 season was the subject of sweeping rule changes, most notably banning the use of electronic \"driver aids\" such as active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control From the start, suspicion of foul play mainly involving the Benetton team was said to have troubled Senna For example, instead of returning to the pit area after his first lap retirement at the Pacific Grand Prix, Senna opted to stand near the first corner and watch the cars complete the race to see if he could detect whether any now banned traction control system was being used [128] He returned to the Williams pits after the race, suspicious that the Benetton car was illegal [131] In an interview for the 20th anniversary of  Senna's death, his then-teammate Damon Hill revealed that Senna had \"concluded that there was, what he regarded, as unusual noises from the engine\" with \"special tweak\" giving Benetton an advantage [132]\n\n\nCrash and death\nThe 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April and 1 May 1994 Senna, who did not finish the two opening races of the season, declared that this was where his season would start, with 14 races, as opposed to 16, in which to win the title [134] Williams brought modified FW16s to Imola in an attempt to improve the car's handling During the afternoon qualifying session, Senna's compatriot and protégé Rubens Barrichello was involved in a serious accident when his car became airborne at the Variante Bassa chicane and hit the tyre-wall and fence Barrichello suffered a broken nose and arm, and withdrew from the event Barrichello reported that Senna was the first person he saw upon regaining consciousness [135]\n\n\nState funeral\nSenna's death was considered by many of his Brazilian fans to be a national tragedy, and the government of Brazil declared three days of national mourning.\n\n\nImmediate reactions\nFor the next race at Monaco, the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger [151] Throughout the rest of the 1994 season, Senna was commemorated in various ways Damon Hill, along with Michael Schumacher, dedicated their individual success to Senna with Hill's victory in the Spanish Grand Prix and Schumacher's world-championship victory in the Australian Grand Prix [152] [153]\n\n\nItalian prosecution\nItalian law requires that accidents resulting in a fatality must be investigated for any criminal culpability, with the associated scene of the accident secured and the activities that led to the fatality, suspended forthwith Senna's death was thus the subject of criminal proceedings in Italy, which saw key Williams team members investigated and charged with manslaughter The original trial in 1997 concluded with acquittals on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case [161] This prosecution culminated with verdict No 15050 handed down by Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation on 13 April 2007, which stated: \"It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control.\" Head was never arrested because the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced thirteen years after the accident [162]\n\n\nMotorsport career outside Formula One\nSenna  did not participate in many other forms of motorsport once he reached Formula One He took part in the 1984 Nürburgring Race of Champions, an exhibition race where all drivers competed in identical examples of the then-new Mercedes 190E 2.3–16 with minor race modifications The race was held on the then newly-opened Nürburgring Grand Prix track, before the European Grand Prix Notably, this race involved several past and present Formula One drivers, including Stirling Moss and past World Champions Jack Brabham, Denny Hulme, and Alan Jones, driving identical touring cars Alain Prost started from pole position Senna, who was a last-minute inclusion in the Mercedes race taking over from Emerson Fittipaldi, took the lead in the first corner of the first lap, winning the race ahead of Niki Lauda and Carlos Reutemann [164] After the race, Senna was quoted as saying: \"Now I know I can do it.\" [165]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSenna was a devout Catholic, once saying: \"Just because I believe in God, just because I have faith in God, it doesn't mean that I'm immune It doesn't mean that I'm immortal.\" [167] He often read the Bible on long flights from São Paulo to Europe [168] [169] According to his sister, Senna had sought strength from the Bible on the morning of his death: \"On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself.\" [167]\n\n\nReligion and charitable work\nSenna was a devout Catholic, once saying: \"Just because I believe in God, just because I have faith in God, it doesn't mean that I'm immune It doesn't mean that I'm immortal.\" [167] He often read the Bible on long flights from São Paulo to Europe [168] [169] According to his sister, Senna had sought strength from the Bible on the morning of his death: \"On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself.\" [167]\n\n\nFamily and relationships\nSenna married his childhood friend Lilian de Vasconcelos Souza in 1981, but she had difficulty adapting to her husband's racing life in England and they divorced in 1982 Vasconcelos later said: \"I was his second passion His first passion was racing.\" [173] Although Senna did not have much of an income early in his racing career, Senna insisted on supporting his wife with no help from his father out of a sense of pride [174]\n\n\nWealth, properties, and endorsements\n\nAt his death, Senna's estate was estimated at $400 million [170] Senna owned several properties, including an organic farm in Tatuí, Brazil (where he built a go-kart track in 1991), a beach house in Angra dos Reis, Brazil, an apartment in São Paulo, Brazil, an apartment in Monaco, an estate in Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera, and a house in Algarve, Portugal [188] He owned a private jet (British Aerospace 125) and a helicopter, the latter of which he piloted to travel between his various Brazilian residences [189]\n\nHobbies\nSenna

dangers of his profession On the morning of his death, he spoke with current and former rivals and friends, including Niki Lauda and Alain Prost, about reforming the Formula One drivers' union, the Grand Prix Drivers' Association Senna wanted the GPDA to advocate for safety reforms [217]\n\n\nRacing persona\nSenna was often quoted as using driving as a means for self-discovery and racing as a metaphor for life, saying: \"The harder I push, the more I find within myself I am always looking for the next step, a different world to go into, areas where I have not been before It's lonely driving a Grand Prix car, but very absorbing I have experienced new sensations, and I want more That is my excitement, my motivation.\" [219]\n\n\nCultural legacy\nA Brazilian cultural icon, Senna remains a national hero in Brazil [168] In addition, in 2006, the Japanese public ranked Senna 22nd in Nippon TV's survey of Japan's favourite persons in history [226] [227]\n\n\nFormula One memorials to Senna\nVarious tracks feature Senna memorials A statue of Senna stands in a park in Imola, near the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari's Tamburello corner Adelaide, reportedly one of Senna's favourite circuits, [228] installed a plaque bearing Senna's signature and hand prints in 1995 [229] Monaco, where Senna triumphed a record six times, installed a plaque in Senna's honour at the Fairmont/Lowes

drivers Viviane Senna presided at the kickoff The match finished 5–5 and all profits were donated to the IAS In addition, the book Ayrton: O Herói Revelado (Ayrton: The Hero Revealed) was published [251]\n\n\nPosthumous licensing of the Senna brand\nThe Instituto Ayrton Senna (IAS) occasionally licenses Senna's brand for various commercial and charitable enterprises, mostly related to motorsport.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nAs part of Japanese publisher Shueisha's sponsorship of McLaren, Senna collaborated with Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball, on artwork for Weekly Shōnen Jump featuring McLaren-themed illustrations of Dragon Ball characters Senna was also featured in GP Boy, a two-volume manga published in Weekly Shōnen Jump to commemorate Shueisha's sponsorship [276] [277]\n\n\nHelmet design\nIn his karting days, Senna's helmet consisted of a plain white background with notable features absent He experimented with several designs to satisfy him, such as a white, yellow, and green helmet, [283] before settling on a design by Sid Mosca that included a yellow background with a green stripe surrounding the upper visor and a light metallic blue stripe surrounding the lower visor (both stripes are delineated in the other stripe's color) that was first seen in 1979 Mosca also painted helmets for Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet.\n\n\nThird-party adaptations\nSenna's nephew Bruno wore a modified version of his helmet design (a yellow helmet with a green and blue stripe) during his Formula One career The stripes were shaped after an S rather than being straight, there was a green stripe under the chin, and there was a blue rounded rectangle near the top Bruno sported a modified helmet design for the final three races of the 2011 season to honour the 20th anniversary of Senna's last world championship [286]\n\n\nKarting record\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nKarting career

a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ayrton_Senna\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and career\nSenna was born at 2:35 BRT (5:35 GMT) on Monday, 21 March 1960, in the Pro-Matre Maternity Hospital of Santana, a neighbourhood of São Paulo [7] The middle child of a wealthy Brazilian family, he was born to landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva and his wife Neide Joanna Senna da Silva; he had an older sister, Viviane, and a younger brother, Leonardo [8] [9] He was left-handed [10] [11] [better source needed] Senna's mother was the granddaughter of Italian immigrants, while his father was born to a Spanish mother (from Tíjola, Province of Almería) and a Brazilian father from São Paulo [12]\n\n\nFormula One career\nIn 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg [29] Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season [29]\n\n\nToleman (1984)\nIn 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg [29] Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season [29]\n\n\n1983–1984: testing and debut season\nIn 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on During his

Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season [29]\n\n\nLotus (1985–1987)\nSenna was partnered in his first year at Lotus-Renault by Italian driver Elio de Angelis He had dominated testing times at Rio, although he retired with electrical issues during the race weekend Although the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was quick and nimble, particularly on tight and bumpy circuits and perhaps had the best suspension of any car that year, the car was unreliable and Senna made a few mistakes out of inexperience At the second round of the season, the Portuguese Grand Prix, Senna took the first pole position of his Formula 1 career He converted it into his first victory in the race, which was held in very wet conditions, winning by over a minute from the Ferrari of Michele Alboreto, [43] and lapping everyone up to and including third placed Patrick Tambay The race was the first Grand Slam of Senna's career, as he also set the fastest lap of the race He later argued it was the best drive of his career, [44] an opinion shared by race engineer Steve Hallam, who recognised Senna's \"truly special\" talent [45]\n\n\n1985: first pole positions and wins\nSenna was partnered in his first year at Lotus-Renault by Italian driver Elio de Angelis He had dominated testing times at Rio, although he retired with electrical issues during the race weekend Although the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was quick and nimble, particularly on tight and bumpy circuits and perhaps had the best suspension of any car that year, the car was unreliable and Senna made a few mistakes

\"truly special\" talent [45]\n\n\n1986: eight pole positions and eight podiums\nDe Angelis was replaced at Lotus by Scotland's Johnny Dumfries after Senna vetoed Derek Warwick from joining the team, saying that Lotus could not run competitive cars for two top drivers at the same time Senna allegedly pushed for his former flatmate and fellow Brazilian Maurício Gugelmin to join the team as a pure number two driver, but the team's major sponsor John Player & Sons (JPS) insisted on a British driver, which led to the signing of Dumfries Senna later admitted \"It was bad, bad Until then I had a good relationship with Derek.\" [50] Senna started the season well, coming second in Brazil behind the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet, and winning the Spanish Grand Prix by just 0.014s from Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races [51] Although the 98T was like the 97T which came before it, a quick car with superiority on tight, bumpy circuits but plagued with poor reliability, particularly in the second half of the season it saw him drift behind the Williams pairing of Mansell and Piquet, as well as defending and eventual champion Alain Prost Nonetheless, Senna was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the Detroit Grand Prix, thus finishing the season fourth in the driver's standings again, with a total of 55 points The 1986 Formula One cars were the most powerful cars in history, with Senna's 98T producing over 1,300 bhp (969 kW; 1,318 PS) in qualifying and 850 bhp (634 kW; 862 PS) in the race [52]\n\n\n1987: last season at Lotus\nTeam Lotus had a new engine deal in 1987, running the same turbocharged Honda V6 engines as Williams had used to win the previous year's Constructors' Championship, and with them came a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, Satoru Nakajima, who was a test driver employed directly by Honda The team guaranteed Senna contractually preferential treatment over Nakajima in the allocation of equipment [55] Senna started the season with mixed fortunes: a podium at the San Marino Grand Prix was tempered by controversy at the following race at Spa-Francorchamps, where he collided with Mansell, and afterward in the pits an irate Mansell grabbed Senna by the throat and had to be restrained by Lotus mechanics [56] [57] Senna then won two races in a row, which helped him take the lead in the World Championship: the ensuing Monaco Grand Prix (the first of his record six victories at the Principality) and the Detroit Grand Prix, his second victory in two years at the angular Michigan street circuit, [58] and the first ever for an active suspension Formula One car [59]\n\n\nMcLaren (1988–1993)\nIn 1988, due to the relationship he had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, Senna joined the McLaren team [63] The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years [64] The experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main opposition from Ferrari, Williams, Benetton, and Lotus.\n\n\n1988: first world championship\nIn 1988, due to the relationship he had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, Senna joined the McLaren team [63] The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years [64] The experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main opposition from Ferrari, Williams, Benetton, and Lotus.\n\n\n1989: runner-up to Alain Prost\nIn 1989, the rivalry between Senna and Prost intensified into numerous battles on the track and a psychological war off it [67] [page needed] Some controversy also arose after the French GP press conference when Ron Dennis declared that they found consistent differences between the Honda engines from Prost and Senna, to the detriment of Prost [68] Tension and mistrust between the two drivers increased when Senna overtook Prost at the restart of the San Marino Grand Prix, a move which Prost claimed violated a pre-race agreement (Senna denied the existence of any agreement, although Prost's story was backed up by John Hogan of the team's major sponsor, Marlboro) A discussion between the two drivers and Dennis during a test session at the Pembrey circuit in Wales served to effectively confirm Senna and Prost's personal animosity to Dennis and the team.\n\n\n1990: second world championship\nIn 1990, Senna took a commanding lead in the championship with six wins, two second-places, and three thirds With Prost gone to Ferrari, he also had a new teammate in Austrian driver and friend Gerhard Berger Among his victories were the opening round on the wide streets of Phoenix, in which he diced for the lead for several laps with Jean Alesi's Tyrrell before coming out on top, and in Germany, where he fought Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini throughout the race for the win Senna won six races, including another Monaco win.\n\n\n1991: youngest back-to-back and three-time world champion\nIn 1991, Senna became the youngest ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, the likes of which littered the team's history, was no longer a serious competitor.\n\n\n1992: unsuccessful challenge to the Williams FW14B\nIn 1992, Senna's determination to win manifested itself in dismay at McLaren's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering FW14B car [94] The FW14B, thanks in part to its aerodynamic-enhancing active suspension and powerful Renault V10 engine was much faster and efficient than any other car that season McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings A delay occurred in getting the new MP4/7A model running (it was McLaren's first car with a semi-automatic gearbox and it debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) and in addition to lacking active suspension, the new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while its Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit [95] Even so, Senna scored wins in Monaco, Hungary, and Italy that year Senna finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, and Benetton's Michael Schumacher [96] [97]\n\n\n1993: final wins and last season at McLaren\nFor 1993, attempts were made by McLaren boss Ron Dennis to secure a supply of the dominant Renault V10 engines that Williams had found great success with But McLaren was forced to take a customer supply of Ford V8 engines, which were two specifications behind that of Ford's then factory team, Benetton [105] McLaren hoped to make up for the inferior horsepower with mechanical sophistication, including an effective active suspension system – although the system itself proved difficult at times, especially for new teammate Michael Andretti [106]\n\n\nWilliams (1994)\nFor 1994, Senna was able to finally join the Williams team after Prost retired [124] and was reportedly paid a $20 million salary [125] Senna was assigned car number 2, with teammate Damon Hill running car number 0 due to Prost, who would have been assigned number 1 had he returned, retiring With Senna's arrival, a new sponsor came as well Rothmans International came aboard as the primary backer for Williams, with Senna being one of their first drivers in the familiar white and navy livery [citation needed]\n\n\n1994: final pole positions and last season\nFor 1994, Senna was able to finally join the Williams team after Prost retired [124] and was reportedly paid a $20 million salary [125] Senna was assigned car number 2, with teammate Damon Hill running car number 0 due to Prost, who would have been assigned number 1 had he returned, retiring With Senna's arrival, a new sponsor came as well Rothmans International came aboard as the primary backer for Williams, with Senna being one of their first drivers in the familiar white and navy livery [citation needed]\n\n\nSeason controversies and end\nThe 1994 season was the subject of sweeping rule changes, most notably banning the use of electronic \"driver aids\" such as active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control From the start, suspicion of foul play mainly involving the Benetton team was said to have troubled Senna For example, instead of returning to the pit area after his first lap retirement at the Pacific Grand Prix, Senna opted to stand near the first corner and watch the cars complete the race to see if he could detect whether any now banned traction control system was being used [128] He returned to the Williams pits after the race, suspicious that the Benetton car was illegal [131] In an interview for the 20th anniversary of  Senna's death, his then-teammate Damon Hill revealed that Senna had \"concluded that there was, what he regarded, as unusual noises from the engine\" with \"special tweak\" giving Benetton an advantage [132]\n\n\nCrash and death\nThe 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April and 1 May 1994 Senna, who did not finish the two opening races of the season, declared that this was where his season would start, with 14 races, as opposed to 16, in which to win the title [134] Williams brought modified FW16s to Imola in an attempt to improve the car's handling During the afternoon qualifying session, Senna's compatriot and protégé Rubens Barrichello was involved in a serious accident when his car became airborne at the Variante Bassa chicane and hit the tyre-wall and fence Barrichello suffered a broken nose and arm, and withdrew from the event Barrichello reported that Senna was the first person he saw upon regaining consciousness [135]\n\n\nState funeral\nSenna's death was considered by many of his Brazilian fans to be a national tragedy, and the government of Brazil declared three days of national mourning.\n\n\nImmediate reactions\nFor the next race at Monaco, the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger [151] Throughout the rest of the 1994 season, Senna was commemorated in various ways Damon Hill, along with Michael Schumacher, dedicated their individual success to Senna with Hill's victory in the Spanish Grand Prix and Schumacher's world-championship victory in the Australian Grand Prix [152] [153]\n\n\nItalian prosecution\nItalian law requires that accidents resulting in a fatality must be investigated for any criminal culpability, with the associated scene of the accident secured and the activities that led to the fatality, suspended forthwith Senna's death was thus the subject of criminal proceedings in Italy, which saw key Williams team members investigated and charged with manslaughter The original trial in 1997 concluded with acquittals on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case [161] This prosecution culminated with verdict No 15050 handed down by Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation on 13 April 2007, which stated: \"It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control.\" Head was never arrested because the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced thirteen years after the accident [162]\n\n\nMotorsport career outside Formula One\nSenna  did not participate in many other forms of motorsport once he reached Formula One He took part in the 1984 Nürburgring Race of Champions, an exhibition race where all drivers competed in identical examples of the then-new Mercedes 190E 2.3–16 with minor race modifications The race was held on the then newly-opened Nürburgring Grand Prix track, before the European Grand Prix Notably, this race involved several past and present Formula One drivers, including Stirling Moss and past World Champions Jack Brabham, Denny Hulme, and Alan Jones, driving identical touring cars Alain Prost started from pole position Senna, who was a last-minute inclusion in the Mercedes race taking over from Emerson Fittipaldi, took the lead in the first corner of the first lap, winning the race ahead of Niki Lauda and Carlos Reutemann [164] After the race, Senna was quoted as saying: \"Now I know I can do it.\" [165]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSenna was a devout Catholic, once saying: \"Just because I believe in God, just because I have faith in God, it doesn't mean that I'm immune It doesn't mean that I'm immortal.\" [167] He often read the Bible on long flights from São Paulo to Europe [168] [169] According to his sister, Senna had sought strength from the Bible on the morning of his death: \"On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself.\" [167]\n\n\nReligion and charitable work\nSenna was a devout Catholic, once saying: \"Just because I believe in God, just because I have faith in God, it doesn't mean that I'm immune It doesn't mean that I'm immortal.\" [167] He often read the Bible on long flights from São Paulo to Europe [168] [169] According to his sister, Senna had sought strength from the Bible on the morning of his death: \"On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself.\" [167]\n\n\nFamily and relationships\nSenna married his childhood friend Lilian de Vasconcelos Souza in 1981, but she had difficulty adapting to her husband's racing life in England and they divorced in 1982 Vasconcelos later said: \"I was his second passion His first passion was racing.\" [173] Although Senna did not have much of an income early in his racing career, Senna insisted on

Arnautović ended his first season in England with five goals in 35 appearances, and the team finished in ninth position in the Premier League.\n\n### West Ham United\n\nOn 22 July 2017, Arnautović signed for fellow Premier League team West Ham United on a five-year contract for a club record £20 million fee, which could rise to £25 million with add-ons.\n\n### Shanghai Port\n\nOn 7 July 2019, Arnautović signed for Shanghai SIPG (later rebranded as Shanghai Port) for a fee of £22.4 million. He scored on his debut two weeks later, a 2–2 draw at Chongqing Dangdai Lifan in the Chinese Super League.\n\n### Bologna\n\nOn 1 August 2021, Arnautović signed a two-year deal with Serie A side Bologna. On 15 August, Arnautović made his debut for Bologna, in a 5–4 defeat against Ternana in the first round of the Coppa Italia, scoring a goal in the 56th minute.\n\n### Second loan to Inter Milan\n\nOn 16 August 2023, Arnautović for the second time in his career joined Inter Milan on loan, returning to the club after 13 years. He chose 8 as his shirt number, alluding to Zlatan Ibrahimović, who wore this number from 2006 to 2009 while playing for the club. On 29 November, he netted his first Champions League goal with Inter in a 3–3 away draw with Benfica, which was the longest time any player had scored since previously scoring in the competition, after 12 years and 357 days from his last goal in 2010. On 20 February 2024, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Atlético Madrid in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16.\n\n## International Career\n\nArnautović played with the Austrian under-19 side in the 2007 UEFA European Under-19 Championship where he was sent-off in their second match and failed to make it out of the group stage. He made four appearances in total at under-19 level. He scored three goals in five matches for the Austria under-21 team. After scoring a free-kick in an under-21 game against Denmark in March 2010, Arnautović earned praise from manager Andreas Herzog who described him as the best Austrian footballer of the last 30 years.\n\n## Style of Play\n\nPossessing a powerful physique and good technique, Arnautović is known for his eye for goal, as well as ability to hold up the ball with his back to goal and bring his teammates into play with his link-up play. Despite his size, he also possesses significant pace and stamina, and is known for his ability to exploit spaces with his runs or run at opponents with the ball. His height helps him to win aerial challenges. A versatile forward, Arnautović has played in several offensive positions: for the majority of his career, he served as a winger; however, during the 2017–18 season, his West Ham manager David Moyes made the decision to transition the Austrian effectively into a striker or a centre-forward, in order to utilise his physical and technical abilities in central areas of the pitch. Despite his playing ability, however, he was also a temperamental player, who was involved in several controversial incidents throughout his career. His skills and playing style have led him to be compared to Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimović in the media.\n\n## Career Statistics\n\nAs of 20 February 2024\n\n### Club\n\n| Club | Season | League |

{"title": "Vivienne_Westwood", "content": "\nLife and career\nWestwood was born in Hollingworth, Cheshire, [11] [12] on 8 April 1941 [13] [14] She grew up in nearby Tintwistle, and was the daughter of Gordon Swire and Dora Swire (née Ball), who had married two years previously, two weeks after the outbreak of the Second World War [15] At the time of Vivienne's birth, her father was employed as a storekeeper in an aircraft factory; he had previously worked as a greengrocer [15]\n\n\nEarly years\nWestwood was born in Hollingworth, Cheshire, [11] [12] on 8 April 1941 [13] [14] She grew up in nearby Tintwistle, and was the daughter of Gordon Swire and Dora Swire (née Ball), who had married two years previously, two weeks after the outbreak of the Second World War [15] At the time of Vivienne's birth, her father was employed as a storekeeper in an aircraft factory; he had previously worked as a greengrocer [15]\n\n\nMalcolm McLaren\nWestwood's marriage to Derek ended after she met Malcolm McLaren Westwood and McLaren moved to Thurleigh Court in Balham, where their son Joseph Corré was born in 1967 [19] Westwood continued to teach until 1971 and also created clothes which McLaren designed McLaren became manager of the punk band the Sex Pistols, and subsequently the two garnered attention as the band wore Westwood's and McLaren's designs [20]\n\n\nPunk era\nWestwood was one of the architects of the punk fashion phenomenon of the 1970s, saying \"I was messianic about punk, seeing if one could put a spoke in the system in some way\" [18] Westwood's emergence as a designer who made garments that reflected the economic, social, and political contexts of 1970s Britain coincided with a disillusioned youth, who developed a unique style of dress and musical expression which was instantly identifiable through its aesthetic and sound [21]\n\n\nFashion collections\nWestwood's designs were independent and represented a statement of her own values She collaborated on occasion with Gary Ness, who assisted Westwood with inspirations and titles for her collections [32]\n\n\nVivienne Westwood companies\nIn March 2012, Vivienne Westwood Group reached agreement to end a long-standing UK franchise relationship with Manchester-based Hervia, which operated seven stores for the fashion chain The deal brought to a conclusion a legal dispute, which included Hervia issuing High Court proceedings for alleged breach of contract, after Westwood sought to end the franchise deal before the agreed term [44] The subsequent transition of some of the Hervia stores to Westwood, along with cost-savings, was credited for a jump in Vivienne Westwood Ltd's pre-tax profits by nearly a factor of 10, to £5 million from £527,683 the previous year [45]\n\n\nTax fine and perception\nIn August 2011, Westwood's company Vivienne Westwood Ltd agreed to pay £350,000 in tax plus interest of £144,112, due in 2009, to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for underestimating the value of her brand Her UK business had sold the rights to her trademarks to Luxembourg-based Latimo, which she controlled, for £840,000 in 2002 After examining the deal, HMRC argued that the brand had been undervalued The £2 million valuation triggered additional taxes [50]\n\n\nCriticism by Eluxe Magazine over sustainability of Westwood clothing\nIn 2013, sustainable luxury fashion publication Eluxe Magazine accused Westwood of using the green movement as a marketing tool because some of Westwood's fashion and accessories lines are made in the People's Republic of China These were found to include PVC, polyester, rayon and viscose, all derived from harmful chemicals [55] Eluxe wrote that, despite Westwood's statements that consumers should 'buy less', her company produces nine collections a year compared to the average designer's two Eluxe accused Westwood of using unpaid interns in her fashion house and making them work over 40 hours per week and wrote that some interns complained about their treatment by the fashion house [56]\n\n\nNotable clients and commissions\nIn 1993, Westwood designed many of the colorful suits and outfits Duran Duran wore during their tour for The Wedding Album, as well as those that appeared in the three videos for that album: \"Ordinary World\", \"Come Undone\" and \"Too Much Information\".\n\n\nSex and the City\nWestwood's designs were featured in the 2008 film adaptation of the television series Sex and the City In the film, Carrie Bradshaw becomes engaged to long-term lover Mr Big Being a writer at Vogue, she is invited by her editor to model wedding dresses, including a design made by Westwood The dress is subsequently sent to Carrie as a gift, with a handwritten note from Westwood herself, and Carrie decides to use the Westwood gown The wedding dress has also been described as one of the movie's most iconic features, leading Westwood to approach the producers about being involved in making a sequel [64] A version of the dress was subsequently made available for purchase on Net-a-porter, and sold out in a matter of hours It was available as a knee-length version [65]\n\n\nPolitical involvement\nIn April 1989, Westwood appeared on the cover of Tatler dressed as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher The suit that Westwood wore had been ordered for Thatcher but not yet delivered [66] The cover, which bore the caption \"This woman was once a punk\", was included in The Guardian list of the best ever UK magazine covers [67]\n\n\nActive Resistance manifesto\nIn a 2007 interview, Westwood spoke out against what she perceived as the \"drug of consumerism\" [83] She said: \"I don't feel comfortable defending my clothes But if you've got the money to afford them, then buy something from me Just don't buy too much\" in response to claims that anti-consumerism and fashion contradict each other [84]\n\n\nJulian Assange and WikiLeaks\nWestwood was a longtime supporter of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, and called for his release from custody [90] In June 2013, Westwood dedicated one of her collections to Chelsea Manning and at her fashion show she and all her models wore large image badges of Manning with the word \"Truth\" under her picture In 2012, she used her appearances at London Fashion Week to push for Assange's release by presenting \"I am Julian Assange\" t-shirts [91] She visited him several times during his political asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and in Belmarsh Prison after his arrest in April 2019 [92] In July 2020, she protested outside London's Old Bailey court against Assange's possible extradition to the United States by wearing a yellow pantsuit and suspending herself in a giant birdcage Describing herself

businesswoman. Born on April 8, 1941, in Hollingworth, Cheshire, England, Westwood rose to prominence in the 1970s as a key figure in the punk fashion movement. Her designs have been characterized by their bold, avant-garde style and their ability to challenge societal norms and conventions.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nWestwood was born to Gordon Swire and Dora Swire (née Ball) in Hollingworth, Cheshire, England. Her father was a storekeeper in an aircraft factory, and her mother was a homemaker. Westwood grew up in nearby Tintwistle, a small village in the Peak District National Park. She has two siblings, a brother and a sister.\n\nWestwood's early life was marked by a strong sense of individuality and nonconformity. She has said in interviews that she was always drawn to the avant-garde and the unconventional, and that she saw fashion as a means of expressing herself and challenging societal norms.\n\n**Marriage and Family**\n\nWestwood's first marriage was to Derek Westwood, with whom she had a son, Ben Westwood, in 1963. The couple divorced, and Westwood then married Malcolm McLaren, a Welsh musician and art dealer, in 1971. McLaren was a key figure in the punk movement, and he introduced Westwood to the world of fashion and art. The couple had a son, Joseph Corré, in 1967, who went on to become a successful fashion designer and entrepreneur.\n\n**Punk Era**\n\nWestwood's emergence as a fashion designer coincided with the rise of the punk movement in the late 1970s. She was one of the key figures in the punk fashion scene, along with designers such as McLaren and Steve Jones. Westwood's designs were characterized by their bold, avant-garde style and their ability to challenge societal norms and conventions.\n\nWestwood's punk aesthetic was influenced by her fascination with history, particularly the 18th and 19th centuries. She was drawn to the ornate and elaborate styles of these periods, but she also sought to subvert and challenge them. Her designs often featured historical references and puns, which added to their sense of irony and subversion.\n\n**Fashion Collections**\n\nWestwood's fashion collections are known for their innovative and provocative style. Her designs often feature bold, avant-garde silhouettes and bold, bright colors. She has been praised for her ability to challenge societal norms and conventions, and for her willingness to push the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in fashion.\n\nWestwood's collections often feature historical references and puns, which add to their sense of irony and subversion. Her designs often incorporate elements of art and architecture, which adds to their sense of sophistication and elegance.\n\n**Vivienne Westwood Companies**\n\nIn 2012, Westwood's company, Vivienne Westwood Group, reached an agreement to end its long-standing franchise relationship with Manchester-based Hervia. The deal brought to a conclusion a legal dispute between the two companies, and it allowed Westwood to regain control of her brand.\n\nThe subsequent transition of some of the Hervia stores to Westwood was credited for a jump in Vivienne Westwood Ltd's pre-tax profits by nearly a factor of 10, to £5 million from £527,683 the previous year.\n\n**Tax Fine and Perception**\n\nIn August 2011, Westwood's company, Vivienne Westwood Ltd, agreed to pay £350,000 in tax plus interest of £144,112, due in 2009, to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for underestimating the value of her brand. Her UK business had sold the rights to her trademarks to Luxembourg-based Latimo, which she controlled, for £840,000 in 2002. After examining the deal, HMRC argued that the brand had been undervalued.\n\n**Criticism by Eluxe Magazine**\n\nIn 2013, sustainable luxury fashion publication Eluxe Magazine accused Westwood of using the green movement as a marketing tool because some of Westwood's fashion and accessories lines are made in the People's Republic of China. These were found to include PVC, polyester, rayon, and viscose, all derived from harmful chemicals.\n\nEluxe wrote that, despite Westwood's statements that consumers should 'buy less,' her company produces nine collections a year compared to the average designer's two. Eluxe accused Westwood of using unpaid interns in her fashion house and making them work over 40 hours per week. Some interns complained about their treatment by the fashion house.\n\n**Notable Clients and Commissions**\n\nIn 1993, Westwood designed many of the colorful suits and outfits worn by Duran Duran during their tour for The Wedding Album, as well as those that appeared in the three videos for that album: \"Ordinary World,\" \"Come Undone,\" and \"Too Much Information.\"\n\n**Sex and the City**\n\nWestwood's designs were featured in the 2008 film adaptation of the television series Sex and the City. In the film, Carrie Bradshaw becomes engaged to long-term lover Mr. Big. As a writer at Vogue, she is invited by her editor to model wedding dresses, including a design made by Westwood. The dress is subsequently sent to Carrie as a gift, with a handwritten note from Westwood herself, and Carrie decides to use the Westwood gown.\n\n**Political Involvement**\n\nIn April 1989, Westwood appeared on the cover of Tatler dressed as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The suit that Westwood wore had been ordered for Thatcher but not yet delivered. The cover, which bore the caption \"This woman was once a punk,\" was included in The Guardian list of the best ever UK magazine covers.\n\n**Active Resistance Manifesto**\n\nIn a 2007 interview, Westwood spoke out against what she perceived as the \"drug of consumerism.\" She said: \"I don't feel comfortable defending my clothes. But if you've got the money to afford them, then buy something from me. Just don't buy too much\" in response to claims that anti-consumerism and fashion contradict each other.\n\n**Julian Assange and WikiLeaks**\n\nWestwood was a longtime supporter of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, and called for his release from custody. In June 2013, Westwood dedicated one of her collections to Chelsea Manning and at her fashion show, she and all her models wore large image badges of Manning with the word \"Truth\" under her picture.\n\n**Books**\n\nWestwood was also a noted author or co-author of books, such as Fashion in Art: The Second Empire and Impressionism, in which she explored the worlds of fashion and the arts and the links between them.\n\n**Recognition**\n\nIn the 1992 Birthday Honours, Westwood was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to fashion design.

in some way\" [18] Westwood's emergence as a designer who made garments that reflected the economic, social, and political contexts of 1970s Britain coincided with a disillusioned youth, who developed

{"title": "Jews", "content": "\nName and etymology\nThe term \"Jew\" is derived from the Hebrew word יְהוּדִי Yehudi, with the plural יְהוּדִים Yehudim [52] Endonyms in other Jewish languages include the Ladino ג׳ודיו Djudio (plural ג׳ודיוס, Djudios) and the Yiddish ייִד Yid (plural ייִדן Yidn) Originally, in ancient times, Yehudi (Jew) [53] was used to describe the inhabitants of the Israelite kingdom of Judah [54] It is also used to distinguish their descendants from the gentiles and the Samaritans [55] According to the Hebrew Bible, these inhabitants predominately descend from the tribe of Judah from Judah, the fourth son of Jacob [56] Together the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin made up the Kingdom of Judah [53]\n\n\nIdentity\nJudaism shares some of the characteristics of a nation, [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] an ethnicity, [14] a religion, and a culture, [76] [77] [78] making the definition of who is a Jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used [79] [better source needed] Generally, in modern secular usage, Jews include three groups: people who were born to a Jewish family regardless of whether or not they follow the religion, those who have some Jewish ancestral background or lineage (sometimes including those who do not have strictly matrilineal descent), and people without any Jewish ancestral background or lineage who have formally converted to Judaism and therefore are followers of the religion [80]\n\n\nOrigins\nThe prehistory and ethnogenesis of the Jews are closely intertwined with archaeology, biology, historical textual records, mythology, and religious literature The ethnic stock to which Jews originally trace their ancestry was a confederation of Iron Age Semitic-speaking tribes known as the Israelites that inhabited a part of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods [93] Modern Jews are named after and also descended from the southern Israelite Kingdom of Judah [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99]\nGary A Rendsburg links the early Canaanite nomadic pastoralists confederation to the Shasu known to the Egyptians around the 15th century BCE [100]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest recorded evidence of a people by the name of Israel appears in the Merneptah Stele, which dates to around 1200 BCE The majority of scholars agree that this text refers to the Israelites, a group that inhabited the central highlands of Canaan, where archaeological evidence shows that hundreds of small settlements were constructed between the 12th and 10th centuries BCE [130] [131] The Israelites differentiated themselves from neighboring peoples through various distinct characteristics including religious practices, prohibition on intermarriage, and an emphasis on genealogy and family history [132] [133] [133]\n\n\nIsrael and Judah\nThe earliest recorded evidence of a people by the name of Israel appears in the Merneptah Stele, which dates to around 1200 BCE The majority of scholars agree that this text refers to the Israelites, a group that inhabited the central highlands of Canaan, where archaeological evidence shows that hundreds of small settlements were constructed between the 12th and 10th centuries BCE [130] [131] The Israelites differentiated themselves from neighboring peoples through various distinct characteristics including religious practices, prohibition on intermarriage, and an emphasis on genealogy and family history [132] [133] [133]\n\n\nSecond Temple period\nAccording to the Book of Ezra, the Persian Cyrus the Great ended the Babylonian exile in 538 BCE, [141] the year after he captured Babylon [142] The exile ended with the return under Zerubbabel the Prince (so called because he was a descendant of the royal line of David) and Joshua the Priest (a descendant of the line of the former High Priests of the Temple) and their construction of the Second Temple circa 521–516 BCE [141] As part of the Persian Empire, the former Kingdom of Judah became the province of Judah (Yehud Medinata), [143] with a smaller territory [144] and a reduced population [113]\n\n\nBabylon and Rome\nThe Jewish diaspora existed well before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and had been ongoing for centuries, with the dispersal driven by both forced expulsions and voluntary migrations [161] [153] In Mesopotamia, a testimony to the beginnings of the Jewish community can be found in Joachin's ration tablets, listing provisions allotted to the exiled Judean king and his family by Nebuchadnezzar II, and further evidence are the Al-Yahudu tablets, dated to the 6th–5th centuries BCE and related to the exiles from Judea arriving after the destruction of the First Temple, [118] though there is ample evidence for the presence of Jews in Babylonia even from 626 BCE [162] In Egypt, the documents from Elephantine reveal the trials of a community founded by a Persian Jewish garrison at two fortresses on the frontier during the 5th–4th centuries BCE, and according to Josephus the Jewish community in Alexandria existed since the founding of the city in the 4th century BCE by Alexander the Great [163] By 200 BCE, there were well established Jewish communities both in Egypt and Mesopotamia (\"Babylonia\" in Jewish sources) and in the two centuries that followed, Jewish populations were also present in Asia Minor, Greece, Macedonia, Cyrene, and, beginning in the middle of the first century BCE, in the city of Rome [164] [153] Later, in the first centuries CE, as a result of the Jewish-Roman Wars, a large number of Jews were taken as captives, sold into slavery, or compelled to flee from the regions affected by the wars, contributing to the formation and expansion of Jewish communities across the Roman Empire as well as in Arabia and Mesopotamia.\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nJewish diaspora communities are generally described to have coalesced into three major ethnic subdivisions according to where their ancestors settled: the Ashkenazim (initially in the Rhineland and France), the Sephardim (initially in the Iberian Peninsula), and the Mizrahim (Middle East and North Africa) [171] Romaniote Jews, Tunisian Jews, Yemenite Jews, Egyptian Jews, Ethiopian Jews, Bukharan Jews, Mountain Jews, and other groups also predated the arrival of the Sephardic diaspora [172]\n\n\nModern period\nIn the 19th century, when Jews in Western Europe were increasingly granted equality before the law, Jews in the Pale of Settlement faced growing persecution, legal restrictions and widespread pogroms Zionism emerged in the late 19th century in Central and Eastern Europe as a national revival movement, aiming to re-establish a Jewish polity in the Land of Israel, an endeavor to restore the Jewish people back to their ancestral homeland in order to stop the exoduses and persecutions that have plagued their history This led to waves of Jewish migration to Ottoman-controlled Palestine Theodor Herzl, who is considered the father of political Zionism, [176] offered his vision of a future Jewish state in his 1896 book Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State); a year later, he presided over the First Zionist Congress [177]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Jewish people and the religion of Judaism are strongly interrelated Converts to Judaism typically have a status within the Jewish ethnos equal to those born into it [180] However, several converts to Judaism, as well as ex-Jews, have claimed that converts are treated as second-class Jews by many born Jews [181] Conversion is not encouraged by mainstream Judaism, and it is considered a difficult task A significant portion of conversions are undertaken by children of mixed marriages, or would-be or current spouses of Jews [182]\n\n\nReligion\nThe Jewish people and the religion of Judaism are strongly interrelated Converts to Judaism typically have a status within the Jewish ethnos equal to those born into it [180] However, several converts to Judaism, as well as ex-Jews, have claimed that converts are treated as second-class Jews by many born Jews [181] Conversion is not encouraged by mainstream Judaism, and it is considered a difficult task A significant portion of conversions are undertaken by children of mixed marriages, or would-be or current spouses of Jews [182]\n\n\nLanguages\nHebrew is the liturgical language of Judaism (termed lashon ha-kodesh, \"the holy tongue\"), the language in which most of the Hebrew scriptures (Tanakh) were composed, and the daily speech of the Jewish people for centuries By the 5th century BCE, Aramaic, a closely related tongue, joined Hebrew as the spoken language in Judea [192] By the 3rd century BCE, some Jews of the diaspora were speaking Greek [193] Others, such as in the Jewish communities of Asoristan, known to Jews as Babylonia, were speaking Hebrew and Aramaic, the languages of the Babylonian Talmud Dialects of these same languages were also used by the Jews of Syria Palaestina at that time [citation needed]\n\n\nLeadership\nThere is no single governing body for the Jewish community, nor a single authority with responsibility for religious doctrine [222] Instead, a variety of secular and religious institutions at the local, national, and international levels lead various parts of the Jewish community on a variety of issues [223] Today, many countries have a Chief Rabbi who serves as a representative of that country's Jewry Although many Hasidic Jews follow a certain hereditary Hasidic dynasty, there is no one commonly accepted leader of all Hasidic Jews Many Jews believe that the Messiah will act a unifying leader for Jews and the entire world [224]\n\n\nTheories on ancient Jewish national identity\nA number of modern scholars of nationalism support the existence of Jewish national identity in antiquity One of them is David Goodblatt, [225] who generally believes in the existence of nationalism before the modern period In his view, the Bible, the parabiblical literature and the Jewish national history provide the base for a Jewish collective identity Although many of the ancient Jews were illiterate (as were their neighbors), their national narrative was reinforced through public readings The Hebrew language also constructed and preserved national identity Although it was not widely spoken after the 5th century BCE, Goodblatt states: [226] [227]\n\n\nDemographics\nWithin the world's Jewish population there are distinct ethnic divisions, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating Israelite population, and subsequent independent evolutions An array of Jewish communities was established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at great distances from one another, resulting in effective and often long-term isolation During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments: political, cultural, natural, and populational Today, manifestations of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture [234]\n\n\nEthnic divisions\nWithin the world's Jewish population there are distinct

established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at great distances from one another, resulting in effective and often long-term isolation During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments: political, cultural, natural, and populational Today, manifestations of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture [234]\n\n\nGenetic studies\nY DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths [238] In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany, and the French Rhine Valley This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East [239] [240]\n\n\nPopulation centers\nAlthough historically, Jews have been found all over the world, in the decades since World War II and the establishment of Israel, they have increasingly concentrated in a small number of countries [255] [256] In 2021, Israel and the United States together accounted for over 85 percent of the global Jewish population, with approximately 45.3% and 39.6% of the world's Jews, respectively [2] More than half (51.2%) of world Jewry resides in just ten metropolitan areas As of 2021, these ten areas were Tel Aviv, New York, Jerusalem, Haifa, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, Paris, Washington, and Chicago The Tel Aviv metro area has the highest percent of Jews among the total population (94.8%), followed by Jerusalem (72.3%), Haifa (73.1%), and Beersheba (60.4%), the balance mostly being Israeli Arabs Outside Israel, the highest percent of Jews in a metropolitan area was in New York (10.8%), followed by Miami (8.7%), Philadelphia (6.8%), San Francisco (5.1%), Washington (4.7%), Los Angeles (4.7%), Toronto (4.5%), and Baltimore (4.1%) [2]\n\n\nIsrael\nIsrael, the Jewish nation-state, is the only country in which Jews make up a majority of the citizens [259] Israel was established as an independent democratic and Jewish state on 14 May 1948 [260] Of the 120 members in its parliament, the Knesset, [261] as of 2016 [update], 14 members of the Knesset are Arab citizens of Israel (not including the Druze), most representing Arab political parties One of Israel's Supreme Court judges is also an Arab citizen of Israel [262]\n\n\nDiaspora (outside Israel)\nThe waves of immigration to the United States and elsewhere at the turn of the 19th century, the founding of Zionism and later events, including pogroms in Imperial Russia (mostly within the Pale of Settlement in present-day Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and eastern Poland), the massacre of European Jewry during the Holocaust, and the founding of the state of Israel, with the subsequent Jewish exodus from Arab lands, all resulted in substantial shifts in the population centers of world Jewry by the end of the 20th century [274]\n\n\nDemographic changes\nSince at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society around them, by either choice or force, ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their Jewish identity [286] Assimilation took place in all areas, and during all time periods, [286] with some Jewish communities, for example the Kaifeng Jews of China, disappearing entirely [287] The advent of the Jewish Enlightenment of the 18th century (see Haskalah) and the subsequent emancipation of the Jewish populations of Europe and America in the 19th century, accelerated the situation, encouraging Jews to increasingly participate in, and become part of, secular society The result has been a growing trend of assimilation, as Jews marry non-Jewish spouses and stop participating in the Jewish community [288]\n\n\nAssimilation\nSince at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society

persecutions throughout Jewish history During Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, the Roman Empire (in its later phases known as the Byzantine Empire) repeatedly repressed the Jewish population, first by ejecting them from their homelands during the pagan Roman era and later by officially establishing them as second-class citizens during the Christian Roman era [293] [294]\n\n\nMigrations\nThroughout Jewish history, Jews have repeatedly been directly or indirectly expelled from both their original homeland, the Land of Israel, and many of the areas in which they have settled This experience as refugees has shaped Jewish identity and religious practice in many ways, and is thus a major element of Jewish history [321] The patriarch Abraham is described as a migrant to the land of Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees [322] after an attempt on his life by King Nimrod [323] His descendants, the Children of Israel, in the Biblical story (whose historicity is uncertain) undertook the Exodus (meaning \"departure\" or \"exit\" in Greek) from ancient Egypt, as recorded in the Book of Exodus [324]\n\n\nGrowth\nIsrael is the only country with a Jewish population that is consistently growing through natural population growth, although the Jewish populations of other countries, in Europe and North America, have recently increased through immigration In the Diaspora, in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady, but Orthodox and Haredi Jewish communities, whose members often shun birth control for religious reasons, have experienced rapid population growth [346]\n\n\nContributions\nJewish individuals have played a significant role in the development and growth of Western culture, [50] [51] advancing many fields of thought, science and technology, [40] both historically and in modern times, [350] including through discrete trends in Jewish philosophy, Jewish ethics [351] and Jewish literature, [40] as well as specific trends in Jewish culture, including in Jewish art, Jewish music, Jewish humor, Jewish theatre, Jewish cuisine and Jewish medicine [44] [45] Jews have established various Jewish political movements, [40] religious movements, and, through the authorship of the Hebrew Bible and parts of the New Testament, [46] [47] provided the foundation for Christianity and Islam [48] [49] More than 20 percent [352] [353] [354] [355] [356] [357] of the awarded Nobel Prize have gone to individuals of Jewish descent

originating from the Israelites and comprising of individuals who adhere to the Jewish faith. The term \"Jew\" is derived from the Hebrew word Yehudi, which refers to the inhabitants of the Israelite kingdom of Judah. The Jewish people have a rich and complex history spanning over 4,000 years, with a strong cultural and spiritual identity that has shaped their experiences and interactions with various civilizations.\n\n**Name and Etymology**\n\nThe term \"Jew\" is derived from the Hebrew word יְהוּדִי Yehudi, with the plural יְהוּדִים Yehudim. Endonyms in other Jewish languages include the Ladino ג׳ודיו Djudio (plural ג׳ודיוס, Djudios) and the Yiddish ייִד Yid (plural ייִדן Yidn). Originally, in ancient times, Yehudi (Jew) was used to describe the inhabitants of the Israelite kingdom of Judah. It is also used to distinguish their descendants from the gentiles and the Samaritans. According to the Hebrew Bible, these inhabitants predominantly descend from the tribe of Judah from Judah, the fourth son of Jacob. Together the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin made up the Kingdom of Judah.\n\n**Identity**\n\nJudaism shares some of the characteristics of a nation, an ethnicity, a religion, and a culture, making the definition of who is a Jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used. Generally, in modern secular usage, Jews include three groups: people who were born to a Jewish family regardless of whether or not they follow the religion, those who have some Jewish ancestral background or lineage (sometimes including those who do not have strictly matrilineal descent), and people without any Jewish ancestral background or lineage who have formally converted to Judaism and therefore are followers of the religion.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe prehistory and ethnogenesis of the Jews are closely intertwined with archaeology, biology, historical textual records, mythology, and religious literature. The ethnic stock to which Jews originally trace their ancestry was a confederation of Iron Age Semitic-speaking tribes known as the Israelites that inhabited a part of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods. Modern Jews are named after and also descended from the southern Israelite Kingdom of Judah.\n\n**History**\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of a people by the name of Israel appears in the Merneptah Stele, which dates to around 1200 BCE. The majority of scholars agree that this text refers to the Israelites, a group that inhabited the central highlands of Canaan, where archaeological evidence shows that hundreds of small settlements were constructed between the 12th and 10th centuries BCE. The Israelites differentiated themselves from neighboring peoples through various distinct characteristics including religious practices, prohibition on intermarriage, and an emphasis on genealogy and family history.\n\n**Israel and Judah**\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of a people by the name of Israel appears in the Merneptah Stele, which dates to around 1200 BCE.

The Israelites differentiated themselves from neighboring peoples through various distinct characteristics including religious practices, prohibition on intermarriage, and an emphasis on genealogy and family history.\n\n**Second Temple period**\n\nAccording to the Book of Ezra, the Persian Cyrus the Great ended the Babylonian exile in 538 BCE, the year after he captured Babylon. The exile ended with the return under Zerubbabel the Prince (so called because he was a descendant of the royal line of David) and Joshua the Priest (a descendant of the line of the former High Priests of the Temple) and their construction of the Second Temple circa 521–516 BCE. As part of the Persian Empire, the former Kingdom of Judah became the province of Judah (Yehud Medinata), with a smaller territory and a reduced population.\n\n**Babylon and Rome**\n\nThe Jewish diaspora existed well before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and had been ongoing for centuries, with the dispersal driven by both forced expulsions and voluntary migrations. In Mesopotamia, a testimony to the beginnings of the Jewish community can be found in Joachin's ration tablets, listing provisions allotted to the exiled Judean king and his family by Nebuchadnezzar II, and further evidence are the Al-Yahudu tablets, dated to the 6th–5th centuries BCE and related to the exiles from Judea arriving after the destruction of the First Temple. In Egypt, the documents from Elephantine reveal the trials of a community founded by a Persian Jewish garrison at two fortresses on the frontier during the 5th–4th centuries BCE, and according to Josephus the Jewish community in Alexandria existed since the founding of the city in the 4th century BCE by Alexander the Great.\n\n**Middle Ages**\n\nJewish diaspora communities are generally described to have coalesced into three major ethnic subdivisions according to where their ancestors settled: the Ashkenazim (initially in the Rhineland and France), the Sephardim (initially in the Iberian Peninsula), and the Mizrahim (Middle East and North Africa). Romaniote Jews, Tunisian Jews, Yemenite Jews, Egyptian Jews, Ethiopian Jews, Bukharan Jews, Mountain Jews, and other groups also predated the arrival of the Sephardic diaspora.\n\n**Modern period**\n\nIn the 19th century, when Jews in Western Europe were increasingly granted equality before the law, Jews in the Pale of Settlement faced growing persecution, legal restrictions, and widespread pogroms. Zionism emerged in the late 19th century in Central and Eastern Europe as a national revival movement, aiming to re-establish a Jewish polity in the Land of Israel, an endeavor to restore the Jewish people back to their ancestral homeland in order to stop the exoduses and persecutions that have plagued their history. This led to waves of Jewish migration to Ottoman-controlled Palestine. Theodor Herzl, who is considered the father of political Zionism, offered his vision of a future Jewish state in his 1896 book Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State); a year later, he presided over the First Zionist Congress.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThe Jewish people and the religion of Judaism are strongly interrelated. Converts to Judaism typically have a status within the Jewish ethnos equal to those born into it. However, several converts to Judaism, as well as ex-Jews, have claimed that converts are treated as second-class Jews by many born Jews. Conversion is not encouraged by mainstream Judaism, and it is considered a difficult task. A significant portion of conversions are undertaken by children of mixed marriages, or would-be or current spouses of Jews.\n\n**Religion**\n\nThe Jewish people and the religion of Judaism are strongly interrelated.

Conversion is not encouraged by mainstream Judaism, and it is considered a difficult task. A significant portion of conversions are undertaken by children of mixed marriages, or would-be or current spouses of Jews.\n\n**Languages**\n\nHebrew is the liturgical language of Judaism (termed lashon ha-kodesh, \"the holy tongue\"), the language in which most of the Hebrew scriptures (Tanakh) were composed, and the daily speech of the Jewish people for centuries. By the 5th century BCE, Aramaic, a closely related tongue, joined Hebrew as the spoken language in Judea. By the 3rd century BCE, some Jews of the diaspora were speaking Greek. Others, such as in the Jewish communities of Asoristan, known to Jews as Babylonia, were speaking Hebrew and Aramaic, the languages of the Babylonian Talmud.\n\n**Leadership**\n\nThere is no single governing body for the Jewish community, nor a single authority with responsibility for religious doctrine. Instead, a variety of secular and religious institutions at the local, national, and international levels lead various parts of the Jewish community on a variety of issues. Today, many countries have a Chief Rabbi who serves as a representative of that country's Jewry. Although many Hasidic Jews follow a certain hereditary Hasidic dynasty, there is no one commonly accepted leader of all Hasidic Jews. Many Jews believe that the Messiah will act a unifying leader for Jews and the entire world.\n\n**Theories on ancient Jewish national identity**\n\nA number of modern scholars of nationalism support the existence of Jewish national identity in antiquity. One of them is David Goodblatt, who generally believes in the existence of nationalism before the modern period. In his view, the Bible, the parabiblical literature, and the Jewish national history provide the base for a Jewish collective identity. Although many of the ancient Jews were illiterate (as were their neighbors), their national narrative was reinforced through public readings. The Hebrew language also constructed and preserved national identity. Although it was not widely spoken after the 5th century BCE, Goodblatt states that the Hebrew language was a key element in the construction and preservation of Jewish national identity.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nWithin the world's Jewish population, there are distinct ethnic divisions, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating Israelite population, and subsequent independent evolutions. An array of Jewish communities was established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at great distances from one another, resulting in effective and often long-term isolation. Today, manifestations of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture.\n\n**Ethnic divisions**\n\nWithin the world's Jewish population, there are distinct ethnic divisions, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating Israelite population, and subsequent independent evolutions.

natural, and populational Today, manifestations of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture [234]\n\n\nEthnic divisions\nWithin the world's Jewish population there are distinct ethnic divisions, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating Israelite population, and subsequent independent evolutions An array of Jewish communities was established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at great distances from one another, resulting in effective and often long-term isolation During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments: political, cultural, natural, and populational Today, manifestations of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture [234]\n\n\nGenetic studies\nY DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths [238] In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany, and the French Rhine Valley This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East [239] [240]\n\n\nPopulation centers\nAlthough historically, Jews have been found all over the world, in the decades since World War II and the establishment of Israel, they have increasingly concentrated in a small number of countries [255] [256] In 2021, Israel and the United States together accounted for over 85 percent of the global Jewish population, with approximately 45.3% and 39.6% of the world's Jews, respectively [2] More than half (51.2%) of world Jewry resides in just ten metropolitan areas As of 2021, these ten areas were Tel Aviv, New York, Jerusalem, Haifa, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, Paris, Washington, and Chicago The Tel Aviv metro area has the highest percent of Jews among the total population (94.8%), followed by Jerusalem (72.3%), Haifa (73.1%), and Beersheba (60.4%), the balance mostly being Israeli Arabs Outside Israel, the highest percent of Jews in a metropolitan area was in New York (10.8%), followed by Miami (8.7%), Philadelphia (6.8%), San Francisco (5.1%), Washington (4.7%), Los Angeles (4.7%), Toronto (4.5%), and Baltimore (4.1%) [2]\n\n\nIsrael\nIsrael, the Jewish nation-state, is the only country in which Jews make up a majority of the citizens [259] Israel was established as an independent democratic and Jewish state on 14 May 1948 [260] Of the 120 members in its parliament, the Knesset, [261] as of 2016 [update], 14 members of the Knesset are Arab citizens of Israel (not including the Druze), most representing Arab political parties One of Israel's Supreme Court judges is also an Arab citizen of Israel [262]\n\n\nDiaspora (outside Israel)\nThe waves of immigration to the United States and elsewhere at the turn of the 19th century, the founding of Zionism and later events, including pogroms in Imperial Russia (mostly within the Pale of Settlement in present-day Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and eastern Poland), the massacre of European Jewry during the Holocaust, and the founding of the state of Israel, with the subsequent Jewish exodus from Arab lands, all resulted in substantial shifts in the population centers of world Jewry by the end of the 20th century [274]\n\n\nDemographic changes\nSince at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society around them, by either choice or force, ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their Jewish identity [286] Assimilation took place in all areas, and during all time periods, [286] with some Jewish communities, for example the Kaifeng Jews of China, disappearing entirely [287] The advent of the Jewish Enlightenment of the 18th century (see Haskalah) and the subsequent emancipation of the Jewish populations of Europe and America in the 19th century, accelerated the situation, encouraging Jews to increasingly participate in, and become part of, secular society The result has been a growing trend of assimilation, as Jews marry non-Jewish spouses and stop participating in the Jewish community [288]\n\n\nAssimilation\nSince at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society

trend of assimilation, as Jews marry non-Jewish spouses and stop participating in the Jewish community [288]\n\n\nWar and persecution\nThe Jewish people and Judaism have experienced various persecutions throughout Jewish history During Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, the Roman Empire (in its later phases known as the Byzantine Empire) repeatedly repressed the Jewish population, first by ejecting them from their homelands during the pagan Roman era and later by officially establishing them as second-class citizens during the Christian Roman era [293] [294]\n\n\nMigrations\nThroughout Jewish history, Jews have repeatedly been directly or indirectly expelled from both their original homeland, the Land of Israel, and many of the areas in which they have settled This experience as refugees has shaped Jewish identity and religious practice in many ways, and is thus a major element of Jewish history [321] The patriarch Abraham is described as a migrant to the land of Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees [322] after an attempt on his life by King Nimrod [323] His descendants, the Children of Israel, in the Biblical story (whose historicity is uncertain) undertook the Exodus (meaning \"departure\" or \"exit\" in Greek) from ancient Egypt, as recorded in the Book of Exodus [324]\n\n\nGrowth\nIsrael is the only country with a Jewish population that is consistently growing through natural population growth, although the Jewish populations of other countries, in Europe and North America, have recently increased through immigration In the Diaspora, in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady, but Orthodox and Haredi Jewish communities, whose members often shun birth control for religious reasons, have experienced rapid population growth [346]\n\n\nContributions\nJewish individuals have played a significant role in the development and growth of Western culture, [50] [51] advancing many fields of thought, science and technology, [40] both historically and in modern times, [350] including through discrete trends in Jewish philosophy, Jewish ethics [351] and Jewish literature, [40] as well as specific trends in Jewish culture, including in Jewish art, Jewish music, Jewish humor, Jewish theatre, Jewish cuisine and Jewish medicine [44] [45] Jews have established various Jewish political movements, [40] religious movements, and, through the authorship of the Hebrew Bible and parts of the New Testament, [46] [47] provided the foundation for Christianity and Islam [48] [49] More than 20 percent [352] [353] [354] [355] [356] [357] of the awarded Nobel Prize have gone to individuals of Jewish descent

the night of the first sighting of the crescent moon The night on which the moon is sighted is celebrated as Chand Raat in countries like Bangladesh If the moon is not observed immediately after the 29th day of the previous lunar month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the holiday is celebrated the following day [14] Eid

It is a joyous occasion celebrated by Muslims around the world, typically lasting for two to three days.\n\n**History**\n\nAccording to Muslim tradition, Muhammad instituted the celebration of Eid al-Fitr. Anas ibn Malik, a companion of Muhammad, narrated that when Muhammad arrived in Medina, he found people celebrating two specific days in which they entertained themselves with recreation. Muhammad then remarked that God had fixed two mandatory days of festivity: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.\n\n**General Rituals**\n\nEid al-Fitr begins at sunset on the night of the first sighting of the crescent moon. The night on which the moon is sighted is celebrated as Chand Raat in countries like Bangladesh. If the moon is not observed immediately after the 29th day of the previous lunar month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the holiday is celebrated the following day. Eid al-Fitr is celebrated for one to three days, depending on the country. It is forbidden to fast on the Day of Eid, and a specific prayer is nominated for this day. As an obligatory act of charity, money is paid to the poor and the needy (zakat al-Fitr) before performing the 'Eid prayer.\n\n**Eid Prayer**\n\nThe Eid prayer is performed by the congregation in an open area such as a field, community center, or mosque. No call to prayer is given for this Eid prayer, and it consists of only two rakaʿāt, with a variable amount of takbirs and other prayer elements depending on the branch of Islam observed. The Eid prayer is followed by the khutbah and then a dua asking for God's forgiveness, mercy, peace, and blessings for all living beings across the world. The sermon also instructs Muslims as to the performance of rituals of Eid, such as the zakāt. The sermon of Eid takes place after the Eid prayer, unlike Friday prayer which comes first before prayer. After the prayers, Muslims visit their relatives, friends, and acquaintances or hold large communal celebrations in homes, community centers, or rented halls.\n\n**Sunni Procedure**\n\nAs ritual dictates, Sunnis praise God in a loud voice while going to the Eid prayer.\n\n**Shia Procedure**\n\nThe prayer starts with the Niyyat followed by five Takbirs. During every Takbir of the first rakat, a special Dua is recited. Then, the Imam recites Sūrat al-Fātiḥah and Surat Al-'A`lá and the congregation performs Ruku and Sujud as in other prayers. In the second Rakat, the same above steps (five Takbeers, Sūrat al-Fātiḥah and Surat Al-'A`lá, Ruku and Sujud) are repeated. After the prayer, Khutbah starts.\n\n**Post-Prayer Celebration**\n\nDuring the Eid celebration, Muslims greet each other by saying 'Eid Mubarak', which is Arabic for \"Blessed Eid\". As it comes after a month of fasting, sweet dishes and foods are often prepared and consumed during the celebration. Muslims typically decorate their homes, and are also encouraged to forgive each other and seek forgiveness. In countries with large Muslim populations, it is normally a public holiday with most schools and businesses closed for the day. Practices differ by country and region.\n\n**Practices and Culture by Country**\n\nIn the Arab states of the Persian Gulf countries, men would typically buy new Kandora (traditional white long robe) or dye their existing Kandoras with walnut oil. Women would wear special clothes for the occasion along with special perfumes and braids. Most majlises would offer fruits, dates, tea or coffee to visitors. Those who live in rural areas tend to celebrate more modestly. Buildings, shops, roads, and houses in UAE cities get decorated in bright festive lights. Many shows such as theatres would also occur.\n\nIn the states of the Arabian Peninsula, Eid is a major celebration for children, and the most common greeting is Akhtar mo Mubarak sha (Eid Mubarak) in the Pashto-speaking community. Afghans start preparing for the Eid al-Fitr festival up to ten days prior by cleaning their homes (called Khana Takani in Dari). Afghans visit their local bazaars to buy new clothes, sweets, and snacks including Jalebi, Shor-Nakhod (made with chickpeas), and Cake wa Kolcha (a simple cake, similar to pound cake).\n\nIn India, Eid is a public holiday.

People are supposed to give obligatory charity on behalf of each of their family members to the needy or poor before Eid day or, at most, before the Eid prayer. At home, family members enjoy a special Eid breakfast with various types of sweets and desserts, including Kheer and the traditional dessert Sheer Khurma.\n\nIn Bangladesh, Eid is celebrated with great pomp and festivities.

sets), then the holiday is celebrated the following day [14] Eid al-Fitr is celebrated for one to three days, depending on the country [15] It is forbidden to fast on the Day of Eid, and a specific

paid to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors, rather than from profit earned. The scheme relies on the constant influx of new investors to provide returns to earlier investors, rather than generating revenue through legitimate investments or business activities.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nIn a Ponzi scheme, a con artist offers investments that promise very high returns with little or no risk to an investor. The returns are said to originate from a business or a secret idea run by the con artist. However, in reality, the business does not exist or the idea does not work in the way it is described, or the extent of returns is made up or exaggerated. The con artist pays the high returns promised to their earlier investors by using the money obtained from later investors. Instead of engaging in a legitimate business activity, the con artist attempts to attract new investors to make the payments that were promised to earlier investors.\n\nThe operator of the scheme also diverts clients' funds for the operator's personal use. This can include using the funds to finance personal expenses, such as buying luxury goods or investing in other businesses. In some cases, the funds may be used to pay off debts or to finance other business ventures.\n\n**Red Flags**\n\nAccording to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), many Ponzi schemes share characteristics that should be \"red flags\" for investors. These include:\n\n* Unrealistic returns: If an investment opportunity promises unusually high returns, especially if it is not a high-risk investment, it may be a Ponzi scheme.\n* Pressure to invest quickly: If an investor is pressured to invest quickly, without being given time to research the opportunity or consider the risks, it may be a Ponzi scheme.\n* Lack of transparency: If an investment opportunity is shrouded in secrecy, and the investor is not given clear information about how the investment will be used or how the returns will be generated, it may be a Ponzi scheme.\n* Unregistered investments: If an investment opportunity is not registered with the relevant regulatory authorities, it may be a Ponzi scheme.\n\n**Methods**\n\nTypically, Ponzi schemes require an initial investment and promise above-average returns. They use vague verbal guises such as \"hedge futures trading,\" \"high-yield investment programs,\" or \"offshore investment\" to describe their income strategy. It is common for the operator to take advantage of a lack of investor knowledge or competence, or sometimes claim to use a proprietary, secret investment strategy to avoid giving information about the scheme.\n\nIn some cases, the operator may use social media or other online platforms to promote the investment opportunity and attract new investors. They may also use email or other forms of electronic communication to solicit investments and provide updates on the investment's performance.\n\n**Unraveling**\n\nTheoretically, it is possible for certain Ponzi schemes to ultimately \"succeed\" financially, at least so long as a Ponzi scheme was not what the promoters were initially intending to operate. For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably \"make good\" its reported numbers, for example, by making a successful high-risk investment. However, this is extremely rare and usually only occurs when the scheme is uncovered and the operator is forced to liquidate the assets to pay off investors.\n\nIn addition, if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional \"risk\" to themselves in attempting to cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading). Especially with investment vehicles like hedge funds that are regulated and monitored less heavily than other investment vehicles such as mutual funds, in the absence of a whistleblower or accompanying illegal acts, any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately collapse.\n\n**Similar Schemes**\n\nA pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return. However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:\n\n* A pyramid scheme is a hierarchical structure, with new investors recruited to join the scheme and older investors moving up the hierarchy, while in a Ponzi scheme, the returns are paid to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.\n* A pyramid scheme typically involves the sale of a product or service, while a Ponzi scheme typically involves the investment of money.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or \"ICOs\", has been one such method, known as \"smart Ponzis\" per the Financial Times. Most schemes have a low recovery rate with investors losing their funds permanently.\n\n**Economic Bubble**\n\nEconomic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant until inevitable collapse. A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example, stock, housing, cryptocurrency, tulip bulbs, or the Mississippi Company) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the \"greater fool\" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme, bubbles are typically characterized by a rapid increase in price, followed by a rapid decrease.\n\n**Exit Scam**\n\nA Ponzi scheme which ultimately terminates with the operator absconding is similar to an exit scam. The main difference is that an exit scam does not involve any sort of investment vehicle with the accompanying promised returns. Instead, exit scammers either accept payment for product which they never ship (usually after gaining a reputation for reliably shipping product) or steal funds held in escrow on behalf of third parties (the latter often involves the operators of illegal darknet markets that facilitate the sale of illicit goods and services).\n\n**Related Concepts**\n\nThe term \"ponzi finance\" generally designates non-sustainable patterns of finance, such as borrowers who can only meet their debt commitment if they continuously obtain new sources of financing, often at an accelerating pace and/or ever-increasing interest rates until the borrower cannot secure more financing at any interest rate and becomes insolvent.

topped figures from the Seoul and Barcelona Olympics (1988 and 1992) IOC President Jacques Rogge characterised Greece's organisation as outstanding and its security precautions as flawless [47] All

Sydney, Australia, in 2000 The preparation for these Games was overshadowed by controversies, including political instability and an economic crisis in the host country, health and safety concerns

held two years earlier, which affected the participation of its athletes in these Games [49]\n\n\nFuture Games\nThe 2028 Summer Olympics will be held in Los Angeles, California, United States, making

Although unfounded reports of potential terrorism drove crowds away from the preliminary competitions at the first weekend of the Olympics (14-15 August 2004), attendance picked up as the Games progressed. A third of the tickets failed to sell, but ticket sales still topped figures from the Seoul and Barcelona Olympics (1988 and 1992). IOC President Jacques Rogge characterized Greece's organization as outstanding and its security precautions as flawless. All 202 NOCs participated at the Athens Games with over 11,000 participants.\n\n**Recent Games**\n\nRio de Janeiro in Brazil hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics, becoming the first South American city to host the Olympics, the second Olympic host city in Latin America, after Mexico City in 1968, as well as the third city in the Southern Hemisphere to host the Olympics after Melbourne, Australia, in 1956 and Sydney, Australia, in 2000. The preparation for these Games was overshadowed by controversies, including political instability and an economic crisis in the host country, health and safety concerns surrounding the Zika virus, and significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay. However, these concerns were superseded by a state-sponsored doping scandal involving Russian athletes at the Winter Olympics held two years earlier, which affected the participation of its athletes in these Games.\n\n**Future Games**\n\nThe 2028 Summer Olympics will be held in Los Angeles, California, United States, making it the third city to host the Games three times (the other times being 1932 and 1984), with the U.S hosting the Summer Olympics for the fifth time.\n\n**Sports**\n\nThere has been a total of 42 sports, spanning 55 disciplines, included in the Olympic program at one point or another in the history of the Games. The schedule has comprised 33 sports for the recent Summer Olympics (2020), with 32 sports planned for the next Summer Olympics (2024).\n\n**Qualification**\n\nQualification rules for each of the Olympic sports are set by the International Sports Federation (IF) that governs that sport's international competition.\n\n**Popularity of Olympic Sports**\n\nThe IOC divides Summer Olympic sports into five categories (A – E) based on popularity, gauged by six criteria: television viewing figures (40%), internet popularity (20%), public surveys (15%), ticket requests (10%), press coverage (10%), and number of national federations (5%). The category of a sport determines the share of Olympic revenue received by that sport's International Federation. Sports that were new to the 2016 Olympics (rugby and golf) have been placed in Category E.\n\n**All-Time Medal Table**\n\nThe table below uses official data provided by the IOC.\n\n| Rank | Nation | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | United States | 1,022 | 794 | 704 | 2,520 |\n| 2 | Soviet Union | 473 | 376 | 355 | 1,204 |\n| 3 | Great Britain | 263 | 295 | 311 | 869 |\n| 4 | France | 223 | 285 | 296 | 804 |\n| 5 | China | 224 | 165 | 166 | 555 |\n\n**Medal Leaders by Year**\n\nThe following table lists the top medal-winning athletes in each Summer Olympics:\n\n| Year | Athlete | Nation | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1896 | Robert Garrett | United States | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| 1900 | Michel Théato | France | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| 1904 | Thomas Burke | United States | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| 1908 | Martin Sheridan | United States | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| 1912 | Alfred Flatow | Germany | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| 1920 | Alf Vagnbak | Denmark | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| 1924 | Oscar Swahn | Sweden | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| 1928 | John K.

the divorce was finalized in 1983 [53]\n\n\nEarly career\nAlbright returned to Washington, D.C., in 1968, and commuted to Columbia for her doctor of philosophy, which she earned in 1975 [47] She began fund-raising for her daughters' school, involvement which led to several positions on education boards [48] She was eventually invited to organize a fund-raising dinner for the 1972 presidential campaign of U.S Senator Ed Muskie of Maine [49] This association with Muskie led to a position as his chief legislative assistant in 1976 [50] However, after the 1976 U.S presidential election of Jimmy Carter, Albright's former professor Brzezinski was named National Security Advisor, and recruited Albright from Muskie in 1978 to work in the West Wing as the National Security Council's congressional liaison [50] Following Carter's loss in 1980 to Ronald Reagan, Albright moved on to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where she was given a grant for a research project [51] She chose to write on the dissident journalists involved in Poland's Solidarity movement, then in its infancy but gaining international attention [51] She traveled to Poland for her research, interviewing dissidents in Gdańsk, Warsaw, and Kraków [52] Upon her return to Washington, her husband announced his intention to divorce her so that he could pursue a relationship with another woman; the divorce was finalized in 1983 [53]\n\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations\nAlbright was appointed ambassador to the United Nations, a Cabinet-level position, shortly after Clinton was inaugurated, presenting her credentials on February 9, 1993 During her tenure at the U.N., she had a rocky relationship with the U.N secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom she criticized as \"disengaged\" and \"neglect [ful]\" of genocide in Rwanda [59] Albright wrote: \"My deepest regret from my years in public service is the failure of the United States and the international community to act sooner to halt these crimes.\" [60]\n\n\nSecretary of State\nWhen Clinton began his second term in January 1997, following his re-election, he required a new Secretary of State, as incumbent Warren Christopher was retiring [69] The top level of the Clinton administration was divided into two camps on selecting the new foreign policy Outgoing Chief of Staff Leon Panetta favored Albright, but a separate faction went for different candidates such as Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Senator George J Mitchell of Maine, and former Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke [70] Albright orchestrated a campaign on her own behalf that proved successful [71] When Albright took office as the 64th U.S Secretary of State on January 23, 1997, she became the first female U.S Secretary of State and the highest-ranking woman in the history of the U.S government at the time of her appointment [72] Not being a natural-born citizen of the U.S., she was not eligible as a U.S presidential successor [73]\n\n\nPost-Clinton administration\nFollowing Albright's term as Secretary of State, Czech president Václav Havel spoke openly about the possibility of Albright succeeding him Albright was reportedly flattered, but denied ever seriously considering the possibility of running for office in her country of origin [89]\n\n\nInvestments\nAlbright was a co-investor with Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, and George Soros in a $350 million investment vehicle called Helios Towers Africa, which intends to buy or build thousands of mobile phone towers in Africa [127] [128]\n\n\nControversies\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, many surveys and studies concluded that excess deaths in Iraq—specifically among children under the age of 5—greatly increased after the implementation of sanctions against Iraq following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 [129] [130] [131] On the other hand, several later surveys conducted in collaboration with the post-Saddam  government during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq (2003–2011) do not document any major increase in child mortality during the sanctions, although they nevertheless found that a \"slight increase\" in child mortality had occurred [132] During the sanctions, high rates of malnutrition, lack of medical supplies, and diseases from lack of clean water were reported; [133] the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that the sanctions \"virtually paralyzed the whole  [Iraqi] economy and generated persistent deprivation, chronic hunger, endemic undernutrition, massive unemployment and widespread human suffering.\" [134]\n\n\nSanctions against Iraq\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, many surveys and studies concluded that excess deaths in Iraq—specifically among children under the age of 5—greatly increased after the implementation of sanctions against Iraq following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 [129] [130] [131] On the other hand, several later surveys conducted in collaboration with the post-Saddam  government during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq (2003–2011) do not document any major increase in child mortality during the sanctions, although they nevertheless found that a \"slight increase\" in child mortality had occurred [132] During the sanctions, high rates of malnutrition, lack of medical supplies, and diseases from lack of clean water were reported;

She was the first female U.S. Secretary of State and the highest-ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government at the time of her appointment.\n\n**Early Life and Career**\n\nMadeleine Albright was born Marie Jana Körbelová in 1937 in the Smíchov district of Prague, Czechoslovakia. Her parents, Josef Korbel and Anna Korbel (née Spieglová), were both diplomats who had fled Czechoslovakia for England in 1939 to avoid anti-Jewish persecution. They later immigrated to the United States, where they settled on Long Island, New York. Albright's family was Jewish, but her parents converted to Catholicism in 1941, and she was raised Catholic.\n\nAlbright's father, Josef Korbel, was a strong supporter of democracy and a vocal critic of communism. He was a close friend of Czech President Tomáš Masaryk and later served as the Czech ambassador to Yugoslavia. Albright's family was well-educated and encouraged her to pursue her interests in politics and international relations.\n\n**Youth and Young Adulthood in the United States**\n\nIn 1948, Albright's family emigrated from the United Kingdom to the United States, where they settled in Great Neck, Long Island. Albright's father applied for political asylum, arguing that as an opponent of communism, he was under threat in Prague. The family initially struggled to adjust to their new life in the United States, but Albright's parents encouraged her to pursue her education and interests.\n\nAlbright attended Wellesley College, where she studied politics and economics. She was an active member of the college's Model United Nations and developed a strong interest in international relations. After graduating from Wellesley in 1958, Albright earned a master's degree in international relations from Columbia University.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 1959, Albright married Joseph Albright, a journalist and writer. The couple had three daughters before divorcing in 1982. Albright's marriage was marked by her conversion to Episcopalianism, which she has described as a spiritual journey.\n\nAlbright's career in the United States began in the 1960s, when she worked as a fund-raiser for her daughters' school. She later served as the chief legislative assistant to Senator Ed Muskie of Maine and then worked in the West Wing as the National Security Council's congressional liaison.\n\nIn the 1980s, Albright worked as a researcher at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, writing about the dissident journalists involved in Poland's Solidarity movement. Her research took her to Poland, where she interviewed dissidents in Gdańsk, Warsaw, and Kraków.\n\n**U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations**\n\nIn 1993, Albright was appointed U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position that made her the highest-ranking woman in the United States government at the time. During her tenure at the U.N., Albright had a rocky relationship with U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom she criticized for his handling of the Rwandan genocide.\n\nAlbright's experience at the U.N. was marked by her efforts to promote human rights and democracy around the world. She was a vocal critic of human rights abuses and worked to promote U.N. reform.\n\n**Secretary of State**\n\nIn 1997, Albright was appointed U.S. Secretary of State, a position that made her the first female U.S. Secretary of State. During her tenure as Secretary of State, Albright played a key role in U.S. foreign policy, promoting democracy and human rights around the world.\n\nAlbright was a strong supporter of NATO expansion and worked to promote stability in the Balkans.

the divorce was finalized in 1983 [53]\n\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations\nAlbright was appointed ambassador to the United Nations, a Cabinet-level position, shortly after Clinton was inaugurated, presenting her credentials on February 9, 1993 During her tenure at the U.N., she had a rocky relationship with the U.N secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom she criticized as \"disengaged\" and \"neglect [ful]\" of genocide in Rwanda [59] Albright wrote: \"My deepest regret from my years in public service is the failure of the United States and the international community to act sooner to halt these crimes.\" [60]\n\n\nSecretary of State\nWhen Clinton began his second term in January 1997, following his re-election, he required a new Secretary of State, as incumbent Warren Christopher was retiring [69] The top level of the Clinton administration was divided into two camps on selecting the new foreign policy Outgoing Chief of Staff Leon Panetta favored Albright, but a separate faction went for different candidates such as Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Senator George J Mitchell of Maine, and former Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke [70] Albright orchestrated a campaign on her own behalf that proved successful [71] When Albright took office as the 64th U.S Secretary of State on January 23, 1997, she became the first female U.S Secretary of State and the highest-ranking woman in the history of the U.S government at the time of her appointment [72] Not being a natural-born citizen of the U.S., she was not eligible as a U.S presidential successor [73]\n\n\nPost-Clinton administration\nFollowing Albright's term as Secretary of State, Czech president Václav Havel spoke openly about the possibility of Albright succeeding him Albright was reportedly flattered, but denied ever seriously considering the possibility of running for office in her country of origin [89]\n\n\nInvestments\nAlbright was a co-investor with Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, and George Soros in a $350 million investment vehicle called Helios Towers Africa, which intends to buy or build thousands of mobile phone towers in Africa [127] [128]\n\n\nControversies\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, many surveys and studies concluded that excess deaths in Iraq—specifically among children under the age of 5—greatly increased after the implementation of sanctions against Iraq following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 [129] [130] [131] On the other hand, several later surveys conducted in collaboration with the post-Saddam  government during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq (2003–2011) do not document any major increase in child mortality during the sanctions, although they nevertheless found that a \"slight increase\" in child mortality had occurred [132] During the sanctions, high rates of malnutrition, lack of medical supplies, and diseases from lack of clean water were reported; [133] the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that the sanctions \"virtually paralyzed the whole  [Iraqi] economy and generated persistent deprivation, chronic hunger, endemic undernutrition, massive unemployment and widespread human suffering.\" [134]\n\n\nSanctions against Iraq\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, many surveys and studies concluded that excess deaths in Iraq—specifically among children under the age of 5—greatly increased after the implementation of sanctions against Iraq following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 [129] [130] [131] On the other hand, several later surveys conducted in collaboration with the post-Saddam  government during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq (2003–2011) do not document any major increase in child mortality during the sanctions, although they nevertheless found that a \"slight increase\" in child mortality had occurred [132] During the sanctions, high rates of malnutrition, lack of medical supplies, and diseases from lack of clean water were reported;

It is organized by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and is considered one of the most prestigious youth football competitions in the world.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea of a UEFA Youth League was first conceived after a match between the under-18 teams of Bayern Munich and Internazionale in May 2010. The match, referred to as the \"UEFA Under-18 Challenge\", was held three days prior to the UEFA Champions League Final between the respective senior sides. Internazionale won the match 2–0 with two goals from Denis Alibec. The match was part of \"UEFA Grassroots Day\" and acted as an inspiration for the UEFA Youth League.\n\nThe first edition of the UEFA Youth League was held in the 2013-14 season, with 32 teams competing in the competition. The competition was initially designed to be a standalone tournament, but it has since been integrated into the UEFA Champions League calendar, with the top four teams in each group qualifying for the knockout stage.\n\n**Finals**\n\nThe finals of the UEFA Youth League are held annually, with the competition culminating in a single-match final between the two remaining teams. The venue for the final is determined by the UEFA administration, with the winner receiving the UEFA Youth League trophy and a cash prize.\n\n**Winners**\n\n**By Club**\n\n| Season | Winner | Runner-up |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2013-14 | Real Madrid | Benfica |\n| 2014-15 | Red Bull Salzburg | Inter Milan |\n| 2015-16 | Benfica | Monaco |\n| 2016-17 | Manchester City | Barcelona |\n| 2017-18 | Chelsea |Ajax |\n| 2018-19 | Benfica | Paris Saint-Germain |\n| 2019-20 | Chelsea | Real Madrid |\n| 2020-21 | Chelsea | Real Madrid |\n| 2021-22 | Benfica | Real Madrid |\n\n**By Country**\n\n| Country | Number of Titles |\n| --- | --- |\n| Spain | 3 |\n| England | 3 |\n| Portugal | 3 |\n| Germany | 0 |\n| Italy | 0 |\n| France | 0 |\n| Netherlands | 0 |\n\n**Requirements and Format**\n\nThe UEFA Youth League is played by the under-19 teams of the top-associated clubs in Europe. The competition is divided into two stages: the group stage and the knockout stage.\n\n* Group stage: The 32 teams are divided into eight groups of four teams each, with each team playing six matches. The top four teams in each group qualify for the knockout stage.\n* Knockout stage: The knockout stage is played in a single-elimination format, with the quarterfinals, semifinals, and final being played over two legs. The winner of each match advances to the next round.\n\n**Notable Teams and Players**\n\nSeveral notable teams and players have participated in the UEFA Youth League over the years. Some of the most successful teams include Real Madrid, Benfica, and Chelsea, who have all won multiple titles in the competition. Some notable players who have participated in the competition include Kylian Mbappé, who played for Monaco in the 2015-16 season, and Erling Haaland, who played for Red Bull Salzburg in the 2016-17 season.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe UEFA Youth League is an annual club football competition for the under-19 teams of the top-associated clubs in Europe. The competition has a rich history, dating back to the inaugural match between Bayern Munich and Internazionale in 2010. The competition has grown in popularity over the years, with several notable teams and players participating in the tournament.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest sprinters in history, having won four Olympic gold medals and eight World Championship titles throughout his career.\n\n## Career\n\nJohnson's athletic career began in the 1990s, when he started competing in track and field events at the collegiate level. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a prominent figure in the sprinting world. In 1991, at the World Championships in Tokyo, Johnson earned his first world title by winning the 200 m race by the unusual margin of victory of 0.33 seconds over Frankie Fredericks.\n\n## 1991–1995\n\nJohnson continued to dominate the sprinting scene in the early 1990s. He won the 200 m gold medal at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain, and repeated his performance at the 1993 World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany. Johnson's impressive performances earned him the nickname \"The Fastest Man in the World,\" and he became a household name in the track and field community.\n\n## 1996 Atlanta Olympics\n\nIn June 1996, Johnson was 28 years old when he ran the 200 m in 19.66 seconds at the U.S Olympic Trials, breaking Pietro Mennea's record of 19.72 seconds that had stood for nearly 17 years. With that performance, he qualified to run at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and prepared to attempt to win both the 200 meters and 400 meters events, a feat never before achieved by a male athlete. Johnson's performances at the Olympics were nothing short of spectacular, as he won gold medals in both the 200 m and 400 m events.\n\n## Rivalry with Donovan Bailey\n\nAfter the end of the 1996 Summer Olympics, American sportscaster Bob Costas claimed that Johnson was faster than 100 m gold medalist Donovan Bailey. Because Johnson's 200 m time (19.32 seconds) divided by 2 (9.66 seconds) was shorter than Bailey's 100 m time (9.84 seconds), this started a debate on whether Johnson or Bailey was the real \"World's Fastest Man.\" This debate ultimately resulted in a 150 m race between the two, in which Bailey won after Johnson, already behind in the race, alleged to have injured his hamstring.\n\n## 1997–1999\n\nAfter recovering from the injury, Johnson was able to compete for his third 400 m world title. The IAAF invented a new policy of giving a \"bye\" to the defending champions essentially to allow Johnson to compete in the IAAF World Championships that year, because Johnson was unable to qualify the conventional method (by competing in the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships) due to his injury from the race with Bailey. More than a month after the U.S Championships, Johnson had recovered from his injury and won the 400 meters at the 1997 World Championships in Athens.\n\n## 2000 Sydney Olympics\n\nAfter qualifying for the 2000 Summer Olympics in the 400 m, Johnson sustained an injury in the 2000 U.S Olympic Trials for the 200 meters while racing in a highly anticipated matchup against the 100 m and 200 m world champion, Maurice Greene. The injury prevented a defense of his 200 m Olympic title. Johnson ended his career at the Sydney Olympics by winning the gold medal in the 400 m, which brought his total number of Olympic gold medals to four. By winning the 400 m at the age of 33 years 12 days, he earned the distinction of being the oldest Olympic gold medalist at any track event shorter than 5000 m. Johnson was also the anchor of the United States 4 × 400 relay team along with Alvin Harrison, Antonio Pettigrew, and Calvin Harrison, which originally won the gold medal, but was later stripped of the title after Pettigrew and Jerome Young (who ran in the heats) were found guilty of having used performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n## Achievements\n\nJohnson has run 200 m in under 19.80 seconds six times, and he has run the distance in less than 20 seconds twenty-three times. He holds nine of the top 50 200 m performances of all time. Johnson has run twenty-two 400 m races in under 44 seconds; he holds twenty-two of the top 50 and four of the top ten 400 m performances of all time. Over the course of his career, he twice set the world record in the 200 m, three times set the world record as part of the 4 × 400 m relay team, twice set the indoor 400 m world record, set the outdoor 400 m world record once, and set the 300 m mark once. In 2002 Johnson was awarded the world record for running 200 m in slippers. The record was set during an episode of mythbusters, Johnson completed the record in a time 21.05 seconds. Johnson commented after the event that 'slippers are on a level playing field with running spikes'\n\n## Season's Bests\n\nJohnson was elected to the United States Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2004, where his 200 m performance at the 1996 Olympics was named the greatest track and field moment of the last 25 years.\n\n## After Athletics\n\nJohnson was elected to the United States Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2004, where his 200 m performance at the 1996 Olympics was named the greatest track and field moment of the last 25 years.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nAs of 2008 Johnson lived in Marin County, California, with his second wife Armine Shamiryan, a chef, and his daughter Selendis Sebastian, born in 2000 during his first marriage to entertainment reporter Kerry D'Oyen.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)\" following this outline:\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1991 at the World Championships in Tokyo, Johnson earned his first world title by winning the 200 m race by the unusual margin of victory of 0.33 seconds over Frankie Fredericks.\n\n\n1991–1995\nIn 1991 at the World Championships in Tokyo, Johnson earned his first world title by winning the 200 m race by the unusual margin of victory of 0.33 seconds over Frankie Fredericks.\n\n\n1996 Atlanta Olympics\nIn June 1996, Johnson was 28 when he ran the 200-m in 19.66 seconds at the U.S Olympic Trials, breaking Pietro Mennea's record of 19.72 seconds that had stood for nearly 17 years With that performance he qualified to run at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and prepared to attempt to win both the 200 meters and 400 meters events, a feat never before achieved by a male athlete [8] (Two women have won Olympic gold medals in both races in the same year: Valerie Brisco-Hooks in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and Marie-José Pérec, in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.)\n\n\nRivalry with Donovan Bailey\nAfter the end of the 1996 Summer Olympics, American Sportscaster Bob Costas claimed that Johnson was faster than 100m Gold medalist Donovan Bailey Because Johnson's 200m time (19.32 Seconds) divided by 2 (9.66 Seconds) was shorter than Bailey's 100m time (9.84) [13] This started a debate on whether Johnson or Bailey was the real \"World's Fastest Man\", which in turn resulted in a 150m race between the two, in which Bailey won after Johnson, already behind in the race, alleged to have injured his hamstring [14]\n\n\n1997–1999\nAfter recovering from the injury, Johnson was able to compete for his third 400 m world title The IAAF invented a new policy of giving a \"bye\" to the defending champions essentially to allow Johnson to compete in the IAAF World Championships that year, because Johnson was unable to qualify the conventional method (by competing in the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships) due to his injury from the race with Bailey Wales, Jimmy (2024)  date=May 2016 ]]More than a month after the U.S Championships, Johnson had recovered from his injury and won the 400 meters at the 1997 World Championships in Athens.\n\n\n2000 Sydney Olympics\nAfter qualifying for the 2000 Summer Olympics in the 400 m, Johnson sustained an injury in the 2000 U.S Olympic Trials for the 200 meters while racing in a highly anticipated matchup against the 100 m and 200 m world champion, Maurice Greene The injury prevented a defense of his 200 m Olympic title Johnson ended his career at the Sydney Olympics by winning the gold medal in the 400 m, which brought his total number of Olympic gold medals to four By winning the 400 m at the age of 33 years 12 days, he earned the distinction of being the oldest Olympic gold medalist at any track event shorter than 5000 m Johnson was also the anchor of the United States 4 × 400 relay team along with Alvin Harrison, Antonio Pettigrew, and Calvin Harrison, which originally won the gold medal, but was later stripped of the title after Pettigrew and Jerome Young (who ran in the heats) were found guilty of having used performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n\nAchievements\nJohnson has run 200 m in under 19.80 seconds six times, and he has run the distance in less than 20 seconds twenty-three times He holds nine of the top 50 200 m performances of all time [21] Johnson has run twenty-two 400 m races in under 44 seconds;

Her interest in fashion came from her mother. Jennie told Elle Indonesia that Chanel was a part of her life from a young age and that she still remembered her first memory involving the fashion house: \"I remember when I was little, I look through my mother's wardrobe, and search for whatever vintage Chanel I could find.\" For her solo debut, she was involved in planning and styling her own wardrobe and put together more than 20 outfits for the music video of \"Solo.\" Jennie recalled in an interview with Billboard that during the music video filming, she considered the way each would fit the song and what she could change, which helped her to learn many new ways of approaching fashion.

Jennie gets more comfortable with each episode, she brings out more fun and enjoys it even more.\" When asked by Elle Korea about being described as \"icon\" and \"unique,\" Jennie responded that \"it's really an honor to be an inspiration and iconic being for someone. When you express me with these words, I feel like [I need] to look nicer and better.\"\n\n## Impact\n\nJennie, instrumental in Blackpink's fashion image, has been nicknamed \"Human Gucci\" and \"Human Chanel.\" Her style portfolio ranges from Gucci and Saint Laurent to niche labels such as Marine Serre and Richard Quinn.

Chanel chose her as House Ambassador after noting her ripple commercial impact. The hairpins Jennie wore in a five-by-five partition during her performances of her debut single \"Solo\" instantly trended in South Korea and were referred to as \"Jennie's hairpins.\"\n\n## Personal life\n\nJennie describes herself as \"quiet\" and \"shy,\" especially around strangers. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar, Jennie remarked, \"My personality may be what people think about my personality.

He is best known for his groundbreaking research on the immune system, particularly in the areas of antibody gene rearrangement, somatic hypermutation, and immune checkpoint therapy.\n\n**Life and Career**\n-------------------\n\nTasuku Honjo was born in Kyoto, Japan in 1942. He completed his M.D. degree in 1966 from the Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University. After completing his medical degree, Honjo went on to pursue his Ph.D. in Medical Chemistry at Kyoto University, where he received his degree in 1975 under the supervision of renowned immunologists Yasutomi Nishizuka and Osamu Hayaishi.\n\n**COVID-19 Pandemic**\n--------------------\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a disputed claim emerged that Honjo believed the novel coronavirus had been \"manufactured\" by a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. This claim was widely disseminated on the internet in many languages, causing a significant stir in the scientific community. However, Honjo later denied this claim, stating that he was \"greatly saddened\" that his name had been used to spread \"false accusations and misinformation.\"\n\n**Contribution**\n----------------\n\nTasuku Honjo has made significant contributions to the field of immunology, particularly in the areas of antibody gene rearrangement and somatic hypermutation. He established the basic conceptual framework of class switch recombination, a process by which the immune system generates diverse antibody molecules. Honjo presented a model explaining antibody gene rearrangement in class switch and, between 1980 and 1982, verified its validity by elucidating its DNA structure.\n\nIn addition to his work on class switch recombination, Honjo also discovered the cytokines IL-4 and IL-5, which are involved in class switching. He also succeeded in cloning the IL-2 receptor alpha chain in 1986 and discovered the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in 2000, which is essential for class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation.\n\n**Recognition**\n----------------\n\nTasuku Honjo has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to immunology. In 2016, he won the Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences for \"Discovery of the Mechanism Responsible for the Functional Diversification of Antibodies, Immunoregulatory Molecules and Clinical Applications of PD-1.\" In 2018, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with American immunologist James P. Allison for their work on immune checkpoint therapy.\n\nIn 2014, Honjo also shared the Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science with James P.

Pandev impressed in his first year at Lazio, as he made 29 appearances, scoring three goals, which included a memorable effort away to Juventus where he beat Fabio Cannavaro, Lilian Thuram, and Gianluca Zambrotta before beating Gianluigi Buffon with an angled shot.\n\nIn July 2005, 50 percent of his player registration rights were transferred to Udinese in exchange for David Pizarro's transfer to the Milanese club.\n\nContract dispute with Lazio\n\nIn the summer of 2009, a dispute between Pandev and Lazio chairman Claudio Lotito erupted, resulting in a legal battle between Pandev and his club. The ruling was announced on December 23, 2009.\n\nInter Milan\n\nOn January 4, 2010, Pandev signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Inter Milan, wearing the number 27 shirt. He made his Inter debut as a starter in the 1–0 away win against Chievo on January 6. His first two games for the Nerazzurri resulted in him contributing to both winners — setting up Mario Balotelli against Chievo and setting up Walter Samuel to score a last-minute winner against Siena. He opened his scoring account in his third appearance for the club, pulling a goal back for Inter in an eventual 2–2 draw at Bari. Pandev was the main protagonist in the 2–0 victory over local rivals Milan as he first assisted Diego Milito with an overhead cross and scored a curling freekick to complete the win. He continued with his solid performances throughout the season, being an important player in Inter's winning of the first treble in the history of Italian football. Inter won their fifth consecutive Serie A title by defeating Siena in the final match, and also defeated Roma at Stadio Olimpico to win the Coppa Italia. On May 22, 2010, Inter won the UEFA Champions League in the final against Bayern Munich, with Pandev playing for 79 minutes and becoming the third Macedonian football player in history to ever win this championship.\n\nNapoli\n\nOn August 26, 2011, Pandev joined Napoli on a season-long loan. On September 10, Pandev came on as a substitute to make his Napoli debut against Cesena in the 66th minute with the score tied at 1–1. Despite Napoli making it 2–1 in their favour right after the Macedonian striker came on, Pandev missed an open goal in the 85th minute, hitting the crossbar from six yards out after a square pass across the face of goal was played to him; Napoli managed to win the match 3–1.\n\nGalatasaray\n\nOn September 1, 2014, Pandev signed a 1+1-year contract with Turkish club Galatasaray, worth €2.4 million a year. Pandev struggled for game time at Galatasaray and he was mainly used as a cup player.\n\nGenoa\n\nPandev signed a two-year contract with Italian club Genoa in 2015 after failing to get playing time at Galatasaray. He planned on retiring at the end of the 2020–21 season, but extended his contract following the postponement of Euro 2020 to 2021.\n\nParma\n\nOn January 31, 2022, Pandev moved to Parma in Serie B on a permanent deal, retiring after the completion of the 2021–22 season.\n\nInternational Career\n\nPandev made his senior debut for Macedonia in a June 2001 FIFA World Cup qualification match away against Turkey. With two goals against Spain on August 12, 2009, he became the national team's all-time leading scorer, surpassing Georgi Hristov.\n\nStyle of Play\n\nFamed as one of the most skilled Macedonian forwards of all time, Pandev was a quick, creative, and hard-working left-footed forward with good technique, who was capable both of creating and scoring goals, due to his opportunism and shooting accuracy, as well as his vision and passing ability. He was capable of playing in several offensive positions, either on the right or through the centre of the pitch, and was usually deployed in a supporting role, as a winger, as a second striker, or as an attacking midfielder, although he had also been fielded as a striker or as a false nine.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nGoran Pandev is married to Nada Pandeva and they have three children, Filippo, Ana, and Sofia. His younger brother Sashko is also a football player. In 2019, Pandev obtained Italian citizenship in Naples. A year later, he auctioned the shirt he wore in the match in which he gained his 100th cap for Macedonia for a hospital fighting the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCareer Statistics\n\nLazio\n\nClub\n\n|

{"title": "Israeli–Palestinian_conflict", "content": "\nHistory\nThe Israeli–Palestinian conflict began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the development of political Zionism and the arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine [29] [38] The modern political Zionist movement, with the goal of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, grew out of the last two decades of the 19th century, largely in response to antisemitism in Europe While Jewish colonization began during this period, it was not until the arrival of more ideologically Zionist immigrants in the decade preceding the First World War that the landscape of Ottoman Palestine would start to significantly change [39] Land purchases, the eviction of tenant Arab peasants and armed confrontation with Jewish para-military units would all contribute to the Palestinian population's growing fear of territorial displacement and dispossession This fear would gradually be replaced by a broader sense of Palestinian national expression which included the rejection of the Zionist goal of turning the mostly Arab populated land into a Jewish homeland [35] From early on, the leadership of the Zionist movement had the idea of \"transferring\" (a euphemism for ethnic cleansing) the Arab Palestinian population out of the land for the purpose of establishing a Jewish demographic majority [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] According to the Israeli historian Benny Morris the idea of transfer was \"inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism\" [45] The Arab population felt this threat as early as the 1880s with the arrival of the first aliyah [35]\n\n\n1920s\nWith the commitment to establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, the creation of the British Mandate in Palestine after the end of the first world war would allow for large-scale Jewish immigration This would be accompanied by the development of a separate Jewish controlled sector of the economy which was supported with large amounts of capital from abroad [48] The more ardent Zionist ideologues of the Second Aliyah would become the leaders of the Yishuv starting in the 1920s and believed in the separation of Jewish and Arab economies and societies During this period, the exclusionary nationalist ethos would grow to overpower the socialist ideals that the Second Aliyah had arrived with [29]\n\n\n1936–1939 Arab revolt\nIn the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott The strike soon deteriorated into violence, and the Arab revolt was bloodily repressed by the British assisted by the British armed forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, the Jewish Supernumerary Police, and Special Night Squads [51] The suppression of the revolt would leave at least 10% of the adult male population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled [52] In the first wave of organized violence, lasting until early 1937, most of the Arab groups were defeated by the British, and forced expulsion of much of the Arab leadership ensued With much of the leadership in exile and the economy severely weakened, the Palestinians would struggle to confront the Zionist movement which was growing in strength, with the support of the British [53]\n\n\n1940s\nThe renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning of World War II, ended with around 5,000 causualties on the Arab side and 700 combined on the British and Jewish side total [58] [59] [60] With the eruption of World War II, the situation in Mandatory Palestine calmed down It allowed a shift towards a more moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab Palestine Regiment under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa The more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini, however, tended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of a pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world The defeat of Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in Palestine, though he regularly demanded that the Italians and the Germans bomb Tel Aviv By the end of World War II, a crisis over the fate of Holocaust survivors from Europe led to renewed tensions between the Yishuv and Mandate authorities Increased illegal immigration from Jewish refugees, along with a paramilitary campaign of resistance against British authorities by Zionist militias, would effectively overturn the White Paper and eventually lead to the withdrawal of the British [50]\n\n\n1947 United Nations partition plan\nOn 29 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 181(II) [61] recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the City of Jerusalem [62] Palestinian Arabs were opposed to the partition [63] Zionists accepted the partition but planned to expand Israel's borders beyond what was allocated to it by the UN [64] On the next day, Palestine was swept by violence For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and attack, the Yishuv was usually on the defensive while occasionally retaliating [65] The Arab League supported the Arab struggle by forming the volunteer-based Arab Liberation Army, supporting the Palestinian Arab Army of the Holy War, under the leadership of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama On the Jewish side, the civil war was managed by the major underground militias – the Haganah, Irgun and Lehi – strengthened by numerous Jewish veterans of World War II and foreign volunteers By spring 1948, it was already clear that the Arab forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces gained more and more territory, creating a large scale refugee problem of Palestinian Arabs [50]\n\n\n1948 Arab–Israeli War\nFollowing the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the main phase of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War [62] The overall fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease-fire and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the West Bank and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip, where the All-Palestine Government was declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948 [51]\n\n\n1956 Suez Crisis\nThrough the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the Palestinian Fedayeen militants' cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out its own reprisal operations in the host countries The 1956 Suez Crisis resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile of the All-Palestine Government, which was later restored with Israeli withdrawal The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the United Arab Republic, to the detriment of the Palestinian national movement Gaza Strip then was put under the authority of the Egyptian military administrator, making it a de facto military occupation In 1964, however, a new organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser Arafat [62] It immediately won the support of most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the Arab League.\n\n\n1967 Six-Day War\nIn the 1967 Arab-Israel War, Israel occupied the Palestinian West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, Egyptian Sinai, Syrian Golan Heights, and two islands in the Gulf of Aqaba By the mid-1970s, the international community had converged on a framework to resolve the conflict This included Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied territories in exchange for recognition by the Palestinians and other Arab nations, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza and a \"just resolution\" of the Palestinian refugee question These principles, known as \"land for peace\" and Palestinian self-determination through a two-state settlement, were endorsed by the International Court of Justice, the United Nations, and international human rights organizations [66]\n\n\n1973 Yom Kippur War\nOn October 6, 1973, a coalition of Arab forces consisting of mainly Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur Egyptian and Syria had crossed over the ceasefire lines that were agreed upon prior to 1973 Egypt had in particular tried to reoccupy much of the area surrounding the Suez Canal, whilst the frontline with Syria was mainly situated around the north in the Golan Heights The war concluded with an Israeli victory, with both sides suffering tremendous casualties.\n\n\n1982 Lebanon War\nPalestinian insurgency in South Lebanon peaked in the early 1970s, as Lebanon was used as a base to launch attacks on northern Israel and airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian militants continued to launch attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within Lebanon In 1978, the Coastal Road massacre led to the Israeli full-scale invasion known as Operation Litani This operation sought to dislodge the PLO from Lebanon while expanding the area under the control of the Israeli allied Christian militias in southern Lebanon The operation succeeded in leaving a large portion of the south in control of the Israeli proxy which would eventually form the South Lebanon Army Under United States pressure, Israeli forces would eventually withdraw from Lebanon [73] [74] [75] [76]\n\n\nFirst Intifada (1987–1993)\nThe first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to escalating attacks and the endless occupation By the early 1990s, the conflict, termed the First Intifada, was the focus of international settlement efforts, in part motivated by the success of the Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of 1982 Eventually the Israeli–Palestinian peace process led to the Oslo Accords of 1993, allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, establishing the Palestinian National Authority The peace process also had significant opposition among elements of Palestinian society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who immediately initiated a campaign of attacks targeting Israelis Following hundreds of casualties and a wave of anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli far-right extremist who objected to the peace initiative This struck a serious blow to the peace process, which in 1996 led to the newly elected government of Israel backing off from the process, to some degree [50]\n\n\nSecond Intifada (2000–2005)\nFollowing several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict re-erupted as the Second Intifada in September 2000 [51] The violence, escalating into an open conflict between the Palestinian National Security Forces and the Israel Defense Forces, lasted until 2004/2005 and led to approximately 130 fatalities In 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza Israel and its Supreme Court formally declared an end to occupation, saying it \"had no effective control over what occurred\" in Gaza [84] However, the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and many other international bodies and NGOs continue to consider Israel to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel controls Gaza Strip's airspace, territorial waters and controls the movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea [84] [85] [86]\n\n\nFatah–Hamas split (2006–2007)\nIn 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 44% in the Palestinian parliamentary election Israel responded it would begin economic sanctions unless Hamas agreed to accept prior Israeli–Palestinian agreements, forswear violence, and recognize Israel's right to exist, all of which Hamas rejected [87] After internal Palestinian political struggle between Fatah and Hamas erupted into the Battle of Gaza (2007), Hamas took full control of the area [88] In 2007, Israel imposed a naval blockade on the Gaza Strip, and cooperation with Egypt allowed a ground blockade of the Egyptian border.\n\n\nIsrael–Hamas war (2023–present)\nAfter the 2014 war and 2021 crisis, Hamas began planning an attack on Israel [94] In 2022, Netanyahu returned to power while headlining a hardline far-right government, [95] which led to greater political strife in Israel [96] and clashes in the Palestinian territories [97] This culminated in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, when Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing more than 1,200 Israeli civilians and military personnel and taking hostages [98] [99] The Israeli military retaliated by conducting an extensive aerial bombardment campaign on Gaza, [100] followed by a large-scale ground invasion with the stated goal of destroying Hamas and controlling security in Gaza afterwards [101] Israel killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, including civilians and combatants and displaced almost two million people [102] South Africa accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice and called for an immediate ceasefire [103] The Court issued an order requiring Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts contrary to the 1948 Genocide Convention, [104] [105] [106] but did not order Israel to suspend its military campaign [107]\n\n\nAttempts to reach a peaceful settlement\nThe PLO's participation in diplomatic negotiations was dependent on its complete disavowal of terrorism and recognition of Israel's \"right to exist.\" This stipulation required the PLO to abandon its objective of reclaiming all of historic Palestine and instead focus on the 22 percent which came under Israeli military control in 1967 [115] By the late 1970s, Palestinian leadership in the occupied territories and most Arab states supported a two-state settlement [116] In 1981, Saudi Arabia put forward a plan based on a two-state settlement to the conflict with support from the Arab League [117] Israeli analyst Avner Yaniv describes Arafat as ready to make a historic compromise at this time, while the Israeli cabinet continued to oppose the existence of a Palestinian state Yaniv described Arafat's willingness to compromise as a \"peace offensive\" which Israel responded to by planning to remove the PLO as a potential negotiating partner in order to evade international diplomatic pressure [118] Israel would invade Lebanon the following year in an attempt to undermine the PLO as a political organization, weakening Palestinian nationalism and facilitating the annexation of the West Bank into Greater Israel [79]\n\n\nThe peace process\nThe term \"peace process\" refers to the step-by-step approach to resolving the conflict Having originally entered into usage to describe the US mediated negotiations between Israel and surrounding Arab countries, notably Egypt, the term \"peace-process\" has grown to be associated with an emphasis on the negotiation process rather than on presenting a comprehensive solution to the conflict [121] [122] [123] As part of this process, fundamental issues of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict such as borders, access to resources, and the Palestinian right of return, have been left to \"final status\" talks Such \"final status\" negotiations along the lines discussed in Madrid in 1991 have never taken place [123]\n\n\nCreation of the Palestinian Authority and security cooperation\nCore to the Oslo Accords was the creation of the Palestinian Authority and the security cooperation it would enter into with the Israeli military authorities in what has been described as the \"outsourcing\" of the occupation to the PA [115] Just before signing the Oslo accord, Rabin described the expectation that the \"Palestinians will be better at establishing internal security than we were, because they will allow no appeals to the Sepreme Court and will prevent  [human rights groups] from criticizing the conditions there.\" [130] Along these lines, Ben-Ami, who participated in the Camp David 2000 talks, described this process: \"One of the meanings of Oslo was that the PLO was eventually Israel's collaborator in the task of stifling the Intifada and cutting short what was clearly an authentically democratic struggle for Palestinian independence.\" [129]\n\n\nOslo Accords (1993, 1995)\nIn 1993, Israeli officials led by Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leaders from the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist Emblematic of the asymmetry in the Oslo process, Israel was not required to, and did not, recognize the right of a Palestinian state to exist In 1993, the Declaration of Principles (or Oslo I) was signed and set forward a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian negotiations, in which key issues would be left to \"final status\" talks The stipulations of the Oslo agreements ran contrary to the international consensus for resolving the conflict; the agreements did not uphold Palestinian self-determination or statehood and repealed the internationally accepted interpretation of UN Resolution 242 that land cannot be acquired by war [126] With respect to access to land and resources, Noam Chomsky described the Oslo agreements as allowing \"Israel to do virtually what it likes.\" [136] The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts.\n\n\nCamp David Summit (2000)\nIn July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Barak reportedly put forward the following as \"bases for negotiation\", via the US to the Palestinian President: a non-militarized Palestinian state split into 3–4 parts containing 87–92% of the West Bank after having already given up 78% of historic Palestine [i] Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent of the West Bank (5,538 km2 of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective), [142] including Arab parts of East Jerusalem and the entire Gaza Strip, [143] [144] as well as a stipulation that 69 Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank's Jewish settlers) would be ceded to Israel, no right of return to Israel, no sovereignty over the Temple Mount or any core East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, and continued Israel control over the Jordan Valley [145] [146]\n\n\nDevelopments following Camp David\nFollowing the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators continued to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to try to bridge the gaps between their respective positions The United States prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues Clinton's presentation of the US proposals was delayed by the advent of the Second Intifada at the end of September [148]\n\n\nTaba Summit (2001)\nThe Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the Taba Summit in Taba, Egypt, in January 2001 The proposition removed the \"temporarily Israeli controlled\" areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a basis for further negotiation With Israeli elections looming the talks ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement attesting to the progress they had made: \"The sides declare that they have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections.\" The following month the Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 7 February 2001 Sharon's new government chose not to resume the high-level talks [148]\n\n\nRoad map for peace (2002–2003)\nOne peace proposal, presented by the Quartet of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States on 17 September 2002, was the Road Map for Peace This plan did not attempt to resolve difficult questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of the process The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, whose goals called for a halt to both Israeli settlement construction and Israeli–Palestinian violence Neither goal has been achieved as of November 2015 [154] [155] [156]\n\n\nArab Peace Initiative (2002, 2007, 2017)\nThe Arab Peace Initiative (Arabic: مبادرة السلام العربية Mubādirat as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah), also known as the Saudi Initiative, was first proposed by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the 2002 Beirut summit  The peace initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in particular [160] The initiative was initially published on 28 March 2002, at the Beirut summit, and agreed upon again at the 2007 Riyadh summit Unlike the Road Map for Peace, it spelled out \"final solution\" borders based on the UN borders established before the 1967 Six-Day War It offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in exchange for the withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied territories, including the Golan Heights, to recognize \"an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital\" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a \"just solution\" for the Palestinian refugees [161]\n\n\nCurrent status\nIn July 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that Israeli policies violate the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [172] As of 2022, all the major Israeli and international human rights organizations were in agreement that Israeli actions constituted the crime of apartheid [173] In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released its report A Threshold Crossed, describing the policies of Israel towards Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza constituted the crime of apartheid [174] A further report titled Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime Against Humanity was released by Amnesty International on 1 February 2022 [175]\n\n\nApartheid\nIn July 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that Israeli policies violate the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [172] As of 2022, all the major Israeli and international human rights organizations were in agreement that Israeli actions constituted the crime of apartheid [173] In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released its report A Threshold Crossed, describing the policies of Israel towards Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza constituted the crime of apartheid [174] A further report titled Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime Against Humanity was released by Amnesty International on 1 February 2022 [175]\n\n\nOccupied Palestinian territory\nIsrael has occupied the Palestinian territories, which comprise the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, since the 1967 Six-Day War, making it the longest military occupation in modern history [178] In 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that the Palestinian territories constitute one political unit and that Israel's occupation since 1967, and the subsequent creation of Israeli settlements and exploitation of natural resources, are illegal under international law The court also ruled that Israel should pay full reparations to the Palestinian people for the damage the occupation has caused [179] [180]\n\n\nIsraeli settlements\nThe international community considers Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law, [183] [184] [185] [186] but Israel disputes this [187] [188] [189] [190] Those who justify the legality of the settlements use arguments based upon Articles 2 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as UN Security Council Resolution 242 [191] [better source needed] The expansion of settlements often involves the confiscation of Palestinian land and resources, leading to displacement of Palestinian communities and creating a source of tension and conflict Settlements are often protected by the Israeli military and are frequently flashpoints for violence against Palestinians Furthermore, the presence of settlements and Jewish-only bypass roads creates a fragmented Palestinian territory, seriously hindering economic development and freedom of movement for Palestinians [192] Amnesty International reports that Israeli settlements divert resources needed by Palestinian towns, such as arable land, water, and other resources; and, that settlements reduce Palestinians' ability to travel freely via local roads, owing to security considerations [192]\n\n\nIsraeli military police\nIn a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the three-year period of 2011–2013, Amnesty International stated that Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be tantamount to war crimes Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely injured by Israeli use of live ammunition In this same period, 45 Palestinians, including 6 children had been killed Amnesty's review of 25 civilians deaths concluded that in no case was there evidence of the Palestinians posing an imminent threat At the same time, over 8,000 Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including rubber-coated metal bullets Only one IDF soldier was convicted, killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel illegally The soldier was demoted and given a 1-year sentence with a five-month suspension The IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself \"to the highest of professional standards\", adding that when there was suspicion of wrongdoing, it investigated and took action \"where appropriate\" [199] [200]\n\n\nSeparation of the Gaza Strip\nSince 2006, Israel has enforced an official and explicit policy of enforcing \"separation\" between the West Bank and Gaza Strip [201] This separation policy has involved strict restrictions on imports, exports and travel to and from the Gaza Strip [202] This policy began to develop as early as the 1950s, but was further formalized with the implementation of an Israeli closure regime in 1991, where Israel began requiring Gazans to obtain permits to exit the Gaza Strip and to enter the West Bank (cancelling the \"general exit permit\") By treating the Gaza Strip as a separate entity, Israel has aimed to increase it's control over the West Bank while avoiding a political resolution to the conflict [203] [204] The lack of territorial contiguity between Gaza and the West Bank and the absence of any \"safe passage\" explain the success of Israel's policy of separation [205] Harvard political economist Sara Roy describes the separation policy as motivated by Israeli rejection of territorial compromise, fundamentally undermining Palestinian political and economic cohesion and weakening national unity among Palestinians [206] [207]\n\n\nBlockade of the Gaza Strip\nAlthough closure has a long history in Gaza dating back to 1991 when it was first imposed, it was made more acute after 2000 with the start of the second intifada Closure was tightened further after the 2005 disengagement and then again in 2006, after Hamas's electoral victory [207] Heightened restrictions were imposed on imports and exports as well as on the movement of people, including Gaza's labor force The total siege of Gaza that was imposed following the Hamas led attack on Israel during October 7, 2023, was part of that same policy of separation and closure, characterized by the destruction of Gaza's infrastructure (especially housing) and the denial of food, water, electricity, and fuel to its population [205] On 9 October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas and tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip [214] Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared, \"There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.\" [215] [216]\n\n\nUnited Nations and Recognition of Palestinian statehood\nThe PLO have campaigned for full member status for the state of Palestine at the UN and for recognition on the 1967 borders This campaign has received widespread support [230] [231] The UN General Assembly votes every year almost unanimously in favor of a resolution calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders [232] The US and Israel instead prefer to pursue bilateral negotiation rather than resolving the conflict on the basis of international law [233] [234] Netanyahu has criticized the Palestinians of purportedly trying to bypass direct talks, [235] whereas Abbas has argued that the continued construction of Israeli-Jewish settlements is \"undermining the realistic potential\" for the two-state solution [236] Although Palestine has been denied full member status by the UN Security Council, [237] in late 2012 the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of sovereign Palestine by granting non-member state status [238]\n\n\nIncitement\nFollowing the Oslo Accords, which was to set up regulative bodies to rein in frictions, Palestinian incitement against Israel, Jews, and Zionism continued, parallel with Israel's pursuance of settlements in the Palestinian territories, [239] though under Abu Mazen it has reportedly dwindled significantly [240] Charges of incitement have been reciprocal, [241] [242] both sides interpreting media statements in the Palestinian and Israeli press as constituting incitement [240] Schoolbooks published for both Israeli and Palestinian schools have been found to have encouraged one-sided narrative and even hatred of the other side [243] [244] [245] [246] [247] [248]\nPerpetrators of murderous attacks, whether against Israelis or Palestinians, often find strong vocal support from sections of their communities despite varying levels of condemnation from politicians [249] [250] [251]\n\n\nIssues in dispute\nThe core issues of the conflict are borders, the status of settlements in the West Bank, the status of east Jerusalem, the Palestinian refugee right of return, and security [254] [126] [122] [255] With the PLO's recognition of Israel's right to exist in 1982, [136] the international community with the main exception of the United States and Israel [256] [257] has been in consensus on a framework for resolving the conflict on the basis of international law [258] Various UN bodies and the ICJ have supported this position; [258] [122] every year, the UN General Assembly votes almost unanimously in favor of a resolution titled \"Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine.\" This resolution consistently affirms the illegality of the Israeli settlements, the annexation of East Jerusalem, and the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war It also emphasizes the need for an Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 and the need for a just resolution to the refugee question on the basis of UN resolution 194 [232]\n\n\nStatus of Jerusalem\nIn 1967, Israel unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem, in violation of international law Israel seized a significant area further east of the city, eventually creating a barrier of Israeli settlements around the city, isolating Jerusalem's Palestinian population from the West Bank [264] Israel's policy of constructing sprawling Jewish neighborhoods surrounding the Palestinian sections of the city were aimed at making a repartition of the city almost impossible In a further effort to change the demography of Jerusalem in favor of a Jewish majority, Israel discouraged Palestinian presence in the city while encouraging Jewish presence, as a matter of policy Specifically, Israel introduced policies restricting the space available for the construction of Palestinian neighborhoods, delaying or denying building permits and raising housing demolition orders [265] Tensions in Jerusalem are primarily driven by provocations by Israeli authorities and Jewish extremists against Arabs in the city [266]\n\n\nHoly sites and the Temple Mount\nSince the early 20th century, the issue of holy places and particularly the sacred places in Jerusalem has been employed by nationalist politicians [272]\n\n\nPalestinian refugees\nPalestinian refugees are people who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict [279] and the 1967 Six-Day War [280] The number of Palestinians who were expelled or fled from Israel was estimated at 711,000 in 1949 [281] The descendants of all refugees (not just Palestinian refugees  [282]) are considered by the UN to also be refugees As of 2010 there are 4.7 million Palestinian refugees [283] Between 350,000 and 400,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1967 Arab–Israeli war [280] A third of the refugees live in recognized refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip The remainder live in and around the cities and towns of these host countries [279] Most Palestinian refugees were born outside Israel and are not allowed to live in any part of historic Palestine [279] [284]\n\n\nIsraeli security concerns\nThroughout the conflict, Palestinian violence has been a concern for Israelis Security concerns have historically been a key driver in Israeli political decision making, often expanding in scope and taking precedence over other considerations such as international law and Palestinian human rights [311] [312] [313] The occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the continued expansion of settlements in those areas have been justified on security grounds [314]\n\n\nWater resources\nIn the Middle East, water resources are of great political concern Since Israel receives much of its water from two large underground aquifers which continue under the Green Line, the use of this water has been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict Israel withdraws most water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with approximately 40 million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for a population of about 2.6 million [337]\n\n\nFuture and financing\nNumerous foreign nations and international organizations have established bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water authorities It was estimated that a future investment of about US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn for the Gaza Strip Southern Governorates was needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015 [344]\n\n\nAgricultural rights\nThe conflict has been about land since its inception [345] When Israel became a state after the war in 1948, 77% of Palestine's land was used for the creation on the state [346] The majority of those living in Palestine at the time became refugees in other countries and this first land crisis became the root of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict [347] [page needed] Because the root of the conflict is with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.\n\n\nIsrael's West Bank barrier\nWith the construction of the separation barrier, the Israeli state promised free movement across regions However, border closures, curfews, and checkpoints has significantly restricted Palestinian movement [351] [352] In 2012, there were 99 fixed check points and 310 flying checkpoints [353] [page needed] The border restrictions impacted the imports and exports in Palestine and weakened the industrial and agricultural sectors because of the constant Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza [354] In order for the Palestinian economy to be prosperous, the restrictions on Palestinian land must be removed [350] According to The Guardian and a report for World Bank, the Palestinian economy lost $3.4bn (%35 of the annual GDP) to Israeli restrictions in the West Bank alone [355]\n\n\nPalestinian violence outside of Israel\nSome Palestinians have committed violent acts over the globe on the pretext of a struggle against Israel [356]\n\n\nPalestinian-on-Palestinian violence\nFighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian militants, as well as in the Palestinian leadership's own policies [citation needed] As early as the 1930s revolts in Palestine, Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day [citation needed]\n\n\nOverriding authority and international status\nAs far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority is derived from the Oslo Accords, signed with the PLO, under which it acquired control over cities in the Palestinian territories (Area A) while the surrounding countryside came either under Israeli security and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete Israeli civil administration (Area C) Israel has built additional highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering Palestinian cities in Area A The initial areas under Palestinian Authority control are diverse and non-contiguous The areas have changed over time by subsequent negotiations, including Oslo II, Wye River and Sharm el-Sheik According to Palestinians, the separated areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails to address Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed no agreement to withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no reduction in the division of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of a safe pass system, without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts.\n\n\nEconomic disputes and boycotts\nIn Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and border closures and restrictions placed by Israel [361] The PA's Minister of Agriculture estimates that around US$1.2 billion were lost in September 2006 because of these security measures This embargo was brought on by Hamas' refusal to recognize Israel's right to statehood [citation needed] As a result, as of 2007 [update], the PA's 160,000 employees had not received their salaries in over one year [362]\n\n\nFatalities\nStudies provide aggregated casualty data for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 13,000 Israelis and Palestinians were killed in the conflict between 1948 and 1997 [365] Other estimates give 14,500 killed between 1948 and 2009 [365] [366] During the 1982 Lebanon War, Israel killed an estimated 20,000 Palestinians and Lebanese, not including the 800–3,500 Palestinians killed in the Sabra-Shatila Massacre [9]\n\n\nCriticism of casualty statistics\nThe Israeli-based International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) claimed that Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups overestimated the percentage of civilians killed since the IDF suspected many of those killed to be possible militants [370] [371]\n\n\nLandmines and unexploded ordnance\nA comprehensive collection mechanism to gather land mine and explosive remnants of war (ERW) casualty data does not exist for the Palestinian territories [373] In 2009, the United Nations Mine Action Centre reported that more than 2,500 mine and explosive remnants of war casualties occurred between 1967 and 1998, at least 794 casualties (127 killed, 654 injured and 13 unknown) occurred between 1999 and 2008 and that 12 people had been killed and 27 injured since the Gaza War [373] The UN Mine Action Centre identified the main risks as coming from \"ERW left behind by Israeli aerial and artillery weapon systems, or from militant caches targeted by the Israeli forces.\" [373] There are at least 15 confirmed minefields in the West Bank on the border with Jordan The Palestinian National Security Forces do not have maps or records of the minefields [373]\n\n\nSee also\nHe  [Husseini] incited and headed anti-Jewish riots in April 1920 ..

The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the early 20th century, when Zionist Jews began immigrating to Palestine, then under Ottoman rule. The conflict escalated in the 1940s, leading to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.\n\n**History**\n\n## Early Developments\n\nThe modern political Zionist movement, with the goal of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, grew out of the last two decades of the 19th century, largely in response to antisemitism in Europe. Jewish colonization began during this period, but it was not until the arrival of more ideologically Zionist immigrants in the decade preceding the First World War that the landscape of Ottoman Palestine would start to significantly change.\n\n## 1920s\n\nWith the commitment to establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, the creation of the British Mandate in Palestine after the end of the first world war allowed for large-scale Jewish immigration. This would be accompanied by the development of a separate Jewish controlled sector of the economy which was supported with large amounts of capital from abroad.\n\n## 1930s\n\nThe Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East. Under the leadership of Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam, a group was established that prepared the grounds for the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into violence, and the Arab revolt was bloodily repressed by the British assisted by the British armed forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, the Jewish Supernumerary Police, and Special Night Squads.\n\n## 1940s\n\nThe renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning of World War II, ended with around 5,000 casualties on the Arab side and 700 combined on the British and Jewish side. With the eruption of World War II, the situation in Mandatory Palestine calmed down, allowing a shift towards a more moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab Palestine Regiment under British command.\n\n## 1947 United Nations Partition Plan\n\nOn 29 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 181(II), recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state, and the City of Jerusalem. Palestinian Arabs were opposed to the partition, while Zionists accepted the partition but planned to expand Israel's borders beyond what was allocated to it by the UN.\n\n## 1948 Arab–Israeli War\n\nFollowing the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the main phase of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The overall fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease-fire and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the former Mandate territory.\n\n**Peace Process**\n\n## Oslo Accords\n\nIn 1993, Israeli officials led by Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leaders from the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist.\n\n## Camp David Summit\n\nIn July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Barak reportedly put forward the following as \"bases for negotiation\": a non-militarized Palestinian state split into 3-4 parts containing 87-92% of the West Bank after having already given up 78% of historic Palestine.\n\n## Road Map for Peace\n\nOne peace proposal, presented by the Quartet of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations, and the United States on 17 September 2002, was the Road Map for Peace. The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, whose goals called for a halt to both Israeli settlement construction and Israeli-Palestinian violence.\n\n**Current Status**\n\n## Recognition of Palestinian Statehood\n\nThe PLO have campaigned for full member status for the state of Palestine at the UN and for recognition on the 1967 borders. This campaign has received widespread support. The US and Israel prefer to pursue bilateral negotiation rather than resolving the conflict on the basis of international law.\n\n## Border Disputes\n\nThe core issues of the conflict are borders, the status of settlements in the West Bank, the status of East Jerusalem, the Palestinian refugee right of return, and security. Israel has built additional highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering Palestinian cities in Area A.\n\n## Economic Disputes and Boycotts\n\nIn Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and border closures and restrictions placed by Israel.

The conflict escalated in the 1940s, leading to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. The peace process has been a series of attempts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, but has been hindered by various factors, including disagreements over borders, settlements, and the status of Jerusalem. The current status of the conflict remains a major concern for the international community, with ongoing violence and displacement of Palestinians.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Israeli–Palestinian_conflict\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe Israeli–Palestinian conflict began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the development of political Zionism and the arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine [29] [38] The modern political Zionist movement, with the goal of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, grew out of the last two decades of the 19th century, largely in response to antisemitism in Europe While Jewish colonization began during this period, it was not until the arrival of more ideologically Zionist immigrants in the decade preceding the First World War that the landscape of Ottoman Palestine would start to significantly change [39] Land purchases, the eviction of tenant Arab peasants and armed confrontation with Jewish para-military units would all contribute to the Palestinian population's growing fear of territorial displacement and dispossession This fear would gradually be replaced by a broader sense of Palestinian national expression which included the rejection of the Zionist goal of turning the mostly Arab populated land into a Jewish homeland [35] From early on, the leadership of the Zionist movement had the idea of \"transferring\" (a euphemism for ethnic cleansing) the Arab Palestinian population out of the land for the purpose of establishing a Jewish demographic majority [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] According to the Israeli historian Benny Morris the idea of transfer was \"inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism\" [45] The Arab population felt this threat as early as the 1880s with the arrival of the first aliyah [35]\n\n\n1920s\nWith the commitment to establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, the creation of the British Mandate in Palestine after the end of the first world war would allow for large-scale Jewish immigration This would be accompanied by the development of a separate Jewish controlled sector of the economy which was supported with large amounts of capital from abroad [48] The more ardent Zionist ideologues of the Second Aliyah would become the leaders of the Yishuv starting in the 1920s and believed in the separation of Jewish and Arab economies and societies During this period, the exclusionary nationalist ethos would grow to overpower the socialist ideals that the Second Aliyah had arrived with [29]\n\n\n1936–1939 Arab revolt\nIn the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott The strike soon deteriorated into violence, and the Arab revolt was bloodily repressed by the British assisted by the British armed forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, the Jewish Supernumerary Police, and Special Night Squads [51] The suppression of the revolt would leave at least 10% of the adult male population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled [52] In the first wave of organized violence, lasting until early 1937, most of the Arab groups were defeated by the British, and forced expulsion of much of the Arab leadership ensued With much of the leadership in exile and the economy severely weakened, the Palestinians would struggle to confront the Zionist movement which was growing in strength, with the support of the British [53]\n\n\n1940s\nThe renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning of World War II, ended with around 5,000 causualties on the Arab side and 700 combined on the British and Jewish side total [58] [59] [60] With the eruption of World War II, the situation in Mandatory Palestine calmed down It allowed a shift towards a more moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab Palestine Regiment under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa The more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini, however, tended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of a pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world The defeat of Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in Palestine, though he regularly demanded that the Italians and the Germans bomb Tel Aviv By the end of World War II, a crisis over the fate of Holocaust survivors from Europe led to renewed tensions between the Yishuv and Mandate authorities Increased illegal immigration from Jewish refugees, along with a paramilitary campaign of resistance against British authorities by Zionist militias, would effectively overturn the White Paper and eventually lead to the withdrawal of the British [50]\n\n\n1947 United Nations partition plan\nOn 29 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 181(II) [61] recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the City of Jerusalem [62] Palestinian Arabs were opposed to the partition [63] Zionists accepted the partition but planned to expand Israel's borders beyond what was allocated to it by the UN [64] On the next day, Palestine was swept by violence For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and attack, the Yishuv was usually on the defensive while occasionally retaliating [65] The Arab League supported the Arab struggle by forming the volunteer-based Arab Liberation Army, supporting the Palestinian Arab Army of the Holy War, under the leadership of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama On the Jewish side, the civil war was managed by the major underground militias – the Haganah, Irgun and Lehi – strengthened by numerous Jewish veterans of World War II and foreign volunteers By spring 1948, it was already clear that the Arab forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces gained more and more territory, creating a large scale refugee problem of Palestinian Arabs [50]\n\n\n1948 Arab–Israeli War\nFollowing the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the main phase of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War [62] The overall fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease-fire and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the West Bank and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip, where the All-Palestine Government was declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948 [51]\n\n\n1956 Suez Crisis\nThrough the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the Palestinian Fedayeen militants' cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out its own reprisal operations in the host countries The 1956 Suez Crisis resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile of the All-Palestine Government, which was later restored with Israeli withdrawal The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the United Arab Republic, to the detriment of the Palestinian national movement Gaza Strip then was put under the authority of the Egyptian military administrator, making it a de facto military occupation In 1964, however, a new organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser Arafat [62] It immediately won the support of most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the Arab League.\n\n\n1967 Six-Day War\nIn the 1967 Arab-Israel War, Israel occupied the Palestinian West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, Egyptian Sinai, Syrian Golan Heights, and two islands in the Gulf of Aqaba By the mid-1970s, the international community had converged on a framework to resolve the conflict This included Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied territories in exchange for recognition by the Palestinians and other Arab nations, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza and a \"just resolution\" of the Palestinian refugee question These principles, known as \"land for peace\" and Palestinian self-determination through a two-state settlement, were endorsed by the International Court of Justice, the United Nations, and international human rights organizations [66]\n\n\n1973 Yom Kippur War\nOn October 6, 1973, a coalition of Arab forces consisting of mainly Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur Egyptian and Syria had crossed over the ceasefire lines that were agreed upon prior to 1973 Egypt had in particular tried to reoccupy much of the area surrounding the Suez Canal, whilst the frontline with Syria was mainly situated around the north in the Golan Heights The war concluded with an Israeli victory, with both sides suffering tremendous casualties.\n\n\n1982 Lebanon War\nPalestinian insurgency in South Lebanon peaked in the early 1970s, as Lebanon was used as a base to launch attacks on northern Israel and airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian militants continued to launch attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within Lebanon In 1978, the Coastal Road massacre led to the Israeli full-scale invasion known as Operation Litani This operation sought to dislodge the PLO from Lebanon while expanding the area under the control of the Israeli allied Christian militias in southern Lebanon The operation succeeded in leaving a large portion of the south in control of the Israeli proxy which would eventually form the South Lebanon Army Under United States pressure, Israeli forces would eventually withdraw from Lebanon [73] [74] [75] [76]\n\n\nFirst Intifada (1987–1993)\nThe first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to escalating attacks and the endless occupation By the early 1990s, the conflict, termed the First Intifada, was the focus of international settlement efforts, in part motivated by the success of the Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of 1982 Eventually the Israeli–Palestinian peace process led to the Oslo Accords of 1993, allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, establishing the Palestinian National Authority The peace process also had significant opposition among elements of Palestinian society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who immediately initiated a campaign of attacks targeting Israelis Following hundreds of casualties and a wave of anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli far-right extremist who objected to the peace initiative This struck a serious blow to the peace process, which in 1996 led to the newly elected government of Israel backing off from the process, to some degree [50]\n\n\nSecond Intifada (2000–2005)\nFollowing several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict re-erupted as the Second Intifada in September 2000 [51] The violence, escalating into an open conflict between the Palestinian National Security Forces and the Israel Defense Forces, lasted until 2004/2005 and led to approximately 130 fatalities In 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza Israel and its Supreme Court formally declared an end to occupation, saying it \"had no effective control over what occurred\" in Gaza [84] However, the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and many other international bodies and NGOs continue to consider Israel to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel controls Gaza Strip's airspace, territorial waters and controls the movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea [84] [85] [86]\n\n\nFatah–Hamas split (2006–2007)\nIn 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 44% in the Palestinian parliamentary election Israel responded it would begin economic sanctions unless Hamas agreed to accept prior Israeli–Palestinian agreements, forswear violence, and recognize Israel's right to exist, all of which Hamas rejected [87] After internal Palestinian political struggle between Fatah and Hamas erupted into the Battle of Gaza (2007), Hamas took full control of the area [88] In 2007, Israel imposed a naval blockade on the Gaza Strip, and cooperation with Egypt allowed a ground blockade of the Egyptian border.\n\n\nIsrael–Hamas war (2023–present)\nAfter the 2014 war and 2021 crisis, Hamas began planning an attack on Israel [94] In 2022, Netanyahu returned to power while headlining a hardline far-right government, [95] which led to greater political strife in Israel [96] and clashes in the Palestinian territories [97] This culminated in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, when Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing more than 1,200 Israeli civilians and military personnel and taking hostages [98] [99] The Israeli military retaliated by conducting an extensive aerial bombardment campaign on Gaza, [100] followed by a large-scale ground invasion with the stated goal of destroying Hamas and controlling security in Gaza afterwards [101] Israel killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, including civilians and combatants and displaced almost two million people [102] South Africa accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice and called for an immediate ceasefire [103] The Court issued an order requiring Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts contrary to the 1948 Genocide Convention, [104] [105] [106] but did not order Israel to suspend its military campaign [107]\n\n\nAttempts to reach a peaceful settlement\nThe PLO's participation in diplomatic negotiations was dependent on its complete disavowal of terrorism and recognition of Israel's \"right to exist.\" This stipulation required the PLO to abandon its objective of reclaiming all of historic Palestine and instead focus on the 22 percent which came under Israeli military control in 1967 [115] By the late 1970s, Palestinian leadership in the occupied territories and most Arab states supported a two-state settlement [116] In 1981, Saudi Arabia put forward a plan based on a two-state settlement to the conflict with support from the Arab League [117] Israeli analyst Avner Yaniv describes Arafat as ready to make a historic compromise at this time, while the Israeli cabinet continued to oppose the existence of a Palestinian state Yaniv described Arafat's willingness to compromise as a \"peace offensive\" which Israel responded to by planning to remove the PLO as a potential negotiating partner in order to evade international diplomatic pressure [118] Israel would invade Lebanon the following year in an attempt to undermine the PLO as a political organization, weakening Palestinian nationalism and facilitating the annexation of the West Bank into Greater Israel [79]\n\n\nThe peace process\nThe term \"peace process\" refers to the step-by-step approach to resolving the conflict Having originally entered into usage to describe the US mediated negotiations between Israel and surrounding Arab countries, notably Egypt, the term \"peace-process\" has grown to be associated with an emphasis on the negotiation process rather than on presenting a comprehensive solution to the conflict [121] [122] [123] As part of this process, fundamental issues of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict such as borders, access to resources, and the Palestinian right of return, have been left to \"final status\" talks Such \"final status\" negotiations along the lines discussed in Madrid in 1991 have never taken place [123]\n\n\nCreation of the Palestinian Authority and security cooperation\nCore to the Oslo Accords was the creation of the Palestinian Authority and the security cooperation it would enter into with the Israeli military authorities in what has been described as the \"outsourcing\" of the occupation to the PA [115] Just before signing the Oslo accord, Rabin described the expectation that the \"Palestinians will be better at establishing internal security than we were, because they will allow no appeals to the Sepreme Court and will prevent  [human rights groups] from criticizing the conditions there.\" [130] Along these lines, Ben-Ami, who participated in the Camp David 2000 talks, described this process: \"One of the meanings of Oslo was that the PLO was eventually Israel's collaborator in the task of stifling the Intifada and cutting short what was clearly an authentically democratic struggle for Palestinian independence.\" [129]\n\n\nOslo Accords (1993, 1995)\nIn 1993, Israeli officials led by Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leaders from the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist Emblematic of the asymmetry in the Oslo process, Israel was not required to, and did not, recognize the right of a Palestinian state to exist In 1993, the Declaration of Principles (or Oslo I) was signed and set forward a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian negotiations, in which key issues would be left to \"final status\" talks The stipulations of the Oslo agreements ran contrary to the international consensus for resolving the conflict; the agreements did not uphold Palestinian self-determination or statehood and repealed the internationally accepted interpretation of UN Resolution 242 that land cannot be acquired by war [126] With respect to access to land and resources, Noam Chomsky described the Oslo agreements as allowing \"Israel to do virtually what it likes.\" [136] The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts.\n\n\nCamp David Summit (2000)\nIn July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Barak reportedly put forward the following as \"bases for negotiation\", via the US to the Palestinian President: a non-militarized Palestinian state split into 3–4 parts containing 87–92% of the West Bank after having already given up 78% of historic Palestine [i] Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent of the West Bank (5,538 km2 of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective), [142] including Arab parts of East Jerusalem and the entire Gaza Strip, [143] [144] as well as a stipulation that 69 Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank's Jewish settlers) would be ceded to Israel, no right of return to Israel, no sovereignty over the Temple Mount or any core East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, and continued Israel control over the Jordan Valley [145] [146]\n\n\nDevelopments following Camp David\nFollowing the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators continued to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to try to bridge the gaps between their respective positions The United States prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues Clinton's presentation of the US proposals was delayed by the advent of the Second Intifada at the end of September [148]\n\n\nTaba Summit (2001)\nThe Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the Taba Summit in Taba, Egypt, in January 2001 The proposition removed the \"temporarily Israeli controlled\" areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a basis for further negotiation With Israeli elections looming the talks ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement attesting to the progress they had made: \"The sides declare that they have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections.\" The following month the Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 7 February 2001 Sharon's new government chose not to resume the high-level talks [148]\n\n\nRoad map for peace (2002–2003)\nOne peace proposal, presented by the Quartet of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States on 17 September 2002, was the Road Map for Peace This plan did not attempt to resolve difficult questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of the process The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, whose goals called for a halt to both Israeli settlement construction and Israeli–Palestinian violence Neither goal has been achieved as of November 2015 [154] [155] [156]\n\n\nArab Peace Initiative (2002, 2007, 2017)\nThe Arab Peace Initiative (Arabic: مبادرة السلام العربية Mubādirat as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah), also known as the Saudi Initiative, was first proposed by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the 2002 Beirut summit  The peace initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in particular [160] The initiative was initially published on 28 March 2002, at the Beirut summit, and agreed upon again at the 2007 Riyadh summit Unlike the Road Map for Peace, it spelled out \"final solution\" borders based on the UN borders established before the 1967 Six-Day War It offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in exchange for the withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied territories, including the Golan Heights, to recognize \"an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital\" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a \"just solution\" for the Palestinian refugees [161]\n\n\nCurrent status\nIn July 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that Israeli policies violate the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [172] As of 2022, all the major Israeli and international human rights organizations were in agreement that Israeli actions constituted the crime of apartheid [173] In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released its report A Threshold Crossed, describing the policies of Israel towards Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza constituted the crime of apartheid [174] A further report titled Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime Against Humanity was released by Amnesty International on 1 February 2022 [175]\n\n\nApartheid\nIn July 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that Israeli policies violate the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [172] As of 2022, all the major Israeli and international human rights organizations were in agreement that Israeli actions constituted the crime of apartheid [173] In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released its report A Threshold Crossed, describing the policies of Israel towards Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza constituted the crime of apartheid [174] A further report titled Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime Against Humanity was released by Amnesty International on 1 February 2022 [175]\n\n\nOccupied Palestinian territory\nIsrael has occupied the Palestinian territories, which comprise the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, since the 1967 Six-Day War, making it the longest military occupation in modern history [178] In 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that the Palestinian territories constitute one political unit and that Israel's occupation since 1967, and the subsequent creation of Israeli settlements and exploitation of natural resources, are illegal under international law The court also ruled that Israel should pay full reparations to the Palestinian people for the damage the occupation has caused [179] [180]\n\n\nIsraeli settlements\nThe international community considers Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law, [183] [184] [185] [186] but Israel disputes this [187] [188] [189] [190] Those who justify the legality of the settlements use arguments based upon Articles 2 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as UN Security Council Resolution 242 [191] [better source needed] The expansion of settlements often involves the confiscation of Palestinian land and resources, leading to displacement of Palestinian communities and creating a source of tension and conflict Settlements are often protected by the Israeli military and are frequently flashpoints for violence against Palestinians Furthermore, the presence of settlements and Jewish-only bypass roads creates a fragmented Palestinian territory, seriously hindering economic development and freedom of movement for Palestinians [192] Amnesty International reports that Israeli settlements divert resources needed by Palestinian towns, such as arable land, water, and other resources; and, that settlements reduce Palestinians' ability to travel freely via local roads, owing to security considerations [192]\n\n\nIsraeli military police\nIn a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the three-year period of 2011–2013, Amnesty International stated that Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be tantamount to war crimes Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely injured by Israeli use of live ammunition In this same period, 45 Palestinians, including 6 children had been killed Amnesty's review of 25 civilians deaths concluded that in no case was there evidence of the Palestinians posing an imminent threat At the same time, over 8,000 Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including rubber-coated metal bullets Only one IDF soldier was convicted, killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel illegally The soldier was demoted and given a 1-year sentence with a five-month suspension The IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself \"to the highest of professional standards\", adding that when there was suspicion of wrongdoing, it investigated and took action \"where appropriate\" [199] [200]\n\n\nSeparation of the Gaza Strip\nSince 2006, Israel has enforced an official and explicit policy of enforcing \"separation\" between the West Bank and Gaza Strip [201] This separation policy has involved strict restrictions on imports, exports and travel to and from the Gaza Strip [202] This policy began to develop as early as the 1950s, but was further formalized with the implementation of an Israeli closure regime in 1991, where Israel began requiring Gazans to obtain permits to exit the Gaza Strip and to enter the West Bank (cancelling the \"general exit permit\") By treating the Gaza Strip as a separate entity, Israel has aimed to increase it's control over the West Bank while avoiding a political resolution to the conflict [203] [204] The lack of territorial contiguity between Gaza and the West Bank and the absence of any \"safe passage\" explain the success of Israel's policy of separation [205] Harvard political economist Sara Roy describes the separation policy as motivated by Israeli rejection of territorial compromise, fundamentally undermining Palestinian political and economic cohesion and weakening national unity among Palestinians [206] [207]\n\n\nBlockade of the Gaza Strip\nAlthough closure has a long history in Gaza dating back to 1991 when it was first imposed, it was made more acute after 2000 with the start of the second intifada Closure was tightened further after the 2005 disengagement and then again in 2006, after Hamas's electoral victory [207] Heightened restrictions were imposed on imports and exports as well as on the movement of people, including Gaza's labor force The total siege of Gaza that was imposed following the Hamas led attack on Israel during October 7, 2023, was part of that same policy of separation and closure, characterized by the destruction of Gaza's infrastructure (especially housing) and the denial of food, water, electricity, and fuel to its population [205] On 9 October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas and tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip [214] Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared, \"There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.\" [215] [216]\n\n\nUnited Nations and Recognition of Palestinian statehood\nThe PLO have campaigned for full member status for the state of Palestine at the UN and for recognition on the 1967 borders This campaign has received widespread support [230] [231] The UN General Assembly votes every year almost unanimously in favor of a resolution calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders [232] The US and Israel instead prefer to pursue bilateral negotiation rather than resolving the conflict on the basis of international law [233] [234] Netanyahu has criticized the Palestinians of purportedly trying to bypass direct talks, [235] whereas Abbas has argued that the continued construction of Israeli-Jewish settlements is \"undermining the realistic potential\" for the two-state solution [236] Although Palestine has been denied full member status by the UN Security Council, [237] in late 2012 the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of sovereign Palestine by granting non-member state status [238]\n\n\nIncitement\nFollowing the Oslo Accords, which was to set up regulative bodies to rein in frictions, Palestinian incitement against Israel, Jews, and Zionism continued, parallel with Israel's pursuance of settlements in the Palestinian territories, [239] though under Abu Mazen it has reportedly dwindled significantly [240] Charges of incitement have been reciprocal, [241] [242] both sides interpreting media statements in the Palestinian and Israeli press as constituting incitement [240] Schoolbooks published for both Israeli and Palestinian schools have been found to have encouraged one-sided narrative and even hatred of the other side [243] [244] [245] [246] [247] [248]\nPerpetrators of murderous attacks, whether against Israelis or Palestinians, often find strong vocal support from sections of their communities despite varying levels of condemnation from politicians [249] [250] [251]\n\n\nIssues in dispute\nThe core issues of the conflict are borders, the status of settlements in the West Bank, the status of east Jerusalem, the Palestinian refugee right of return, and security [254] [126] [122] [255] With the PLO's recognition of Israel's right to exist in 1982, [136] the international community with the main exception of the United States and Israel [256] [257] has been in consensus on a framework for resolving the conflict on the basis of international law [258] Various UN bodies and the ICJ have supported this position; [258] [122] every year, the UN General Assembly votes almost unanimously in favor of a resolution titled \"Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine.\" This resolution consistently affirms the illegality of the Israeli settlements, the annexation of East Jerusalem, and the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war It also emphasizes the need for an Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 and the need for a just resolution to the refugee question on the basis of UN resolution 194 [232]\n\n\nStatus of Jerusalem\nIn 1967, Israel unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem, in violation of international law Israel seized a significant area further east of the city, eventually creating a barrier of Israeli settlements around the city, isolating Jerusalem's Palestinian population from the West Bank [264] Israel's policy of constructing sprawling Jewish neighborhoods surrounding the Palestinian sections of the city were aimed at making a repartition of the city almost impossible In a further effort to change the demography of Jerusalem in favor of a Jewish majority, Israel discouraged Palestinian presence in the city while encouraging Jewish presence, as a matter of policy Specifically, Israel introduced policies restricting the space available for the construction of Palestinian neighborhoods, delaying or denying building permits and raising housing demolition orders [265] Tensions in Jerusalem are primarily driven by provocations by Israeli authorities and Jewish extremists against Arabs in the city [266]\n\n\nHoly sites and the Temple Mount\nSince the early 20th century, the issue of holy places and particularly the sacred places in Jerusalem has been employed by nationalist politicians [272]\n\n\nPalestinian refugees\nPalestinian refugees are people who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict [279] and the 1967 Six-Day War [280] The number of Palestinians who were expelled or fled from Israel was estimated at 711,000 in 1949 [281] The descendants of all refugees (not just Palestinian refugees  [282]) are considered by the UN to also be refugees As of 2010 there are 4.7 million Palestinian refugees [283] Between 350,000 and 400,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1967 Arab–Israeli war [280] A third of the refugees live in recognized refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip The remainder live in and around the cities and towns of these host countries [279] Most Palestinian refugees were born outside Israel and are not allowed to live in any part of historic Palestine [279] [284]\n\n\nIsraeli security concerns\nThroughout the conflict, Palestinian violence has been a concern for Israelis Security concerns have historically been a key driver in Israeli political decision making, often expanding in scope and taking precedence over other considerations such as international law and Palestinian human rights [311] [312] [313] The occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the continued expansion of settlements in those areas have been justified on security grounds [314]\n\n\nWater resources\nIn the Middle East, water resources are of great political concern Since Israel receives much of its water from two large underground aquifers which continue under the Green Line, the use of this water has been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict Israel withdraws most water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with approximately 40 million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for a population of about 2.6 million [337]\n\n\nFuture and financing\nNumerous foreign nations and international organizations have established bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water authorities It was estimated that a future investment of about US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn for the Gaza Strip Southern Governorates was needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015 [344]\n\n\nAgricultural rights\nThe conflict has been about land since its inception [345] When Israel became a state after the war in 1948, 77% of Palestine's land was used for the creation on the state [346] The majority of those living in Palestine at the time became refugees in other countries and this first land crisis became the root of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict [347] [page needed] Because the root of the conflict is with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.\n\n\nIsrael's West Bank barrier\nWith the construction of the separation barrier, the Israeli state promised free movement across regions However, border closures, curfews, and checkpoints has significantly restricted Palestinian movement [351] [352] In 2012, there were 99 fixed check points and 310 flying checkpoints [353] [page needed] The border restrictions impacted the imports and exports in Palestine and weakened the industrial and agricultural sectors because of the constant Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza [354] In order for the Palestinian economy to be prosperous, the restrictions on Palestinian land must be removed [350] According to The Guardian and a report for World Bank, the Palestinian economy lost $3.4bn (%35 of the annual GDP) to Israeli restrictions in the West Bank alone [355]\n\n\nPalestinian violence outside of Israel\nSome Palestinians have committed violent acts over the globe on the pretext of a struggle against Israel [356]\n\n\nPalestinian-on-Palestinian violence\nFighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian militants, as well as in the Palestinian leadership's own policies [citation needed] As early as the 1930s revolts in Palestine, Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day [citation needed]\n\n\nOverriding authority and international status\nAs far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority is derived from the Oslo Accords, signed with the PLO, under which it acquired control over cities in the Palestinian territories (Area A) while the surrounding countryside came either under Israeli security and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete Israeli civil administration (Area C) Israel has built additional highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering Palestinian cities in Area A The initial areas under Palestinian Authority control are diverse and non-contiguous The areas have changed over time by subsequent negotiations, including Oslo II, Wye River and Sharm el-Sheik According to Palestinians, the separated areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails to address Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed no agreement to withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no reduction in the division of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of a safe pass system, without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts.\n\n\nEconomic disputes and boycotts\nIn Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and border closures and restrictions placed by Israel [361] The PA's Minister of Agriculture estimates that around US$1.2 billion were lost in September 2006 because of these security measures This embargo was brought on by Hamas' refusal to recognize Israel's right to statehood [citation needed] As a result, as of 2007 [update], the PA's 160,000 employees had not received their salaries in over one year [362]\n\n\nFatalities\nStudies provide aggregated casualty data for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 13,000 Israelis and Palestinians were killed in the conflict between 1948 and 1997 [365] Other estimates give 14,500 killed between 1948 and 2009 [365] [366] During the 1982 Lebanon War, Israel killed an estimated 20,000 Palestinians and Lebanese, not including the 800–3,500 Palestinians killed in the Sabra-Shatila Massacre [9]\n\n\nCriticism of casualty statistics\nThe Israeli-based International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) claimed that Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups

{"title": "Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks", "content": "\nEvacuation\nMost tall buildings in the United States at the time were not designed for complete evacuation during a crisis, even after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing It was also procedural for announcements in the case of high-rise fire safety for individuals to remain in their offices unless they were near the burning floor [25] However, after it took ten hours to completely evacuate the towers in the 1993 attack, multiple additions were made to the buildings and evacuation plans Radio repeaters were installed in the towers to improve communication, battery powered emergency lights were installed, and fire drills held Individuals who evacuated for both the 1993 and 2001 attacks reportedly stated they were better prepared for the 2001 evacuations [26] At least two individuals who had evacuated in both 1993 and 2001 later reported that they had prepared for a potential evacuation after 1993, by bringing either an item such as a flashlight or an emergency preparedness bag with them [27]\n\n\nNorth Tower\nThe exact number of civilians and emergency workers killed in the North Tower is not conclusively known, but an estimated total of 1,600 is the consensus Between 1,344 [107] and 1,426 [108] of these individuals were above the 91st floor when Flight 11 crashed between floors 93 and 99 at 8:46 a.m Hundreds in the path of the impact or the ensuing flash fire were killed instantly Some were fatally burned hundreds of feet below as the elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel down as far as the lobby, where it exploded [109]: 73  More than 800 people were believed to have survived the initial crash but were trapped; [110] the centralized impact into the tower immediately severed all elevator shafts in the central core from the 50th floor upward, [111]: 74  while all three stairwells in the impact zone were impassable 70 people on floor 92, the first floor below the impact zone, were also trapped because the stairwells were destroyed or blocked by debris [112] Those trapped died from smoke inhalation, the fire, jumping or falling from the building, or were killed in the eventual collapse [44] Although a few people would subsequently be found alive in the rubble following the collapse of the towers, none of these individuals were from the trapped floors [113]  Twenty-four people were still officially listed as missing in 2006 [114] and as of September 2021, the remains of 1,106 victims of the attacks have yet to be identified [115]\n\n\nSouth Tower\nThe precise total of people killed in the South Tower has also never been verified, but it is believed that around a thousand civilians and emergency personnel lost their lives in the building that day The National Institute of Standards and Technology report estimated that between 630 and 701 of these people were WTC employees, [123]: 238  all but 11 from floors trapped by the impact Had the South Tower been struck first, Flight 175's hijacking would have been the deadliest suicide attack of the day, as more than 3,500 people were present in Floor 77 or higher at 08:46 [124]: 92  The 17 minute gap between the two impacts meant this figure had reduced substantially by 09:03 [125]: 96  More than 300 people were killed instantly by the crash, [110] two-thirds of whom came from the 78th floor sky lobby [126] [127] [128] [129] Those who remained were not completely trapped, but almost all still perished The causes of death in the South Tower were identical to those in the North Tower, but in much lower numbers The actions taken by trapped workers suggest that conditions were comparably more tenable in the South Tower than its twin; hundreds of people fell or jumped to their deaths from the North Tower, but almost no one did from the South [130]: 86  A total of 18 people from the impact zone escaped the South Tower using Stairwell A, the one stairway left mostly intact and negotiable from top to bottom when the tower was struck There may have been others from the trapped floors who found Stairwell A but were caught in the collapse before they could escape [131]: 239  [81] The relatively few employees killed below the 77th floor is something the 9/11 Commission noted as being a strong indication that evacuation below the impact zones was a success, allowing most to safely evacuate before the collapse of the World Trade Center [113]\n\n\nPentagon\nAt least 125 people working at the Pentagon were killed, most of whom worked for the United States Army or the United States Navy [165] Of those 125 deaths, 70 were civilians – 47 Army employees, six Army contractors, six Navy employees, three Navy contractors, seven Defense Intelligence Agency employees, and one Office of the Secretary of Defense contractor [166] – and 55 were members of the United States Armed Forces – 33 Navy sailors and 22 Army soldiers [167] Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military official killed at the Pentagon [168]\n\n\nWorld Trade Center Hotel\nThere is no precise number of deaths which occurred within the hotel as many who sheltered in the hotel during and after the collapse of the South Tower were protected by the reinforced beams that had been installed by the Port Authority after the 1993 bombing [66] However, the pieces of the South Tower did cause catastrophic damage to the hotel, with many claiming the hotel was cut in half by the falling debris, with survivors stating the pressure picked everyone up and carried them through the air Hotel employees that were protected by the beams were ordered to evacuate while firefighters remained to attempt to dig out those covered by debris After the collapse of the North Tower additional debris caused those stuck under the debris to be crushed and killed including two hotel employees; Joseph John Keller and Abdu Ali Malahi Additionally at least 41 firefighters who had been attempting to clear the hotel and 11 of the 940 registered guests were killed [67]\n\n\nSurrounding area\nAfter both towers had been struck, the order to evacuate the North Tower quickly spread to encompass not only the entire World Trade Center complex, but most high rise buildings in Lower Manhattan and surrounding areas as well The evacuation of employees from the North and South towers continued past the plaza and through the concourse Evacuees from the North Tower were directed through the underground shopping mall, from where they exited the complex onto Church Street Evacuees from the South Tower were directed elsewhere to prevent congestion; they were sent across the covered footbridge over West Street to the World Financial Center or to 4 World Trade Center and out onto Liberty Street [citation needed] Not all of the evacuees were connected to World Trade Centers, with students from Stuyvesant High School, the Borough of Manhattan Community College, tourists, residents of the area with their pets and others, also involved in the evacuation process [69]\n\n\nDisabled individuals\nOn the day of the attacks there were a number of disabled individuals in the World Trade Center; there was a revised evacuation plan in place after the 1993 attack as many had been told to wait for rescuers and some waited up to nine hours [72] [73] Some like John Abruzzo, a quadriplegic, and Tina Hansen were able to evacuate, as Abruzzo was carried by coworkers from the 69th floor down in an evacuation chair and indicated that it took them about ninety minutes to reach ground level The chairs were some of the about 125 that were purchased after the 1993 bombing, however there was varying levels of training and communication about them [74] Others such as Michael Hingson, who was born blind, were able to evacuate from the 78th floor of the North Tower with the help of his guide dog Roselle [75]\n\n\nSurvivors\nNo one in the North Tower survived in the impact zone, above it, or immediately below it [76] The highest floor in the building that had any survivors was floor 91 Approximately 15 people in a central stairwell on floor 22 or below survived the collapse of WTC 1, escaping or being rescued from the rubble [77] [78]\n\n\nAfter collapses\nAfter the towers collapsed, only 20 individuals in or below the towers escaped from the debris, including 12 firefighters and three Port Authority police officers Only 16 individuals who were inside the collapsing North Tower survived and were rescued, and they were all trying to evacuate via stairwell B, located in the center of the building Four people who were in the concourse area between the Twin Towers survived and either saved themselves or were rescued Nobody who was in the South Tower at the time of its collapse survived [82] [83] The last survivor removed from the WTC collapse debris was found in the ruins of the North Tower 27 hours after its collapse [84]\n\n\nSurvivor advocacy\nAs of September 28, 2008, a total of over 33,000 police officers, firefighters, responders, and community members have been treated for injuries and sickness related to the 9/11 attacks in New York City, including respiratory conditions, mental health problems like PTSD and depression, gastrointestinal conditions, and at least 4,166 cases of cancer; according to one advocacy group \"more cops have died of illness linked to the attack than had perished in it\" [89] [90]\n\n\nFatalities\n2,606 people who were in the World Trade Center and on the ground perished as a result of the attacks and the subsequent collapse of the towers [6] [92] This figure consisted of 2,192 civilians (including eight EMTs and paramedics from private hospital units); 343 members of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY); and 71 law enforcement officers including 23 members of the New York City Police Department (NYPD), 37 members of the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), four members of the New York State Office of Tax Enforcement (OTE), three officers of the New York State Office of Court Administration (OCA), one fire marshal of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) who had sworn law enforcement powers (and was also among the 343 FDNY members killed), one member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), one member of the New York Fire Patrol (FPNY), and one member of the United States Secret Service (USSS) [93] [94] This total includes K-9 Sirius, a Port Authority bomb-sniffing dog [95]\n\n\nWorld Trade Center\n2,606 people who were in the World Trade Center and on the ground perished as a result of the attacks and the subsequent collapse of the towers [6] [92] This figure consisted of 2,192 civilians (including eight EMTs and paramedics from private hospital

civilians and emergency personnel lost their lives in the building that day The National Institute of Standards and Technology report estimated that between 630 and 701 of these people were WTC

number of deaths which occurred within the hotel as many who sheltered in the hotel during and after the collapse of the South Tower were protected by the reinforced beams that had been installed by the Port Authority after the 1993 bombing [66] However, the pieces of the South Tower did cause catastrophic damage to the hotel, with many claiming the hotel was cut in half by the falling debris,

Keller and Abdu Ali Malahi Additionally at least 41 firefighters who had been attempting to clear the hotel and 11 of the 940 registered guests were killed [67]\n\n\nDeaths involving elevators\nA USA Today report estimated that approximately 200 people died inside the elevators, while only 21 escaped the elevators However, it was later found that 16% of those who evacuated the South Tower used an elevator and simulations of the evacuation without elevators claim to show that the use of elevators saved about 3,000 individuals in the South Tower [135] Many elevators did not plunge when the planes crashed through, but were left stranded in the shafts, leaving their occupants to be burned alive in the fires or trapped and unable to escape before the towers collapsed With the exception of one case, when the elevators malfunctioned, safety features intended to keep people from plummeting down shafts trapped individuals inside [136] One survivor recounted having to pry open a narrow gap between the doors of the elevator to escape by utilizing the stairs [137] Similarly, a group of six found themselves trapped inside a North Tower elevator from the moment of impact until 9:30 a.m., when they managed to escape by prying open the doors and tunnelling their way through the sheetrock wall of the elevator shaft behind, still leaving them with nearly an hour to spare until the building gave way [138]\n\n\nDeaths by jumping or falling\nAs the fires raged inside the towers, some 100–200 people plummeted at speeds of 125–200 mph (201–322 km/h), [139] sufficient to cause instantaneous death upon impact, but not enough to lose consciousness during the drop [44] Most of the people who fell or jumped from the Twin Towers came from the North Tower with as few as three spotted from the South Tower [140] In spite of the extremely limited number of victims documented, a fatal accident took place when a person landed on firefighter Danny Suhr as he prepared to enter the South Tower at around 9:30 a.m., crushing his skull and killing him [c]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nContrary to some conspiracy theories about Jewish people being warned not to go to work that day, the number of Jewish people who died in the attacks is variously estimated at between 270 and 400, based on the last names of the dead [161] [d] [163]\n\n\nList of the dead\nThe following list details the number of deaths reported by companies in business premises at the World Trade Center The list includes WTC tenants (all buildings), vendors, visitors, independent emergency responders, as well as some hijacked passenger-related firms [164] This list only includes 2,117 of the victims.\n\n\nPentagon\nAt least 125 people working at the Pentagon were killed, most of whom worked for the United States Army or the United States Navy [165] Of those 125 deaths, 70 were civilians – 47 Army employees, six Army contractors, six Navy employees, three Navy contractors, seven Defense Intelligence Agency employees, and one Office of the Secretary of Defense contractor [166] – and 55 were members of the United States Armed Forces – 33 Navy sailors and 22 Army soldiers [167] Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military official killed at the Pentagon [168]\n\n\nAboard the four planes\nThe 265 fatalities (not including the 19 hijackers) aboard the four planes included: [169]\n\n\nDeaths by stabbing or slashing\nWhile almost all of the passengers and crew who perished on the flights were killed in the ensuing plane crashes, some were murdered with knives or box cutters during the hijackings It is believed that occurred at least [e] once on Flight 11 and twice on flights 175 and 93 There were no reports of hijackers being violent on Flight 77, although it was noted that they were carrying knives regardless and threatened their hostages with them [186] It is suspected that on Flight 11, passenger Daniel Lewin's throat was slit after attempting to prevent the hijacking in some way or simply as a result of the terrorists trying to intimidate the passengers into submission, [187] while Mark Rothenberg on Flight 93 may have been killed for the same reasons [188] One passenger aboard Flight 93 said a flight attendant had been killed without identifying her [189] A process of elimination determined that Rothenberg was murdered in the early stages of the hijacking On Flight 11, crew members Betty Ong [187] and Amy Sweeney [190] reported separately that several people had been attacked with knives, including a man (Lewin) who had his throat slashed Shortly after Flight 175 was commandeered by the terrorists, flight attendant Robert Fangman mentioned specifically that both pilots had been killed, adding that other crew members were non-fatally injured [191]\n\n\nForeign deaths\nExcluding the 19 perpetrators (15 of whom came from Saudi Arabia, two from the UAE, and one each from Egypt and Lebanon), at least 372 people from 102 countries besides the United States died [193] [13] [14] [15]  Below is a list of the nationalities of the foreign victims:\n\n\nAfter the attacks\nDuring the attacks and afterwards, there was a large amount of toxic dust, debris and ash that was centralized around Ground Zero and created long-term health problems Toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and mercury were in the air and the debris, and many victims and first responders did not wear respirators [244]\n\n\nForensic identification\nDue to the mass amount of debris and the scale of the towers, many of those who were killed in the attacks were not found intact It was reported that only 174 complete bodies were recovered from Ground Zero, out of the about 2,753 deceased Many fragments were found in recovered shoes or pieces of clothing or pockets made from large pieces of debris, with 19,979 fragments recovered from Ground Zero [255]\n\n\nIdentification\nAs of September 11, 2012 [update], a total of 2,753 death certificates had been filed relating to the attacks [262] Of these, 1,588 (58%) were forensically identified from recovered physical remains [263] [264]\n\n\n2010s\nAs of September 11, 2012 [update], a total of 2,753 death certificates had been filed relating to the attacks [262] Of these, 1,588 (58%) were forensically identified from recovered physical remains [263] [264]\n\n\n2020s\nIn 2021, four days before the 20th anniversary of the attacks, the New York City Medical Examiner's Office announced that the identification of the 1,646th and 1,647th persons: Dorothy Morgan of Hempstead, Long Island, and an unnamed man whose identity was withheld at the request of his family [115]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to Victims of the September 11 attacks at

designed for complete evacuation during a crisis, even after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing It was also procedural for announcements in the case of high-rise fire safety for individuals to remain in their offices unless they were near the burning floor [25] However, after it took ten hours to completely evacuate the towers in the 1993 attack, multiple additions were made to the buildings and evacuation plans Radio repeaters were installed in the towers to improve communication, battery powered emergency lights were installed, and fire drills held Individuals who evacuated for both the 1993 and 2001 attacks reportedly stated they were better prepared for the 2001 evacuations [26] At least two individuals who had evacuated in both 1993 and 2001 later reported that they had prepared for a potential evacuation after 1993, by bringing either an item such as a flashlight or an emergency preparedness bag with them [27]\n\n\nNorth Tower\nThe exact number of civilians and emergency workers killed in the North Tower is not conclusively known, but an estimated total of 1,600 is the consensus Between 1,344 [107] and 1,426 [108] of these individuals were above the 91st floor when Flight 11 crashed between floors 93 and 99 at 8:46 a.m Hundreds in the path of the impact or the ensuing flash fire were killed instantly Some were fatally burned hundreds of feet below as the elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel down as far as the lobby, where it exploded [109]: 73  More than 800 people were believed to have survived the initial crash but were trapped; [110] the centralized impact into the tower immediately severed all elevator shafts in the central core from the 50th floor upward, [111]: 74  while all three stairwells in the impact zone were impassable 70 people on floor 92, the first floor below the impact zone, were also trapped because the stairwells were destroyed or blocked by debris [112] Those trapped died from smoke inhalation, the fire, jumping or falling from the building, or were killed in the eventual collapse [44] Although a few people would subsequently be found alive in the rubble following the collapse of the towers, none of these individuals were from the trapped floors [113]  Twenty-four people were still officially listed as missing in 2006 [114] and as of September 2021, the remains of 1,106 victims of the attacks have yet to be identified [115]\n\n\nSouth Tower\nThe precise total of people killed in the South Tower has also never been verified, but it is believed that around a thousand civilians and emergency personnel lost their lives in the building that day The National Institute of Standards and Technology report estimated that between 630 and 701 of these people were WTC employees, [123]: 238  all but 11 from floors trapped by the impact Had the South Tower been struck first, Flight 175's hijacking would have been the deadliest suicide attack of the day, as more than 3,500 people were present in Floor 77 or higher at 08:46 [124]: 92  The 17 minute gap between the two impacts meant this figure had reduced substantially by 09:03 [125]: 96  More than 300 people were killed instantly by the crash, [110] two-thirds of whom came from the 78th floor sky lobby [126] [127] [128] [129] Those who remained were not completely trapped, but almost all still perished The causes of death in the South Tower were identical to those in the North Tower, but in much lower numbers The actions taken by trapped workers suggest that conditions were comparably more tenable in the South Tower than its twin; hundreds of people fell or jumped to their deaths from the North Tower, but almost no one did from the South [130]: 86  A total of 18 people from the impact zone escaped the South Tower using Stairwell A, the one stairway left mostly intact and negotiable from top to bottom when the tower was struck There may have been others from the trapped floors who found Stairwell A but were caught in the collapse before they could escape [131]: 239  [81] The relatively few employees killed below the 77th floor is something the 9/11 Commission noted as being a strong indication that evacuation below the impact zones was a success, allowing most to safely evacuate before the collapse of the World Trade Center [113]\n\n\nPentagon\nAt least 125 people working at the Pentagon were killed, most of whom worked for the United States Army or the United States Navy [165] Of those 125 deaths, 70 were civilians – 47 Army employees, six Army contractors, six Navy employees, three Navy contractors, seven Defense Intelligence Agency employees, and one Office of the Secretary of Defense contractor [166] – and 55 were members of the United States Armed Forces – 33 Navy sailors and 22 Army soldiers [167] Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military official killed at the Pentagon [168]\n\n\nWorld Trade Center Hotel\nThere is no precise number of deaths which occurred within the hotel as many who sheltered in the hotel during and after the collapse of the South Tower were protected by the reinforced beams that had been installed by the Port Authority after the 1993 bombing [66] However, the pieces of the South Tower did cause catastrophic damage to the hotel, with many claiming the hotel was cut in half by the falling debris, with survivors stating the pressure picked everyone up and carried them through the air Hotel employees that were protected by the beams were ordered to evacuate while firefighters remained to attempt to dig out those covered by debris After the collapse of the North Tower additional debris caused those stuck under the debris to be crushed and killed including two hotel employees; Joseph John Keller and Abdu Ali Malahi Additionally at least 41 firefighters who had been attempting to clear the hotel and 11 of the 940 registered guests were killed [67]\n\n\nSurrounding area\nAfter both towers had been struck, the order to evacuate the North Tower quickly spread to encompass not only the entire World Trade Center complex, but most high rise buildings in Lower Manhattan and surrounding areas as well The evacuation of employees from the North and South towers continued past the plaza and through the concourse Evacuees from the North Tower were directed through the underground shopping mall, from where they exited the complex onto Church Street Evacuees from the South Tower were directed elsewhere to prevent congestion; they were sent across the covered footbridge over West Street to the World Financial Center or to 4 World Trade Center and out onto Liberty Street [citation needed] Not all of the evacuees were connected to World Trade Centers, with students from Stuyvesant High School, the Borough of Manhattan Community College, tourists, residents of the area with their pets and others, also involved in the evacuation process [69]\n\n\nDisabled individuals\nOn the day of the attacks there were a number of disabled individuals in the World Trade Center; there was a revised evacuation plan in place after the 1993 attack as many had been told to wait for rescuers and some waited up to nine hours [72] [73] Some like John Abruzzo, a quadriplegic, and Tina Hansen were able to evacuate, as Abruzzo was carried by coworkers from the 69th floor down in an evacuation chair and indicated that it took them about ninety minutes to reach ground level The chairs were some of the about 125 that were purchased after the 1993 bombing, however there was varying levels of training and communication about them [74] Others such as Michael Hingson, who was born blind, were able to evacuate from the 78th floor of the North Tower with the help of his guide dog Roselle [75]\n\n\nSurvivors\nNo one in the North Tower survived in the impact zone, above it, or immediately below it [76] The highest floor in the building that had any survivors was floor 91 Approximately 15 people in a central stairwell on floor 22 or below survived the collapse of WTC 1, escaping or being rescued from the rubble [77] [78]\n\n\nAfter collapses\nAfter the towers collapsed, only 20 individuals in or below the towers escaped from the debris, including 12 firefighters and three Port Authority police officers Only 16 individuals who were inside the collapsing North Tower survived and were rescued, and they were all trying to evacuate via stairwell B, located in the center of the building Four people who were in the concourse area between the Twin Towers survived and either saved themselves or were rescued Nobody who was in the South Tower at the time of its collapse survived [82] [83] The last survivor removed from the WTC collapse debris was found in the ruins of the North Tower 27 hours after its collapse [84]\n\n\nSurvivor advocacy\nAs of September 28, 2008, a total of over 33,000 police officers, firefighters, responders, and community members have been treated for injuries and sickness related to the 9/11 attacks in New York City, including respiratory conditions, mental health problems like PTSD and depression, gastrointestinal conditions, and at least 4,166 cases of cancer; according to one advocacy group \"more cops have died of illness linked to the attack than had perished in it\" [89] [90]\n\n\nFatalities\n2,606 people who were in the World Trade Center and on the ground perished as a result of the attacks and the subsequent collapse of the towers [6] [92] This figure consisted of 2,192 civilians (including eight EMTs and paramedics from private hospital units); 343 members of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY); and 71 law enforcement officers including 23 members of the New York City Police Department (NYPD), 37 members of the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), four members of the New York State Office of Tax Enforcement (OTE), three officers of the New York State Office of Court Administration (OCA), one fire marshal of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) who had sworn law enforcement powers (and was also among the 343 FDNY members killed), one member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), one member of the New York Fire Patrol (FPNY), and one member of the United States Secret Service (USSS) [93] [94] This total includes K-9 Sirius, a Port Authority bomb-sniffing dog [95]\n\n\nWorld Trade Center\n2,606 people who were in the World Trade Center and on the ground perished as a result of the attacks and the subsequent collapse of the towers [6] [92] This figure consisted of 2,192 civilians (including eight EMTs and paramedics from private hospital units); 343 members of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY); and 71 law enforcement officers including 23 members of the New York City Police Department (NYPD), 37 members of the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), four members of the New York State Office of Tax Enforcement (OTE), three officers of the New York State Office of Court Administration (OCA), one fire marshal of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) who had sworn law enforcement powers (and was also among the 343 FDNY members killed), one member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), one member of the New York Fire Patrol (FPNY), and one member of the United States Secret Service (USSS) [93] [94] This total includes K-9 Sirius, a Port Authority bomb-sniffing dog [95]\n\n\nNorth Tower\nThe exact number of civilians and emergency workers killed in the North Tower is not conclusively known, but an estimated total of 1,600 is the consensus Between 1,344 [107] and 1,426 [108] of these individuals were above the 91st floor when Flight 11 crashed between floors 93 and 99 at 8:46 a.m Hundreds in the path of the impact or the

in 2006 [114] and as of September 2021, the remains of 1,106 victims of the attacks have yet to be identified [115]\n\n\nSouth Tower\nThe precise total of people killed in the South Tower has also never been verified, but it is believed that around a thousand civilians and emergency personnel lost their lives in the building that day The National Institute of Standards and Technology report estimated that between 630 and 701 of these people were WTC employees, [123]: 238  all but 11 from floors trapped by the impact Had the South Tower been struck first, Flight 175's hijacking would have

something the 9/11 Commission noted as being a strong indication that evacuation below the impact zones was a success, allowing most to safely evacuate before the collapse of the World Trade Center [113]\n\n\nWorld Trade Center Hotel\nThere is no precise number of deaths which occurred within the hotel as many who sheltered in the hotel during and after the collapse of the South Tower were protected by the reinforced beams that had been installed by the Port Authority after the 1993 bombing [66] However, the pieces of the South Tower did cause catastrophic damage to the hotel, with many claiming the hotel was cut in half by the falling debris, with survivors stating the pressure picked everyone up and carried them through the air Hotel employees that were protected by the beams were

and killed including two hotel employees; Joseph John Keller and Abdu Ali Malahi Additionally at least 41 firefighters who had been attempting to clear the hotel and 11 of the 940 registered guests were killed [67]\n\n\nDeaths involving elevators\nA USA Today report estimated that approximately 200 people died inside the elevators, while only 21 escaped the elevators However, it was later found that 16% of those who evacuated the South Tower used an elevator and simulations of the evacuation without elevators claim to show that the use of elevators saved about 3,000 individuals in the South Tower [135] Many elevators did not plunge when the planes crashed through, but were left stranded in the shafts, leaving their occupants to be burned alive in the fires or trapped and unable to escape before the towers collapsed With the exception of one case, when the elevators malfunctioned, safety features intended to keep people from plummeting down shafts trapped individuals inside [136] One survivor recounted having to pry open a narrow gap between the doors of the elevator to escape by utilizing the stairs [137] Similarly, a group of six found themselves trapped inside a North Tower elevator from the moment of impact until 9:30 a.m., when they managed to escape by prying open the doors and tunnelling their way through the sheetrock wall of the elevator shaft behind, still leaving them with nearly an hour to spare until the building gave way [138]\n\n\nDeaths by jumping or falling\nAs the fires raged inside the towers, some 100–200 people plummeted at speeds of 125–200 mph (201–322 km/h), [139] sufficient to cause instantaneous death upon impact, but not enough to lose consciousness during the drop [44] Most of the people who fell or jumped from the Twin Towers came from the North Tower with as few as three spotted from the South Tower [140] In spite of the extremely limited number of victims documented, a fatal accident took place when a person landed on firefighter Danny Suhr as he prepared to enter the South Tower at around 9:30 a.m., crushing his skull and killing him [c]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nContrary to some conspiracy theories about Jewish people being warned not to go to work that day, the number of Jewish people who died in the attacks is variously estimated at between 270 and 400, based on the last names of the dead [161] [d] [163]\n\n\nList of the dead\nThe following list details the number of deaths reported by companies in business premises at the World Trade Center The list includes WTC tenants (all buildings), vendors, visitors, independent emergency responders, as well as some hijacked passenger-related firms [164] This list only includes 2,117 of the victims.\n\n\nPentagon\nAt least 125 people working at the Pentagon were killed, most of whom worked for the United States Army or the United States Navy [165] Of those 125 deaths, 70 were civilians – 47 Army employees, six Army contractors, six Navy employees, three Navy contractors, seven Defense Intelligence Agency employees, and one Office of the Secretary of Defense contractor [166] – and 55 were members of the United States Armed Forces – 33 Navy sailors and 22 Army soldiers [167] Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military official killed at the Pentagon [168]\n\n\nAboard the four planes\nThe 265 fatalities (not including the 19 hijackers) aboard the four planes included: [169]\n\n\nDeaths by stabbing or slashing\nWhile almost all of the passengers and crew who perished on the flights were killed in the ensuing plane crashes, some were murdered with knives or box cutters during the hijackings It is believed that occurred at least [e] once on Flight 11 and twice on flights 175 and 93 There were no reports of hijackers being violent on Flight 77, although it was noted that they were carrying knives regardless and threatened their hostages with them [186] It is suspected that on Flight 11, passenger Daniel Lewin's throat was slit after attempting to prevent the hijacking in some way or simply as a result of the terrorists trying to intimidate the passengers into submission, [187] while Mark Rothenberg on Flight 93 may have been killed for the same reasons [188] One passenger aboard Flight 93 said a flight attendant had been killed without identifying her [189] A process of elimination determined that Rothenberg was murdered in the early stages of the hijacking On Flight 11, crew members Betty Ong [187] and Amy Sweeney [190] reported separately that several people had been attacked with knives, including a man (Lewin) who had his throat slashed Shortly after Flight 175 was commandeered by the terrorists, flight attendant Robert Fangman mentioned specifically that both pilots had been killed, adding that other crew members were non-fatally injured [191]\n\n\nForeign deaths\nExcluding the 19 perpetrators (15 of whom came from Saudi Arabia, two from the UAE, and one each from Egypt and Lebanon), at least 372 people from 102 countries besides the United States died [193] [13] [14] [15]  Below is a list of the nationalities of the foreign victims:\n\n\nAfter the attacks\nDuring the attacks and afterwards, there was a large amount of toxic dust, debris and ash that was centralized around Ground Zero and created long-term health problems Toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and mercury were in the air and the debris, and many victims and first responders did not wear respirators [244]\n\n\nForensic identification\nDue to the mass amount of debris and the scale of the towers, many of those who were killed in the attacks were not found intact It was reported that only 174 complete bodies were recovered from Ground Zero, out of the about 2,753 deceased Many fragments were found in recovered shoes or pieces of clothing or pockets made from large pieces of debris, with 19,979 fragments recovered from Ground Zero [255]\n\n\nIdentification\nAs of September 11, 2012 [update], a total of 2,753 death certificates had been filed relating to the attacks [262] Of these, 1,588 (58%) were forensically identified from recovered physical remains [263] [264]\n\n\n2010s\nAs of September 11, 2012 [update], a total of 2,753 death certificates had been filed relating to the attacks [262] Of these, 1,588 (58%) were forensically identified from recovered physical remains [263] [264]\n\n\n2020s\nIn 2021, four days before the 20th anniversary of the attacks, the New York City Medical Examiner's Office announced that the identification of the 1,646th and 1,647th persons: Dorothy Morgan of Hempstead, Long Island, and an unnamed man whose identity was withheld at the request of his family [115]\n\n\nSee also\n

The active region continued to be active, producing an X2.25- and X1.12-class flare each associated with a full-halo CME on 9 May. On 10 May, the region produced an X3.98-class flare, and on 11 May at 01:23 UTC it produced another X-class flare of magnitude 5.4–5.7 with another asymmetrical full-halo CME. The region also caused an S1 solar radiation storm with spikes reaching S2.\n\nOn 14 May, as the most active region 3664 rotated beyond the Sun's western limb, the strongest flare occurred, an X8.7, causing level R3 (strong) radio blackouts.\n\n**Geomagnetic Storm**\n\nAs a result of the interplanetary magnetic field reaching a magnitude of 73 nanotesla (nT), with the component along Earth's magnetic axis oriented south reaching as much as −50 nT, the moderately high solar wind density, and the solar wind speed reaching 750–950 km/s (470–590 mi/s) between 11 and 12 May (UTC time), the event was classified as a G5-class geomagnetic storm (Kp = 9), making it the most intense storm since the 2003 Halloween solar storms. Several other CMEs were expected to reach Earth on 11 and 12 May.\n\nThe G5-class geomagnetic storm caused the Earth's magnetic field to be severely weakened, leading to a negative Dst index of -270 nT. This was the strongest Dst index recorded since the 2003 Halloween solar storms.\n\n**Comparison to Other Geomagnetic Storms**\n\nThe disturbance storm time index (Dst index) is a measure in the context of space weather. A negative Dst index means that Earth's magnetic field is weakened. This is particularly the case during solar storms, with a higher negative Dst index indicating a stronger solar storm.\n\nThe Dst index is a useful indicator of the severity of a geomagnetic storm. A higher negative Dst index indicates a more severe storm. The Dst index has been used to study the effects of geomagnetic storms on Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere.\n\n**Aurora Sightings**\n\nThree CMEs from 8 May reached Earth on 10 May 2024, causing severe to extreme geomagnetic storms with bright and very long-lasting aurorae. The aurorae were visible in many regions around the world, and far from the magnetic poles.\n\nThe aurorae were caused by the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind carried charged particles from the Sun, which interacted with Earth's magnetic field, causing it to vibrate and produce light. The light was visible as aurorae in the polar regions.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe storm negatively affected ground-based broadcasting and two-way radio communications, especially on the HF band and to a lesser extent the VHF and UHF bands, because it increased the density of the D layer of the ionosphere, causing absorption and thus interfering with propagation.\n\nThe storm also caused power grid fluctuations and communication disruptions. The increased radiation from the solar storm interacted with the Earth's magnetic field, causing electrical currents to flow through the power grid. This led to power grid fluctuations and communication disruptions.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nAuroras were visible in many regions around the world, and far from the magnetic poles. These figures demonstrate the spread of the aurorae on the night of 10 and 11 May. Captions indicate geographic latitude (GLAT) first, and magnetic latitude (MLAT) second, using the quasi-dipole latitude of IGRF-13 model.\n\n[Figure 1: Aurora over Europe, GLAT = 55.6° N, MLAT = 64.2° N]\n\n[Figure 2: Aurora over Asia, GLAT = 35.0° N, MLAT = 44.1° N]\n\n[Figure 3: Aurora over North America, GLAT = 45.0° N, MLAT = 54.1° N]\n\n[Figure 4: Aurora over South America, GLAT = 20.0° S, MLAT = 29.1° S]\n\n[Figure 5: Aurora over Africa, GLAT = 10.0° S, MLAT = 19.1° S]\n\n[Figure 6: Aurora over Australia, GLAT = 25.0° S, MLAT = 34.1° S]\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe May 2024 solar storms were a significant event in the field of space weather. The storms caused disruptions to Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, and had a significant impact on ground-based broadcasting and two-way radio communications.\n\nThe storms also caused aurorae to be visible in many regions around the world, and far from the magnetic poles. The aurorae were caused by the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.\n\nThe May 2024 solar storms are an important reminder of the impact that space weather can have on our daily lives.

she was publicly flogged in Ghazi Stadium, receiving 100 lashes [42] Female employment was restricted to the medical sector, where male medical personnel were prohibited from treating women and girls [40] This extensive ban on the employment of women further resulted in the widespread closure of primary schools, as almost all teachers prior to the Taliban's rise had been women, further restricting access to education not only to girls but also to boys Restrictions became especially severe after the Taliban took control of the capital In February 1998, for instance, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations ordering people to blacken their windows so that women would not be visible from outside [43]\n\n\nRole of women in the Emirate\nDuring the Taliban's period of rule, brutal repression of women was widespread in the Emirate [37] [38] Abuses were frequently and violently enforced by the religious police [39] For example, the Taliban issued edicts forbidding women from being educated, forcing girls to leave schools and colleges [40] [41] Women leaving their houses were required to be accompanied by a male relative and were obligated to wear the burqa, a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small slit out of which to see [40] [41] Those accused of disobeying were publicly beaten In one instance, a young woman named Sohaila was charged with adultery after walking with a man who was not a relative; she was publicly flogged in Ghazi Stadium, receiving 100 lashes [42] Female employment was restricted to the medical sector, where male medical personnel were prohibited from treating women and girls [40] This extensive ban on the employment of women further resulted in the widespread closure of primary schools, as almost all teachers prior to the Taliban's rise had been women, further restricting access to education not only to girls but also to boys Restrictions became especially severe after the Taliban took control of the capital In February 1998, for instance, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations ordering people to blacken their windows so that women would not be visible from outside [43]\n\n\nBan on entertainment and recreational activities\nDuring the Taliban rule of 1996–2001, they banned many recreational activities and games, such as football, kite flying, and chess General entertainment such as televisions, cinemas, music with instrumental accompaniments, VCRs and satellite dishes were also banned [44] Also included in the list of banned items were \"musical instruments and accessories\" and all visual representation of living creatures [45]\n\n\nInternational relations\nRegarding its relations with the rest of the world, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan held a policy of isolationism: \"The Taliban believe in non-interference in the affairs of other countries and similarly desire no outside interference in their country's internal affairs\" [17] Despite these isolationist policies, the Taliban entered in a deal for oil, electricity, and gas with Turkmenistan as part of the Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India Pipeline [48]\n\n\nDiplomatic recognition\nBetween 1996 and 2001, only three widely recognized countries; Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) declared the Islamic Emirate to be the rightful government of Afghanistan [53] The Islamic Emirate would also receive recognition from the partially recognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria; [54] though Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov would later describe the Islamic Emirate as an \"illegitimate\" government [55] The Taliban government additionally received support from Turkmenistan, though the country did not provide the Emirate with formal recognition [49] [48]\n\n\nSanctions\nOn 15 October 1999, the UN Security Council established a sanctions regime to cover individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and/or the Taliban [56] Since the US Invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the sanctions were applied to individuals and organizations in all parts of the world; also targeting former members of the Taliban government.\n\n\nBamiyan Buddhas controversy\nThe Buddhas of Bamiyan were two 6th-century [58] monumental statues carved into the side of a cliff in the Bamyan valley of central Afghanistan that were destroyed in March 2001, [59] after the Taliban government declared that they were idols [60] International and local opinion strongly condemned the destruction of the Buddhas [58]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Taliban maintained 400 Soviet-built T-54/T-55 and T-62 tanks and more than 200 armored personnel carriers [67] The Taliban began training its own army and commanders; some were even trained by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence [68]\nIslamabad continued to support the Taliban, as Pakistani allies, in their push to conquer Afghanistan in the 1990s [69] The Islamic Army used child soldiers, many of them under 14 years old [70]\n\n\nConscription\nAccording to the testimony of Guantanamo captives before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its civil service – both done at gunpoint [73] [74] [75]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the Taliban occupation But the Afghani soon fell in value [77] The Taliban imposed a 50% tax on any company operating in the country, and those who failed to pay were attacked [78] They also imposed a 6% import tax on anything brought into the country, [79] and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade [80] By 2001, the per-capita income of the 25 million population was under $200, [81] and the country was close to total economic collapse [38] As of 2007, the economy had begun to recover, with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13% increase in economic growth [82]\n\n\nSee also\n34°00′N 65°48′E﻿ / ﻿34.0°N 65.8°E﻿ / 34.0;

Overwhelmingly ethnic Pashtuns, the Taliban blended Pashtunwali tribal code with elements of Salafist teaching to form an anti-Western and anti-modern Islamist ideology with which it ruled. It began to receive support from neighboring Pakistan as well as from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nA small Taliban militia first emerged near Kandahar in the spring and summer of 1994, committing vigilante acts against minor warlords, with a fund of 250,000 USD from local businessmen. They soon began to receive backing from local Durrani Pashtun leaders.\n\n## Early History and Ethnic Conflict\n\nThe Taliban and its rule arose from the chaos after the Soviet-Afghan War.

By the end of 2000, the Taliban controlled 90% of the country, aside from the opposition (Northern Alliance) strongholds found primarily in the northeast corner of Badakhshan Province. Areas under the Taliban's direct control were mainly Afghanistan's major cities and highways. Tribal khans and warlords had de facto direct control over various small towns, villages, and rural areas.\n\nThe Taliban sought to establish law and order and to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law, along with the religious edicts of Mullah Mohammed Omar, upon the entire country of Afghanistan.\n\n## Fall and Legacy\n\nThe rule of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan came to an end in 2001 following the United States invasion. In May and June 2003, senior Taliban officials proclaimed the Taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel US forces from Afghanistan. In late 2004, the then-hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against \"America and its puppets\" (i.e., transitional Afghan government forces) to \"regain the sovereignty of our country.\" Following a long insurgency, the Taliban once again took control of Afghanistan in 2021.\n\n## Government\n\nThe goal of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan during the period 1996 to 2001 was to return the order of Abdur Rahman (the Iron Emir) by the re-establishment of a state with Pashtun dominance within the northern areas. The Taliban sought to establish an Islamic government through law and order alongside a strict interpretation of Islamic law, in accordance with the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence and the religious guidance of Mullah Omar, upon the entire land of Afghanistan. By 1998, the Taliban controlled 90% of Afghanistan under their interpretation of Sharia.\n\n## Human Rights in the Emirate\n\nDuring the Taliban's period of rule, brutal rep", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan_(1996–2001)\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe Taliban and its rule arose from the chaos after the Soviet–Afghan War It began as an Islamic and Pashtun politico-religious movement composed of madrasa students in southern Afghanistan Overwhelmingly ethnic Pashtuns, the Taliban blended Pashtunwali tribal code with elements of Salafist teaching to form an anti-Western and anti-modern Islamist ideology with which it ruled [7] It began to receive support from neighboring Pakistan as well as from Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates A small Taliban militia first emerged near Kandahar in the spring and summer of 1994, committing vigilante acts against minor warlords, with a fund of 250,000 USD from local businessmen [8] They soon began to receive backing from local Durrani Pashtun leaders [9]\n\n\nEarly history and ethnic conflict\nThe Taliban and its rule arose from the chaos after the Soviet–Afghan War It began as an Islamic and Pashtun politico-religious movement composed of madrasa students in southern Afghanistan Overwhelmingly ethnic Pashtuns, the Taliban blended Pashtunwali tribal code with elements of Salafist teaching to form an anti-Western and anti-modern Islamist ideology with which it ruled [7] It began to receive support from neighboring Pakistan as well as from Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates A small Taliban militia first emerged near Kandahar in the spring and summer of 1994, committing vigilante acts against minor warlords, with a fund of 250,000 USD from local businessmen [8] They soon began to receive backing from local Durrani Pashtun leaders [9]\n\n\nRise to power and rule\nSpreading from Kandahar, the Taliban eventually captured Kabul in 1996 By the end of 2000, the Taliban controlled 90% of the country, aside from the opposition (Northern Alliance) strongholds found primarily in the northeast corner of Badakhshan Province Areas under the Taliban's direct control were mainly Afghanistan's major cities and highways Tribal khans and warlords had de facto direct control over various small towns, villages, and rural areas [16] The Taliban sought to establish law and order and to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law, along with the religious edicts of Mullah Mohammed Omar, upon the entire country of Afghanistan [17]\n\n\nFall and legacy\nThe rule of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan came to an end in 2001 following the United States invasion In May and June 2003, senior Taliban officials proclaimed the Taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel US forces from Afghanistan [30] [31] In late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against \"America and its puppets\" (i.e transitional Afghan government forces) to \"regain the sovereignty of our country\" [32] Following a long insurgency, the Taliban once again took control of Afghanistan in 2021 [33]\n\n\nGovernment\nThe goal of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan during the period 1996 to 2001 was to return the order of Abdur Rahman (the Iron Emir) by the re-establishment of a state with Pashtun dominance within the northern areas [34] The Taliban sought to establish an Islamic government through law and order alongside a strict interpretation of Islamic law, in accordance with the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence and the religious guidance of Mullah Omar, upon the entire land of Afghanistan [35] By 1998, the Taliban controlled 90% of Afghanistan under their interpretation of Sharia [36]\n\n\nHuman rights in the Emirate\nDuring the Taliban's period of rule, brutal repression of women was widespread in the Emirate [37] [38] Abuses were frequently and violently enforced by the religious police [39] For example, the Taliban issued edicts forbidding women from being educated, forcing girls to leave schools and colleges [40] [41] Women leaving their houses were required to be accompanied by a male relative and were obligated to wear the burqa, a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small slit out of which to see [40] [41] Those accused of disobeying were publicly beaten In one instance, a young woman named Sohaila was charged with adultery after walking with a man who was not a relative; she was publicly flogged in Ghazi Stadium, receiving 100 lashes [42] Female employment was restricted to the medical sector, where male medical personnel were prohibited from treating women and girls [40] This extensive ban on the employment of women further resulted in the widespread closure of primary schools, as almost all teachers prior to the Taliban's rise had been women, further restricting access to education not only to girls but also to boys Restrictions became especially severe after the Taliban took control of the capital In February 1998, for instance, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations ordering people to blacken their windows so that women would not be visible from outside [43]\n\n\nRole of women in the Emirate\nDuring the Taliban's period of rule, brutal repression of women was widespread in the Emirate [37] [38] Abuses were frequently and violently enforced by the religious police [39] For example, the Taliban issued edicts forbidding women from being educated, forcing girls to leave schools and colleges [40] [41] Women leaving their houses were required to be accompanied by a male relative and were obligated to wear the burqa, a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small slit out of which to see [40] [41] Those accused of disobeying were publicly beaten In one instance, a young woman named Sohaila was charged with adultery after walking with a man who was not a relative;

Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) declared the Islamic Emirate to be the rightful government of Afghanistan [53] The Islamic Emirate would also receive recognition from the partially recognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria; [54] though Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov would later describe the Islamic Emirate as an \"illegitimate\" government [55] The Taliban government additionally received support from Turkmenistan, though the country did not provide the Emirate with formal recognition [49] [48]\n\n\nSanctions\nOn 15 October 1999, the UN Security Council established a sanctions regime to cover individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and/or the Taliban [56] Since the US Invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the sanctions were applied to individuals and organizations in all parts of the world; also targeting former members of the Taliban government.\n\n\nBamiyan Buddhas controversy\nThe Buddhas of Bamiyan were two 6th-century [58] monumental statues carved into the side of a cliff in the Bamyan valley of central Afghanistan that were destroyed in March 2001, [59] after the Taliban government declared that they were idols [60] International and local opinion strongly condemned the destruction of the Buddhas [58]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Taliban maintained 400 Soviet-built T-54/T-55 and T-62 tanks and more than 200 armored personnel carriers [67] The Taliban began training its own army and commanders; some were even trained by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence [68]\nIslamabad continued to support the Taliban, as Pakistani allies, in their push to conquer Afghanistan in the 1990s [69] The Islamic Army used child soldiers, many of them under 14 years old [70]\n\n\nConscription\nAccording to the testimony of Guantanamo captives before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its civil service – both done at gunpoint [73] [74] [75]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the Taliban occupation But the Afghani soon fell in value [77] The Taliban imposed a 50% tax on any company operating in the country, and those who failed to pay were attacked [78] They also imposed a 6% import tax on anything brought into the country, [79] and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade [80] By 2001, the per-capita income of the 25 million population was under $200, [81] and the country was close to total economic collapse [38] As of 2007, the economy had begun to recover, with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13% increase in economic growth [82]\n\n\nSee also\n34°00′N 65°48′E﻿ / ﻿34.0°N 65.8°E﻿ / 34.0;

[13] Allowing his concept to come into being, O'Brien states \"glam rock allowed me to be myself more\" [14]\n\n\nFilming and locations\nSet in the fictional town of Denton, the film was shot at Bray Studios and Oakley Court, a country house near Maidenhead, Berkshire, England, and at Elstree Studios [20] for post-production, [21] from 21 October to 19 December 1974 Oakley Court, built in 1857 in the Victorian Gothic style, is known for a number of Hammer films [22] [23] Much of the location shooting took place there, although at the time the manor was not in good condition [24] Most of the cast were from the original London stage production, including Tim Curry, who had decided that Dr Frank N Furter should speak like the Queen of the United Kingdom, extravagantly posh [14] Fox insisted on casting the two characters of Brad and Janet with American actors, Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon [15] Filming took place during autumn, which made conditions worse During filming, Sarandon fell ill with pneumonia [12] Filming of the laboratory scene and the title character's creation occurred on 30 October 1974 [25]\n\n\nCostumes, make-up, and props\nIn the stage productions, actors generally did their own make-up; however, for the film, the producers chose Pierre La Roche, who had previously been a make-up artist for Mick Jagger and David Bowie, to redesign the make-up for each character [27] Production stills were taken by rock photographer Mick Rock, who has published a number of books from his work [28] In Rocky Horror: From Concept to Cult, designer Sue Blane discusses the Rocky Horror costumes' influence on punk music style, opining \" [It was a] big part of the build-up  [to punk].\" She states that ripped fishnet stockings, glitter, and coloured hair were directly attributable to Rocky Horror [10]\n\n\nTitle sequence\nThe film starts with the screen fading to black and oversized, disembodied female lips appear overdubbed with a male voice, [29] [33] establishing the theme of androgyny to be repeated as the film unfolds [34] The opening scene and song, \"Science Fiction/Double Feature\", consists of the lips of Patricia Quinn (who appears in the film later as the character Magenta and as 'Trixie the Usherette' in the original London production, where she also sings the song) but has the vocals of actor and Rocky Horror creator, Richard O'Brien (who appears as Magenta's brother Riff Raff) The lyrics refer to science fiction and horror films of the past and list several film titles from the 1930s to the 1960s, including The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Flash Gordon (1936), The Invisible Man (1933), King Kong (1933), It Came from Outer Space (1953), Doctor X (1932), Forbidden Planet (1956), Tarantula (1955), The Day of the Triffids (1962), Curse of the Demon (1957), and When Worlds Collide (1951) [10]\n\n\nMusic\nThe soundtrack was released in 1975 by Ode Records and produced by English composer Richard Hartley The album peaked at No 49 on the U.S Billboard 200 in 1978 [35] It reached No 12 on the Australian albums chart [36] and No. 11 on the New Zealand albums chart [37] The album is described as the \"definitive version of the  [Rocky Horror] score\" [38]\n\n\nRelease\nThe film opened in the United Kingdom at the Rialto Theatre in London on 14 August 1975 and in the United States on 26 September at the UA Westwood in Los Angeles [39] [40] It did well at that location, but not elsewhere [41]  Before the midnight screenings' success, the film was withdrawn from its eight opening cities due to very small audiences, and its planned New York City opening on Halloween night was cancelled [42] Fox re-released the film around college campuses on a double-bill with another rock music film parody, Brian De Palma's Phantom of the Paradise (1974), but again it drew small audiences [42]\n\n\nHome media\nA Super 8 version of selected scenes of the film was made available [51] In 1983, Ode Records released The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Audience Par-Tic-I-Pation Album, recorded at the 8th Street Playhouse The recording consisted of the film's audio and the standardized call-backs from the audience [52]\n\n\nReception\nChicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that when first released, The Rocky Horror Picture Show was \"ignored by pretty much everyone, including the future fanatics who would eventually count the hundreds of times they'd seen it\" He considered it more a \"long-running social phenomenon\" than a movie, rating it 2.5 out of 4 stars and describing Curry as \"the best thing in the movie, maybe because he seems to be having the most fun\" but thinking the story would work better performed on stage for a live audience [59] Bill Henkin noted that Variety thought that the \"campy hijinks\" of the film seemed labored, and also mentioned that the San Francisco Chronicle's John Wasserman, who had liked the stage play in London, found the film \"lacking both charm and dramatic impact\" Newsweek, in 1978, called the film \"tasteless, plotless and pointless\" [60]\n\n\nCult following\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show helped shape conditions of cult film's transition from art-house to exploitation style [68] The film developed a cult following in 1976 at the Waverly Theatre in New York, which developed into a standardized ritual According to J Hoberman, author of Midnight Movies, it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be shouted by the audience Louis Farese Jr., a normally quiet teacher, upon seeing the character Janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain, yelled, \"Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch.\" Originally, Louis and other Rocky Horror pioneers, including Amy Lazarus, Theresa Krakauskas, and Bill O'Brian, did this to entertain each other, each week trying to come up with something new to make each other laugh This quickly caught on with other theatre-goers and thus began this self-proclaimed \"counter point dialogue\", which became standard practice and was repeated nearly verbatim at each screening [11] Performance groups became a staple at Rocky Horror screenings due in part to the prominent New York City fan cast [41] The New York City cast was originally run by former schoolteacher and stand-up comic Sal Piro and his friend Dori Hartley, the latter of whom portrayed Dr Frank N Furter and was one of several performers, including Will Kohler as Brad Majors, Nora Poses as Janet, and Lilias Piro as Magenta, in a flexible rotating cast [69] The performances of the audience were scripted and actively discouraged improvising, being conformist in a similar way to the repressed characters [70]\n\n\nOrigins\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show helped shape

conventions are held in varying locations, lasting days Tucson, Arizona has been host a number of times, including 1999 with \"El Fishnet Fiesta\", and \"Queens of the Desert\" held in 2006 [73] Vera Dika wrote that, to the fans, Rocky Horror is ritualistic and comparable to a religious event, with a compulsive, repeated cycle of going home and coming back to see the film each weekend [11] The audience call-backs are similar to responses in church during a mass [11] Many theatre troupes exist across the United States that produce shadow-cast performances where the actors play each part in the film in full costume, with props, as the movie plays on the big screen in a movie theatre [74] [75] O'Brien's Orchestra, formerly known as the Queerios (based in Austin, Texas), is the longest running shadow-cast in Texas [76]\n\n\nLGBT influence\nMembers of the LGBT community composed a large part of the Rocky Horror cult following: they identified with the embrace of sexual liberation and androgyny, and attended show after show, slowly forming a community Judith A Peraino compares Brad and Janet's initiation into Frank N Furter's world to the self-discovery of \"queer identity\", and to the traditional initiation of \"virgins\" in the shadow screenings [79] June Thomas describes the midnight screenings in Newark, Delaware as a \"very queer scene\", which increased visibility for the LGBTQ community: \"The folks standing in line outside the State in fishnets and makeup every Saturday night undoubtedly widened the sphere of possibilities for gender expression on Main Street.\" [80] [81]\n\n\nCultural influence\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show has been featured in a number of other feature films and television series over the years Episodes of The Simpsons, The Venture Bros., Tuca & Bertie, The Boondocks, Glee, The Drew Carey Show, That '70s Show, Deutschland 86, and American Dad! spotlight Rocky Horror, as do films such as Vice Squad (1982), Halloween II (2009), and The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) [39] The 1980 film Fame featured the audience reciting their callback lines to the screen and dancing the Time Warp, [89] the dance from the stage show and film, which has become a novelty dance at parties [90] Director Rob Zombie cited Rocky Horror as a major influence on his film House of 1000 Corpses (2003), [91] while the film's fan culture of cosplaying and audience participation during screenings laid the groundwork for the similarly influential cult following surrounding Tommy Wiseau's The Room (2003) [92] [93] Rocky Horror also inspired John McPhail's zombie musical Anna and the Apocalypse (2018) [94]\n\n\nSequel\nO'Brien drafted a sequel titled Rocky Horror Shows His Heels in 1979 This script featured the return of all of the characters from the original film, and O'Brien wished to reunite the original production team But Sharman did not wish to revisit the original concept so directly, nor did Tim Curry wish to reprise his role [citation needed]\n\n\nRemake\n\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\" aired on 26 October 2010, as part of the second season of the television series Glee—and recreated several scenes from the film, including the opening credits It featured Barry Bostwick and Meat Loaf in cameo roles [103] An EP album covering seven songs from the movie was released on 19 October 2010 [104]\n\n\nVideo game\nA video game

by Jim Sharman and written by Richard O'Brien. The film is a cult classic that has gained a significant following over the years, and its influence can be seen in many areas of popular culture.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film begins with a pair of floating disembodied lips welcoming the audience to a science fiction double feature (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature\"). Throughout the film, a criminologist from an unspecified point in the future narrates and provides commentary on the events. The story follows Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, a newlywed couple who get stranded in a castle during a rainstorm. They soon find themselves caught up in a bizarre and campy world filled with creatures, including Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a transvestite scientist who is creating a perfect man.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including Tim Curry as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Barry Bostwick as Brad Majors, and Susan Sarandon as Janet Weiss.

Before the midnight screenings' success, the film was withdrawn from its eight opening cities due to very small audiences, and its planned New York City opening on Halloween night was cancelled.\n\n## Home Media\n\nA Super 8 version of selected scenes of the film was made available. In 1983, Ode Records released The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Audience Par-Tic-I-Pation Album, recorded at the 8th Street Playhouse. The recording consisted of the film's audio and the standardized call-backs from the audience.\n\n## Reception\n\nChicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that when first released, The Rocky Horror Picture Show was \"ignored by pretty much everyone, including the future fanatics who would eventually count the hundreds of times they'd seen it\". He considered it more a \"long-running social phenomenon\" than a movie, rating it 2.5 out of 4 stars and describing Curry as \"the best thing in the movie, maybe because he seems to be having the most fun\" but thinking the story would work better performed on stage for a live audience.\n\n## Cult Following\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show helped shape conditions of cult film's transition from art-house to exploitation style. The film developed a cult following in 1976 at the Waverly Theatre in New York, which developed into a standardized ritual. According to J Hoberman, author of Midnight Movies, it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be shouted by the audience.\n\n## Legacy\n\nAnnual Rocky Horror conventions are held in varying locations, lasting days. Tucson, Arizona has been host a number of times, including 1999 with \"El Fishnet Fiesta\", and \"Queens of the Desert\" held in 2006. Vera Dika wrote that, to the fans, Rocky Horror is ritualistic and comparable to a religious event, with a compulsive, repeated cycle of going home and coming back to see the film each weekend.\n\n## LGBT Influence\n\nMembers of the LGBT community composed a large part of the Rocky Horror cult following: they identified with the embrace of sexual liberation and androgyny, and attended show after show, slowly forming a community. Judith A Peraino compares Brad and Janet's initiation into Frank N Furter's world to the self-discovery of \"queer identity\", and to the traditional initiation of \"virgins\" in the shadow screenings.\n\n## Cultural Influence\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show has been featured in a number of other feature films and television series over the years. Episodes of The Simpsons, The Venture Bros., Tuca & Bertie, The Boondocks, Glee, The Drew Carey Show, That '70s Show, Deutschland 86, and American Dad! spotlight Rocky Horror, as do films such as Vice Squad (1982), Halloween II (2009), and The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012).\n\n## Sequel\n\nO'Brien drafted a sequel titled Rocky Horror Shows His Heels in 1979. This script featured the return of all of the characters from the original film, and O'Brien wished to reunite the original production team. But Sharman did not wish to revisit the original concept so directly, nor did Tim Curry wish to reprise his role.\n\n## Remake\n\n\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\" aired on October 26, 2010, as part of the second season of the television series Glee—and recreated several scenes from the film, including the opening credits. It featured Barry Bostwick and Meat Loaf in cameo roles. An EP album covering seven songs from the movie was released on October 19, 2010.\n\n## Video Game\n\nA video game adaptation by Freakzone Games is set to be released on October 27, 2024, on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with a pair of floating disembodied lips welcoming the audience to a science fiction double feature (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature\") Throughout the film, a criminologist from an unspecified point in the future narrates and provides commentary on the events.\n\n\nCast\nJeremy Newson and Hilary Labow play Brad and Janet's newlywed friends Ralph and Betty Hapschatt The guests at both the Hapschatt wedding and Frank's convention consist of Perry Bedden, Christopher Biggins, Gaye Brown, Ishaq Bux, Stephen Calcutt, Hugh Cecil, Imogen Claire, Tony Cowan, Sadie Corré, Fran Fullenwider, Lindsay Ingram, Peggy Ledger, Annabel Leventon, Anthony Milner, Pamela Obermeyer, Tony Then, Kimi Wong, and Henry Woolf, as well as an uncredited Rufus Collins.\n\n\nProduction\nRichard O'Brien was living as an unemployed actor in London during the early 1970s He wrote most of The Rocky Horror Show during one winter just to occupy himself [10] [11] Since his youth, O'Brien had loved science fiction and B horror movies He wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, Steve Reeves muscle flicks, and fifties rock and roll into his musical [12] O'Brien conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself in British popular culture in the 1970s [13] Allowing his concept to come into being, O'Brien states \"glam rock allowed me to be myself more\" [14]\n\n\nConcept and development\nRichard O'Brien was living as an unemployed actor

conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself in British popular culture in the 1970s [13] Allowing his concept to come into being, O'Brien states \"glam rock allowed me to be myself more\" [14]\n\n\nFilming and locations\nSet in the fictional town of Denton, the film was shot at Bray Studios and Oakley Court, a country house near Maidenhead, Berkshire, England, and at Elstree Studios [20] for post-production, [21] from 21 October to 19 December 1974 Oakley Court, built in 1857 in the Victorian Gothic style, is known for a number of Hammer films [22] [23] Much of the location shooting took place there, although at the time the manor was not in good condition [24] Most of the cast were from the original London stage production, including Tim Curry, who had decided that Dr Frank N Furter should speak like the Queen of the United Kingdom, extravagantly posh [14] Fox insisted on casting the two characters of Brad and Janet with American actors, Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon [15] Filming took place during autumn, which made conditions worse During filming, Sarandon fell ill with pneumonia [12] Filming of the laboratory scene and the title character's creation occurred on 30 October 1974 [25]\n\n\nCostumes, make-up, and props\nIn the stage productions, actors generally did their own make-up; however, for the film, the producers chose Pierre La Roche, who had previously been a make-up artist for Mick Jagger and David Bowie, to redesign the make-up for each character [27] Production stills were taken by rock photographer Mick Rock, who has published a number of books from his work [28] In Rocky Horror: From Concept to Cult, designer Sue Blane discusses the Rocky Horror costumes' influence on punk music style, opining \" [It was a] big part of the build-up  [to punk].\" She states that ripped fishnet stockings, glitter, and coloured hair were directly attributable to Rocky Horror [10]\n\n\nTitle sequence\nThe film starts with the screen fading to black and oversized, disembodied female lips appear overdubbed with a male voice, [29] [33] establishing the theme of androgyny to be repeated as the film unfolds [34] The opening scene and song, \"Science Fiction/Double Feature\", consists of the lips of Patricia Quinn (who appears in the film later as the character Magenta and as 'Trixie the Usherette' in the original London production, where she also sings the song) but has the vocals of actor and Rocky Horror creator, Richard O'Brien (who appears as Magenta's brother Riff Raff) The lyrics refer to science fiction and horror films of the past and list several film titles from the 1930s to the 1960s, including The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Flash Gordon (1936), The Invisible Man (1933), King Kong (1933), It Came from Outer Space (1953), Doctor X (1932), Forbidden Planet (1956), Tarantula (1955), The Day of the Triffids (1962), Curse of the Demon (1957), and When Worlds Collide (1951) [10]\n\n\nMusic\nThe soundtrack was released in 1975 by Ode Records and produced by English composer Richard Hartley The album peaked at No 49 on the U.S Billboard 200 in 1978 [35] It reached No 12 on the Australian albums chart [36] and No. 11 on the New Zealand albums chart [37] The album is described as the \"definitive version of the  [Rocky Horror] score\" [38]\n\n\nRelease\nThe film opened in the United Kingdom at the Rialto Theatre in London on 14 August 1975 and in the United States on 26 September at the UA Westwood in Los Angeles [39] [40] It did well at that location, but not elsewhere [41]  Before the midnight screenings' success, the film was withdrawn from its eight opening cities due to very small audiences, and its planned New York City opening on Halloween night was cancelled [42] Fox re-released the film around college campuses on a double-bill with another rock music film parody, Brian De Palma's Phantom of the Paradise (1974), but again it drew small audiences [42]\n\n\nHome media\nA Super 8 version of selected scenes of the film was made available [51] In 1983, Ode Records released The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Audience Par-Tic-I-Pation Album, recorded at the 8th Street Playhouse The recording consisted of the film's audio and the standardized call-backs from the audience [52]\n\n\nReception\nChicago Sun-Times critic

having the most fun\" but thinking the story would work better performed on stage for a live audience [59] Bill Henkin noted that Variety thought that the \"campy hijinks\" of the film seemed labored, and also mentioned that the San Francisco Chronicle's John Wasserman, who had liked the stage play in London, found the film \"lacking both charm and dramatic impact\" Newsweek, in 1978, called the film \"tasteless, plotless and pointless\" [60]\n\n\nCult following\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show helped shape conditions of cult film's transition from art-house to exploitation style [68] The film developed a cult following in 1976 at the Waverly Theatre in New York, which developed into a standardized ritual According to J Hoberman, author of Midnight Movies, it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be shouted by the audience Louis Farese Jr., a normally quiet teacher, upon seeing the character Janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain, yelled, \"Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch.\" Originally, Louis and other Rocky Horror pioneers, including Amy Lazarus, Theresa Krakauskas, and Bill O'Brian, did this to entertain each other, each week trying to come up with something new to make each other laugh This quickly caught on with other theatre-goers and thus began this self-proclaimed \"counter point dialogue\", which became standard practice and was repeated nearly verbatim at each screening [11] Performance groups became a staple at Rocky Horror screenings due in part to the prominent New York City fan cast [41] The New York City cast was originally run by former schoolteacher and stand-up comic Sal Piro and his friend Dori Hartley, the latter of whom portrayed Dr Frank N Furter and was one of several performers, including Will Kohler as Brad Majors, Nora Poses as Janet, and Lilias Piro as Magenta, in a flexible rotating cast [69] The performances of the audience were scripted and actively discouraged improvising, being conformist in a similar way to the repressed characters [70]\n\n\nOrigins\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show helped shape conditions of cult film's transition from art-house to

ritualistic and comparable to a religious event, with a compulsive, repeated cycle of going home and coming back to see the film each weekend [11] The audience call-backs are similar to responses in church during a mass [11] Many theatre troupes exist across the United States that produce shadow-cast performances where the actors play each part in the film in full costume, with props, as the movie plays on the big screen in a movie theatre [74] [75] O'Brien's Orchestra, formerly known as the Queerios (based in Austin, Texas), is the longest running shadow-cast in Texas [76]\n\n\nLGBT influence\nMembers of the LGBT community composed a large part of the Rocky Horror cult following: they identified with the embrace of sexual liberation and androgyny, and attended show after show, slowly forming a community Judith A Peraino compares Brad and Janet's initiation into Frank N Furter's world to the self-discovery of \"queer identity\", and to the traditional initiation of \"virgins\" in the shadow screenings [79] June Thomas describes the midnight screenings in Newark, Delaware as a \"very queer scene\", which increased visibility for the LGBTQ community: \"The folks standing in line outside the State in fishnets and makeup every Saturday night undoubtedly widened the sphere of possibilities for gender expression on Main Street.\" [80] [81]\n\n\nCultural influence\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show has been featured in a number of other feature films and television series over the years Episodes of The Simpsons, The Venture Bros., Tuca & Bertie, The Boondocks, Glee, The Drew Carey Show, That '70s Show, Deutschland 86, and American Dad! spotlight Rocky Horror, as do films such as Vice Squad (1982), Halloween II (2009), and The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) [39] The 1980 film Fame featured the audience reciting their callback lines to the screen and dancing the Time Warp, [89] the dance from the stage show and film, which has become a novelty dance at parties [90] Director Rob Zombie cited Rocky Horror as a major influence on his film House of 1000 Corpses (2003), [91] while the film's fan culture of cosplaying and audience participation during screenings laid the groundwork for the similarly influential cult following surrounding Tommy Wiseau's The Room (2003) [92] [93] Rocky Horror also inspired John McPhail's zombie musical Anna and the Apocalypse (2018) [94]\n\n\nSequel\nO'Brien drafted a sequel titled Rocky Horror Shows His Heels in 1979 This script featured the return of all of the characters from the original

inactive since 2014, [16] the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai volcano erupted on 20 December 2021, sending particulates into the stratosphere A large plume of ash was visible from Nukuʻalofa, the capital city of Tonga, about 70 km (43 mi) from the volcano [1] [17] The Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) in Wellington, New Zealand, issued an advisory notice to airlines [18] This initial eruption ended at 02:00 on 21 December 2021 [17]\n\n\nJanuary 2022\nAs activity on the island decreased, it was declared dormant by the Tonga Geological Services on 11 January 2022 [2] [20] A large eruption commenced on 14 January 2022 at 04:20 local time (15:20 UTC, 13 January), sending clouds of ash 20 km (12 mi) into the atmosphere [21] [22] The government of Tonga issued a tsunami warning to residents, and waves of 30 cm (12 in) were observed in Nuku'alofa [21] [23] Later in the afternoon, Tongan geologists near the volcano observed explosions and a 5-kilometre-wide (3.1 mi) ash column between 17:00 and 18:30 local time [24] A much larger Plinian eruption started the following day (15 January 2022) at 17:14 local time (04:14:45 UTC, 15 January) [25] [26] The eruption column from this eruption rose 58 km (36 mi) into the mesosphere [27] [28] The VAAC again issued an advisory notice to airlines [29] Ash from the eruption made landfall on the main island of Tongatapu, blotting out the sun Loud explosions were heard 65 km (40 mi) away in Nukuʻalofa, and small stones and ash rained down from the sky [30] Many residents in Tonga were stuck in traffic whilst attempting to flee to higher ground [31]\n\n\nAcademic research\nAccording to a March 2022 paper in the journal Earthquake Research Advances (ERA), Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai's plume reached a peak height of 58 kilometres (36 mi) into the atmosphere and sustained heights greater than 30 km (19 mi) [5] The initial explosive event was possibly more powerful than the Hatepe eruption, even though Hatepe ejected over ten times the volume of material in a longer eruption [61] Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai erupted over a span of 12 hours, releasing 1.9 km3 (0.46 cu mi) of ejecta with an estimated mass of 2,900 teragrams \n\n\nClimate and atmospheric impact\nThe eruption produced a high eruption column, reaching elevations of 57 kilometres (35 mi) and thus reaching into the mesosphere; this is the highest known eruption column in history [72] The column developed multiple \"umbrella\"-like clouds, a higher one in the stratosphere and a lower at about 17 km (11 mi) elevation, [73] and generated a terrestrial gamma-ray flash [74] The column injected a large quantity of water into the stratosphere, where it disturbed the local temperature balance and caused the formation of anomalous winds [75]\n\n\nTsunami\nTsunamis are most frequently caused by earthquakes, while those caused by volcanic eruptions are rare [83] [84] Fewer than 100 volcanic tsunamis were recorded in the prior two centuries [83] According to an official at GNS Science, the suspected cause of the tsunami was an undersea eruption that destroyed part of the island on 14 January This allowed seawater to fill the volcanic vent, causing another undersea explosion the next day The explosion was so huge that it penetrated through the overlying seawater and triggered the tsunami [85]\n\n\nOceania\nAs a result of the eruption, a 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) tsunami [88] struck the Tongan capital Nukuʻalofa [20] [89] Tide gauges in the city recorded waves 1.5–2 m (4 ft 11 in – 6 ft 7 in) in height [90] Videos posted on the Internet showed a series of waves hitting the shore and homes, sweeping away debris [91] Other videos show ashfall and a cloud of ash obscuring the sun [20] According to a resident in the Tongan capital, a series of initial smaller explosions was heard It was followed by a tsunami approximately 15 minutes later The first wave was said to be the largest A long white wave was observed out at sea approaching the coast Three waves reportedly struck the coast [92] In the wake of the tsunami, King Tupou VI was evacuated from the Royal Palace and traffic jams formed as locals fled inland or to higher ground [93] Run-ups of 3–5 m (9.8–16.4 ft) were found in the capital after a survey [94]\n\n\nAsia\nIn Kominato, Amami, Kagoshima, Japan, a 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) tsunami was reported at 23:55 on 15 January JST At Tosashimizu, Kōchi, the tsunami was 0.9 m (2 ft 11 in) in height [111] [112] A tsunami measuring 0.9 m (2 ft 11 in) was also reported in Chichijima Futami [113] On the Tohoku coast, a 0.7 m (2 ft 4 in) wave struck at 00:38 local time, on 16 January 2022 In the Sendai Port, the tsunami measured 0.9 m (2 ft 11 in) at 00:08 [114] In Iwate Prefecture, a 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tsunami was recorded at 02:26 on 16 January The tallest tsunami was recorded 1.34 m (4 ft 5 in) at Amami Ōshima, Okinawa [115] Tsunami waves of less than a metre were reported along the Hokkaido Pacific coast [116] The JMA said that the tsunami struck 2.5 hours earlier than predicted [117]\nSmall tsunami waves were observed on the coast of Taiwan The heights of the tsunami were: 0.4 m (1 ft 4 in) at Houbi Lake in Pingtung County, followed by 0.38 m (1 ft 3 in).\n\n\nNorth America\nThe highest tsunami waves in the United States were 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) in Port San Luis in San Luis Obispo County (Southern California) and 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) in both Arena Cove and Crescent City (Northern California) [120] [122] Significant waves hit the Santa Cruz Harbor, [123] and its parking lot was flooded with about 0.91 m (3 ft 0 in) of water, [122] while Soquel Creek in the neighboring city of Capitola flowed backwards [124] A surfing competition was cancelled [125] Strong currents in Half Moon Bay were reported, [123] while small waves were observed at Seal Beach [126] Waves up to 0.37 m (1 ft 3 in) in height were recorded in Nikolski, Alaska [127]\n\n\nSouth America\nIn Peru, two people were killed in Lambayeque, where the tsunami measured 2 m (6 ft 7 in) [134] Waves measuring 0.68 m (2 ft 3 in) were recorded in the port of Callao, 0.72 m (2 ft 4 in) in Marcona District and 0.65 m (2 ft 2 in) in Paita [135]\n\n\nResponse\nA tsunami warning was issued on 14 January in Tonga after an eruption was observed Volcanic activity decreased following that eruption and the warning was lifted in the early morning of 15 January A 30 cm (12 in) wave was observed during the first tsunami warning [140]\n\n\n14 January\nA tsunami warning was issued on 14 January in Tonga after an eruption was observed

and a RNZAF P-3 Orion would be sent on a reconnaissance flight as soon as it was safe to do so The ash cloud was estimated at 19,000 m (62,000 ft) high, well above the Orion's service ceiling [207] The C-130H Hercules airlift is ready to serve as well [245] Following reports of no continued ashfall in Tonga, the P-3 Orion left RNZAF Base Auckland for Tonga on the morning of 17 January [246] On 18 January, as an RNZAF Lockheed C-130 Hercules was unable to land following continued ashfall in Tonga, two Royal New Zealand Navy ships set sail for Tonga HMNZS Wellington carried survey equipment and a helicopter, while HMNZS Aotearoa carried 250,000 L (55,000 imp gal; 66,000 US gal) of water and desalination equipment to produce a further 70,000 L (15,000 imp gal; 18,000 US gal) per day [247]

Tsunami**\n\nThe 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai eruption and tsunami was a series of volcanic eruptions and tsunamis that occurred on January 15, 2022, in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the island nation of Tonga. The eruption was one of the largest in the past century, with a volcanic ash cloud reaching altitudes of up to 58 kilometers (36 miles) into the atmosphere.\n\n**Volcanic Activity**\n\nThe Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai volcano had been relatively inactive since 2014. However, on December 20, 2021, a large plume of ash was visible from the capital city of Nukuʻalofa, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the volcano. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) in Wellington, New Zealand, issued an advisory notice to airlines. The initial eruption ended on December 21, 2021.\n\nThe volcano remained relatively dormant until January 14, 2022, when a large eruption commenced at 04:20 local time (15:20 UTC, January 13). The eruption sent clouds of ash 20 kilometers (12 miles) into the atmosphere, and a tsunami warning was issued to residents. Waves of 30 centimeters (12 inches) were observed in Nukuʻalofa.\n\nOn January 15, 2022, at 17:14 local time (04:14:45 UTC, January 15), a much larger Plinian eruption started, sending the eruption column from this eruption rose 58 kilometers (36 miles) into the mesosphere. The VAAC again issued an advisory notice to airlines. Ash from the eruption made landfall on the main island of Tongatapu, blotting out the sun.

stratosphere, where it disturbed the local temperature balance and caused the formation of anomalous winds [75]\n\n\nTsunami\nTsunamis are most frequently caused by earthquakes, while those caused by volcanic eruptions are rare [83] [84] Fewer than 100 volcanic tsunamis were recorded in the prior two centuries [83] According to an official at GNS Science, the suspected cause of the tsunami was an undersea eruption that destroyed part of the island on 14 January This allowed seawater to fill the volcanic vent, causing another undersea explosion the next day The explosion was so huge that it penetrated through the overlying seawater and triggered the tsunami [85]\n\n\nOceania\nAs a result of the eruption, a 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) tsunami [88] struck the Tongan capital Nukuʻalofa [20] [89]

Other videos show ashfall and a cloud of ash obscuring the sun [20] According to a resident in the Tongan capital, a series of initial smaller explosions was heard It was followed by a tsunami approximately 15 minutes later The first wave was said to be the largest A long white wave was observed out at sea approaching the coast Three waves reportedly struck the coast [92] In the wake of the tsunami, King Tupou VI was evacuated from the Royal Palace and traffic jams formed as locals fled inland or to higher ground [93] Run-ups of 3–5 m (9.8–16.4 ft) were found in the capital after a survey [94]\n\n\nAsia\nIn Kominato, Amami, Kagoshima, Japan, a 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) tsunami was reported at 23:55 on 15 January JST At Tosashimizu, Kōchi, the tsunami was 0.9 m (2 ft 11 in) in height

The festival was organized by Billy McFarland and Ja Rule, with the intention of showcasing a luxury experience for guests. However, the festival turned out to be a disaster, with attendees facing severe logistical issues, poor accommodations, and a lack of basic amenities.\n\n**Planning and Organization**\n\nThe festival was organized by Billy McFarland, a 26-year-old entrepreneur, and Ja Rule, a rapper and entrepreneur. McFarland and Ja Rule had a vision of creating a luxury music festival that would showcase high-end art, fashion, and music. They partnered with several other companies, including Magnises, a private members-only club, to create a unique experience for guests.\n\nThe festival was initially planned to take place on the island of Great Exuma, but the organizers later decided to move the festival to a private island, Norman's Cay, which was formerly owned by Carlos Lehder Rivas, a kingpin of the Medellín Cartel. However, the owners of the island had strict conditions that the organizers could not mention Pablo Escobar, the leader of the Medellín Cartel, in any marketing materials.\n\n**Festival Events and Attendee Experiences**\n\nThe festival was scheduled to take place over three days, with a lineup of artists and performers that included Blink-182, Major Lazer, and Disclosure. However, the festival was plagued by logistical issues from the start. On the first day of the festival, heavy rain soaked the open tents and mattresses that were meant to be the accommodations for guests.\n\nAttendees were left stranded on the island, with no clear instructions on how to access basic amenities such as food, water, and shelter. Many attendees were forced to wait in line for hours to get food and drinks, only to find out that there was no food available. The festival's website was also plagued by issues, with many attendees unable to access information about the festival or get help with their concerns.\n\n**Involved Parties**\n\nThe Fyre Festival was promoted on social media by several high-profile celebrities, including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and Emily Ratajkowski. However, it was later revealed that these celebrities had been paid by the festival organizers to promote the event on their social media accounts.\n\nThe festival was also promoted by Magnises, a private members-only club that had partnered with the festival organizers. However, Magnises had a reputation for being a scam, with many members reporting that they had not received the benefits that they were promised.\n\n**Celebrity and Social Media Promoters**\n\nThe Fyre Festival was promoted on Instagram by several high-profile celebrities, including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and Emily Ratajkowski. However, it was later revealed that these celebrities had been paid by the festival organizers to promote the event on their social media accounts.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) later stated that the use of the hashtag #ad was not sufficient to disclose that the posts were paid endorsements. The FTC also stated that the celebrities had a responsibility to disclose that they had been paid to promote the festival.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Fyre Festival was a disaster, with many attendees left stranded on the island with no clear instructions on how to access basic amenities. The festival's website was also plagued by issues, with many attendees unable to access information about the festival or get help with their concerns.\n\nThe festival was also plagued by logistical issues, with many attendees reporting that they had not received the accommodations or amenities that they had been promised. The festival's organizers were also accused of scamming attendees, with many reporting that they had been charged for services that they had not received.\n\n**Lawsuits**\n\nThe Fyre Festival was the subject of a $100 million lawsuit in the state of California, filed on behalf of plaintiff Daniel Jung by entertainment lawyer Mark Geragos. The lawsuit alleged fraud, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith, and negligent misrepresentation.\n\nThe lawsuit also accused the festival's organizers of scamming attendees, with many reporting that they had been charged for services that they had not received. The lawsuit also accused the festival's organizers of failing to provide basic amenities, such as food and water, to attendees.\n\n**Criminal Investigation**\n\nThe Fyre Festival was the subject of a criminal investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for mail fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud. The investigation was overseen by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nOn June 30, 2017, Billy McFarland was arrested and charged with one count of wire fraud. McFarland was later sentenced to six years in prison for his role in the Fyre Festival scandal.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nIn 2019, a crowdfunding appeal was launched to compensate the caterer who worked on the Fyre Festival, who had not been paid for her services. The appeal raised over $200,000, which was used to compensate the caterer and other vendors who had not been paid.\n\n**Films**\n\nIn 2019, two documentary films were released that covered the Fyre Festival and Billy McFarland. The films, titled \"Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened\" and \"Fyre Fraud,\" provided an inside look at the planning and execution of the festival, as well as the aftermath of the disaster.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThe Fyre Festival has been referenced in popular culture, including in the song \"Goodbye Fire Island\" by Alkaline Trio. The song was inspired by the band's involvement in the festival, which was canceled due to logistical issues.\n\n**Proposed Fyre Festival II**\n\nIn April 2023, Billy McFarland announced that he was planning to launch a new Fyre Festival, titled Fyre Festival II. The festival was scheduled to take place in the Caribbean, but the exact location and dates have not been announced.\n\nThe Fyre Festival II was met with skepticism and criticism from many, who pointed out that McFarland had not learned from his mistakes and was attempting to repeat the same errors that led to the disaster of the original festival.\n\nThe Fyre Festival was a disaster that was plagued by logistical issues, poor planning, and a lack of basic amenities. The festival was also the subject of a $100 million lawsuit and a criminal investigation, and it resulted in the imprisonment of Billy McFarland. The festival has become a cautionary tale about the dangers of chasing profits and ignoring the needs and concerns of customers.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

{"title": "Wembley_Stadium", "content": "\nStadium\nWembley was designed by architects Foster + Partners and HOK Sport (now Populous) and with engineers Mott Stadium Consortium, who were a collection of three structural engineering consultants in the form of Mott MacDonald, Sinclair Knight Merz and Aurecon The design of the building services was carried out by Mott MacDonald The construction of the stadium was managed by Australian company Multiplex and funded by Sport England, WNSL (Wembley National Stadium Limited), the Football Association, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the London Development Agency It is one of the most expensive stadia ever built at a cost of £798 million in 2007, [17] and has the largest roof-covered seating capacity in the world Nathaniel Lichfield and Partners was appointed to assist Wembley National Stadium Limited in preparing the scheme for a new stadium and to obtain planning and listed building permission for the development [18]\n\n\nConstruction\nThe initial plan for the reconstruction of Wembley Stadium was for demolition to begin before Christmas 2000, and for the new stadium to be completed some time during 2003, but this work was delayed by a succession of financial and legal difficulties In 2004, London Mayor Ken Livingstone and Brent Council also announced wider plans for the regeneration of Wembley, taking in the arena and the surrounding areas as well as the stadium, to be implemented over two or three decades Demolition officially began on 30 September 2002, with the Twin Towers being dismantled in December 2002.\n\n\nHandover and opening\nThe new stadium was completed and handed over to the FA on 9 March 2007 The official Wembley Stadium website had announced that the stadium would be open for public viewing for local residents of Brent on 3 March 2007, however this was delayed by two weeks and instead happened on 17 March [33]\n\n\nStructure\nThe pitch size, as lined for association football, is 115 yd (105 m) long by 75 yd (69 m) wide, slightly narrower than the old Wembley, as required by the UEFA stadium categories for a category four stadium, the top category.\n\n\nPitch\nThe pitch size, as lined for association football, is 115 yd (105 m) long by 75 yd (69 m) wide, slightly narrower than the old Wembley, as required by the UEFA stadium categories for a category four stadium, the top category.\n\n\nCovering\nThe stadium roof has an area of 40,000 m2 (430,000 sq ft), of which 13,722 m2 (147,700 sq ft) is movable [39] The primary reason for the sliding roof was to avoid shading the pitch, as grass demands direct sunlight to grow effectively [53] The sliding roof design minimises the shadow by having the roof pulled back on the east, west and south [54] Angus Campbell, the chief architect, also said that an aim was for the pitch to be in sunlight during matches played between 3 pm and 5 pm from the beginning of May to the end of June, when the FA and World Cups would be played However, it was mentioned during live commentary of the mid-May 2007 FA Cup Final that the pitch was in partial shade at the start at 3 pm and also during the match [55]\n\n\nLitigation\nThe Australian firm Multiplex, which was the main contractor on Wembley Stadium, made significant losses on the project [56] [57] In an attempt to recoup some of those losses, the firm initiated a number of legal cases against its sub-contractors and consultants [58] The largest of these – the largest construction claim in UK legal history – was a claim for £253 million against the structural engineering consultants Mott MacDonald [59]\n\n\nBid to buy\nIn April 2018, Shahid Khan, the owner of Fulham F.C and the Jacksonville Jaguars, put forward an offer to purchase Wembley Stadium from the FA The deal included not only the purchase of the stadium, but also providing the FA full rights to keep control of the Club Wembley business [66] On 18 July 2018, a parliamentary select committee was held to discuss the possible sale, with evidence being given by former player, Gary Neville, and Katrina Law of the Football Supporters' Federation [67] [68] The offer was withdrawn on 17 October 2018 [69]\n\n\nSport\nGiven the ownership of the stadium by the Football Association (the governing body of English football), the England national football team is a major user of Wembley In 2007, the League Cup final moved back to Wembley from Cardiff following the FA Cup final and FA Community Shield Other showpiece football matches that were previously staged at Wembley, such as the Football League promotion play-offs and the Football League Trophy final, have returned to the stadium In addition, the Conference National (now National League) play-off final is held at Wembley since 2007, and the FA Women's Cup final since 2015.\n\n\nRegular events\nWembley Stadium has a series of annual events that under normal circumstances are hosted at Wembley every year These events cover the sports of football, rugby league and American football [78]\n\n\nFootball\nThe first match at the stadium was a game played behind closed doors between Multiplex and Wembley Stadium staff [79] The first game in front of spectators was between the Geoff Thomas Foundation Charity XI and the Wembley Sponsors Allstars on 17 March 2007 The Geoff Thomas Foundation Charity XI won 2–0 (scorers Mark Bright and Simon Jordan) [80] The first official match involving professional players was England U21s vs Italy U21s on 24 March 2007, which finished 3–3 Official attendance was 56,700 (although all of the 60,000 tickets that were made available were sold in advance) [81] The first player to score in a FIFA-sanctioned match was Italian striker Giampaolo Pazzini after 28 seconds of the same game; he also scored the first hat-trick at Wembley The first English player to score in a full-scale match was David Bentley with a free kick in the same game

It is one of the most famous and iconic stadiums in the world, and has a seating capacity of over 90,000. The stadium has a rich history, dating back to the early 20th century, and has hosted numerous high-profile events, including the FA Cup Final, the League Cup Final, and international football matches.\n\nStadium\n\nWembley Stadium was designed by architects Foster + Partners, HOK Sport (now Populous), and engineers Mott Stadium Consortium, who were a collection of three structural engineering consultants in the form of Mott MacDonald, Sinclair Knight Merz, and Aurecon. The design of the building services was carried out by Mott MacDonald. The construction of the stadium was managed by Australian company Multiplex and funded by Sport England, WNSL (Wembley National Stadium Limited), the Football Association, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and the London Development Agency. It is one of the most expensive stadia ever built, with a cost of £798 million in 2007. The stadium has the largest roof-covered seating capacity in the world.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe initial plan for the reconstruction of Wembley Stadium was for demolition to begin before Christmas 2000, and for the new stadium to be completed some time during 2003. However, this work was delayed by a succession of financial and legal difficulties. In 2004, London Mayor Ken Livingstone and Brent Council also announced wider plans for the regeneration of Wembley, taking in the arena and the surrounding areas as well as the stadium, to be implemented over two or three decades. Demolition officially began on 30 September 2002, with the Twin Towers being dismantled in December 2002.\n\nHandover and Opening\n\nThe new stadium was completed and handed over to the FA on 9 March 2007. The official Wembley Stadium website had announced that the stadium would be open for public viewing for local residents of Brent on 3 March 2007, however this was delayed by two weeks and instead happened on 17 March.\n\nStructure\n\nThe pitch size, as lined for association football, is 115 yd (105 m) long by 75 yd (69 m) wide, slightly narrower than the old Wembley, as required by the UEFA stadium categories for a category four stadium, the top category.\n\nPitch\n\nThe pitch size, as lined for association football, is 115 yd (105 m) long by 75 yd (69 m) wide, slightly narrower than the old Wembley, as required by the UEFA stadium categories for a category four stadium, the top category.\n\nCovering\n\nThe stadium roof has an area of 40,000 m² (430,000 sq ft), of which 13,722 m² (147,700 sq ft) is movable. The primary reason for the sliding roof was to avoid shading the pitch, as grass demands direct sunlight to grow effectively. The sliding roof design minimises the shadow by having the roof pulled back on the east, west, and south. Angus Campbell, the chief architect, also said that an aim was for the pitch to be in sunlight during matches played between 3 pm and 5 pm from the beginning of May to the end of June, when the FA and World Cups would be played.\n\nLitigation\n\nThe Australian firm Multiplex, which was the main contractor on Wembley Stadium, made significant losses on the project. In an attempt to recoup some of those losses, the firm initiated a number of legal cases against its sub-contractors and consultants. The largest of these – the largest construction claim in UK legal history – was a claim for £253 million against the structural engineering consultants Mott MacDonald.\n\nBid to Buy\n\nIn April 2018, Shahid Khan, the owner of Fulham F.C and the Jacksonville Jaguars, put forward an offer to purchase Wembley Stadium from the FA. The deal included not only the purchase of the stadium, but also providing the FA full rights to keep control of the Club Wembley business. On 18 July 2018, a parliamentary select committee was held to discuss the possible sale, with evidence being given by former player, Gary Neville, and Katrina Law of the Football Supporters' Federation. The offer was withdrawn on 17 October 2018.\n\nSport\n\nGiven the ownership of the stadium by the Football Association (the governing body of English football), the England national football team is a major user of Wembley. In 2007, the League Cup final moved back to Wembley from Cardiff following the FA Cup final and FA Community Shield. Other showpiece football matches that were previously staged at Wembley, such as the Football League promotion play-offs and the Football League Trophy final, have returned to the stadium. In addition, the Conference National (now National League) play-off final is held at Wembley since 2007, and the FA Women's Cup final since 2015.\n\nRegular Events\n\nWembley Stadium has a series of annual events that under normal circumstances are hosted at Wembley every year. These events cover the sports of football, rugby league, and American football.\n\nFootball\n\nThe first match at the stadium was a game played behind closed doors between Multiplex and Wembley Stadium staff. The first game in front of spectators was between the Geoff Thomas Foundation Charity XI and the Wembley Sponsors Allstars on 17 March 2007. The Geoff Thomas Foundation Charity XI won 2–0 (scorers Mark Bright and Simon Jordan). The first official match involving professional players was England U21s vs Italy U21s on 24 March 2007, which finished 3–3. Official attendance was 56,700 (although all of the 60,000 tickets that were made available were sold in advance).\n\nRugby League\n\nThe Rugby league Challenge Cup Final had been played annually at the old Wembley Stadium since 1929. When Catalans Dragons played St Helens in the 2007 Challenge Cup final, they became the first non-English rugby league team to play in the final. The result saw St Helens retain the cup by a score of 30–8 before 84,241 fans. The first rugby league team to win a game at the new Wembley Stadium, were Normanton Freeston. The West Yorkshire secondary school beat Castleford High School in the Year 7 boys Carnegie Champion Schools final, which was played immediately prior to the 2007 Challenge Cup Final.\n\nRugby Union\n\nThe first top level rugby union match was a non-cap match between the Barbarians and Australia on 3 December 2008.\n\nAmerican Football\n\nWembley has had a long association with American football. A United States Football League game was staged there in 1984, and between 1986 and 1993 the old Wembley Stadium hosted eight National Football League exhibition games featuring 13 different NFL teams. Between the opening of the new Wembley Stadium in 2007 and 2019 Wembley hosted games during the NFL regular season.\n\nBoxing\n\nOn 31 May 2014, Wembley Stadium hosted its first boxing event, featuring the rematch between Carl Froch and George Groves for the WBA and IBF super-middleweight titles. The contest was held in front of a crowd of 80,000 spectators, a British post-war attendance record for a boxing event, surpassing the crowd at the City of Manchester Stadium when it hosted Ricky Hatton vs Juan Lazcano in May 2008.\n\nProfessional Wrestling\n\nOn 5 April 2023, Tony Khan, president of American professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW), announced that they would stage an event at the stadium on 27 August 2023, promoted as \"All In London at Wembley Stadium\".

{"title": "The_Sound_of_Music_(film)", "content": "\nPlot\nIn 1938 in Salzburg, at the end of the Federal State of Austria regime, Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey However, her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be the new governess to his seven children: Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife; they have scared away several governesses by playing tricks Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her.\n\n\nCast\nThe real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her daughter Rosmarie and the daughter of Werner von Trapp, during \"I Have Confidence\" [8]\n\n\nBackground\nThe Sound of Music story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband Georg in 1947 [9] Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told [9] In 1956, German producer Wolfgang Liebeneiner purchased the film rights for $9,000 (equivalent to $101,000 in 2023), hired George Hurdalek and Herbert Reinecker to write the screenplay, and Franz Grothe to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs [10] The Trapp Family was released in West Germany on October 9, 1956, and became a major success [9] Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a sequel, The Trapp Family in America, and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years [9] Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America [9]\n\n\nProduction\nIn December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical [14] Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps [15] The \"Do-Re-Mi\" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively montage showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time [15] Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"No Way to Stop It\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max [15] In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-dubbed version of the two German films Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material [16] While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director Their first choice was Robert Wise, with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story, but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, The Sand Pebbles [17] Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including Stanley Donen, Vincent J Donehue, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly [18]\n\n\nScreenplay and pre-production\nIn December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman

children growing closer over time [15] Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"No Way to Stop It\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max [15] In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-dubbed version of the two German films Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material [16] While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director Their first choice was Robert Wise, with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story, but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, The Sand Pebbles [17] Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including Stanley Donen, Vincent J Donehue, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly [18]\n\n\nCasting and rehearsals\nLehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews [30] When Wise joined the project, he made a list of his choices for the role, which included Andrews as his first choice, Grace Kelly, and Shirley Jones [31] Wise and Lehman went to Disney Studios to view footage from Mary Poppins, which was not yet released A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!\" [30] Andrews had some reservations—mainly about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version—but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in The Sound of Music and one other film for $225,000 ($2.21 million in 2023) [32] Wise had a more difficult time casting the role of the Captain Many actors were considered for the part, including Bing Crosby, Yul Brynner, Sean Connery, and Richard Burton [33] Wise had seen Christopher Plummer on Broadway and wanted him for the role, but the stage actor turned down the offer several times Wise flew to London to meet with Plummer and explained his concept of the film; the actor accepted after being assured that he could work with Lehman to improve the character [34]\n\n\nFilming and post-production\nPrincipal photography began on March 26, 1964 at 20th Century-Fox studios in Los Angeles, where scenes were filmed from Maria's bedroom and the abbey cloister and graveyard [48] The company then flew to Salzburg, where filming resumed on April 23 at Mondsee Abbey for the wedding scenes [49] From April 25 through May 22, scenes were filmed at the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, Residence Fountain, and various street locations throughout the Altstadt (Old Town) area of the city [49] Wise faced opposition from city leaders who did not want him staging scenes with swastika banners They relented after he threatened instead to include old newsreel footage featuring the banners [50] Rainy days were a constant challenge for the company, [51] so Wise arranged for scenes to be shot at St Margarethen Chapel and Dürer Studios (Reverend Mother's office) [52] From May 23 to June 7, the company worked at Schloss Leopoldskron and an adjacent property called Bertelsmann for scenes representing the lakeside terrace and gardens of the von Trapp villa [53] From June 9 to 19, scenes were shot at Frohnburg Palace, which represented the front and back façades of the villa [53] Karath could not swim and was in danger during the capsizing boat scene [54] The \"Do-Re-Mi\" picnic scene in the mountains was filmed above the town of Werfen in the Salzach River valley on June 25 and 27 [53] The opening sequence of Maria on her mountain was filmed from June 28 to July 2 at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg in Bavaria [55] [Note 2] During filming, Birch trees were added and then removed The brook that she walks through was plastic filled with water which was put there during filming [56] The final scene of the von Trapp family escaping over the mountains was filmed on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps [57]\n\n\nMusic and soundtrack album\nMost of the soundtrack to The Sound of Music was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, who also adapted the instrumental underscore passages [74] [75]  Both the lyrics and music for two new songs were written by Rodgers, as Hammerstein died in 1960 [76] The soundtrack album was released by RCA Victor in 1965 and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide [77] [78]\n\n\nRelease and reception\nWise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the film [88] After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line \"The Happiest Sound in All the World\", which would appear on promotional material and artwork [88] Kaplan also brought in outside agencies to work with the studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by Howard Terpning of Andrews on an alpine meadow with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background [89] [90] [Note 4] In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers Daily Variety, Weekly Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter to attract future exhibitor interest in the project [88] The studio intended the film to have an initial roadshow theatrical release in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound [91] The roadshow concept involved two showings a day with reserved seating and an intermission similar to Broadway musicals [91] Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities [89] During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century-Fox organized press junkets for American journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members [89]\n\n\nMarketing\nWise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the

excess of hearts and flowers, but there is no valid reason for hiding honest emotion This has always been a major element in the theatre, and it's my conviction that anyone who can't, on occasion, be sentimental about children, home or nature is sadly maladjusted [92]\n\n\nBox office\nThe Sound of Music is one of the most commercially successful films of all time [106] Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number-one box office film in the United States, [107] from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week [100] It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks, [100] and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965 [108] One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers [101] In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population [101] [Note 6] By January 1966, the film had earned $20 million in distributor rentals from just 140 roadshow engagements in the United States and Canada [109] Worldwide, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries, [110] including the United Kingdom, where it played for a record-breaking three years at the Dominion Theatre in London [111] and earned £4 million in rentals and grossed £6 million—more than twice as much as any other film had taken in [110] It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results [112] It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over $67.5 million in worldwide rentals ($125 million in gross receipts), [110] surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years [113] [Note 7] It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release [114]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute.\n\n\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\nThe Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute.\n\n\nTelevision and home media\nThe first American television broadcast of The Sound of Music was on February 29, 1976, on ABC, which paid $15 million ($84.9 million in 2023) for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films shown on television to that point [136] with a Nielsen rating of 33.6 and an audience share of 49% [137] The film was not shown again until NBC acquired the broadcast rights in June, 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years The first NBC broadcast of the film was on February 11, 1979 [138] [139] NBC continued to broadcast the film annually for twenty years [136] During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot—approximately 140 minutes without commercials, which inevitably cut around 30 minutes out of the original film [140]\n\n\nHistorical accuracy\nThe Sound of Music film adaptation, like the stage musical, presents a fictionalized story inspired by the history of the von Trapp family The musical was based on the West German film The Trapp Family (1956) rather than Maria von Trapp's 1949 memoirs, as director Vincent J Donehue had seen the film and decided that it would make a good vehicle for Mary Martin [151] The musical followed the film's plot so closely that the New York Times review of the West German film noticed that it \"strongly suggests 'The Sound of Music,' often scene by scene.\" [Note 8] [152] The West German screenwriters made several significant changes to the family's story that were kept in the musical Maria had been hired to teach just one child, but the 1956 film made her governess to all seven children [153]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe Sound of Music is set in Salzburg, yet it was largely ignored in Austria upon release The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\" [163] In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg [164] Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region [164] The Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention from foreign tourists, although residents of the city were apathetic about \"everything that is dubious about tourism.\" [165] The guides on the bus tour \"seem to have little idea of what really happened on the set.\" [166] Even the ticket agent for the Sound of Music Dinner Show tried to dissuade Austrians from attending a performance that was intended for American tourists, saying that it \"does not have anything to do with the real Austria.\" [167] By 2007, The Sound of Music was drawing 300,000 visitors a year to Salzburg, [168] more than the city's self-conception as the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart [72] [169] A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\" [170] The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater, [171] but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\" [172] However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out, [170] [171] and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Sound of Music is a 1965 American musical drama film directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. The film is based on the 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical of the same name, which was inspired by the true story of the von Trapp Family Singers.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Sound of Music is a timeless classic that has captured the hearts of audiences around the world. The film tells the story of a young nun, Maria, who becomes the governess of a large family and helps them to find their musical talents. The film features iconic songs such as \"Do-Re-Mi,\" \"My Favorite Things,\" and \"Edelweiss,\" which have become synonymous with the film.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn 1938 in Salzburg, at the end of the Federal State of Austria regime, Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey. However, her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be the new governess to his seven children: Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife; they have scared away several governesses by playing tricks. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including Julie Andrews as Maria, Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp, and an ensemble cast of children who play the von Trapp family. The real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her daughter Rosmarie and the daughter of Werner von Trapp, during \"I Have Confidence.\"\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Sound of Music story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband Georg in 1947. Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told. In 1956, German producer Wolfgang Liebeneiner purchased the film rights for $9,000 and hired George Hurdalek and Herbert Reinecker to write the screenplay, and Franz Grothe to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs.\n\n**Production**\n\nIn December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical. Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps. The screenplay was developed and refined over several months, with Lehman working closely with Zanuck and the cast.\n\n**Casting and Rehearsals**\n\nLehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews, who was still relatively unknown at the time. Wise and Lehman made a list of their choices for the role, which included Andrews as their first choice, Grace Kelly, and Shirley Jones. Wise and Lehman went to Disney Studios to view footage from Mary Poppins, which was not yet released. A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!\" Andrews had some reservations about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version, but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in The Sound of Music and one other film for $225,000.\n\n**Filming and Post-Production**\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 26, 1964, at 20th Century-Fox studios in Los Angeles, where scenes were filmed from Maria's bedroom and the abbey cloister and graveyard.

Both the lyrics and music for two new songs were written by Rodgers, as Hammerstein died in 1960.

number of tickets sold exceeded the total population [101] [Note 6] By January 1966, the film had earned $20 million in distributor rentals from just 140 roadshow engagements in the United States and Canada [109] Worldwide, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries, [110] including the United Kingdom, where it played for a record-breaking three years at the Dominion Theatre in London [111] and earned £4 million in rentals and grossed £6 million—more than twice as much as any other film had taken in [110] It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results [112] It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over $67.5 million in worldwide rentals ($125 million in gross receipts), [110] surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years [113] [Note 7] It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release [114]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute.\n\n\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\nThe Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute.\n\n\nTelevision and home media\nThe first American television broadcast of The Sound of Music was on February 29, 1976, on ABC, which paid $15 million ($84.9 million in 2023) for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films shown on television to that point [136] with a Nielsen rating of 33.6 and an audience share of 49% [137] The film was not shown again until NBC acquired the broadcast rights in June, 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years The first NBC broadcast of the film was on February 11, 1979 [138] [139] NBC continued to broadcast the film annually for twenty years [136] During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot—approximately 140 minutes without commercials, which inevitably cut around 30 minutes out of the original film [140]\n\n\nHistorical accuracy\nThe Sound of Music film adaptation, like the stage musical, presents a fictionalized story inspired by the history of the von Trapp family The musical was based on the West German film The Trapp Family (1956) rather than Maria von Trapp's 1949 memoirs, as director Vincent J Donehue had seen the film and decided that it would make a good vehicle for Mary Martin [151] The musical followed the film's plot so closely that the New York Times review of the West German film noticed that it \"strongly suggests 'The Sound of Music,' often scene by scene.\" [Note 8] [152] The West German screenwriters made several significant changes to the family's story that were kept in the musical Maria had been hired to teach just one child, but the 1956 film made her governess to all seven children [153]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe Sound of Music is set in Salzburg, yet it was largely ignored in Austria upon release The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\" [163] In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg [164] Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region [164] The Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention from foreign tourists, although residents of the city were apathetic about \"everything that is dubious about tourism.\" [165] The guides on the bus tour \"seem to have little idea of what really happened on the set.\" [166] Even the ticket agent for the Sound of Music Dinner Show tried to dissuade Austrians from attending a performance that was intended for American tourists, saying that it \"does not have anything to do with the real Austria.\" [167] By 2007, The Sound of Music was drawing 300,000 visitors a year to Salzburg, [168] more than the city's self-conception as the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart [72] [169] A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\" [170] The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater, [171] but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\" [172] However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out, [170] [171] and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The phenomenon has been observed in numerous countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and South Africa.\n\nOrigins and Criticism\n\nThe term \"Missing White Woman Syndrome\" was first coined by Gwen Ifill, an American news anchor, at the 2004 Unity: Journalists of Color journalism conference. Ifill stated that if a white woman goes missing, the media will cover the story daily, whereas if a non-white woman goes missing, the story may not receive the same level of attention. Ifill's comment highlighted the disparity in media coverage of missing persons cases based on the victim's racial and ethnic background.\n\nStudies, Reports, and Analyses\n\nNumerous studies have examined the phenomenon of Missing White Woman Syndrome. A 2003 article in the San Francisco Chronicle detailed the disparity in media coverage of the Laci Peterson and Evelyn Hernandez cases. Both women went missing in 2002, but Peterson, a white woman, received extensive media coverage, while Hernandez, a Hispanic woman, did not receive the same level of attention.\n\nIn Canada, a 2008 study found that Indigenous women who go missing receive 27 times less news coverage than white women. The study also found that the headlines, articles, and images used to report on the cases of missing Indigenous women were often dispassionate and less detailed than those used to report on the cases of missing white women.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the London Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Ian Blair, accused the media of institutional racism in its reporting of murders in 2006. Blair contrasted the reporting of the death of Tom ap Rhys Pryce, a white lawyer, with the murder of Balbir Matharu, a male Asian builder, and noted that murders in minority communities do not seem to interest the mainstream media.\n\nSouth Africa has also experienced a similar phenomenon. During the Oscar Pistorius trial, Sandile Memela, the chief director for social cohesion at the Department of Arts and Culture, noted the substantial differences in media coverage of the murders of Reeva Steenkamp and Zanele Khumalo. Steenkamp, a white model, received extensive media coverage, while Khumalo, a black model, did not receive the same level of attention.\n\nAnalogous Cases that Do Not Involve Missing Persons\n\nMissing White Woman Syndrome has also been observed in situations that do not involve missing persons. The case of Jessica Lynch, a young, blonde white woman who was injured during the Iraq War, received far more media attention than her fellow soldiers, Shoshana Johnson and Lori Piestewa. Lynch's case was often referred to as the \"blonde angel\" of the war, while Johnson and Piestewa received much less media attention.\n\nIn 2013, a four-year-old girl was found in the custody of a Roma couple in Greece and was presumed to have been abducted. The story received international media coverage, with the girl being referred to as the \"blonde angel.\" However, if the situation were reversed, and the children were brown and the parents were white, the media coverage would likely have been much less extensive.\n\nMurder Trial Defendants\n\nCritics have also cited excessive media coverage of murder trials where the defendant is female, white, young, and attractive. These cases are often referred to as the \"woman in jeopardy\" or \"damsel in distress\" genre. In such cases, the media will focus on the accused, rather than the victim, and will be more ambiguous about their guilt than in other criminal cases, regardless of the evidence.\n\nExamples of such cases include Amanda Knox, Jodi Arias, and Casey Anthony. These cases received extensive media coverage, with many outlets speculating about the guilt or innocence of the defendants, rather than focusing on the facts of the case.\n\nLaws Named After Missing White Women and Girls\n\nSeveral laws have been created in the aftermath of disappearance cases and are sometimes informally named after the missing person. These laws are often created in response to high-profile cases involving missing white women. For example, Sarah's Law, Lori's Law, Megan's Law, Jessica's Law, and Caylee's Law are all named after missing white women and girls.\n\nThese laws are often criticized for being ineffective or overly broad. For example, Megan's Law, which requires sex offenders to register with the state, has been criticized for being overly broad and for not adequately addressing the root causes of sexual violence.\n\nConclusion\n\nMissing White Woman Syndrome is a phenomenon in which cases of missing white women and girls receive disproportionately more media attention and public sympathy than cases of missing women and girls from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. The phenomenon has been observed in numerous countries and has been criticized for perpetuating racial and ethnic stereotypes.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Missing_white_woman_syndrome\" following this outline:\n\n\nOrigins and criticism\nAmerican news anchor Gwen Ifill is credited with originating the phrase at the Unity: Journalists of Color journalism conference in 2004 [7] [17] [18] At the conference, she said: \"I call it the missing white woman search syndrome If there is a missing white woman we're going to cover that every day.\" [19]\n\n\nStudies, reports and analyses\nIn 2003, the San Francisco Chronicle published an article detailing the disparity between the coverage of the Laci Peterson case, and that of Evelyn Hernandez, a Hispanic woman – both of whom disappeared in 2002 [21]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn 2003, the San Francisco Chronicle published an article detailing the disparity between the coverage of the Laci Peterson case, and that of Evelyn Hernandez, a Hispanic woman – both of whom disappeared in 2002 [21]\n\n\nCanada\nAccording to a 2008 study published in The Law and Society Association, Indigenous women who go missing in Canada receive 27 times less news coverage than white women;

The genre has its roots in Japanese art and anime, but has also been featured in Western media, including live-action films.\n\n**History**\n\nThe earliest examples of tentacle erotica were woodblock prints depicting women being violated by octopuses, such as Kitao Shigemasa's Programme of Erotic Noh Plays (1781) and Shunshō Katsukawa's Lust of Many Women on One Thousand Nights (1786). These prints were created during the Edo period in Japan and were part of a larger genre of erotic art that featured fantastical and supernatural creatures.\n\nIn the 20th century, tentacle erotica gained popularity in Japan with the rise of manga and anime. The earliest examples of tentacle erotica in manga were found in \"real life\" erotic comedy manga magazines, which predate ero-gekiga. Multiple scenes were found in the March 12, 1968 issue of Weekly Manga Q, where several creatures with tentacles attacked women. Another early example belonged to Osamu Tezuka's sci-fi story The Returnees (1973), where a scene depicts a woman being assaulted and impregnated by a space creature.\n\n## Early Anime and Manga\n\nThe earliest animated form of tentacle erotica was in the 1985 original video animation (OVA) Dream Hunter Rem, though the scene in question was excised when the OVA was re-released in a form with sexual scenes removed.

B-movie producer Roger Corman used the concept of tentacle rape in a brief scene in his 1970 film The Dunwich Horror, a film adaptation of the H P Lovecraft short story of the same name. Vice magazine identifies this as \"perhaps cinema history's first tentacle-rape scene\".\n\n## Influence and Cultural Significance\n\nTentacle erotica has had a significant influence on popular culture, particularly in Japan. The genre has been featured in numerous anime and manga series, and has also been referenced in Western media, including films and television shows. The use of tentacle rape as a plot device has been criticized for its potential to perpetuate rape culture and its impact on women's rights.\n\nHowever, proponents of the genre argue that it serves as a metaphor for the fear of being overwhelmed or consumed by external forces, and that it can be a powerful tool for exploring themes of power, control, and consent. The genre has also been praised for its ability to push boundaries and challenge societal norms.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTentacle erotica is a complex and multifaceted genre that has its roots in Japanese art and anime. While it has been criticized for its potential to perpetuate rape culture, it also serves as a powerful tool for exploring themes of power, control, and consent. As a cultural phenomenon, tentacle erotica continues to evolve and adapt, reflecting the changing values and attitudes of society.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Rape culture\n* Consent\n* Power dynamics\n* Japanese art\n* Anime\n* Manga\n* Live-action films\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This section has been intentionally left blank as the article does not include any citations or references.)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Vice magazine: \"The History of Tentacle Rape in Cinema\"\n* Anime News Network: \"Tentacle Rape in Anime\"\n* Wikipedia: \"Rape culture\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tentacle_erotica\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest examples of tentacle erotica were woodblock prints depicting women being violated by octopuses, such as Kitao Shigemasa's Programme of Erotic Noh Plays (1781) and Shunshō Katsukawa's Lust of Many Women on One Thousand Nights (1786) [1]\n\n\nCulture\nThe earliest animated form of tentacle erotica was in the 1985 original video animation (OVA) Dream Hunter Rem, though the scene in question was excised when the OVA was re-released in a form with sexual scenes removed The first purely non-erotic anime portraying a tentacle assault would be the 1986 anime OVA Guyver: Out of Control, where a female Chronos soldier named Valcuria is enshrouded by the second (damaged) Guyver unit that surrounds her in tentacle form and assaults her [citation needed]\n\n\nAnimation\nThe earliest animated form of tentacle erotica was in the 1985 original video animation (OVA) Dream Hunter Rem, though the scene in question was excised when the OVA was re-released in a form with sexual scenes removed The first purely non-erotic anime portraying a tentacle assault would be the 1986 anime OVA Guyver: Out of Control, where a female Chronos soldier named Valcuria is enshrouded by the second (damaged) Guyver unit that surrounds her in tentacle form and assaults her [citation needed]\n\n\nManga\nWhile manga has featured stories of heroes being attacked by monsters with tentacles since its early days, the earliest examples of tentacle erotica in manga belong to \"real life\" erotic comedy manga magazines, which predate ero-gekiga Multiple scenes were found in the March 12, 1968 issue of Weekly Manga Q, where several creatures with tentacles attacked women Another early example belonged to Osamu Tezuka's sci-fi story The Returnees (1973), where a scene depicts a woman being assaulted and impregnated by a space creature [5]\n\n\nLive action\nThe use of sexualized tentacles in live-action films, while much rarer, started in American B-movie horror films and has since migrated to Japan [citation needed] B-movie producer Roger Corman used the concept of tentacle rape in a brief scene in his 1970 film The Dunwich Horror, a film adaptation of the H P Lovecraft short story of the same name Vice magazine identifies this as \"perhaps cinema history's first tentacle-rape scene\" [8]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

referred to as a pop icon, [212] [213] [214] a fashion icon, [215] [216] [217] and a global icon [218] [219] [220] He is considered to be among the most successful solo artists to have emerged from a band [221] [222] Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian wrote that he is \"a star who has negotiated one of the most difficult transitions in music – from boyband to solo artist – with more panache than even successful forebears such as Justin Timberlake and Robbie Williams\" [223] Forbes noted that with his third album, Harry's House, Styles racked up a first-week vinyl sales count larger than anything any musician has managed before [224]\n\n\nLegacy\nStyles has inspired his fans to dress up for his concerts, leading Fashionista to call the shows \"his fans' Met Gala\" Outfits often

blouses, floral prints, flamboyant suits and ankle boots while in One Direction [273] [274] Nicole Saunders of Billboard noted that his fashion had \"blossomed from a teen wearing purple Jack Wills hoodies to a carefully executed blend of '70s rock with a glamorous magpie feel\" over the course of the group's five-year stint [275] Regarding Styles' time in One Direction, AllMusic writer Tim Sendra opined that his \"charming persona and elastic vocals had him positioned as the Timberlake of the group\" [276] Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt described him as \"a dimpled, rakish prankster happy to wear the mantle of Class Clown\" [277] During the band's 2014 Four era, Styles began collaborating with stylist Harry Lambert [278] In 2016, he was featured in Another Man magazine, [279] after which Anne T Donahue of The Guardian labelled him an \"artthrob\" who offers \"something other than token shirtlessness\" and telegraphs \"an allegiance to the niche worlds of art and fashion rather than aiming for mainstream notoriety\" [280] Billboard's Chris Payne opined that Styles' \"vibe has always screamed rock star\" [281]\n\n\nPersonal life\nStyles splits his time between

Corden [345] His tattoos include the Green Bay Packers logo, swallows, \"NY, LA, LDN\", a padlock tattooed on him by Ed Sheeran, \"never gonna dance again\" (lyrics from the song \"Careless Whisper\" by George Michael), Brasil!, a naked mermaid, the cover art of the album The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd, his parents' birth years and various tattoos related to family members, and a tiny cross [346] Styles has \"17 Black\" below his left clavicle after losing money gambling in Australia on 17 black and shares matching work of the children's character Pingu with Ed Sheeran [344] He also shares a matching half a heart tattoo with Caleb Followill of Kings of Leon [347]\n\n\nRelationships\nFrom November 2011 to January 2012, 17-year-old Styles dated television presenter Caroline Flack; their relationship stirred controversy, as she was 14 years older than Styles [348] He briefly dated American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift later in 2012, [349] leading to fan and media speculation about them writing songs about each other after their breakup [5] [350] From 2013 to 2016, Styles dated model Kendall Jenner and later cited her as one of the muses of his debut album [351]\n\n\nSexuality\nStyles has been repeatedly asked about his sexual orientation in interviews since he was 19 years old [44] [286] [357] [358] [359] When asked in a 2013 interview with British GQ whether he was bisexual, he replied, \"Bisexual? Me? I don't think so I'm pretty sure I'm not\" [357] In 2017, when asked if he labelled his sexuality, he said, \"No, I've never felt the need to really I don't feel like it's something I've ever felt like I have to explain about myself\" [358]\n\n\nPhilanthropy and advocacy\nIn 2013, Styles and fellow One Direction member Liam Payne became ambassadors for the cancer charity Trekstock, raising over US$800,000 through the online fundraising platform Prizeo [360] [361] When the Westboro Baptist Church picketed a One Direction concert in 2013, [362] Styles spoke up on Twitter, responding that he \"believes in equal rights for everyone\" [362] In 2014, Styles joined LGBT rights charity Stonewall's #FirstSnog campaign in celebration of their 25th anniversary [363] and showed support for Michael Sam, the first openly gay player drafted by an NFL team, by wearing his jersey onstage during One Direction's concert in St Louis [364] Styles regularly waves pride flags thrown onstage by fans at concerts, [365] [366] [367] and he assists fans with coming out publicly during sections of the show where he engages in banter with the audience [368] [369] [370] [371] LGBT fans have referred to Styles' concerts as \"a safe space\" [372] Some of his lesbian and bisexual fans have called him a \"lesbian icon\" [366] [373] He received a Gay Times Honour for LGBTQ Advocate [374] Styles has been nominated three times at the British LGBT Awards [375] The Los Angeles Times called Styles a \"champion of the LGBT community\" and that \"Styles' ability to exist comfortably, and extremely publicly, in a fluid space along the gender spectrum is particularly resonant with young gender-nonconforming fans.\" [376]\n\n\nTreat People with Kindness\n\"Treat People with Kindness\", abbreviated to \"TPWK\", is a slogan used by Styles to promote his message of love, acceptance, and kindness to others [412] Styles began using the slogan during his debut concert tour in 2017 on a badge on his guitar and tour merchandise, including Pride T-shirts sold to raise funds for GLSEN [413] [414] In a December 2019 interview, he stated, \"It was a pin I had on my guitar strap and we made T-shirts for it, then I saw a lot of T-shirts around I'd be driving or something and see someone in one and I started feeling like, 'Oh this is a bit of a thing'\" The initiative gave Styles the idea to write a song titled after the slogan, which serves as the penultimate track on his second studio album, Fine Line [415] The track was later released as a single with a subsequent music video featuring writer and actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge in January 2021 [416]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nTours\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Swift mentions the age difference between her and the subject several times, and states how the subject used it as an excuse to terminate their relationship but continued to date women of her age She recollects the build-up and intensity of falling in love and acknowledges her naivety [69] The production of the first verse is relatively more uptempo, with new lyrics added such as \"And you were tossing me the car keys / 'Fuck the patriarchy' keychain on the ground.\" [70] There are three major sections of new lyrics in the 10-minute version: between the second verse and the second pre-chorus;
