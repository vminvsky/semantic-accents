as some academic leaders were afraid the school would be unable to receive accreditation with such a building But the tower, designed by architect Frank Wallace, was completed in 1967 at a cost of $2 million, a further source of contention After its completion, Roberts called for a three-day period of prayer and fasting [11] At the university's dedication ceremony in 1967, the evangelist Billy

spokesman said the university was still $52.5 million in debt The school accepted an additional $8 million from the Greens in November [48] [49] Of the $82 million given to Oral Roberts University, approximately half went toward eliminating its debt The remaining half was allocated to \"campus renovations, technology upgrades, academic enhancement, financial aid for new and returning students,

2021, the Religious Exemption Accountability Project, or REAP, filed a class action lawsuit, Hunter v the U.S Department of Education, on March 26, 2021, against this campus and other named campuses citing the abuses that thousands of LGBTQ+ students endured at these colleges and universities over the years LGBTQ+ students document their own direct discrimination, harassment and negative harms in

time.. the set of The Jetsons\" but also \"shabby\" and \"dated, like Disney's Tomorrowland.\" [32] [79] [80] Interviewed in 2010, Wallace characterized his ORU buildings as \"sculptures\", noting that an inspiration for his artistic sensibility was \"whittling since I was a kid\" [81] It has also been suggested that the buildings may have been inspired by Tulsa's art deco architectural

University in 1962 in Tulsa, Oklahoma The university received its charter the following year from the State of Oklahoma and Oral Roberts University officially opened in 1965 with an enrollment of 300 students and seven major completed buildings [11] The university was founded by Oral Roberts \"as a result of the evangelist Oral Roberts' obeying God's mandate to build a university on God's authority and the Holy Spirit God's commission to Oral Roberts was to 'Raise up your students to hear My voice, to go where My light is dim, where My voice is heard small, and My healing power is not known, even to the uttermost bounds of the earth Their work will exceed yours, and in this I am well pleased'.\" [12] Roberts placed special importance on the Prayer Tower, even though the concept of a building specifically dedicated to prayer at the center of the campus caused considerable tension, as some academic leaders were afraid the school would be unable to receive accreditation with such a building But the tower, designed by architect Frank Wallace, was completed in 1967 at a cost of $2 million, a further source of contention After its completion, Roberts called for a three-day period of prayer and fasting [11] At the university's dedication ceremony in 1967, the evangelist Billy Graham was the keynote speaker [11]\n\n\nFoundation and early years\nGround was officially broken for

called for a three-day period of prayer and fasting [11] At the university's dedication ceremony in 1967, the evangelist Billy Graham was the keynote speaker [11]\n\n\nCampus expansion and later years\nThe university built the City of Faith Medical and Research Center hospital in 1981 and started the Oral Roberts University School of Medicine in 1978 Severe financial difficulties with both of these institutions led to their closure in 1989 Oral Roberts's son Richard was named president in 1993.\n\n\nResignation of Richard Roberts\nIn October 2007, three former professors filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against ORU in Tulsa County The professors also alleged university president Richard Roberts misused university assets and illegally ordered the university to participate in Republican candidate Randi Miller's political campaign for Tulsa mayor [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]\n\n\nFinances\nORU's operating budget for 2007-08 was over $82 million On January 14, 2008, ORU's board of regents voted unanimously to accept $62 million from the Mart Green family, the owners of Oklahoma City-based Hobby Lobby, Mardel educational, and various Christian supply stores, an offer which included changes to the university's governing board In October of that year, an ORU spokesman said the university was still $52.5 million in debt The school accepted an additional $8 million from the Greens in November [48] [49] Of the $82 million given to Oral Roberts University, approximately half went toward eliminating its debt The remaining half was allocated to \"campus renovations, technology upgrades, academic enhancement, financial aid for new and returning students, marketing and operations\", according to the university website [50] In February 2008, the Renewing the Vision campaign was initiated in an effort to erase this debt To free the university from its burgeoning debt, the board of trustees announced plans for a $25 million matching campaign, [50] in which the board agreed to match dollar-for-dollar all donations [50] In addition to eliminating debt, funds from the Renewing the Vision campaign contributed to the 2008 summer campus renovations, as well as scholarships provided by the university [50] During the summer of 2008, $10 million went to campus upgrades and deferred maintenance Many dormitories were extensively renovated and most other buildings received restoration and upgrades [51] In January 2009, the university's presidential search committee recommended Mark Rutland, President of Southeastern University of the Assemblies of God in Florida, to succeed Richard Roberts, which the trustees approved [52] [53] On January 14, Rutland confirmed that he had been offered the position and intended to accept it [54] The university began to implement the employment reduction plans, laying off 53 employees and cutting about 40 unfilled positions [55] On January 29, 2009, the Green family committed $10.4 million to additional campus renovations and upgrades to take place during summer 2009 Following Mart Green's contribution, the university's debt was reduced to $25 million [56]\n\n\nAllegations of LGBTQ discrimination on campus\nOn August 25, 2015, ORU Administration learned of student Sabrina Bradford's recent marriage to a woman, and two days later she was informed she was not welcome back on campus [63] In March 2006 eight peaceful protesters were arrested while rallying across the street from ORU's main entrance [64] Ronnie Roberts, the son of Oral Roberts, came out as gay to the Rev Troy Perry, founder of the Metropolitan Community Church, in the early 1980s Six months later, Ronnie Roberts committed suicide [65] As of December 7, 2021, an online petition to \"Tell Oral Roberts University: Change your anti-LGBTQ honor code\" had gained over 10,000 signatures [66] [67] In March 2021, the Religious Exemption Accountability Project, or REAP, filed a class action lawsuit, Hunter v the U.S Department of Education, on March 26, 2021, against this campus and other named campuses citing the abuses that thousands of LGBTQ+ students endured at these colleges and universities over the years LGBTQ+ students document their own direct discrimination, harassment and negative harms in the filing Those abuses include \"conversion therapy, expulsion, denial of housing and health care, sexual and physical abuse and harassment.\" The abuses also include the \"less visible, but no less damaging, consequences of institutionalized shame, fear, anxiety, and loneliness.\" [68] On November 1, 2017, president Billy Wilson preached a chapel service entitled, \"Holy Sex\" and quoted Leviticus 20:13: \"If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable, they are put to death.\" [69] Within three months of graduation, Andrew Hartzler joined a class-action lawsuit against the U.S Department of Education, seeking to strike down a religious exemption provision in U.S civil rights law that allows ORU and other schools to receive federal funds despite such discriminatory policies The lawsuit contends it is a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and of the students' equal protection rights [70]\n\n\nPresidential inauguration of William Wilson and recent history\nOn January 31, 2013, ORU announced that William \"Billy\" Wilson, executive director of the International Center for Spiritual Renewal and vice-chair of the ORU board of trustees, had been selected to succeed Rutland as president, effective July 1, 2013 [71] A day earlier, the ORU student newspaper had briefly posted an erroneous report on its website, mistakenly identifying someone else as the new president Rutland criticized the report at a student assembly and the newspaper's longtime faculty adviser left the school the next day [72]\n\n\nCampus\nThe campus began construction in 1963 with a futuristic look and architecture, which historian Margaret Grubiak noted as being inspired by the 1933 Chicago World's Fair [76] Architects Stanfield, Imel & Walton of Tulsa designed the 1963 master plan, but most of the buildings were designed by Tulsa architect Frank Wallace [77] In 1981, the City of Faith Medical and Research Center opened The buildings were south of the ORU campus, and were originally built as a 60-story clinic, a 30-story hospital, and a 20-story research center The original tenants left in 1989 because of financial problems and a lack of demand for medical services As of 2007, some floors (in the 20-story building) have never been leased The facility is now mostly leased out as commercial office space under the name CityPlex Towers A 60 ft (18.2 m), 30 ton bronze sculpture Healing Hands, by sculptor Leonard McMurray (cast in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico in 1980) and originally in front of the towers, was moved to the ORU campus entrance in the summer of 1991 [78] By 2007, the campus was described as \"a perfect representation of the popular modernistic architecture of the time.. the set of The Jetsons\" but also \"shabby\" and \"dated, like Disney's Tomorrowland.\" [32] [79] [80] Interviewed in 2010, Wallace characterized his ORU buildings as \"sculptures\", noting that an inspiration for his artistic sensibility was \"whittling since I was a kid\" [81] It has also been suggested that the buildings may have been inspired by Tulsa's art deco architectural heritage, [82] [83] along with Bruce Goff's individualistic style and creative use of new materials [84]\n\n\nHousing\nThere are eight residence halls on campus The university has strict guidelines concerning student access to the upper floors of residence halls by members of the opposite sex, which is limited to designated occasions called

met while attending the University of Florida [8] [9] During that time, his mother was a freshman and his father was a sophomore The couple married on June 12, 1971, before Pamela's graduation from the university [10] In 1985, the family moved to the Philippines where they served as Baptist missionaries and built a ministry [10] During the Tebows' stay, Pamela contracted amoebic dysentery and fell into a coma While recovering, she discovered that she was pregnant The medications used to treat Pamela caused a severe placental abruption [10] Doctors expected a stillbirth and recommended an abortion, which was illegal in the Philippines even in severe cases; the Tebows decided against it On August 14, 1987, Pamela Tebow gave birth to Tim Tebow in Manila [10] When Tim was three years old, his family moved from the Philippines to Jacksonville, Florida [11]\n\n\nHomeschooling\nOn January 7, 2007, Tebow was featured prominently in an ESPN Outside The Lines feature on home-schooled athletes seeking equal access to high school athletics in other states Because a home-schooler's access to public and private school athletic functions varies by state, Tebow and former defensive end Jason Taylor (who was allowed to play at his local high school in Pennsylvania) argued in favor of extending the right to play for local teams to more states [26] Upon becoming the first home-schooled athlete to be nominated for the Heisman Trophy, he remarked, \"That's really cool A lot of times people have this stereotype of home-schoolers as not very athletic – it's like, go win a spelling bee or something like that – it's an honor for me to be the first one to do that.\" [27] Tebow received the 2008 Quaqua Protégé Award as outstanding home-education graduate [28]\n\n\nCollege football

(NCAA), 14 Southeastern Conference (SEC), and 28 University of Florida statistical records [93] He was the SEC's all-time leader in career passing efficiency (170.8), completion percentage (67.1%), passing touchdown to interception ratio (5.5 to 1), rushing yards by a quarterback (2,947), rushing touchdowns (any position) (57), and total touchdowns responsible for (145) [4] [94] Among many

potential was much debated At the time, Jon Gruden said Tebow was \"the strongest human being that's ever played the position\" and \"is the kind of guy who could revolutionize the game\" [127] Former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy said he would pick Tebow with a top 10 pick over any quarterback in the 2010 Draft [128] However, NFL analyst Mel Kiper Jr believed Tebow did not have the intangibles to play quarterback in the NFL \"I don't think he can be a fulltime quarterback I don't think he can be the quarterback of the future for you, but I do think in the third round, maybe the second round, he'll be the same as Pat White\", said Kiper [129]\n\n\nPre-draft\nAfter passing on the 2009 NFL draft for his senior season at Florida, Tebow went on to enter the 2010 NFL draft Despite

the 2010 NFL draft [135] The Broncos had acquired the pick in a trade with the Baltimore Ravens on the first night of the draft for the Broncos' second, third and fourth round picks [136] Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels said about drafting Tebow, \"He has all the traits you look for It's a good pick.\" [137]  When asked how Tebow will be used, McDaniels commented that Tebow probably wouldn't start at quarterback as a rookie, and that he'll, \"Play when he's ready.\"  The Denver Post columnist Woody Paige praised the pick, saying \"Tim Tremendous may be high risk, but he will be a Mile High Reward.\" [138]\n\n\n2010 season\nTebow was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round (25th overall) of the 2010 NFL draft [135] The Broncos had acquired the pick in a trade with the

Tebow**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nTimothy Richard Tebow is a former American football quarterback and current sports analyst, baseball player, and author. He played college football for the University of Florida and was a key contributor to the team's national championship in 2007 and 2008. Tebow was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the first round of the 2010 NFL draft and played for the Broncos, New York Jets, and New England Patriots. In addition to his football career, Tebow has also pursued a career in baseball, signing a minor league contract with the New York Mets in 2016. He has also been involved in various philanthropic efforts, including the Tim Tebow Foundation, which he founded in 2010.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nTim Tebow was born on August 14, 1987, in Makati, Philippines, to American parents Pamela Elaine (née Pemberton) and Robert Ramsey Tebow II. His parents were Baptist missionaries who met while attending the University of Florida. Tebow's mother contracted amoebic dysentery and fell into a coma while pregnant with Tebow, who was born in Manila, Philippines. Doctors expected a stillbirth and recommended an abortion, but Tebow's parents decided against it. When Tebow was three years old, his family moved from the Philippines to Jacksonville, Florida.\n\n**Homeschooling**\n\nTebow was homeschooled by his parents, which allowed him to focus on his athletic and academic pursuits. He was a key contributor to his homeschool football team, leading them to a state championship in 2005. Tebow's homeschooling experience also gave him the opportunity to attend home-schooled athletic events in other states, which helped him gain exposure and recognition.\n\n**College Football Career**\n\nTebow was heavily recruited by many college programs and almost accepted a scholarship offer from Mike Shula, then coach at Alabama. Instead, he chose to attend the University of Florida and play for coach Urban Meyer's Florida Gators. Tebow was a key backup on Florida's 2006 national championship team, won the starting quarterback job and the Heisman Trophy in 2007, led the Gators to another BCS championship in 2008, and quarterbacked them to a 13–1 season in 2009.

He was the first sophomore to win the Heisman Trophy and garnered 462 first-place votes and 1,957 points, 254 points ahead of the runner-up, Arkansas running back Darren McFadden.\n\n**Professional Football Career**\n\nAfter passing on the 2009 NFL draft for his senior season at Florida, Tebow went on to enter the 2010 NFL draft. Despite his college success, Tebow's NFL potential was much debated. He was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round (25th overall) of the 2010 NFL draft.

The film stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a small-town businessman whose crisis of despair is interwoven with the lives of those around him, and Donna Reed as Mary Hatch Bailey, his loving wife.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe film begins on Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, where George Bailey is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He is visited by Clarence Odbody, an angel second class who is trying to earn his wings. Clarence shows George a series of flashbacks that reveal the significant moments of George's life, including his rescue of his younger brother Harry from drowning, leaving him deaf in his left ear. George later saves the pharmacist, Mr. Gower, from accidentally poisoning a customer.\n\nAs George's life is revealed to Clarence, it becomes clear that he has made a significant impact on the lives of those around him. His wife Mary, his children, and his friends are all grateful for the sacrifices he has made for them. However, George's own sense of purpose and fulfillment are lacking, and he feels trapped in a life he did not choose.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* James Stewart as George Bailey\n* Donna Reed as Mary Hatch Bailey\n* Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter\n* Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy Bailey\n* Henry Travers as Clarence Odbody\n* Beulah Bondi as Mrs. Bailey\n* Frank Faylen as Bert the Cop\n* Ward Bond as Ernie the Cab Driver\n\n## Production\n\nThe original story, \"The Greatest Gift,\" was written by Philip Van Doren Stern in November 1939. After it was rejected by several publishers, he had it printed as a 24-page pamphlet and mailed to 200 family members and friends for Christmas 1943. The story came to the attention of either Cary Grant or RKO producer David Hempstead, who showed it to Grant's agent. In April 1944, RKO Pictures bought the rights to the story for $10,000, hoping to turn it into a vehicle for Grant.\n\nFrank Capra was approached to direct the film, and he immediately saw the potential of the story. He convinced RKO to cast James Stewart, who had previously worked with Capra on two films, \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938) and \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939). The film was shot at RKO Radio Pictures Studios in Culver City, California, and the 89-acre RKO movie ranch in Encino, where \"Bedford Falls\" was adapted from Oscar-winning sets originally designed by art director Max Ree for the 1931 epic film \"Cimarron.\"\n\n## Reception\n\nThe film premiered at the Globe Theatre in New York City on December 20, 1946, to mixed reviews. While some critics praised the film's inventiveness and humor, others found it too sentimental and overly long. However, the film's popularity grew over time, and it became a beloved classic.\n\n## Awards and honors\n\nPrior to its Los Angeles release, Liberty Films mounted an extensive promotional campaign that included a daily advertisement highlighting one of the film's players, along with comments from reviewers. Jimmy Starr wrote, \"If I were an Oscar, I'd elope with It's a Wonderful Life lock, stock and barrel on the night of the Academy Awards.\" The New York Daily Times published an editorial that declared the film and James Stewart's performance to be worthy of Academy Award consideration.\n\n## Release\n\nLiberty Films was purchased by Paramount Pictures, and remained a subsidiary until 1951. In 1955, M & A Alexander purchased the movie, which included key rights to the original television syndication, the original nitrate film elements, the music score, and the film rights to the story on which the film is based, \"The Greatest Gift.\" National Telefilm Associates took over the rights to the film soon thereafter.\n\n## Ownership and copyright issues\n\nThe film's ownership and copyright issues have been a subject of controversy over the years. In 1955, M & A Alexander purchased the movie, which included key rights to the original television syndication, the original nitrate film elements, the music score, and the film rights to the story on which the film is based, \"The Greatest Gift.\" National Telefilm Associates took over the rights to the film soon thereafter.\n\n## Colorization\n\nIn the 1980s, director Frank Capra met with Wilson Markle about having Colorization Inc. colorize \"It's a Wonderful Life\" based on an enthusiastic response to the colorization of \"Topper\" from actor Cary Grant. The company's art director, Brian Holmes, prepared 10 minutes of colorized footage from \"It's a Wonderful Life\" for Capra to view, which resulted in Capra signing a contract with Colorization Inc. and his \"enthusiastic agreement\" to pay half the $260,000 cost of colorizing the movie and to share any profits.\n\n## Home media\n\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, when the film was still thought to be public domain, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" was released on VHS by a variety of home video companies, including Meda Video, Kartes Video Communications, GoodTimes Home Video, and Video Treasures. After Republic reclaimed the rights to the film, all unofficial VHS copies of the film still in the hands of video distributors were supposed to have been destroyed.\n\n## Technological first: CD-ROM\n\nIn 1993, due in part to the confusion of the ownership and copyright issues, Kinesoft Development, with the support of Republic Pictures, released \"It's a Wonderful Life\" as one of the first commercial feature-length films on CD-ROM for the Windows PC (Windows 3.1). Antedating commercial DVDs by several years, it included such features as the ability to follow along with the complete shooting script as the film was playing.\n\n## DVD and Blu-ray\n\nThe film has seen multiple DVD releases since the availability of the format. In the autumn of 2001, Republic issued the film twice, once in August, and again with different packaging in September of that same year. On October 31, 2006, Paramount released a newly remastered \"60th Anniversary Edition.\" On November 13, 2007, Paramount released a two-disc \"special edition\" DVD of the film that contained both the original theatrical black-and-white version, and a new, third colorized version, produced by Legend Films using the latest colorization technology.\n\n## Restoration\n\nIn 2017, the film was restored in 4K resolution, available via streaming services and DCP.\n\n## 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray\n\nOn October 29, 2019, the film was released for the first time on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, along with a digital copy featuring a new Dolby Vision transfer.\n\n## Adaptations in other media\n\nThe film was twice adapted for radio in 1947, first on \"Lux Radio Theater\" (March 10) and then on the \"Screen Guild Theater\" (December 29), then again on the \"Screen Guild Theater\" broadcast of March 15, 1951. James Stewart and Donna Reed reprised their roles for all three radio productions. Stewart also starred in the May 8, 1949, radio adaptation presented on the \"Screen Directors Playhouse.\"\n\n## Remakes\n\nIn 1990, the made-for-television film \"Clarence\" starred Robert Carradine in a new tale of the helpful angel, Clarence Odbody.\n\n## Sequel\n\nIn 1990, the made-for-television film \"Clarence\" starred Robert Carradine in a new tale of the helpful angel, Clarence Odbody.\n\n## Cancelled Sequel\n\nA purported sequel was in development for a 2015 release, and was to be called \"It's a Wonderful Life: The Rest of the Story.\" It was to be written by Bob Farnsworth and Martha Bolton and follow the angel of George Bailey's daughter Zuzu (played once again by Karolyn Grimes), as she teaches Bailey's evil grandson how different the world would have been if he had never been born. Producers were considering directors and hoped to shoot the film with a $25–$35 million budget in Louisiana early in 2014.\n\n## Modern remake\n\nOn January 19, 2024, it was announced that Kenya Barris will write and direct a modern remake of the film for Paramount, with the intention to cast a person of color in the role of George Bailey. On the announcement, Barris remarked: \"I feel like Christmas movies are amazing and I think the idea of taking something that has that long of a history and a tale behind it and putting an amazing piece of talent to tell that story...

However, in a correction for the 1999 \"Annual Xmas Quiz\" in the San Francisco Chronicle, which made this claim, series writer Jerry Juhl confirmed that, per producer Jon Stone, the shared names were merely a coincidence. Despite this, the 1996 holiday special \"Elmo Saves Christmas\" references the rumor, during a scene where Bert and Ernie walk by a TV set, which is playing the movie. The pair are surprised by the line: \"Bert! Ernie! What's the matter with you two guys?

{"title": "Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "content": "\nName, symbol, and themes\nThe name as well as the symbol of the party were selected by the founders The name \"Bharatiya Janata Party\" literally translates to \"Indian People's Party\" The Symbol of the party is the flower Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) [51] Lotus has a cultural significance within India as well as Hinduism The symbol has been regarded as a symbol of peace and prosperity within Hinduism Likewise, during the independence movement of India, the symbol was used by Indian nationalist as a symbol of revolt against the British Raj [52] Lotus is also recognised as the national flower of India Thus, use of the symbol gives the party a nationalist as well as Hindutva appeal [53] Besides these, the party also heavily uses the Saffron colour in its promotional materials and campaigning Similar to Lotus, the Saffron colour also has a major significance within Hinduism [54] The most common flag used by the party is predominantly saffron with a stripe of green in the left Within the Saffron part of the flag, the lotus symbol is also integrated [55] This particular colour scheme used in the flag assists the party to project itself as a secular party Meanwhile, this also helps the party to maintain a religious undertone for its core electorate and Hindu nationalistic supporter groups [55]\n\n\nPrecursors\nThe BJP's origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, popularly known as the Jana Sangh, founded by Syama Prasad Mukherjee in 1951 in response to the politics of the dominant National Congress party It was founded in collaboration with the Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and was widely regarded as the political arm of the RSS [56] The Jana Sangh's aims included the protection of India's \"Hindu\" cultural identity, in addition to countering what it perceived to be the appeasement of Muslim people and the country of Pakistan by the Congress party and then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru The RSS loaned several of its leading pracharaks, or full-time workers, to the Jana Sangh to get the new party off the ground Prominent among these was Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was appointed General Secretary The Jana Sangh won only three Lok Sabha seats in the first general elections in 1952 It maintained a minor presence in parliament until 1967 [57] [58]\n\n\nBharatiya Jana Sangh (1951–77)\nThe BJP's origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, popularly known as the Jana Sangh, founded by Syama Prasad Mukherjee in 1951 in response to the politics of

arm of the RSS [56] The Jana Sangh's aims included the protection of India's \"Hindu\" cultural identity, in addition to countering what it perceived to be the appeasement of Muslim people and the

presence in parliament until 1967 [57] [58]\n\n\nJanata Party (1977–80)\nIn 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a state of emergency The Jana Sangh took part in the widespread protests, with thousands of its members being imprisoned along with other agitators across the country In 1977, the emergency was withdrawn and general elections were held The Jana Sangh merged with parties from across the political spectrum, including the Socialist Party, the Congress (O) and the Bharatiya Lok Dal to form the Janata Party, with its main agenda being defeating Indira Gandhi [58] The Janata Party won a majority in 1977 and formed a government with Morarji Desai as Prime Minister The former Jana Sangh contributed the largest tally to the Janata Party's parliamentary contingent, with 93 seats or 31% of its strength Vajpayee, previously the leader of the Jana Sangh, was appointed the Minister of External Affairs [63]\n\n\nHistory\nAlthough the newly formed BJP was technically distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president [67] Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian socialism [68] This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984 [68] The assassination of Indira Gandhi a few months earlier resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 414 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP [69]\n\n\nFormation and early days\nAlthough the newly formed BJP was

Vajpayee's moderate strategy led to a shift in the ideology of the party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism [68] [70] In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement In the early 1980s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the disputed site of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1527 There is a dispute about whether a temple once stood there [71] The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site is the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque [72] The BJP threw its support behind this campaign and made it a part of their election platform It won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government of V P Singh [73]\n\n\nVajpayee and Advani era (1996–2004)\nA coalition of regional parties formed the government in 1996, but this grouping was short-lived, and mid-term polls were held in 1998 The BJP contested the elections leading a coalition called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which contained its existing allies like the Samata Party, the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Shiv Sena in addition to the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the Biju Janata Dal Among these regional parties, the Shiv Sena was the only one that had an ideology similar to the BJP; Amartya Sen, for example, called the coalition an \"ad hoc\" grouping [81] The NDA had a majority with outside support from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Vajpayee returned as Prime Minister [82] However, the coalition ruptured in May 1999 when the leader of AIADMK, J Jayalalithaa, withdrew her support, and fresh elections were held again [83]\n\n\n2002 Gujarat violence\nOn 27 February 2002, a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was burned outside the town of Godhra, killing 59 people The incident was seen as an attack upon Hindus, and sparked off massive anti-Muslim violence across the state of Gujarat that lasted several weeks [87] The death toll estimated was as high as 2000, while 150,000 were displaced [88] Rape, mutilation, and torture were also widespread [88] [89] The then-Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and several high-ranking government officials were accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as were police officers who allegedly directed the rioters and gave them lists of Muslim-owned properties [90] In April 2009, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riots cases In 2012, Modi was cleared of complicity in the violence by the SIT BJP MLA Maya Kodnani, who later held a cabinet portfolio in the Modi government, was convicted of having orchestrated one of the riots and sentenced to 28 years imprisonment; [91] [92] she was later acquitted by the Gujarat High Court [93] Scholars such as Paul Brass, Martha Nussbaum and Dipankar Gupta have said that there was a high level of state complicity in the incidents [94] [95] [96]\n\n\nIn opposition (2004–2014)\nVajpayee called for early elections in 2004, six months ahead of schedule The NDA's campaign was based on the slogan \"India Shining\", which sought to depict it as responsible for a rapid economic transformation of the country [97] However, the NDA unexpectedly suffered a heavy defeat, winning only 186 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 222 of the Congress and its allies Manmohan Singh succeeded Vajpayee as Prime Minister as the head of the United Progressive Alliance The NDA's failure to reach out to rural Indians was provided as an explanation for its defeat, as was its divisive policy agenda [97] [98]\n\n\nModi era (2014–present)\nIn the 2014 Indian general election, the BJP won 282 seats, leading the NDA to a tally of 336 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha [100] Narendra Modi was sworn in as the 14th prime minister of India on 26 May 2014 [101] [102] The vote share of the BJP was 31% of all votes cast, a low figure relative to the number of seats it won [103] This was the first instance since 1984 of a single party achieving an outright majority in the Indian Parliament [104] and the first time that it achieved a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own strength Support was concentrated in the Hindi-speaking belt in North-central India [103] The magnitude of the victory was not predicted by most opinion and exit polls [103]\n\n\nIdeology and political positions\n\nThe party along the history has been widely described as a right-wing party, [24] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] but has recently been described as far-right, specifically it is considered part of the radical right, a subset of the far-right that does not oppose democracy [25] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135]\n\nSocial policies and Hindutva\nThe official philosophy of the BJP is \"Integral humanism,\" a philosophy first formulated by Deendayal Upadhyaya in 1965, who described it as advocating an \"indigenous economic model that puts the human being at center stage.\" [136] [137] It is committed to Hindutva, an ideology articulated by Indian independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar According to the party, Hindutva is cultural nationalism favouring Indian culture over westernisation, thus it extends to all Indians regardless of religion [68] Scholars and political analysts describe Hindutva as seeking to redefine India and recast it as a Hindu country to the exclusion of other religions, making the BJP a Hindu nationalist party in a general sense [76] [68] [138] [139] The BJP moderated its stance after the NDA was formed in 1998, due to the presence of parties with a broader set of ideologies [76] [45]\n\n\nEconomic policies\nThe BJP's economic policy has changed considerably since its founding There is a significant range of economic ideologies within the party In the 1980s, like the Jana Sangh, it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its affiliates It supported swadeshi (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a protectionist export policy However, it supported internal economic liberalisation, and opposed the state-driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress [169] During the 1996 elections, and later when it was in government, the BJP shifted its stance away from protectionism and towards globalisation The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India [169] This was criticised, including by the BJP's affiliates, the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch: [169] the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its swadeshi ideology [169]\n\n\nDefence and counterterrorism\nCompared to Congress, the BJP takes a more aggressive and nationalistic position on defence policy and terrorism [186] [187] The Vajpayee-led NDA government carried out nuclear weapons tests and enacted the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which later came under heavy criticism [186] [187] It also deployed troops to evict infiltrators from Kargil, and supported the United States War on Terror [188]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe historical stance of the BJP towards foreign policy, like the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, was based on an aggressive Hindu nationalism combined with economic protectionism [198] The Bharatiya Jana Sangh was founded with the explicit aim of reversing the partition of India; as a result, its official position was that the existence of Pakistan was illegitimate [198] This antagonism toward Pakistan remains a significant influence on the BJP's ideology [198] [199] During the Cold War, the party and its affiliates strongly opposed India's long standing policy of non-alignment, and instead advocated closeness to the United States [198] In the post-Cold War era, the party has largely embraced the Indian foreign policy consensus of improving relations with the United States, [200] while stressing a desire for a more multipolar world order [201]\n\n\nOrganisation and structure\nThe organisation of the BJP is strictly hierarchical, with the president being the highest authority in the party [137] Until 2012, the BJP constitution mandated that any qualified member could be national or state president for a single three-year term [137] This was amended to a maximum of two consecutive terms [216]\n\n\nGeneral election results\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party was officially founded in 1980, and the first general election it contested was in 1984, in which it won only two Lok Sabha seats Following the election in 1996, the BJP became the largest party in the Lok Sabha for the first time, but the government it formed was short-lived [44] In the elections of 1998 and 1999, it remained the largest party, and headed the ruling coalition on both occasions [45] In the 2014 general election, it won an outright majority in parliament From 1991 onwards, a BJP member has led the Opposition whenever the party was not in power [223] [f]\n\n\nPresence in states and Union Territories\n As of

center. The party is known for its right-wing ideology and its commitment to Hindutva, a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. The BJP was founded in 1980 and has since become one of the most influential and powerful parties in Indian politics.\n\n**Name, Symbol, and Themes**\n\nThe name of the party, \"Bharatiya Janata Party,\" literally translates to \"Indian People's Party.\" The symbol of the party is the lotus flower, which has a significant cultural and historical significance in India. The lotus flower is also the national flower of India and is often associated with peace, prosperity, and spirituality. The party's use of the lotus flower as its symbol is a reflection of its commitment to Indian culture and values.\n\nThe BJP's promotional materials and campaigning often feature the color saffron, which is also a significant color in Hinduism. The use of saffron is a nod to the party's Hindu nationalist leanings and its commitment to promoting Hindu culture and values. The party's flag features a predominantly saffron background with a stripe of green on the left, and the lotus symbol is integrated into the saffron part of the flag.\n\n**Precursors**\n\nThe BJP's origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, popularly known as the Jana Sangh, which was founded by Syama Prasad Mukherjee in 1951. The Jana Sangh was a right-wing party that was founded in response to the politics of the dominant National Congress party. The party was widely regarded as the political arm of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization.\n\nThe Jana Sangh's aims included the protection of India's \"Hindu\" cultural identity and countering what it perceived to be the appeasement of Muslim people and the country of Pakistan by the Congress party and then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The RSS loaned several of its leading pracharaks, or full-time workers, to the Jana Sangh to get the new party off the ground.\n\n**Bharatiya Jana Sangh (1951-77)**\n\nThe Jana Sangh won only three Lok Sabha seats in the first general elections in 1952 and maintained a minor presence in parliament until 1967. The party was known for its hardline Hindu nationalist stance, which often put it at odds with the Congress party and other political parties.\n\n**Janata Party (1977-80)**\n\nIn 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a state of emergency, which led to widespread protests across the country. The Jana Sangh took part in the protests, and thousands of its members were imprisoned along with other agitators. In 1977, the emergency was withdrawn, and general elections were held.\n\nThe Jana Sangh merged with parties from across the political spectrum, including the Socialist Party, the Congress (O), and the Bharatiya Lok Dal, to form the Janata Party. The main agenda of the Janata Party was to defeat Indira Gandhi, who was still in power. The Janata Party won a majority in 1977 and formed a government with Morarji Desai as Prime Minister.\n\n**History**\n\nAlthough the newly formed BJP was technically distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor. Vajpayee was the first president of the BJP and played a key role in shaping the party's ideology and policies.\n\nThe early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims, which led to a shift in the ideology of the party toward a more hardline Hindu nationalist stance. In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him, it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.\n\nThe agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site is the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque. The BJP threw its support behind this campaign and made it a part of their election platform. They won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made their support crucial to the National Front government of V P Singh.\n\n**Vajpayee and Advani Era (1996-2004)**\n\nA coalition of regional parties formed the government in 1996, but this grouping was short-lived, and mid-term polls were held in 1998. The BJP contested the elections leading a coalition called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which contained its existing allies like the Samata Party, the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Shiv Sena, and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).\n\nThe NDA had a majority with outside support from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Vajpayee returned as Prime Minister. However, the coalition ruptured in May 1999 when the leader of AIADMK, J Jayalalithaa, withdrew her support, and fresh elections were held again.\n\n**2002 Guj", "prompt": "Write a complete

well as Hinduism The symbol has been regarded as a symbol of peace and prosperity within Hinduism Likewise, during the independence movement of India, the symbol was used by Indian nationalist as a symbol of revolt against the British Raj [52] Lotus is also recognised as the national flower of India Thus, use of the symbol gives the party a nationalist as well as Hindutva appeal [53] Besides these, the party also heavily uses the Saffron colour in its promotional materials and campaigning Similar to Lotus, the Saffron colour also has a major significance within Hinduism [54] The most common flag used by the party is predominantly saffron with a stripe of green in the left Within the Saffron part of the flag, the lotus symbol is also integrated [55] This particular colour scheme used in the flag assists the party to project itself as a secular party Meanwhile, this also helps the party to maintain a religious undertone for its core electorate and Hindu nationalistic supporter

newly formed BJP was technically distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president [67] Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian socialism [68] This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984 [68] The assassination of Indira Gandhi a few months earlier resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 414 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP [69]\n\n\nFormation and early

was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement In the early 1980s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the disputed site of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1527 There is a dispute about whether a temple once stood there [71] The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site is the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque [72]

The mosque's complex history is intertwined with the temple of Vishweshwar, a Hindu deity, which was allegedly demolished by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1669.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Gyanvapi Mosque is situated in the heart of Varanasi, a city considered one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The mosque's history is marked by periods of construction, destruction, and reconstruction, reflecting the complex and often tumultuous relationship between Hindus and Muslims in India. This article explores the history of the mosque, from its origins as a Hindu temple to its current status as a place of worship for Muslims.\n\n**Vishweshwar Temple**\n\nThe site originally had a Vishweshwar temple devoted to the Hindu deity Shiva. It was built by Todar Mal, a premier courtier and minister of Akbar, in conjunction with Narayana Bhatta, a pre-eminent Brahmin scholar of Banaras from Maharashtra, during the late 16th century. The temple's history is shrouded in mystery, with various accounts of its origins and significance.\n\n**Pre-Temple History**\n\nWhat might have existed at the site prior to this temple is debated by scholars. Such history has also been extensively contested by the local Hindu as well as the Muslim population. Desai notes these multiple histories of the original temple and tensions arising out of the location of Gyanvapi to have fundamentally shaped the sacred topography of the city.\n\n**Popular Claims**\n\nRecent accounts of the history of the mosque, as purveyed by Hindus, center around a litany of repeated destruction and re-construction of the original temple, which is situated in contrast to the timelessness of the lingam. The original temple was allegedly uprooted by Ghurids in 1193/1194 CE, upon the defeat of Jayachandra of Kannauj; the Razia Mosque was constructed in its place, a few years later.\n\n**Historicity**\n\nThe earliest manuscripts of Skanda Purana (c 810 CE) describe Banaras to be the kshetra of Avimukteshwar; there is no mention of Vishweshwar. The slightly-later Matsya Purana, too, attests the supremacy of Avimukteshwar and does not mention Vishweshwar; however, certain corrupt manuscripts include it, suggesting a late interpolation. Krtyakalpataru, an encyclopedia of traditional Hindu law, written during the reign of Govindachandra (c early 12th century) quoted a detailed description of Banaras — including an enumeration of all religious sanctuaries — from the Linga Purana.\n\n**Establishment**\n\nIn September 1669, Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of the temple. A mosque was constructed in place, perhaps by Aurangzeb himself, c 1678. The façade was modeled partially on the Taj Mahal's entrance; the plinth of the temple was left largely untouched to serve as the courtyard of the mosque, and the southern wall — along with its cusped arches, exterior moldings, and toranas — was turned into the qibla wall.\n\n**Motives**\n\nScholars attribute political reasons rather than religious zealotry to be the primary motivation for Aurangzeb's demolition. Catherine Asher notes that not only did the zamindars of Banaras frequently rebel against Aurangzeb but also the local Brahmins were oft accused of interfering with Islamic teaching. Consequently, she argues that the demolition was a political message in that it served as a warning for the Zamindars and Hindu religious leaders, who wielded great influence in the city.\n\n**Muslim Counter-Claims**\n\nWriting in 1993, Mary Searle Chatterjee found most local Muslims rejecting the idea that Aurangzeb had the temple demolished out of religious zealotry. Theories included that the temple was demolished due to its alleged neglect or decay, or that it was a strategic move to assert Mughal authority over the city.\n\n**Late-Mughal India**\n\nIn 1678, the chief minister of the Malla ruler of Lalitpur constructed the Bhaideval temple for Vishveshwara in the Patan Durbar Square — the inscription claims him to have transported Shiva from Banaras to Lalitpur since \"he was dejected by terrible yavanas.\" In 1698, Bishan Singh, the Kachhwaha ruler of Amber, had his agents survey the town — rather its ritual landscape — and gather details about the land-use patterns; their maps ('tarah') were explicit in holding the Gyanvapi mosque to lay at the site of the dismantled Vishweshwar temple.\n\n**British Raj**\n\nUnder British Raj, the Gyanvapi, which was once the subject of whimsical Mughal politics, got transformed into a site of perennial contestation between local Hindus and Muslims spawning numerous legal suits and even, riots. A new generation of aristocrats and well-to-do traders took over the role exclusively played by petty rulers in late-Mughal India in controlling the ritual life of the city.\n\n**Independent India**\n\nIn March 1959, Hindu Mahasabha conducted a Rudrabhishek ceremony at the mosque pavilion on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri. Two of their workers were subsequently sentenced to six months of imprisonment for violating law and order. This spurred fellow Mahasabha-ites to mount routine agitations at the mosque pavilion across the next few months, demanding the restoration of the temple.\n\n**Litigation**\n\nFrom 1984, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and other elements of the Hindu nationalist Sangh Parivar engaged in a nation-wide campaign to reclaim mosques which were constructed by demolishing Hindu temples. The Gyanvapi mosque was prominently included among them. In 1991, a title-dispute suit was filed by three local Hindus in the Varanasi Civil Court on behalf of three Hindu deities — Shiva, Shringar Gauri, and Ganesha — for handing over the entire site to Hindu community to facilitate the reconstruction of temple.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Gyanvapi mosque is a site of great historical and cultural significance, reflecting the complex and often tumultuous relationship between Hindus and Muslims in India. From its origins as a Hindu temple to its current status as a place of worship for Muslims, the mosque has been the subject of numerous controversies and disputes.

monitored for a couple days before entering the South-West Indian Ocean, which later became Cyclone Batsirai and caused devastation to Madagascar On 29 January, BoM started to track Tropical Low 16U and exited the basin without affecting land Meanwhile, Tropical Low 14U caused record flooding in the Kimberly Region [6]\n\n\nSystems\nDuring 17 November, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Low 02U had developed along a trough of low pressure, just to the west of Christmas Island [1] Over the next couple of days, the system remained slow-moving near the island before it started to move south-eastwards [18] On 21 November of 04:00 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for Invest 90S which the agency was tracking very recently, noting that the system was well-structured, with convection and near gale-force winds wrapping into its consolidated low-level circulation center (LLCC) [19] The BoM did not upgrade the system into a tropical cyclone at that time, as its centre was still somewhat elongated, and the near gale-force winds were only present at its southern quadrant At 00:00 UTC of 22 November, the BoM upgraded the system to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, and named it Paddy, becoming the first named cyclone in the season [1] The JTWC followed suit later that day at 09:00 UTC [20]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Paddy\nDuring 17 November, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Low 02U had developed along a trough of low pressure, just to the west of Christmas Island [1] Over the next couple of days, the system remained slow-moving near the island before it started to move south-eastwards [18] On 21 November of 04:00 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for Invest 90S which the agency was tracking very recently, noting that the system was well-structured, with convection and near gale-force winds wrapping into its consolidated low-level circulation center (LLCC) [19] The BoM did not upgrade the system into a tropical cyclone at that time, as its centre was still somewhat elongated, and the near gale-force winds were only present at its southern quadrant At 00:00 UTC of 22 November, the BoM upgraded the system to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, and named it Paddy, becoming the first named cyclone in the season [1] The JTWC followed suit later that day at 09:00 UTC [20]\n\n\nTropical Low 03U\nOn 22 November, a weak tropical low formed north of the Western Region, which was designated as 03U [24] By 24 November, the tropical low had entered the region and was located 560 kilometres (350 mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands [25] 03U meandered near the Cocos Islands, before moving westwards and exited the basin on 28 November [26]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Teratai\nOn 28 November, the BoM reported that a low formed within a monsoon trough to the southwest of Sumatra [2] They designated it as 05U by the next day [27] At 23:30 UTC on 30 November, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system as the agencies found that the convection in associated with the system had increased [28] By the next day, the BoM briefly upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, and named it Teratai which was given by TCWC Jakarta [2] [29] Later, the JTWC upgraded Teratai to a tropical storm, as it briefly attained sufficient convection [30]  But at 18:00 UTC, the BoM downgraded to a tropical low as deep convection had become limited, with the LLCC displaced towards the south This was caused due to the lack of sufficient outflow caused by the northerly strait line flow which inhibited the system from further intensifying, despite favorable conditions [2] [31] The JTWC followed suit two hours later [31] During the next few days, the BoM monitored ex-Teratai for redevelopment as the system executed a clockwise loop [32] By 6 December, the JTWC issued a TCFA, [33] and the next day it re-upgraded the system to a tropical storm [34] However, by 09:00 UTC of 9 December, JTWC issued its final warning [35] The BoM continued to track the system until 11 December [2]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Ruby\nOn 6 December, the BoM predicted that a tropical low could form near the Solomon Sea [36] Two days later, the tropical low formed, resulting in the BoM designating it as 07U, [37] [3] while the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system [38] The system's deep convection became more organized overnight in 10 December, and began to strengthen, with gale-force winds being reported on 11 December [3] Late on the same day, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm [39] By the next day, it was upgraded to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, resulting in the BoM naming it Ruby Twelve hours later, the BoM would upgrade Ruby into a Category 2 cyclone, [3] while the JTWC upgraded the system into a category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone [40] By 13 December, Ruby reached its peak intensity, [3] before entering the South Pacific basin [41]\n\n\nTropical Low 06U\nOn 7 December, the BoM noted on a possibility of a weak tropical low developing over the northern part of the Arafura Sea [42] The BoM designated the system as 06U [43] By 13 December, the BoM stated that 06U was already forming [44] The system was last noted on 15 December [45]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Seth\nOn 21 December, the BoM started to monitor a possible tropical low near the Arafura Sea [46] Two days later, the BoM designated the low as 08U [47] The JTWC started to monitor the system on 24 December [48] By that same day, BoM began issuing advisories on the system, predicting a Category 1 intensity before landfall, [49] while the JTWC issued a TCFA at 21:00 UTC on the same day [50] However, the TCFA was cancelled at 18:00 UTC on 25 December, since the system moved inland, [51] and the BoM ceased issuing advisories as well [52] However, the tropical low kept moving eastward, reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria, before moving over the Top End and entering the Coral Sea [4] At 02:30 UTC on 30 December, the JTWC issued a TCFA again on the system; however, at 02:30 UTC on 31 December, the TCFA was cancelled, due to the system developing subtropical characteristics [53] [54] Around that same time, the BoM upgraded the low to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale and named it Seth [4] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC finally classified it as a tropical cyclone, designating the system with the identifier 04P [55]  The cyclone reached its peak intensity that day, with BoM estimating Seth as a category 2 tropical cyclone, with sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph), before subsequently downgrading the storm to a category 1 tropical cyclone at 18:00 UTC that same day At 06:00 UTC on 1 January, the BoM reclassified Seth as an ex-tropical cyclone [4] The JTWC issued their final warning three hours later [56] On the next day, the BoM classified the system as a subtropical low [4]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Tiffany\nOn 4 January, the BoM started to monitor a possible tropical low near the Coral Sea [59] By 8 January, BoM began issuing advisories on Tropical Low 10U [5] [60] The JTWC later issued a TCFA on the system [61] By the next day, the BoM upgraded it to a category 1 tropical cyclone, and named it Tiffany [5] The JTWC subsequently followed suit and started issuing advisories on Tiffany [62] Tiffany then rapidly intensified, peaking as a Category 2 tropical cyclone in the Australian scale and a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone in the Saffir-Simpson scale [5] [63] The storm then rapidly weakened and made landfall over the Cape York Peninsula as a category 1 tropical cyclone at 06:00 UTC on 10 January Due to land interaction, it rapidly weakened overland and became a weak tropical low The low entered into the Gulf of Carpentaria with that intensity by the same night [5] Despite the moderate wind shear, Tiffany re-intensified, with the BoM upgrading the system into a category 2 tropical cyclone by 11 January [64] [5] On 00:00 UTC of 12 January, the storm made its final landfall over the Northern Territory region and was followed by rapid weakening [5] The JTWC stopped issuing advisories by the same time [65]\n\n\nTropical Low 11U\nOn 6 January, the BoM first noted the possible formation of a weak tropical low [67] By 13 January, 11U formed while moving west-southwestward, 11U dissipated by the next day [68] [69]\n\n\nTropical Low 14U\nOn 26 January, the BoM noted that a tropical low may form within a monsoon trough over the Kimberley Region [70] The agency then reported that the low was forming over the central parts of the Northern Territory on 28 January [71] As it moved slowly west over the next few days, [72] by 1 February, the BoM designated the tropical low as 14U [73] The low then weakened as it turned northwestwards, [74] before being last noted on 5 February, about 515 km (320 mi) north-northwest of Port Hedland [75]\n\n\nTropical Low 16U\nOn 28 January, the BoM noted that a tropical low may form within a monsoon trough over the Coral Sea over the next few days [77] By the next day, the agency reported that the low was forming about 250 km (160 mi) to the northeast of Cairns [78] On 30 January, the JTWC started to monitor the low and gave it a low chance of formation into a tropical cyclone [79] Under a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures, lowering wind shear and good outflow aloft, the system continued to consolidate, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA by the next day, [80] [81] before subsequently upgrading it to a tropical cyclone, and designated it as 09P [82] By 1 February, the BoM designated the low as 16U [83] However, 16U did not intensify further as a dry air entrainment hampered the system's intensification, while continuing to move east-southeast under a near-equatorial ridge positioned to the north and northeast [84] The JTWC later downgraded 16U into a tropical depression [85] On 3 February, 16U exited the basin and entered the South Pacific basin [86] [17]\n\n\nTropical Low 17U\nBy 4 February, the BoM noted that a weak tropical low may form within the vicinity of Christmas Island, and predesignated it as 17U [87] The low then subsequently formed by the next day, about 300 km (190 mi) west-southwest of Christmas Island [88] By 7 February, the JTWC started to monitor 17U, and gave it a medium chance for development within the next 24 hours [89] The BoM subsequently gave the system a low chance for development in the next 3 days [90] Under an environmment of warm sea surface temperatures, lowering vertical wind shear and fair poleward outflow, the low started to organize, with deep convection wrapping to its low-level circulation center, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA by the next day [91] However, as it moved south-southwest, [92] the wind shear started to increase, leading to its LLCC becoming exposed and the JTWC cancelling the TCFA on 10 February [93] 17U continued westwards, and was last noted by the BoM on 13 February, before exiting the basin shortly thereafter [94]\n\n\nTropical Low 19U (Fezile)\nOn 10 February, the BoM noted that a tropical low may form in the next few days to the southeast of Christmas Island, and was predesignated as 19U [95] The tropical low then developed three days later, about 600 km (370 mi) southeast of the Cocos Islands [96] 19U moved west-southwestwards, [97] before entering the South-West Indian Ocean basin on 16 February [98]\n\n\nTropical Low 20U\nOn 16 February, the BoM noted that a weak tropical low may form to the south of Papua New Guinea, and predesignated it as 20U [99] The low then subsequently formed the next day, under an unfavorable environment [100] 20U was last noted by 18 February [101]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Vernon\nOn 23 February, the BoM reported that a tropical low had developed to the southwest of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, and designated it as 22U [7] [17] By the next day, the JTWC started to monitor the low, and gave it a low chance of formation into a tropical cyclone [102] Under a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and increasing poleward outflow, the system organized further, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA at 14:00 UTC that same day [103] At 00:00 UTC on 25 February, the low intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone in the Australian scale, with the BoM naming it as Vernon [7] The JTWC subsequently started to issue advisories [104] Moving west-southwest along the northern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge to the south, Vernon went on a rapid intensification phase over the day, with BoM and JTWC upgrading Vernon into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone in the Australian scale and a category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone in the Saffir-Simpson scale respectively 12 hours later, as it developed a pinhole eye [7] [105] Vernon then intensified to a category 4 severe tropical cyclone by the next day, as it started to move out of the basin and into the South-West Indian Ocean basin [7]\n\n\nTropical Low 21U\nOn 20 February, the BoM noted a possible formation of a tropical low over the Arafura Sea, as a trough over northern Australia was expected to be more active [106] It was later predesignated as 21U [107] By 23 February, the JTWC started to monitor the low, and gave a low chance of formation in the next 24 hours [108] The BoM then reported the low was forming by the next day, near the Torres Strait, and gave a moderate chance of formation over the next 3 days [109] As the system continued to move east-southeast, [110] it never organized further, prompting the JTWC to drop the system on their bulletins by 26 February [111] 21U was last noted by the next day, moving east and exiting the basin [112]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Anika\nDuring 23 February, the BoM started to monitor an enhanced area of convection, that developed along a monsoon trough in the Timor Sea [8] The JTWC started to track the area late on the same day, and gave a low chance of formation into a tropical cyclone [113] By the next day, the convection organized into a tropical low, and the BoM designated it as 23U [17] Under a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures and pronounced outflow being offset by high wind shear, the low continued to organize, with the JTWC issuing a TCFA late on 24 February [114] At 15:00 UTC the next day, the low intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone, with the BoM naming it as Anika [8] The JTWC subsequently followed suit and upgraded the system into a tropical storm, noting deep and cold convection covering its low-level circulation center [115] By 25 January, Anika intensified to a category 2 cyclone, before making landfall in the Kimberley coast, to the east of Kalumburu at 12:00 UTC that same day As a result, the BoM downgraded Anika to an ex-tropical cyclone [8] The JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system [116]\n\n\nTropical Low 25U\nOn 26 February, Moderate Tropical Storm 08 briefly moved into the western portion of the basin while undergoing a fujiwhara interaction with Severe Tropical Cyclone Vernon, and was designated by BoM as Tropical Low 25U [120] 25U was last noted on 27 February where it moved back to the South-West Indian Ocean basin [17]\n\n\nTropical Low 26U\nOn 27 February, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 26U had formed about 295 km (183 mi) to the east of Christmas Island, and gave a low chance of formation over the next 3 days [121] The JTWC started to monitor the low the next day, and also gave a low chance of formation over the next 24 hours [122] Under a marginal environment of warm sea surface temperatures and robust outflow aloft offset by high wind shear, the low started to consolidate, prompting the agency to issue a TCFA late on 1 March [123] By the next day, the JTWC upgraded 26U to a tropical storm, designating it as 17S At that time, the system was already disorganized, with flaring convection being sheared off to the west of its exposed, elongated low-level circulation center [124] As its LLCC continued to become more exposed, and its central convection becoming more disorganized, the JTWC discontinued issuing advisories for 26U late on the same day [125] The BoM stopped monitoring the low on 4 February, as it moved southeast while continuing to weaken [126]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Billy\nOn 9 March, the BoM noted that a tropical low is expected to develop to the south of Java, Indonesia [127] The low started to develop two days later, on 11 March [128] Late on the same day, the JTWC started to monitor the low, and gave a low chance of formation as it started to organize [129] Moving west-southwestward under an environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low to moderate vertical wind shear and strong radial outflow aloft, [130] the low continued to improve, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA on 13 March, [131] before initiating advisories on Tropical Cyclone 20S late on the same day [132]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Charlotte\nOn 12 March, the BoM noted that a tropical low may form in the Arafura Sea in the next 3 days [140] The low developed 3 days later, to the north of the Northern Territory [141] As it moved westwards across Timor-Leste into the Indian Ocean, [11] the JTWC started to monitor the system on 18 March, with deep convection displaced to the west of its elongated low-level circulation center [142] Under a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low vertical wind shear and good poleward outflow aided by the upper-level westerlies associated with a mid-latitude trough to the south, [143] the low started to consolidate, prompting the agency to issue a TCFA by the next day [144] On 20 March, the BoM started to issue advisories on the low, and assigned the identifier 28U [145] The JTWC subsequently followed suit, and upgraded the low into a tropical storm, designating it as 21S [146] 28U reached tropical cyclone intensity afterwards, with the BoM naming it as Charlotte [11]\n\n\nTropical Low 30U\nOn 30 March, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 30U was developing south of Christmas Island, near 810 km (500 mi) northwest of Exmouth [12] [152] The JTWC also started to monitor the system, giving a low chance of formation in the next 24 hours [153] Although in a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low vertical wind shear and robust poleward outflow aloft, [154] the low failed to organize as shear started to increase, prompting the JTWC to drop the system on 1 April [155] The cyclone transitioned to a subtropical low at the same day as it moved south, before dissipating near Kalbarri two days later [12]\n\n\nTropical Low 32U\nAccording to a bulletin released by the Bureau of Meteorology on the morning of 8 April, a new tropical low formed in Papua New Guinea [156] It was designated as 32U 32U lost its tropical characteristics on 9 April without affecting any habitable areas [157]\n\n\nTropical Low 33U\nOn 17 April, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 33U had formed, about 155 km (96 mi) to the northwest of the Gove Peninsula [158] 33U slowly headed northwards, before the BoM stopped monitoring the low on 19 April [13]\n\n\nTropical Low 37U\nA tropical low formed 420 km (260 mi) from Christmas Island, according to the Bureau Of Meteorology technical bulletin, and was designated 34U [159] The cyclone intensified and the agency released unusual bulletins about the possibility of reaching Category 1, even though it did not pose a threat to any habitable areas [14]\n\n\nTropical Low 34U\nOn 25 April, a new low-level circulation center formed from now-classified Tropical Low 37U and tracked away to the east The BoM  assigned the identifier 34U to the system This low dissipated on 29 April [17] The system was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC in post-analysis [160]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Karim\nOn 7 May, Moderate Tropical Storm Karim entered the Australian region, and the BoM initiated advisories on the system as a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale [15] [161] At the time, the system was intensifying, with deep central convection wrapping into the system [162] By the next day, Karim further intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone [15] Late on the same day, the JTWC reported the system had reached its peak intensity [163] As it moved steadily southwards within an environment of warm sea surface temperatures, moderate wind shear and strong poleward outflow, Karim maintained its intensity throughout 9 May, before the BoM reported that Karim reached its peak intensity by the next day, with 10-minute sustained winds of 60 kn (110 km/h; 69 mph) [15] The storm then started to weaken, as it turned south-southeastwards under the influence of a near-equatorial ridge to the northwest, into an unfavorable environment of cooler sea surface temperatures and high wind shear [164] By 11 May, the BoM reclassified Karim as a subtropical low [15] The JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system as it was transitioning to an extratropical cyclone [165]\n\n\nOther systems\nThe BoM first noted the formation of a possible low-pressure system to the southwest of the island of Sumatra by 4 November [166] This forecast was materialized when the bureau started to track a weak tropical low outside the Western Region on 9 November, while located at 400 kilometres (250 mi) to the north-northeast of the Cocos Islands [167] It then entered the region by the next day while tracking slowly towards the island Environmental conditions were analyzed to be unfavorable for further development and as such, the BoM only forecast a \"very low\" chance of the low becoming a tropical cyclone [168] The tropical low then passed to the south of the archipelago before turning westwards and exiting the basin into the South-West Indian Ocean region by 14 November [169] [170] [171]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology (TCWC Melbourne) monitors all tropical cyclones that form within the Australian region, including any within the areas of responsibility of TCWC Jakarta or TCWC Port Moresby [184] Should a tropical low reach tropical cyclone strength within the BoM's area of responsibility, it will be assigned the next name from

about \"2021–22_Australian_region_cyclone_season\" following this outline:\n\n\nSeason summary\nA tropical low developed to the north of the Western Region on 9 November, starting the season and the overall Southern Hemisphere season as well After passing near the Cocos Islands with rainfall, it exiting the basin into the South-West Indian Ocean region on 14 November Three days later, Tropical Low 02U formed near the Christmas Island and later became Tropical Cyclone Paddy, the first named cyclone in this season [1] On 22 November, Tropical Low 03U formed and it exited the basin on 28 November On 1 December, Tropical Cyclone Teratai was designated by TCWC Jakarta, but BoM downgraded to a tropical low later that day due to limited deep convection Ex-Teratai was monitored for redevelopment for a few days, and on 7 December, the system was re-upgraded to tropical storm status The system later dissipated on 11 December [2] On 9 December, BoM designated Tropical Low 07U and later became Tropical Cyclone Ruby, which peaked as a Category 2 tropical cyclone before entering the South Pacific basin [3] About two weeks later, Tropical Low 08U was monitored for development but made landfall before further strengthening could occur The tropical low later entered the Coral Sea  where Tropical Cyclone Seth peaked with winds of 70 mph [4] A couple days after Seth dissipated, Tropical Low 10U quickly organized and was named Tiffany The tropical cyclone rapidly intensified to a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone before making landfall over Northern Queensland Land interaction and wind shear significantly weakened the system Tiffany later made a second landfall over Northern Territory without restrengthening much over the Gulf of Carpentaria [5] On 23 January, a tropical low was monitored for a couple days before entering the South-West Indian Ocean, which later became Cyclone Batsirai and caused devastation to Madagascar On 29 January, BoM started to track Tropical Low 16U and exited the basin without affecting land Meanwhile, Tropical Low 14U caused record flooding in the Kimberly Region [6]\n\n\nSystems\nDuring 17 November, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Low 02U had developed along a trough of low pressure, just to the west of Christmas Island [1] Over the next couple of days, the system remained slow-moving near the island before it started to move south-eastwards [18] On 21 November of 04:00 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for Invest 90S which the agency was tracking very recently, noting that the system was well-structured, with convection and near gale-force winds wrapping into its consolidated low-level circulation center (LLCC) [19] The BoM did not upgrade the system into a tropical cyclone at that time, as its centre was still somewhat elongated, and the near gale-force winds were only present at its southern quadrant At 00:00 UTC of 22 November, the BoM upgraded the system to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, and named it Paddy, becoming the first named cyclone in the season [1] The JTWC followed suit later that day at 09:00 UTC [20]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Paddy\nDuring 17 November, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Low 02U had developed along a trough of low pressure, just to the west of Christmas Island [1] Over the next couple of days, the system remained slow-moving near the island before it started to move south-eastwards [18] On 21 November of 04:00 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for Invest 90S which the agency was tracking very recently, noting that the system was well-structured, with convection and near gale-force winds wrapping into its consolidated low-level circulation center (LLCC) [19] The BoM did not upgrade the system into a tropical cyclone at that time, as its centre was still somewhat elongated, and the near gale-force winds were only present at its southern quadrant At 00:00 UTC of 22 November, the BoM upgraded the system to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, and named it Paddy, becoming the first named cyclone in the season [1] The JTWC followed suit later that day at 09:00 UTC [20]\n\n\nTropical Low 03U\nOn 22 November, a weak tropical low formed north of the Western Region, which was designated as 03U [24] By 24 November, the tropical low had entered the region and was located 560 kilometres (350 mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands [25] 03U meandered near the Cocos Islands, before moving westwards and exited the basin on 28 November [26]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Teratai\nOn 28 November, the BoM reported that a low formed within a monsoon trough to the southwest of Sumatra [2] They designated it as 05U by the next day [27] At 23:30 UTC on 30 November, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system as the agencies found that the convection in associated with the system had increased [28] By the next day, the BoM briefly upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, and named it Teratai which was given by TCWC Jakarta [2] [29] Later, the JTWC upgraded Teratai to a tropical storm, as it briefly attained sufficient convection [30]  But at 18:00 UTC, the BoM downgraded to a tropical low as deep convection had become limited, with the LLCC displaced towards the south This was caused due to the lack of sufficient outflow caused by the northerly strait line flow which inhibited the system from further intensifying, despite favorable conditions [2] [31] The JTWC followed suit two hours later [31] During the next few days, the BoM monitored ex-Teratai for redevelopment as the system executed a clockwise loop [32] By 6 December, the JTWC issued a TCFA, [33] and the next day it re-upgraded the system to a tropical storm [34] However, by 09:00 UTC of 9 December, JTWC issued its final warning [35] The BoM continued to track the system until 11 December [2]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Ruby\nOn 6 December, the BoM predicted that a tropical low could form near the Solomon Sea [36] Two days later, the tropical low formed, resulting in the BoM designating it as 07U, [37] [3] while the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system [38] The system's deep convection became more organized overnight in 10 December, and began to strengthen, with gale-force winds being reported on 11 December [3] Late on the same day, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm [39] By the next day, it was upgraded to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, resulting in the BoM naming it Ruby Twelve hours later, the BoM would upgrade Ruby into a Category 2 cyclone, [3] while the JTWC upgraded the system into a category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone [40] By 13 December, Ruby reached its peak intensity, [3] before entering the South Pacific basin [41]\n\n\nTropical Low 06U\nOn 7 December, the BoM noted on a possibility of a weak tropical low developing over the northern part of the Arafura Sea [42] The BoM designated the system as 06U [43] By 13 December, the BoM stated that 06U was already forming [44] The system was last noted on 15 December [45]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Seth\nOn 21 December, the BoM started to monitor a possible tropical low near the Arafura Sea [46] Two days later, the BoM designated the low as 08U [47] The JTWC started to monitor the system on 24 December [48] By that same day, BoM began issuing advisories on the system, predicting a Category 1 intensity before landfall, [49] while the JTWC issued a TCFA at 21:00 UTC on the same day [50] However, the TCFA was cancelled at 18:00 UTC on 25 December, since the system moved inland, [51] and the BoM ceased issuing advisories as well [52] However, the tropical low kept moving eastward, reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria, before moving over the Top End and entering the Coral Sea [4] At 02:30 UTC on 30 December, the JTWC issued a TCFA again on the system; however, at 02:30 UTC on 31 December, the TCFA was cancelled, due to the system developing subtropical characteristics [53] [54] Around that same time, the BoM upgraded the low to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale and named it Seth [4] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC finally classified it as a tropical cyclone, designating the system with the identifier 04P [55]  The cyclone reached its peak intensity that day, with BoM estimating Seth as a category 2 tropical cyclone, with sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph), before subsequently downgrading the storm to a category 1 tropical cyclone at 18:00 UTC that same day At 06:00 UTC on 1 January, the BoM reclassified Seth as an ex-tropical cyclone [4] The JTWC issued their final warning three hours later [56] On the next day, the BoM classified the system as a subtropical low [4]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Tiffany\nOn 4 January, the BoM started to monitor a possible tropical low near the Coral Sea [59] By 8 January, BoM began issuing advisories on Tropical Low 10U [5] [60] The JTWC later issued a TCFA on the system [61] By the next day, the BoM upgraded it to a category 1 tropical cyclone, and named it Tiffany [5] The JTWC subsequently followed suit and started issuing advisories on Tiffany [62] Tiffany then rapidly intensified, peaking as a Category 2 tropical cyclone in the Australian scale and a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone in the Saffir-Simpson scale [5] [63] The storm then rapidly weakened and made landfall over the Cape York Peninsula as a category 1 tropical cyclone at 06:00 UTC on 10 January Due to land interaction, it rapidly weakened overland and became a weak tropical low The low entered into the Gulf of Carpentaria with that intensity by the same night [5] Despite the moderate wind shear, Tiffany re-intensified, with the BoM upgrading the system into a category 2 tropical cyclone by 11 January [64] [5] On 00:00 UTC of 12 January, the storm made its final landfall over the Northern Territory region and was followed by rapid weakening [5] The JTWC stopped issuing advisories by the same time [65]\n\n\nTropical Low 11U\nOn 6 January, the BoM first noted the possible formation of a weak tropical low [67] By 13 January, 11U formed while moving west-southwestward, 11U dissipated by the next day [68] [69]\n\n\nTropical Low 14U\nOn 26 January, the BoM noted that a tropical low may form within a monsoon trough over the Kimberley Region [70] The agency then reported that the low was forming over the central parts of the Northern Territory on 28 January [71] As it moved slowly west over the next few days, [72] by 1 February, the BoM designated the tropical low as 14U [73] The low then weakened as it turned northwestwards, [74] before being last noted on 5 February, about 515 km (320 mi) north-northwest of Port Hedland [75]\n\n\nTropical Low 16U\nOn 28 January, the BoM noted that a tropical low may form within a monsoon trough over the Coral Sea over the next few days [77] By the next day, the agency reported that the low was forming about 250 km (160 mi) to the northeast of Cairns [78] On 30 January, the JTWC started to monitor the low and gave it a low chance of formation into a tropical cyclone [79] Under a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures, lowering wind shear and good outflow aloft, the system continued to consolidate, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA by the next day, [80] [81] before subsequently upgrading it to a tropical cyclone, and designated it as 09P [82] By 1 February, the BoM designated the low as 16U [83] However, 16U did not intensify further as a dry air entrainment hampered the system's intensification, while continuing to move east-southeast under a near-equatorial ridge positioned to the north and northeast [84] The JTWC later downgraded 16U into a tropical depression [85] On 3 February, 16U exited the basin and entered the South Pacific basin [86] [17]\n\n\nTropical Low 17U\nBy 4 February, the BoM noted that a weak tropical low may form within the vicinity of Christmas Island, and predesignated it as 17U [87] The low then subsequently formed by the next day, about 300 km (190 mi) west-southwest of Christmas Island [88] By 7 February, the JTWC started to monitor 17U, and gave it a medium chance for development within the next 24 hours [89] The BoM subsequently gave the system a low chance for development in the next 3 days [90] Under an environmment of warm sea surface temperatures, lowering vertical wind shear and fair poleward outflow, the low started to organize, with deep convection wrapping to its low-level circulation center, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA by the next day [91] However, as it moved south-southwest, [92] the wind shear started to increase, leading to its LLCC becoming exposed and the JTWC cancelling the TCFA on 10 February [93] 17U continued westwards, and was last noted by the BoM on 13 February, before exiting the basin shortly thereafter [94]\n\n\nTropical Low 19U (Fezile)\nOn 10 February, the BoM noted that a tropical low may form in the next few days to the southeast of Christmas Island, and was predesignated as 19U [95] The tropical low then developed three days later, about 600 km (370 mi) southeast of the Cocos Islands [96] 19U moved west-southwestwards, [97] before entering the South-West Indian Ocean basin on 16 February [98]\n\n\nTropical Low 20U\nOn 16 February, the BoM noted that a weak tropical low may form to the south of Papua New Guinea, and predesignated it as 20U [99] The low then subsequently formed the next day, under an unfavorable environment [100] 20U was last noted by 18 February [101]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Vernon\nOn 23 February, the BoM reported that a tropical low had developed to the southwest of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, and designated it as 22U [7] [17] By the next day, the JTWC started to monitor the low, and gave it a low chance of formation into a tropical cyclone [102] Under a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and increasing poleward outflow, the system organized further, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA at 14:00 UTC that same day [103] At 00:00 UTC on 25 February, the low intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone in the Australian scale, with the BoM naming it as Vernon [7] The JTWC subsequently started to issue advisories [104] Moving west-southwest along the northern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge to the south, Vernon went on a rapid intensification phase over the day, with BoM and JTWC upgrading Vernon into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone in the Australian scale and a category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone in the Saffir-Simpson scale respectively 12 hours later, as it developed a pinhole eye [7] [105] Vernon then intensified to a category 4 severe tropical cyclone by the next day, as it started to move out of the basin and into the South-West Indian Ocean basin [7]\n\n\nTropical Low 21U\nOn 20 February, the BoM noted a possible formation of a tropical low over the Arafura Sea, as a trough over northern Australia was expected to be more active [106] It was later predesignated as 21U [107] By 23 February, the JTWC started to monitor the low, and gave a low chance of formation in the next 24 hours [108] The BoM then reported the low was forming by the next day, near the Torres Strait, and gave a moderate chance of formation over the next 3 days [109] As the system continued to move east-southeast, [110] it never organized further, prompting the JTWC to drop the system on their bulletins by 26 February [111] 21U was last noted by the next day, moving east and exiting the basin [112]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Anika\nDuring 23 February, the BoM started to monitor an enhanced area of convection, that developed along a monsoon trough in the Timor Sea [8] The JTWC started to track the area late on the same day, and gave a low chance of formation into a tropical cyclone [113] By the next day, the convection organized into a tropical low, and the BoM designated it as 23U [17] Under a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures and pronounced outflow being offset by high wind shear, the low continued to organize, with the JTWC issuing a TCFA late on 24 February [114] At 15:00 UTC the next day, the low intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone, with the BoM naming it as Anika [8] The JTWC subsequently followed suit and upgraded the system into a tropical storm, noting deep and cold convection covering its low-level circulation center [115] By 25 January, Anika intensified to a category 2 cyclone, before making landfall in the Kimberley coast, to the east of Kalumburu at 12:00 UTC that same day As a result, the BoM downgraded Anika to an ex-tropical cyclone [8] The JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system [116]\n\n\nTropical Low 25U\nOn 26 February, Moderate Tropical Storm 08 briefly moved into the western portion of the basin while undergoing a fujiwhara interaction with Severe Tropical Cyclone Vernon, and was designated by BoM as Tropical Low 25U [120] 25U was last noted on 27 February where it moved back to the South-West Indian Ocean basin [17]\n\n\nTropical Low 26U\nOn 27 February, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 26U had formed about 295 km (183 mi) to the east of Christmas Island, and gave a low chance of formation over the next 3 days [121] The JTWC started to monitor the low the next day, and also gave a low chance of formation over the next 24 hours [122] Under a marginal environment of warm sea surface temperatures and robust outflow aloft offset by high wind shear, the low started to consolidate, prompting the agency to issue a TCFA late on 1 March [123] By the next day, the JTWC upgraded 26U to a tropical storm, designating it as 17S At that time, the system was already disorganized, with flaring convection being sheared off to the west of its exposed, elongated low-level circulation center [124] As its LLCC continued to become more exposed, and its central convection becoming more disorganized, the JTWC discontinued issuing advisories for 26U late on the same day [125] The BoM stopped monitoring the low on 4 February, as it moved southeast while continuing to weaken [126]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Billy\nOn 9 March, the BoM noted that a tropical low is expected to develop to the south of Java, Indonesia [127] The low started to develop two days later, on 11 March [128] Late on the same day, the JTWC started to monitor the low, and gave a low chance of formation as it started to organize [129] Moving west-southwestward under an environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low to moderate vertical wind shear and strong radial outflow aloft, [130] the low continued to improve, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA on 13 March, [131] before initiating advisories on Tropical Cyclone 20S late on the same day [132]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Charlotte\nOn 12 March, the BoM noted that a tropical low may form in the Arafura Sea in the next 3 days [140] The low developed 3 days later, to the north of the Northern Territory [141] As it moved westwards across Timor-Leste into the Indian Ocean, [11] the JTWC started to monitor the system on 18 March, with deep convection displaced to the west of its elongated low-level circulation center [142] Under a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low vertical wind shear and good poleward outflow aided by the upper-level westerlies associated with a mid-latitude trough to the south, [143] the low started to consolidate, prompting the agency to issue a TCFA by the next day [144] On 20 March, the BoM started to issue advisories on the low, and assigned the identifier 28U [145] The JTWC subsequently followed suit, and upgraded the low into a tropical storm, designating it as 21S [146] 28U reached tropical cyclone intensity afterwards, with the BoM naming it as Charlotte [11]\n\n\nTropical Low 30U\nOn 30 March, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 30U was developing south of Christmas Island, near 810 km (500 mi) northwest of Exmouth [12] [152] The JTWC also started to monitor the system, giving a low chance of formation in the next 24 hours [153] Although in a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low vertical wind shear and robust poleward outflow aloft, [154] the low failed to organize as shear started to increase, prompting the JTWC to drop the system on 1 April [155] The cyclone transitioned to a subtropical low at the same day as it moved south, before dissipating near Kalbarri two days later [12]\n\n\nTropical Low 32U\nAccording to a bulletin released by the Bureau of Meteorology on the morning of 8 April, a new tropical low formed in Papua New Guinea [156] It was designated as 32U 32U lost its tropical characteristics on 9 April without affecting any habitable areas [157]\n\n\nTropical Low 33U\nOn 17 April, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 33U had formed, about 155 km (96 mi) to the northwest of the Gove Peninsula [158] 33U slowly headed northwards, before the BoM stopped monitoring the low on 19 April [13]\n\n\nTropical Low 37U\nA tropical low formed 420 km (260 mi) from Christmas Island, according to the Bureau Of Meteorology technical bulletin, and was designated 34U [159] The cyclone intensified and the agency released unusual bulletins about the possibility of reaching Category 1, even though it did not pose a threat to any habitable areas [14]\n\n\nTropical Low 34U\nOn 25 April, a new low-level circulation center formed from now-classified Tropical Low 37U and tracked away to the east The BoM  assigned the identifier 34U to the system This low dissipated on 29 April [17] The system was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC in post-analysis [160]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Karim\nOn 7 May, Moderate Tropical Storm Karim entered the Australian region, and the BoM initiated advisories on the system as a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale [15] [161] At the time, the system was intensifying, with deep central convection wrapping into the system [162] By the next day, Karim further intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone [15] Late on the same day, the JTWC reported the system had reached its peak intensity [163] As it moved steadily southwards within an environment of warm sea surface temperatures, moderate wind shear and strong poleward outflow, Karim maintained its intensity throughout 9 May, before the BoM reported that Karim reached its peak intensity by the next day, with 10-minute sustained winds of 60 kn (110 km/h; 69 mph) [15] The storm then started to weaken, as it turned south-southeastwards under the influence of a near-equatorial ridge to the northwest, into an unfavorable environment of cooler sea surface temperatures and high wind shear [164] By 11 May, the BoM reclassified Karim as a subtropical low [15] The JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system as it was transitioning to an extratropical cyclone [165]\n\n\nOther systems\nThe BoM first noted the formation of a possible low-pressure system to the southwest of the island of Sumatra by 4 November [166] This forecast was materialized when the bureau started to track a weak tropical low outside the Western Region on 9 November, while located at 400 kilometres (250 mi) to the north-northeast of the Cocos Islands [167] It then entered the region by the next day while tracking slowly towards the island Environmental conditions were analyzed to be unfavorable for further development and as such, the BoM only forecast a \"very low\" chance of the low becoming a tropical cyclone [168] The tropical low then passed to the south of the archipelago before turning westwards and exiting the basin into the South-West Indian Ocean region by 14 November [169] [170] [171]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology (TCWC Melbourne) monitors all tropical cyclones that form within the Australian region, including any within the areas of responsibility of TCWC Jakarta or TCWC Port Moresby [184] Should a tropical low reach tropical cyclone strength within the BoM's area of responsibility, it will be assigned the next name from

Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) both issued a tropical cyclone outlook that discussed the upcoming season [2] [4] These outlooks took into account a variety of factors such as a developing El Niño event and what had happened in previous seasons such as 1972–73, 1982–83, 1997–98, 2009–10 and 2015–16 [2] [4] Within their seasonal outlook for the Australian region, the BoM suggested that there was an 80% chance, that the whole region between 90°E – 160°E, would be below average, having less than the long term average of 11 tropical cyclones [2] They also suggested that each of their self-defined Western, Northern, North-western and Eastern regions would see a below-average amount of tropical cyclone activity [2]\n\n\nSeason summary\nThe season officially started on 1 November, however the first system, Cyclone Jasper, would not be active until 4 December, when it crossed into the basin as a tropical low from the South Pacific The low became

2 tropical cyclone on 13 December [7]\n\n\nEarly activity\nThe season officially started on 1 November, however the first system, Cyclone Jasper, would not be active until 4 December, when it crossed into the basin as a tropical low from the South Pacific The low became a named storm on 5 December, receiving the name Jasper, [5] and intensified into the season's first severe tropical cyclone the next day [6] Jasper made landfall in Far North Queensland as a Category 2 tropical cyclone on 13 December [7]\n\n\nSeason starts\nAfter a significant lull in activity, Tropical Cyclone Anggrek and Tropical Low 03U formed on 10 and 11 January respectively, [8] [9] with the latter dissipating on 23 January [10] The next day, Cyclone Kirrily formed [11] Tropical Low 06U formed on 30 January, dancing out of basin the next day and waltzing back in on 5 February [1] [12] Tropical Cyclone Lincoln formed on 16 February and made landfall on the Gulf of Carpentaria coast [13] Severe Tropical Cyclone Neville formed north of the Cocos Islands [14] on 1 March and left the basin 20 days later [15] Severe Tropical Cyclone Megan formed on 13 March from a tropical low over the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria [16] Short-lived Tropical Low 10U formed and weakened within the same day of 14 March [17] Severe Tropical Cyclone Olga formed within a monsoon trough south of Sumba [18] [19] on 4 April Tropical Cyclone Paul formed 5 days later over the Louisiade Archipelago [20] Tropical Low 12U formed on 12 April and remained traceable [21]\n\n\nOff-season\nThe season ended with Tropical Low 16U, formed on 4 May and weakened the next day [22]\n\n\nSystems\nOn 2 December, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Disturbance 03F, which was re-designated as Tropical Low 02U, had formed in the South Pacific Ocean in Fiji's area of responsibility [23] Two days later, on 00:00 UTC of 4 December, the system would enter the Australian area of responsibility [24] [25] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) later that day, projecting a high likelihood of a significant tropical cyclone developing [26] Later the next day, the JTWC subsequently initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 03P [27] The BoM subsequently followed suit and upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, naming it Jasper [5] Jasper started to track southward under the steering influence of a near equatorial ridge to the east [28] During the next day, the cyclone's centre continued to organise, with deep convective bands starting to wrap around the centre, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system to a Category 1 hurricane [29] Jasper rapidly intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, [6] due to being in an environment with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear The next day, it further intensified, becoming a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone [30] Operationally, the BoM classified Jasper as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), but during post-cyclone reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 215 km/h (130 mph) based on Synthetic-aperture radar measurements [1] [31] Shortly thereafter, Jasper began weakening, with its eye becoming cloud-filled and the deep convection eroding due to dry air entrainment [32] Jasper would reintensify, and at 12:00 UTC on 13 December, made landfall as a Category 2 tropical cyclone in Wujal Wujal, Queensland [7] After making landfall, the JTWC discontinue warnings on the system later that day [33] By 14:00 UTC that day, the BoM reported that Jasper had weakened to a tropical low [34] However, Jasper remained traceable, and the BoM would give the tropical low a moderate chance of redeveloping into a tropical cyclone on 15 December [35] However, they would soon downgrade its chances of re-developing into a very low as the storm turned southeast further inland, causing the tropical low to rapidly weaken, and on 18 December, Jasper was last noted over the Cape York Peninsula [36]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Jasper\nOn 2 December, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Disturbance 03F, which was re-designated as Tropical Low 02U, had formed in the South Pacific Ocean in Fiji's area of responsibility [23] Two days later, on 00:00 UTC of 4 December, the system would enter the Australian area of responsibility [24] [25] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) later that day, projecting a high likelihood of a significant tropical cyclone developing [26] Later the next day, the JTWC subsequently initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 03P [27] The BoM subsequently followed suit and upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, naming it Jasper [5] Jasper started to track southward under the steering influence of a near equatorial ridge to the east [28] During the next day, the cyclone's centre continued to organise, with deep convective bands starting to wrap around the centre, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system to a Category 1 hurricane [29] Jasper rapidly intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, [6] due to being in an environment with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear The next day, it further intensified, becoming a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone [30] Operationally, the BoM classified Jasper as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), but during post-cyclone reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 215 km/h (130 mph) based on Synthetic-aperture radar measurements [1] [31] Shortly thereafter, Jasper began weakening, with its eye becoming cloud-filled and the deep convection eroding due to dry air entrainment [32] Jasper would reintensify, and at 12:00 UTC on 13 December, made landfall as a Category 2 tropical cyclone in Wujal Wujal, Queensland [7] After making landfall, the JTWC discontinue warnings on the system later that day [33] By 14:00 UTC that day, the BoM reported that Jasper had weakened to a tropical low [34] However, Jasper remained traceable, and the BoM would give the tropical low a moderate chance of redeveloping into a tropical cyclone on 15 December [35] However, they would soon downgrade its chances of re-developing into a very low as the storm turned southeast further inland, causing the tropical low to rapidly weaken, and on 18 December, Jasper was last noted over the Cape York Peninsula [36]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Anggrek\nOn 9 January, the BoM noted that a tropical low could form in the Indian Ocean, designating it as 04U [40] Later the next day, the BoM reported that it had formed to the northwest of the Cocos Islands [41] On 11 January, the JTWC followed suit in monitoring the system, after convection had significantly consolidated around the circulation [42] Three days later, the agency issued a TCFA, for the disturbance as it was situated in an environment of warm waters, low shear, and good outflow [43] By 15 January, the JTWC began issuing advisories, recognising it as Tropical Cyclone 06S after its circulation had improved, [44]  with the BoM subsequently followed suit and upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone [45]  Since the cyclone was within their area of responsibility, Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) named the system Anggrek [46] It tracked southeast before changing direction and tracking west [47] Anggrek remained nearly stationary due to weak steering ridges to the north and southwest, the system generated upwelling, causing sea surface temperatures to decrease [48] Despite that, Anggrek steadily re-intensified, [49] and after entering favourable conditions on 24 January, became a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with estimated maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph), and a central barometric pressure of 968 hPa (28.59 inHg) [50] [51] while the system's depiction showed that tightly circulating around a ragged eye [52] The next day, the system exited the basin towards the South West Indian Ocean [53]\n\n\nTropical Low 03U\nOn 7 January, the BoM noted the possibility of a tropical low forming near the north Kimberley, as a monsoon trough was expected to develop along the Top End It was predesignated as 03U [54] This came to fruition 4 days later, when the BoM reported that it was developing over the southern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf within the trough [9] As the tropical low tracked overland, the system maintained a robust outflow channel in the upper troposphere [55] The BoM continued to monitor the low as it moved slowly southeast, [56] then turning west towards Western Australia by 20 January, [57] until they determined that it would not develop into a tropical cyclone on 23 January [58] [59]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Kirrily\nThe BoM noted the possibility of a tropical low forming within the monsoon trough over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 9 January, designating it as 05U [62] Three days later, the BoM reported that it was developing over the eastern portion of the gulf [63] By 17 January, the JTWC began monitoring the low [64] Two days later, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system [65] By 21 January, the BoM started issuing warnings on the system [66] By 23 January, the JTWC followed suit, recognising it as Tropical Cyclone 07P [67] The next day, the BoM upgraded the low into a  Category 1 tropical cyclone, naming it Kirrily [68] Deep convection shifted to the western side of Kirrily's circulation, though its centre remained well defined [69] It subsequently intensified to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, [70] the JTWC followed suit the system and upgraded it to a Category 1 hurricane, [71] prior to landfall over Townsville, Australia on 25 January [72] Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system [72] The next day, the BoM discontinued warnings [73] However, Kirrily remained traceable, as it moved westwards towards the Queensland region throughout the rest of January [74] The JTWC began monitoring the remnants of Kirrily for potential regeneration as the system developed a partially exposed low-level circulation centre (LLCC) [75] Early the next day, they issued a TCFA for the remnants [76] The disturbance later regenerated into a tropical cyclone; the system showed a consolidating LLCC with convective banding and a central dense overcast (CDO) [77] Since the system only produced near-gale-force winds in the Gulf of Carpentaria, the BoM determined that the low was not expected to redevelop into a tropical cyclone [78] By 2 February, the JTWC discontinued their advisories again, as the storm accelerated inland with the rainbands unraveling and warming cloud tops, [79] until it was last noted on the BoM tropical cyclone outlooks by the next day [80]\n\n\nTropical Low 06U\nOn 29 January, the BoM noted that a subtropical low was expected to form off the coast of Eastern Australia in a few days, designating it as 06U [83] The next day, the BoM began monitoring the low as it was developing in the eastern portion of the basin, about 125 km (80 mi) to the northeast of Kgari in Queensland, Australia [1] [84] [85] Over the next couple of days, the system moved north-eastwards and moved into the South Pacific basin during 1 February, where it was classified as Tropical Disturbance 05F by the Fiji Meteorological Service [1] [12] At this stage, the system was located in an area of moderate vertical wind shear and good upper-level divergence about 675 km (420 mi) to the northwest of Nouméa in New Caledonia, while atmospheric convection persisted over the system's LLCC [12] After meandering outside the basin for several days, the system re-entered the basin as a tropical low [86] Environmental conditions were assessed as being marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea surface temperatures near 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) and low vertical wind shear [87]  It again exited the basin on 7 February, as the storm was struggling due to moderate wind shear [88]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Lincoln\n\nDuring February 2024, the presence of the Madden–Julian Oscillation and an equatorial Indian Ocean in the Australian region contributed to the formation of Tropical Low 07U in the monsoon trough over the western Gulf of Carpentaria, [89] [90] [91] approximately 419 km (260 mi) to the east-southeast of Darwin in the Northern Territory during 14 February [92] [90] Initially located in an favourable environment for intensification, the tropical low began to encounter somewhat improved conditions [93] As the tropical low tracked slowly moving towards the coast, consolidating LLCC with convection started to develop and was wrapping toward the centre [94] By 15 February, at 14:30 UTC, the JTWC issued a TCFA, noting that the system was in a favourable environment with low wind shear and sea surface temperatures exceeding 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) [95] The agency later issued its first warning on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 14P [96] The BoM followed suit—officially upgrading the system to a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigning the name Lincoln [97] Lincoln had a partially exposed LLCC with core convection confined to the western edge of the cyclone [98] Lincoln made landfall on the Gulf of Carpentaria coast between Port McArthur and the Northern Territory—Queensland border just after 06:00 UTC on 16 February [99] Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system [100] Later that day, the BoM followed suit and released its last advisory as the system degenerated into a tropical low [101] However, Lincoln remained traceable, and the BoM would give the system a high chance of redeveloping into a tropical cyclone on 18 February [102] The following day, the tropical low continued moving west-southwest, aided by a ridge to the south, across inland parts of the Northern Territory [89] By 21 February, the remnants of Lincoln turned westward into the offshore of the Kimberley coast and began to re-organise, resulting deep convection to the north [103] The JTWC re-issued a TCFA for the system at 07:30 UTC as the formative convective banding was wrapping into a defined circulation [104] With an increase in convective banding on the southern of the cyclone's circulation, [105]  the JTWC re-initiated advisories on the storm approximately 446 km (275 mi) northeast of Learmonth at 03:00 UTC on 22 February [106] Turning northwest as it approached Western Australia, the storm failed to organised its deep convection [107] By 24 February, the JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its circulation became exposed [108] The storm then crossed just south of Coral Bay on the Australian northwestern coastline just after 12:00 UTC that day, before moving inland across Gascoyne and dissipating shortly afterward [109] [110] Tropical Cyclone Lincoln was the first tropical cyclone to form in the Gulf of the Carpentaria since Tropical Cyclone Alfred in February 2017 [111]\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Neville\nOn 1 March, the BoM started to monitor a possible tropical low to the north of the Cocos Islands within the monsoon trough, designating it as 08U [112] An increased monsoon flow over the Indian Ocean towards Indonesia prompted the agency to report that the tropical low was forming on 4 March, within an unfavourable environment for further development [113] [114] By 10 March, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the tropical low after noting that its deep convection continued to build in the southern and central regions over the system's LLCC, and the next day, it recognised the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S [115] [116] Afterwards, subsidence and high vertical wind shear caused the system to struggle to intensify, leaving the LLLC exposed [117] [118] Although convection continued to fluctuate in the system, deep convection continued to improve near the centre [119] By 18 March, the JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its structure was to be disorganised [120] During the next day, the tropical low began to displace to the south of the LLLC, the JTWC resumed monitoring the system [121] The LLCC started to re–develop with deep convective bands wrapping into it, the JTWC re-initiated advisories approximately 341 km (210 mi) northwest of Learmonth at 03:00 UTC on 20 March [122] Later that day, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Neville [123] Neville intensified shortly after, with an eye forming on microwave imagery [124] A pinhole eye briefly emerged on infrared and visible satellite imagery as a ragged feature at the cyclone's centre, surrounded by well-defined rainbands [125] Neville reached peak intensity at 06:00 UTC the following day as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone, with ten-minute sustained winds estimated at 175 km/h (110 mph), and a central barometric pressure of 952 hPa (28.11 inHg) [126] [127] The JTWC estimated that the system was generating one-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph), equivalent to a low-end Category 4 major hurricane [128] Afterward, the storm's eye becoming cloud-filled caused Neville to gradually weaken as its track shifted west-southwestward [129] Neville's eye disappeared from satellite imagery and the cloud tops of the central dense overcast warming [130] Not long afterward, the storm began to deteriorate due to cooler waters, increasing vertical wind, and dry air entrainment The BoM downgraded the storm to a vigorous gale-force tropical low on 24 March [131] [132] Around this time, Ex-Tropical Cyclone Neville assumed a more consistent course towards the southwest, and crossed over the 90th meridian east into the South-West Indian Ocean [133]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Megan\nOn 4 March, the BoM noted the formation of a tropical low over south of Indonesia's Sumatra or Java, designating it as 09U [135] Over the next couple of days, the BoM reported that it was developing over the western Timor Sea within the trough [136] Analysis from the JTWC indicated that the disturbance was in a favourable environment for development—featuring sea surface temperatures of 29 to 31 °C (84 to 88 °F), and low to moderate wind shear [137] By 15 March, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the tropical low and warned that there was a high potential for the disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone [138] The tropical low moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, [139] whereupon it gradually organised and began to intensify [140] The same day, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Cyclone 19S, approximately 367 km (230 mi) east of Darwin, Northern Territory [141] Later the next day, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Megan [142] Rapid intensification began the same day, with Megan reaching Category 2 tropical cyclone [143] The BoM upgraded the storm to a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC, [144] Operationally, the BoM classified Megan a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone with winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), but during post-cyclone reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 165 km/h (105 mph) based on Synthetic-aperture radar measurements [145] [146] Gradually approaching the southwestern coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, [147] the JTWC indicated that one-minute sustained winds had reached 185 km/h (115 mph), equivalent to a Category 3 major hurricane on the SSHWS [148] Megan made landfall on the southwestern Gulf of Carpentaria coast just after 06:00 UTC on 18 March [149] Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system [150] After moving ashore, the cyclone turned generally southeast and tracked along the inland of Borroloola [151] [152] The following day, the system was downgraded to a tropical low by the BoM as it approached the inland coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria [153] Ex-Tropical Cyclone Megan moved inland, tracking across the Northern Territory, before the BoM stopped monitoring the low on 21 March [154] [155]\n\n\nTropical Low 10U\nOn 12 March, the BoM started to monitor a possible tropical low within the monsoon trough off the eastern Top End in the Gulf of Carpentaria, designating it as 10U [157] Over the next couple of days, the tropical low remained poorly organised [158] By 14 March, the BoM reported that a tropical low had developed within a monsoon trough east of Cape York Peninsula [159] Later that day, the BoM stopped monitoring the low, as it moved southeast off the coast while continuing to weaken [160]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Olga\nOn 4 April, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 11U had developed within a monsoonal trough over the south of Indonesia's Sumba [161] [162] The JTWC assessed environmental conditions as being favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, with good poleward outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 to 31 °C (86 to 88 °F) being offset by the effects of low to moderate vertical wind shear [163] Convective activity began organising into a symmetrical circulation, which prompted the JTWC to issue a TCFA on the disturbance as it tracked southwestwards into a favourable environment [164] [165] By 5 April, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 21S, about 642 km (400 mi) northwest of Learmonth, Western Australia [166] Later the next day, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Olga as its deep convection had organised significantly along with improved curvature of its bands [167] [168] The system developed a central dense overcast and a weak-developing eye [169] The same day, Olga intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, while the JTWC upgraded Olga to the equivalent of a low-end Category 1 hurricane with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) [170] [171] By the following day, the storm had undergone rapid intensification to attain its peak strength with sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph)—equivalent to a  Category 5 severe tropical cyclone—and an estimated central pressure of 933 hPa (27.55 inHg) [172] [173] The JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at this time to have been 220 km/h (140 mph)—equivalent to a Category 4 major hurricane [174] Operationally, the BoM classified Olga as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), but during post-cyclone reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 205 km/h (125 mph) based on Dvorak technique measurements [1] [31] Upon reaching its peak, Olga entered a phase of steady weakening, whereby its eye disappeared from satellite imagery [175] By 8 April, the cyclone began to encounter increasing west-northwesterly shear coupled with dry air entrainment [176] Deep convection becoming displaced to the southeast of an increasingly-exposed LLLC [177] Olga was re-classified as a tropical low by the BoM at 18:00 UTC on 9 April, despite still producing gale-force winds [178] [179] By the following day, the JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its gale-force winds soon became confined to the southern quadrant as the low became devoid of deep convection, leaving the LLLC exposed [180] Shortly after, the BoM stopped monitoring the low, as it moved southwest while continuing to weaken [181]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Paul\nOn 9 April, the BoM reported that a Tropical Low 13U had formed over the Louisiade Archipelago [182] The tropical low depicted flaring consolidated convection to the LLLC [183] The same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA, noting a deep convective banding wrapping into a circulation centre [184] Shortly after, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Paul [185] The JTWC followed suit, initiated advisories on the system, and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 22S [186] Paul featured a ragged central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organised, obscuring the LLCC, with the BoM upgrading the storm to a Category 2 tropical cyclone [187] Paul then peaked at 12:00 UTC on 11 April, with 10-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph), and a central barometric pressure of 994 hPa (29.35 inHg) [188] [189] Flaring deep convection became disorganised into a weakly-defined centre due to increasing westerly wind shear [190] The system was downgraded to a tropical low by the BoM at 00:00 UTC on 12 April [191] The JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its circulation became disorganised [192] The circulation of Paul had dissipated on the same day [193] [194]\n\n\nTropical Low 12U\nOn 4 April, the BoM noted that a weak tropical low could form in the Arafura Sea, designating it as 12U [195] It remained traceable, and the BoM would give the developing tropical low an increased chance of developing into a tropical cyclone [196] By 11 April, the BoM reported that the probability of becoming a tropical cyclogenesis had decreased due to model guidance [197] As the system continued to move westwards, it organized further, prompting the tropical low to develop a weak circulation [198] By 14 April, the BoM stopped monitoring the low as it moved westwards near East Timor while continuing to weaken [199]\n\n\nTropical Low 16U\nTowards the end of the Australian season, the BoM noted that a tropical low was expected to form north of the Australian Region and also gave the system a 15% chance of tropical cyclogenesis within a few days, designating it as 16U [200] On 4 May, the BoM reported that it was developing over the Banda Sea [201] At this stage, the system was located in an area of low vertical wind shear and good upper-level divergence to the northwest of Gove Airport in Australia, while atmospheric isolated convection persisted over the system before the BoM stopped monitoring the tropical low [202] [203]\n\n\nOther systems\nThe United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that Cyclone Djoungou entered the Australian region after crossing the 90th meridian east from the South-West Indian Ocean basin at 18:00 UTC on 19 February, located approximately 1,271 kilometres (790 mi) to the west-southwest of Learmonth, Western Australia [204] Upon entering the region, the Météo-France (MFR) issued its last advisory on Djoungou as it transitioned into a post-tropical depression [205] The system had commenced upon entering the region due to the effects of hostile vertical wind shear of 35–40 kn (65–74 km/h) [206]  At this time, the JTWC assessed the system as a subtropical cyclone, with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 55 km/h (35 mph) The JTWC subsequently issued its final advisory on Djoungou, as its circulation became fully exposed [204]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology (TCWC Melbourne) monitors all tropical cyclones that form within the Australian region, including any within the areas of responsibility of

Australian region cyclone season was a period of the year when tropical cyclones formed in the Australian region, which included areas of the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean. The season officially started on 1 November and ended on 30 April.\n\n# Season Forecasts\n\nAhead of the season officially starting on 1 November, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) and New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) both issued a tropical cyclone outlook that discussed the upcoming season. These outlooks took into account a variety of factors such as a developing El Niño event and what had happened in previous seasons such as 1972–73, 1982–83, 1997–98, 2009–10, and 2015–16. Within their seasonal outlook for the Australian region, the BoM suggested that there was an 80% chance that the whole region between 90°E and 160°E would be below average, having less than the long-term average of 11 tropical cyclones. They also suggested that each of their self-defined Western, Northern, North-western, and Eastern regions would see a below-average amount of tropical cyclone activity.\n\n# Season Summary\n\nThe season officially started on 1 November, however the first system, Cyclone Jasper, would not be active until 4 December, when it crossed into the basin as a tropical low from the South Pacific. The low became a named storm on 5 December, receiving the name Jasper, and intensified into the season's first severe tropical cyclone the next day. Jasper made landfall in Far North Queensland as a Category 2 tropical cyclone on 13 December.\n\n# Early Activity\n\nThe season officially started on 1 November, however the first system, Cyclone Jasper, would not be active until 4 December, when it crossed into the basin as a tropical low from the South Pacific. The low became a named storm on 5 December, receiving the name Jasper, and intensified into the season's first severe tropical cyclone the next day. Jasper made landfall in Far North Queensland as a Category 2 tropical cyclone on 13 December.\n\n## Tropical Cyclone Jasper\n\nOn 2 December, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Disturbance 03F, which was re-designated as Tropical Low 02U, had formed in the South Pacific Ocean in Fiji's area of responsibility. Two days later, on 00:00 UTC of 4 December, the system would enter the Australian area of responsibility. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) later that day, projecting a high likelihood of a significant tropical cyclone developing. Later the next day, the JTWC subsequently initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 03P. The BoM subsequently followed suit and upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, naming it Jasper. Jasper started to track southward under the steering influence of a near equatorial ridge to the east. During the next day, the cyclone's centre continued to organise, with deep convective bands starting to wrap around the centre, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system to a Category 1 hurricane. Jasper rapidly intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, due to being in an environment with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. The next day, it further intensified, becoming a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone. Operationally, the BoM classified Jasper as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), but during post-cyclone reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 215 km/h (130 mph) based on Synthetic-aperture radar measurements. Shortly thereafter, Jasper began weakening, with its eye becoming cloud-filled and the deep convection eroding due to dry air entrainment. Jasper would reintensify, and at 12:00 UTC on 13 December, made landfall as a Category 2 tropical cyclone in Wujal Wujal, Queensland.\n\n## Tropical Low 03U\n\nOn 7 January, the BoM noted the possibility of a tropical low forming near the north Kimberley, as a monsoon trough was expected to develop along the Top End. This came to fruition 4 days later, when the BoM reported that it was developing over the southern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf within the trough. As the tropical low tracked overland, the system maintained a robust outflow channel in the upper troposphere. The BoM continued to monitor the low as it moved slowly southeast, then turning west towards Western Australia by 20 January, until they determined that it would not develop into a tropical cyclone on 23 January.\n\n## Tropical Cyclone Kirrily\n\nThe BoM noted the possibility of a tropical low forming within the monsoon trough over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 9 January, designating it as 05U. Three days later, the BoM reported that it was developing over the eastern portion of the gulf. By 17 January, the JTWC began monitoring the low. Two days later, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system. By 21 January, the BoM started issuing warnings on the system. By 23 January, the JTWC followed suit, recognising it as Tropical Cyclone 07P. The next day, the BoM upgraded the low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone, naming it Kirrily. Deep convection shifted to the western side of Kirrily's circulation, though its centre remained well defined. It subsequently intensified to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone. Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system. However, Kirrily remained traceable, as it moved westwards towards the Queensland region throughout the rest of January. The JTWC began monitoring the remnants of Kirrily for potential regeneration as the system developed a partially exposed low-level circulation centre (LLCC). Early the next day, they issued a TCFA for the remnants. The disturbance later regenerated into a tropical cyclone; the system showed a consolidating LLCC with convective banding and a central dense overcast (CDO). Since the system only produced near-gale-force winds in the Gulf of Carpentaria, the BoM determined that the low was not expected to redevelop into a tropical cyclone. By 2 February, the JTWC discontinued their advisories again, as the storm accelerated inland with the rainbands unraveling and warming cloud tops, until it was last noted on the BoM tropical cyclone outlooks by the next day.\n\n## Tropical Low 06U\n\nOn 29 January, the BoM noted that a subtropical low was expected to form off the coast of Eastern Australia in a few days, designating it as 06U. The next day, the BoM began monitoring the low as it was developing in the eastern portion of the basin, about 125 km (80 mi) to the northeast of Kgari in Queensland, Australia. Over the next couple of days, the system moved north-eastwards and moved into the South Pacific basin during 1 February, where it was classified as Tropical Disturbance 05F by the Fiji Meteorological Service. At this stage, the system was located in an area of moderate vertical wind shear and good upper-level divergence about 675 km (420 mi) to the northwest of Nouméa in New Caledonia, while atmospheric convection persisted over the system's LLCC. After meandering outside the basin for several days, the system re-entered the basin as a tropical low. Environmental conditions were assessed as being marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea surface temperatures near 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) and low vertical wind shear. It again exited the basin on 7 February, as the storm was struggling due to moderate wind shear.\n\n## Tropical Cyclone Lincoln\n\nDuring February 2024, the presence of the Madden–Julian Oscillation and an equatorial Indian Ocean in the Australian region contributed to the formation of Tropical Low 07U in the monsoon trough over the western Gulf of Carpentaria. The tropical low began to encounter somewhat improved conditions as it tracked slowly moving towards the coast. By 15 February, at 14:30 UTC, the JTWC issued a TCFA, noting that the system was in a favourable environment with low wind shear and sea surface temperatures exceeding 29–30 °C (84–86 °F). The agency later issued its first warning on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 14P. The BoM followed suit—officially upgrading the system to a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigning the name Lincoln. Lincoln had a partially exposed LLCC with core convection confined to the western edge of the cyclone. Lincoln made landfall on the Gulf of Carpentaria coast between Port McArthur and the Northern Territory–Queensland border just after 06:00 UTC on 16 February. Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system. Later that day, the BoM followed suit and released its last advisory as the system degenerated into a tropical low. However, Lincoln remained traceable, and the BoM would give the system a high chance of redeveloping into a tropical cyclone on 18 February. The following day, the tropical low continued moving west-southwest, aided by a ridge to the south, across inland parts of the Northern Territory. By 21 February, the remnants of Lincoln turned westward into the offshore of the Kimberley coast and began to re-organise, resulting in deep convection to the north. The JTWC re-issued a TCFA for the system at 07:30 UTC as the formative convective banding was wrapping into a defined circulation. With an increase in convective banding on the southern of the cyclone's circulation, the JTWC re-initiated advisories on the storm approximately 446 km (275 mi) northeast of Learmonth at 03:00 UTC on 22 February. Turning northwest as it approached Western Australia, the storm failed to organise its deep convection. By 24 February, the JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its circulation became exposed. The storm then crossed just south of Coral Bay on the Australian northwestern coastline just after 12:00 UTC that day, before moving inland across Gascoyne and dissipating shortly afterward.\n\n## Severe Tropical Cyclone Neville\n\nOn 1 March, the BoM started to monitor a possible tropical low to the north of the Cocos Islands within the monsoon trough, designating it as 08U. An increased monsoon flow over the Indian Ocean towards Indonesia prompted the agency to report that the tropical low was forming on 4 March, within an unfavourable environment for further development. By 10 March, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the tropical low after noting that its deep convection continued to build in the southern and central regions over the system's LLCC. The next day, it recognised the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S. Afterwards, subsidence and high vertical wind shear caused the system to struggle to intensify, leaving the LLCC exposed. Although convection continued to fluctuate in the system, deep convection continued to improve near the centre. By 18 March, the JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its structure was to be disorganised. During the next day, the tropical low began to displace to the south of the LLCC, the JTWC resumed monitoring the system. The LLCC started to re–develop with deep convective bands wrapping into it, the JTWC re-initiated advisories approximately 341 km (210 mi) northwest of Learmonth at 03:00 UTC on 20 March. Later that day, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Neville. Neville intensified shortly after, with an eye forming on microwave imagery. A pinhole eye briefly emerged on infrared and visible satellite imagery as a ragged feature at the cyclone's centre, surrounded by well-defined rainbands. Neville reached peak intensity at 06:00 UTC the following day as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone, with ten-minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), and a central barometric pressure of 952 hPa (28.11 inHg). The JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at this time to have been 215 km/h (130 mph), equivalent to a low-end Category 4 major hurricane. Afterward, the storm's eye becoming cloud-filled caused Neville to gradually weaken as its track shifted west-southwestward. Neville's eye disappeared from satellite imagery and the cloud tops of the central dense overcast warming. Not long afterward, the storm began to deteriorate due to cooler waters, increasing vertical wind, and dry air entrainment. The BoM downgraded the storm to a vigorous gale-force tropical low on 24 March. Around this time, Ex-Tropical Cyclone Neville assumed a more consistent course towards the southwest, and crossed over the 90th meridian east into the South-West Indian Ocean.\n\n## Severe Tropical Cyclone Megan\n\nOn 4 March, the BoM noted the formation of a tropical low over south of Indonesia's Sumatra or Java, designating it as 09U. Over the next couple of days, the BoM reported that it was developing over the western Timor Sea within the trough. Analysis from the JTWC indicated that the disturbance was in a favourable environment for development—featuring sea surface temperatures of 29 to 31 °C (84 to 88 °F), and low to moderate wind shear. By 15 March, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the tropical low and warned that there was a high potential for the disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone. The tropical low moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, whereupon it gradually organised and began to intensify. The same day, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Cyclone 19S, approximately 367 km (230 mi) east of Darwin, Northern Territory. Later the next day, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Megan. Rapid intensification began the same day, with Megan reaching Category 2 tropical cyclone. The BoM upgraded the storm to a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC, Operationally, the BoM classified Megan a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone with winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), but during post-cyclone reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 165 km/h (105 mph) based on Synthetic-aperture radar measurements. Gradually approaching the southwestern coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, the JTWC indicated that one-minute sustained winds had reached 185 km/h (115 mph), equivalent to a Category 3 major hurricane on the SSHWS. Megan made landfall on the southwestern Gulf of Carpentaria coast just after 06:00 UTC on 18 March. Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system. After moving ashore, the cyclone turned generally southeast and tracked along the inland of Borroloola. The following day, the system was downgraded to a tropical low by the BoM as it approached the inland coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Ex-Tropical Cyclone Megan moved inland, tracking across the Northern Territory, before the BoM stopped monitoring the low on 21 March.\n\n## Tropical Low 10U\n\nOn 12 March, the BoM started to monitor a possible tropical low within the monsoon trough off the eastern Top End in the Gulf of Carpentaria, designating it as 10U. Over the next couple of days, the tropical low remained poorly organised. By 14 March, the BoM reported that a tropical low had developed within a monsoon trough east of Cape York Peninsula. Later that day, the BoM stopped monitoring the low, as it moved southeast off the coast while continuing to weaken.\n\n## Severe Tropical Cyclone Olga\n\nOn 4 April, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 11U had developed within a monsoonal trough over the south of Indonesia's Sumba. The JTWC assessed environmental conditions as being favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, with good poleward outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 to 31 °C (86 to 88 °F) being offset by the effects of low to moderate vertical wind shear. Convective activity began organising into a symmetrical circulation, which prompted the JTWC to issue a TCFA on the disturbance as it tracked southwestwards into a favourable environment. By 5 April, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 21S, about 642 km (400 mi) northwest of Learmonth, Western Australia. Later the next day, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Olga as its deep convection had organised significantly along with improved curvature of its bands. The system developed a central dense overcast and a weak-developing eye. The same day, Olga intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, while the JTWC upgraded Olga to the equivalent of a low-end Category 1 hurricane with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). By the following day, the storm had undergone rapid intensification to attain its peak strength with sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph)—equivalent to a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone—and an estimated central pressure of 933 hPa (27.55 inHg). The JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at this time to have been 220 km/h (140 mph)—equivalent to a Category 4 major hurricane. Upon reaching its peak, Olga entered a phase of steady weakening, whereby its eye disappeared from satellite imagery. By 8 April, the cyclone began to encounter increasing west-northwesterly shear coupled with dry air entrainment. Deep convection becoming displaced to the southeast of an increasingly-exposed LLCC. Olga was re-classified as a tropical low by the BoM at 18:00 UTC on 9 April, despite still producing gale-force winds. By the following day, the JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its gale-force winds soon became confined to the southern quadrant as the low became devoid of deep convection, leaving the LLCC exposed. Shortly after, the BoM stopped monitoring the low, as it moved southwest while continuing to weaken.\n\n## Tropical Cyclone Paul\n\nOn 9 April, the BoM reported that a Tropical Low 13U had formed over the Louisiade Archipelago. The tropical low depicted flaring consolidated convection to the LLCC. The same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA, noting a deep convective banding wrapping into a circulation centre. Shortly after, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Paul. The JTWC followed suit, initiated advisories on the system, and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 22S. Paul featured a ragged central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organised, obscuring the LLCC, with the BoM upgrading the storm to a Category 2 tropical cyclone. Paul then peaked at 12:00 UTC on 11 April, with 10-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph), and a central barometric pressure of 994 hPa (29.35 inHg). Flaring deep convection became dis", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023–24_Australian_region_cyclone_season\" following this outline:\n\n\nSeason forecasts\nAhead of the season officially starting on 1 November, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) and New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) both issued a tropical cyclone outlook that discussed the upcoming season [2] [4] These outlooks took into account a variety of factors such as a developing El Niño event and what had happened in previous seasons such as 1972–73, 1982–83, 1997–98, 2009–10 and 2015–16 [2] [4] Within their seasonal outlook for the Australian region, the BoM suggested that there was an 80% chance, that the whole region between 90°E – 160°E, would be below average, having less than the long term average of 11 tropical cyclones [2] They also suggested that each of their self-defined Western, Northern, North-western and Eastern regions would see a below-average amount of tropical cyclone activity [2]\n\n\nSeason summary\nThe season officially started on 1 November, however the first system, Cyclone Jasper, would not be active until 4 December, when it crossed into the basin as a tropical low from the South Pacific The low became a named storm on 5 December, receiving the name Jasper, [5] and intensified into the season's first severe tropical cyclone the next day [6] Jasper made landfall in Far North Queensland as a Category 2 tropical cyclone on 13 December [7]\n\n\nEarly activity\nThe season officially

tropical cyclone on 13 December [7]\n\n\nSeason starts\nAfter a significant lull in activity, Tropical Cyclone Anggrek and Tropical Low 03U formed on 10 and 11 January respectively, [8] [9] with the latter dissipating on 23 January [10] The next day, Cyclone Kirrily formed [11] Tropical Low 06U formed on 30 January, dancing out of basin the next day and waltzing back in on 5 February [1] [12] Tropical Cyclone Lincoln formed on 16 February and made landfall on the Gulf of Carpentaria coast [13] Severe Tropical Cyclone Neville formed north of the Cocos Islands [14] on 1 March and left the basin 20 days later [15] Severe Tropical Cyclone Megan formed on 13 March from a tropical low over the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria [16] Short-lived Tropical Low 10U formed and weakened within the

Tropical Low 12U formed on 12 April and remained traceable [21]\n\n\nOff-season\nThe season ended with Tropical Low 16U, formed on 4 May and weakened the next day [22]\n\n\nSystems\nOn 2 December, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Disturbance 03F, which was re-designated as Tropical Low 02U, had formed in the South Pacific Ocean in Fiji's area of responsibility [23] Two days later, on 00:00 UTC of 4 December, the system would enter the Australian area of responsibility [24] [25] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) later that day, projecting a high likelihood of a significant tropical cyclone developing [26] Later the next day, the JTWC subsequently initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 03P [27] The BoM subsequently followed suit and upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, naming it Jasper [5] Jasper started to track southward under the steering influence of a near equatorial ridge to the east [28] During the next day, the cyclone's centre continued to organise, with deep convective bands starting to wrap around the centre, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system to a Category 1 hurricane [29] Jasper rapidly intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, [6] due to being in an environment with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear The next day, it further intensified, becoming a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone [30] Operationally, the BoM classified Jasper as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), but during post-cyclone reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 215 km/h (130 mph) based on Synthetic-aperture radar measurements [1] [31] Shortly thereafter, Jasper began weakening, with its eye becoming cloud-filled and the deep convection eroding due to dry air entrainment [32] Jasper would reintensify, and at 12:00 UTC on 13 December, made landfall as a Category 2 tropical cyclone in Wujal Wujal, Queensland [7] After making landfall, the JTWC discontinue warnings on the system later that day [33] By 14:00 UTC that day, the BoM reported that Jasper had weakened to a tropical low [34] However, Jasper remained traceable, and the BoM would give the tropical low a moderate chance of redeveloping into a tropical cyclone on 15 December [35] However, they would soon downgrade its chances of re-developing into a very low as the storm turned southeast further inland, causing the tropical low to rapidly weaken, and on 18 December, Jasper was last noted over the Cape York Peninsula [36]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Jasper\nOn 2 December, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Disturbance 03F, which was re-designated as Tropical Low 02U, had formed in the South Pacific Ocean in Fiji's area of responsibility [23] Two days later, on 00:00 UTC of 4 December, the system would enter the Australian area of responsibility [24] [25] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) later that day, projecting a high likelihood of a significant tropical cyclone developing [26] Later the next day, the JTWC subsequently initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 03P [27] The BoM subsequently followed suit and upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, naming it Jasper [5] Jasper started to track southward under the steering influence of a near equatorial ridge to the east [28] During the next day, the cyclone's centre continued to organise, with deep convective bands starting to wrap around the centre, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system to a Category 1 hurricane [29] Jasper rapidly intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, [6] due to being in an environment with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear The next day, it further intensified, becoming a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone [30] Operationally, the BoM classified Jasper as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), but during post-cyclone reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 215 km/h (130 mph) based on Synthetic-aperture radar measurements [1] [31] Shortly thereafter, Jasper began weakening, with its eye becoming cloud-filled and the deep convection eroding due to dry air entrainment [32] Jasper would reintensify, and at 12:00 UTC on 13 December, made landfall as a Category 2 tropical cyclone in Wujal Wujal, Queensland [7] After making landfall, the JTWC discontinue warnings on the system later that day [33] By 14:00 UTC that day, the BoM reported that Jasper had weakened to a tropical low [34] However, Jasper remained traceable, and the BoM would give the tropical low a moderate chance of redeveloping into a tropical cyclone on 15 December [35] However, they would soon downgrade its chances of re-developing into a very low as the storm turned southeast further inland, causing the tropical low to rapidly weaken, and on 18 December, Jasper was last noted over the Cape York Peninsula [36]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Anggrek\nOn 9 January, the BoM noted that a tropical low could form in the Indian Ocean, designating it as 04U [40] Later the next day, the BoM reported that it had formed to the northwest of the Cocos Islands [41] On 11 January, the JTWC followed suit in monitoring the system, after convection had significantly consolidated around the circulation [42] Three days later, the agency issued a TCFA, for the disturbance as it was situated in an environment of warm waters, low shear, and good outflow [43] By 15 January, the JTWC began issuing advisories, recognising it as Tropical Cyclone 06S after its circulation had improved, [44]  with the BoM subsequently followed suit and upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone [45]  Since the cyclone was within their area of responsibility, Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) named the system Anggrek [46] It tracked southeast before changing direction and tracking west [47] Anggrek remained nearly stationary due to weak steering ridges to the north and southwest, the system generated upwelling, causing sea surface temperatures to decrease [48] Despite that, Anggrek steadily re-intensified, [49] and after entering favourable conditions on 24 January, became a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with estimated maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph), and a central barometric pressure of 968 hPa (28.59 inHg) [50] [51] while the system's depiction showed that tightly circulating around a ragged eye [52] The next day, the system exited the basin towards the South West Indian Ocean [53]\n\n\nTropical Low 03U\nOn 7 January, the BoM noted the possibility of a tropical low forming near the north Kimberley, as a monsoon trough was expected to develop along the Top End It was predesignated as 03U [54] This came to fruition 4 days later, when the BoM reported that it was developing over the southern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf within the trough [9] As the tropical low tracked overland, the system maintained a robust outflow channel in the upper troposphere [55] The BoM continued to monitor the low as it moved slowly southeast, [56] then turning west towards Western Australia by 20 January, [57] until they determined that it would not develop into a tropical cyclone on 23 January [58] [59]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Kirrily\nThe BoM noted the possibility of a tropical low forming within the monsoon trough over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 9 January, designating it as 05U [62] Three days later, the BoM reported that it was developing over the eastern portion of the gulf [63] By 17 January, the JTWC began monitoring the low [64] Two days later, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system [65] By 21 January, the BoM started issuing warnings on the system [66] By 23 January, the JTWC followed suit, recognising it as Tropical Cyclone 07P [67] The next day, the BoM upgraded the low into a  Category 1 tropical cyclone, naming it Kirrily [68] Deep convection shifted to the western side of Kirrily's circulation, though its centre remained well defined [69] It subsequently intensified to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, [70] the JTWC followed suit the system and upgraded it to a Category 1 hurricane, [71] prior to landfall over Townsville, Australia on 25 January [72] Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system [72] The next day, the BoM discontinued warnings [73] However, Kirrily remained traceable, as it moved westwards towards the Queensland region throughout the rest of January [74] The JTWC began monitoring the remnants of Kirrily for potential regeneration as the system developed a partially exposed low-level circulation centre (LLCC) [75] Early the next day, they issued a TCFA for the remnants [76] The disturbance later regenerated into a tropical cyclone; the system showed a consolidating LLCC with convective banding and a central dense overcast (CDO) [77] Since the system only produced near-gale-force winds in the Gulf of Carpentaria, the BoM determined that the low was not expected to redevelop into a tropical cyclone [78] By 2 February, the JTWC discontinued their advisories again, as the storm accelerated inland with the rainbands unraveling and warming cloud tops, [79] until it was last noted on the BoM tropical cyclone outlooks by the next day [80]\n\n\nTropical Low 06U\nOn 29 January, the BoM noted that a subtropical low was expected to form off the coast of Eastern Australia in a few days, designating it as 06U [83] The next day, the BoM began monitoring the low as it was developing in the eastern portion of the basin, about 125 km (80 mi) to the northeast of Kgari in Queensland, Australia [1] [84] [85] Over the next couple of days, the system moved north-eastwards and moved into the South Pacific basin during 1 February, where it was classified as Tropical Disturbance 05F by the Fiji Meteorological Service [1] [12] At this stage, the system was located in an area of moderate vertical wind shear and good upper-level divergence about 675 km (420 mi) to the northwest of Nouméa in New Caledonia, while atmospheric convection persisted over the system's LLCC [12] After meandering outside the basin for several days, the system re-entered the basin as a tropical low [86] Environmental conditions were assessed as being marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea surface temperatures near 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) and low vertical wind shear [87]  It again exited the basin on 7 February, as the storm was struggling due to moderate wind shear [88]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Lincoln\n\nDuring February 2024, the presence of the Madden–Julian Oscillation and an equatorial Indian Ocean in the Australian region contributed to the formation of Tropical Low 07U in the monsoon trough over the western Gulf of Carpentaria, [89] [90] [91] approximately 419 km (260 mi) to the east-southeast of Darwin in the Northern Territory during 14 February [92] [90] Initially located in an favourable environment for intensification, the tropical low began to encounter somewhat improved conditions [93] As the tropical low tracked slowly moving towards the coast, consolidating LLCC with convection started to develop and was wrapping toward the centre [94] By 15 February, at 14:30 UTC, the JTWC issued a TCFA, noting that the system was in a favourable environment with low wind shear and sea surface temperatures exceeding 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) [95] The agency later issued its first warning on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 14P [96] The BoM followed suit—officially upgrading the system to a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigning the name Lincoln [97] Lincoln had a partially exposed LLCC with core convection confined to the western edge of the cyclone [98] Lincoln made landfall on the Gulf of Carpentaria coast between Port McArthur and the Northern Territory—Queensland border just after 06:00 UTC on 16 February [99] Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system [100] Later that day, the BoM followed suit and released its last advisory as the system degenerated into a tropical low [101] However, Lincoln remained traceable, and the BoM would give the system a high chance of redeveloping into a tropical cyclone on 18 February [102] The following day, the tropical low continued moving west-southwest, aided by a ridge to the south, across inland parts of the Northern Territory [89] By 21 February, the remnants of Lincoln turned westward into the offshore of the Kimberley coast and began to re-organise, resulting deep convection to the north [103] The JTWC re-issued a TCFA for the system at 07:30 UTC as the formative convective banding was wrapping into a defined circulation [104] With an increase in convective banding on the southern of the cyclone's circulation, [105]  the JTWC re-initiated advisories on the storm approximately 446 km (275 mi) northeast of Learmonth at 03:00 UTC on 22 February [106] Turning northwest as it approached Western Australia, the storm failed to organised its deep convection [107] By 24 February, the JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its circulation became exposed [108] The storm then crossed just south of Coral Bay on the Australian northwestern coastline just after 12:00 UTC that day, before moving inland across Gascoyne and dissipating shortly afterward [109] [110] Tropical Cyclone Lincoln was the first tropical cyclone to form in the Gulf of the Carpentaria since Tropical Cyclone Alfred in February 2017 [111]\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Neville\nOn 1 March, the BoM started to monitor a possible tropical low to the north of the Cocos Islands within the monsoon trough, designating it as 08U [112] An increased monsoon flow over the Indian Ocean towards Indonesia prompted the agency to report that the tropical low was forming on 4 March, within an unfavourable environment for further development [113] [114] By 10 March, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the tropical low after noting that its deep convection continued to build in the southern and central regions over the system's LLCC, and the next day, it recognised the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S [115] [116] Afterwards, subsidence and high vertical wind shear caused the system to struggle to intensify, leaving the LLLC exposed [117] [118] Although convection continued to fluctuate in the system, deep convection continued to improve near the centre [119] By 18 March, the JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its structure was to be disorganised [120] During the next day, the tropical low began to displace to the south of the LLLC, the JTWC resumed monitoring the system [121] The LLCC started to re–develop with deep convective bands wrapping into it, the JTWC re-initiated advisories approximately 341 km (210 mi) northwest of Learmonth at 03:00 UTC on 20 March [122] Later that day, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Neville [123] Neville intensified shortly after, with an eye forming on microwave imagery [124] A pinhole eye briefly emerged on infrared and visible satellite imagery as a ragged feature at the cyclone's centre, surrounded by well-defined rainbands [125] Neville reached peak intensity at 06:00 UTC the following day as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone, with ten-minute sustained winds estimated at 175 km/h (110 mph), and a central barometric pressure of 952 hPa (28.11 inHg) [126] [127] The JTWC estimated that the system was generating one-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph), equivalent to a low-end Category 4 major hurricane [128] Afterward, the storm's eye becoming cloud-filled caused Neville to gradually weaken as its track shifted west-southwestward [129] Neville's eye disappeared from satellite imagery and the cloud tops of the central dense overcast warming [130] Not long afterward, the storm began to deteriorate due to cooler waters, increasing vertical wind, and dry air entrainment The BoM downgraded the storm to a vigorous gale-force tropical low on 24 March [131] [132] Around this time, Ex-Tropical Cyclone Neville assumed a more consistent course towards the southwest, and crossed over the 90th meridian east into the South-West Indian Ocean [133]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Megan\nOn 4 March, the BoM noted the formation of a tropical low over south of Indonesia's Sumatra or Java, designating it as 09U [135] Over the next couple of days, the BoM reported that it was developing over the western Timor Sea within the trough [136] Analysis from the JTWC indicated that the disturbance was in a favourable environment for development—featuring sea surface temperatures of 29 to 31 °C (84 to 88 °F), and low to moderate wind shear [137] By 15 March, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the tropical low and warned that there was a high potential for the disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone [138] The tropical low moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, [139] whereupon it gradually organised and began to intensify [140] The same day, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Cyclone 19S, approximately 367 km (230 mi) east of Darwin, Northern Territory [141] Later the next day, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Megan [142] Rapid intensification began the same day, with Megan reaching Category 2 tropical cyclone [143] The BoM upgraded the storm to a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC, [144] Operationally, the BoM classified Megan a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone with winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), but during post-cyclone reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 165 km/h (105 mph) based on Synthetic-aperture radar measurements [145] [146] Gradually approaching the southwestern coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, [147] the JTWC indicated that one-minute sustained winds had reached 185 km/h (115 mph), equivalent to a Category 3 major hurricane on the SSHWS [148] Megan made landfall on the southwestern Gulf of Carpentaria coast just after 06:00 UTC on 18 March [149] Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system [150] After moving ashore, the cyclone turned generally southeast and tracked along the inland of Borroloola [151] [152] The following day, the system was downgraded to a tropical low by the BoM as it approached the inland coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria [153] Ex-Tropical Cyclone Megan moved inland, tracking across the Northern Territory, before the BoM stopped monitoring the low on 21 March [154] [155]\n\n\nTropical Low 10U\nOn 12 March, the BoM started to monitor a possible tropical low within the monsoon trough off the eastern Top End in the Gulf of Carpentaria, designating it as 10U [157] Over the next couple of days, the tropical low remained poorly organised [158] By 14 March, the BoM reported that a tropical low had developed within a monsoon trough east of Cape York Peninsula [159] Later that day, the BoM stopped monitoring the low, as it moved southeast off the coast while continuing to weaken [160]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Olga\nOn 4 April, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 11U had developed within a monsoonal trough over the south of Indonesia's Sumba [161] [162] The JTWC assessed environmental conditions as being favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, with good poleward outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 to 31 °C (86 to 88 °F) being offset by the effects of low to moderate vertical wind shear [163] Convective activity began organising into a symmetrical circulation, which prompted the JTWC to issue a TCFA on the disturbance as it tracked southwestwards into a favourable environment [164] [165] By 5 April, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 21S, about 642 km (400 mi) northwest of Learmonth, Western Australia [166] Later the next day, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Olga as its deep convection had organised significantly along with improved curvature of its bands [167] [168] The system developed a central dense overcast and a weak-developing eye [169] The same day, Olga intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, while the JTWC upgraded Olga to the equivalent of a low-end Category 1 hurricane with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) [170] [171] By the following day, the storm had undergone rapid intensification to attain its peak strength with sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph)—equivalent to a  Category 5 severe tropical cyclone—and an estimated central pressure of 933 hPa (27.55 inHg) [172] [173] The JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at this time to have been 220 km/h (140 mph)—equivalent to a Category 4 major hurricane [174] Operationally, the BoM classified Olga as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), but during post-cyclone reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 205 km/h (125 mph) based on Dvorak technique measurements [1] [31] Upon reaching its peak, Olga entered a phase of steady weakening, whereby its eye disappeared from satellite imagery [175] By 8 April, the cyclone began to encounter increasing west-northwesterly shear coupled with dry air entrainment [176] Deep convection becoming displaced to the southeast of an increasingly-exposed LLLC [177] Olga was re-classified as a tropical low by the BoM at 18:00 UTC on 9 April, despite still producing gale-force winds [178] [179] By the following day, the JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its gale-force winds soon became confined to the southern quadrant as the low became devoid of deep convection, leaving the LLLC exposed [180] Shortly after, the BoM stopped monitoring the low, as it moved southwest while continuing to weaken [181]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Paul\nOn 9 April, the BoM reported that a Tropical Low 13U had formed over the Louisiade Archipelago [182] The tropical low depicted flaring consolidated convection to the LLLC [183] The same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA, noting a deep convective banding wrapping into a circulation centre [184] Shortly after, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Paul [185] The JTWC followed suit, initiated advisories on the system, and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 22S [186] Paul featured a ragged central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organised, obscuring the LLCC, with the BoM upgrading the storm to a Category 2 tropical cyclone [187] Paul then peaked at 12:00 UTC on 11 April, with 10-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph), and a central barometric pressure of 994 hPa (29.35 inHg) [188] [189] Flaring deep convection became disorganised into a weakly-defined centre due to increasing westerly wind shear [190] The system was downgraded to a tropical low by the BoM at 00:00 UTC on 12 April [191] The JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its circulation became disorganised [192] The circulation of Paul had dissipated on the same day [193] [194]\n\n\nTropical Low 12U\nOn 4 April, the BoM noted that a weak tropical low could form in the Arafura Sea, designating it as 12U [195] It remained traceable, and the BoM would give the developing tropical low an increased chance of developing into a tropical cyclone [196] By 11 April, the BoM reported that the probability of becoming a tropical cyclogenesis had decreased due to model guidance [197] As the system continued to move westwards, it organized further, prompting the tropical low to develop a weak circulation [198] By 14 April, the BoM stopped monitoring the low as it moved westwards near East Timor while continuing to weaken [199]\n\n\nTropical Low 16U\nTowards the end of the Australian season, the BoM noted that a tropical low was expected to form north of the Australian Region and also gave the system a 15% chance of tropical cyclogenesis within a few days, designating it as 16U [200] On 4 May, the BoM reported that it was developing over the Banda Sea [201] At this stage, the system was located in an area of low vertical wind shear and good upper-level divergence to the northwest of Gove Airport in Australia, while atmospheric isolated convection persisted over the system before the BoM stopped monitoring the tropical low [202] [203]\n\n\nOther systems\nThe United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that Cyclone Djoungou entered the Australian region after crossing the 90th meridian east from the South-West Indian Ocean basin at 18:00 UTC on 19 February, located approximately 1,271 kilometres (790 mi) to the west-southwest of Learmonth, Western Australia [204] Upon entering the region, the Météo-France (MFR) issued its last advisory on Djoungou as it transitioned into a post-tropical depression [205] The system had commenced upon entering the region due to the effects of hostile vertical wind shear of 35–40 kn (65–74 km/h) [206]  At this time, the JTWC assessed the system as a subtropical cyclone, with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 55 km/h (35 mph) The JTWC subsequently issued its final advisory on Djoungou, as its circulation became fully exposed [204]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology (TCWC Melbourne) monitors all tropical cyclones that form within the Australian region, including any within the areas of responsibility of TCWC Jakarta or TCWC Port Moresby [215] Should a tropical low intensify into a tropical cyclone  within the BoM's area of responsibility, it will be assigned the next name from the following naming list The names Lincoln and Megan were used for the first (and only time, in case of Megan) time this season,

{"title": "Earth", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe Modern English word  Earth developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled eorðe [24] It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as *erþō In its earliest attestation, the word eorðe was used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek γῆ gē: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included Jörð (\"Earth\"), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor [25]\n\n\nNatural history\nThe oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002−0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago [35] By 4.54±0.04 Ga the primordial Earth had formed [36] The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides) According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form [37]\n\n\nFormation\nThe oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002−0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago [35] By 4.54±0.04 Ga the primordial Earth had formed [36] The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to

theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form [37]\n\n\nAfter formation\nEarth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing [43] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets [44] Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed [45] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity [46] By 3.5 Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind [47]\n\n\nOrigin of life and evolution\nChemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose [61] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere [62] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes [63] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface [64] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, [65] biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, [66] and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia [67] [68] The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms [69] [70]\n\nFuture\nEarth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40% [78] Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, possibly reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for current plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 million years [79] [80] A lack of vegetation would result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making current animal life impossible [81] Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years [82] Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges [82] [83]\n\n\nPhysical characteristics\nEarth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium, [85] with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi), making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System [86]\n\n\nSize and shape\nEarth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium, [85] with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi), making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System [86]\n\n\nSurface\nEarth's surface is the boundary between the atmosphere, and the solid Earth and oceans Defined in this way, it has an area of about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi) [12] Earth can be divided into two hemispheres: by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres.\n\n\nTectonic plates\nEarth's mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth's crust and upper mantle, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur [121] The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates [122]\n\n\nInternal structure\nEarth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity [130] The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30–50 km (19–31 mi) for the continents The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates [131]\n\n\nChemical composition\nEarth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5.970 Yg) It is composed mostly of iron (32.1% by mass), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements Due to gravitational separation, the core is primarily composed of the denser elements: iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements [134] [49] The most common rock constituents of the crust are oxides Over 99% of the crust is composed of various oxides of eleven elements, principally oxides containing silicon (the silicate minerals), aluminium, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium [135] [134]\n\n\nInternal heat\nThe major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232 [136] At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F), [137] and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi) [138] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today [139] [140]\n\n\nGravitational field\nThe gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2) Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in Earth's gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies [144]\n\n\nMagnetic field\nThe main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05×10−5 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79×1022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average) [145] The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago [146] [147]\n\n\nOrbit and rotation\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds) [156] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day [157] [158]\n\n\nRotation\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds) [156] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day [157] [158]\n\n\nOrbit\nEarth orbits the Sun, making Earth the third-closest planet to the Sun and part of the inner Solar System Earth's average orbital distance is about 150 million km (93 million mi), which is the basis for the astronomical unit (AU) and is equal to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth's distance to the Moon Earth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year With an apparent movement of the Sun in Earth's sky at a rate of about 1°/day eastward, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian.\n\n\nAxial tilt and seasons\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281° [2] with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere.\n\n\nEarth–Moon system\nThe Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto [173] [174] The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's [175] The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth This hypothesis explains the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust [40] Computer simulations suggest that two blob-like remnants of this protoplanet could be inside the Earth [176] [177]\n\n\nMoon\nThe Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like

its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust [40] Computer simulations suggest that two blob-like remnants of this protoplanet could be inside the Earth [176] [177]\n\n\nAsteroids and artificial satellites\nEarth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites: objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans There are at least five quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamoʻoalewa [187] [188] A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth's orbit around the Sun [189] The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty years During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time [190]\n\n\nHydrosphere\nEarth's hydrosphere is the sum of Earth's water and its distribution Most of Earth's hydrosphere consists of Earth's global ocean Earth's hydrosphere also consists of water in the atmosphere and on land, including clouds, inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35×1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km2 (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion km3 (320 million cu mi) [193]\n\n\nAtmosphere\nThe atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi), [210] with a scale height of about 8.5 km (5.3 mi) [3] A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules [210] Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4% [210] but averages about 1% [3] Clouds cover around two-thirds of Earth's surface, more so over oceans than land [211] The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors [212]\n\n\nWeather and climate\nEarth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space [217] Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere [218] Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy [219]\n\n\nUpper atmosphere\nThe upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above the troposphere, [234] is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere [214] Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind [235] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth The Kármán line, defined as 100 km (62 mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space [236]\n\n\nLife on Earth\nEarth is the only known place that has ever been habitable for life Earth's life developed in Earth's early bodies of water some hundred million years after Earth formed Earth's life has been shaping and inhabiting many particular ecosystems on Earth and has eventually expanded globally forming an overarching biosphere [241]\n\n\nHuman geography\nOriginating from earlier primates in Eastern Africa 300,000 years ago humans have since been migrating and with the advent of agriculture in the 10th millennium BC increasingly settling Earth's land [252] In the 20th century Antarctica had been the last continent to see a first and until today limited human presence.\n\n\nNatural resources and land use\nEarth has resources that have been exploited by humans [263] Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, are only replenished over geological timescales [264] Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas [265] These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production [266] Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics [267] These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which often brings environmental and health damage [268]\n\n\nHumans and the environment\nHuman activities have impacted Earth's environments Through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, humans have been increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, altering Earth's energy budget and climate [250] [274] It is estimated that global temperatures in the year 2020 were 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) warmer than the preindustrial baseline [275] This increase in temperature, known as global warming, has contributed to the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas [251]\n\n\nCultural and historical viewpoint\nHuman cultures have developed many views of the planet [279] The standard astronomical symbols of Earth are a quartered circle, , [280] representing the four corners of the world, and a globus cruciger,  Earth is sometimes personified as a deity In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity [281] Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities [281] The Gaia hypothesis, developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability [282] [283] [284]\n\n\nSee also\nSolar System → Local Interstellar Cloud → Local Bubble → Gould Belt → Orion Arm → Milky Way → Milky Way subgroup → Local Group →

habitable zone of the Sun. It is the largest of the four terrestrial planets and the fifth largest planet overall. Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with a small amount of other gases. The planet's surface is 71% water, with the majority of it being oceans. Earth's climate is diverse, ranging from tropical to polar regions.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe Modern English word \"Earth\" developed from an Old English noun, most often spelled \"eorðe\". It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as \"*erþō\". In its earliest attestation, the word \"eorðe\" was used to translate the many senses of Latin \"terra\" and Greek \"γῆ\" (gē). The word \"Earth\" may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism, with late Norse mythology including Jörð, a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.\n\n**Natural History**\n\nThe oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002−0.0004 billion years ago. By 4.54±0.04 billion years ago, the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun, with a solar nebula partitioning a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse. The planets grew out of this disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust, including primordial nuclides. According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.\n\n**Formation**\n\nThe primordial Earth formed from the accretion of planetesimals, with the process taking place over several million years. The Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing. Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets. Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed. In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity.\n\n**Origin of Life and Evolution**\n\nChemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.\n\n**Future**\n\nEarth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%. Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, possibly reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for current plants in approximately 100-900 million years. A lack of vegetation would result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making current animal life impossible. Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100°C (212°F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years.\n\n**Physical Characteristics**\n\nEarth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium, with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles). Earth is the fifth largest planet in the Solar System, with a mass of approximately 5.97 x 10^24 kilograms. The planet's surface is composed of several different types of terrain, including oceans, continents, and mountains.\n\n**Surface**\n\nEarth's surface is the boundary between the atmosphere and the solid Earth and oceans. It has an area of about 510 million square kilometers (197 million square miles). Earth can be divided into two hemispheres: by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres.\n\n**Tectonic Plates**\n\nEarth's mechanically rigid outer layer of the Earth's crust and upper mantle, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally.\n\n**Internal Structure**\n\nEarth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) under the oceans to 30-50 kilometers (19-31 miles) for the continents.\n\n**Chemical Composition**\n\nEarth's mass is approximately 5.97 x 10^24 kilograms. It is composed mostly of iron (32.1% by mass), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements.\n\n**Internal Heat**\n\nThe major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000°C (10,830°F), and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi). Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher.\n\n**Gravitational Field**\n\nThe gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth. Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared (32 feet per second squared). Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in Earth's gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies.\n\n**Magnetic Field**\n\nThe main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles.\n\n**Orbit and Rotation**\n\nEarth orbits the Sun, making Earth the third-closest planet to the Sun and part of the inner Solar System. Earth's average orbital distance is about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles), which is the basis for the astronomical unit (AU) and is equal to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth's distance to the Moon. Earth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year.\n\n**Axial Tilt and Seasons**\n\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281°. With the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun.\n\n**Earth-Moon System**\n\nThe Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet. The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth.\n\n**Asteroids and Artificial Satellites**\n\nEarth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites: objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans. There are at least five quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamoʻoalewa. A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n\n**Hydrosphere**\n\nEarth's hydrosphere is the sum of Earth's water and its distribution. Most of Earth's hydrosphere consists of Earth's global ocean. Earth's hydrosphere also consists of water in the atmosphere and on land, including clouds, inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters.\n\n**Atmosphere**\n\nThe atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kilopascals (14.696 pounds per square inch). A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules. Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4%, but averages about 1%. Clouds cover around two-thirds of Earth's surface, more so over oceans than land.\n\n**Weather and Climate**\n\nEarth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air.\n\n**Upper Atmosphere**\n\nThe upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above the troposphere, is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth.\n\n**Life on Earth**\n\nEarth is the only known place that has ever been habitable for life. Earth's life developed in Earth's early bodies of water some hundred million years after Earth formed. Earth's life has been shaping and inhabiting many particular ecosystems on Earth and has eventually expanded globally forming an overarching biosphere.\n\n**Human Geography**\n\nOriginating from earlier primates in Eastern Africa 300,000 years ago, humans have since been migrating and with the advent of agriculture in the 10th millennium BC increasingly settling Earth's land.

have been on Earth since it formed [45] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity [46] By 3.5 Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind [47]\n\n\nOrigin of life and evolution\nChemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose [61] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to

microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, [65] biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, [66] and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia [67] [68] The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms [69] [70]\n\nFuture\nEarth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40% [78] Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, possibly reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for current plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 million years [79] [80] A lack of vegetation would result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making current animal life impossible [81] Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years [82] Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges [82] [83]\n\n\nPhysical characteristics\nEarth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium, [85] with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi), making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System [86]\n\n\nSize and shape\nEarth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium, [85] with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi), making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System [86]\n\n\nSurface\nEarth's surface is the boundary between the atmosphere, and the solid Earth and oceans Defined in this way, it has an area of about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi) [12] Earth can be divided into two hemispheres: by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres.\n\n\nTectonic plates\nEarth's mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth's crust and upper mantle, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur [121] The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates [122]\n\n\nInternal structure\nEarth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity [130] The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30–50 km (19–31 mi) for the continents The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates [131]\n\n\nChemical composition\nEarth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5.970 Yg) It is composed mostly of iron (32.1% by mass), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements Due to gravitational separation, the core is primarily composed of the denser elements: iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements [134] [49] The most common rock constituents of the crust are oxides Over 99% of the crust is composed of various oxides of eleven elements, principally oxides containing silicon (the silicate minerals), aluminium, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium [135] [134]\n\n\nInternal heat\nThe major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232 [136] At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F), [137] and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi) [138] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today [139] [140]\n\n\nGravitational field\nThe gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2) Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in Earth's gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies [144]\n\n\nMagnetic field\nThe main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05×10−5 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79×1022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average) [145] The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago [146] [147]\n\n\nOrbit and rotation\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds) [156] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day [157] [158]\n\n\nRotation\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds) [156] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day [157] [158]\n\n\nOrbit\nEarth orbits the Sun, making Earth the third-closest planet to the Sun and part of the inner Solar System Earth's average orbital distance is about 150 million km (93 million mi), which is the basis for the astronomical unit (AU) and is equal to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth's distance to the Moon Earth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year With an apparent movement of the Sun in Earth's sky at a rate of about 1°/day eastward, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian.\n\n\nAxial tilt and seasons\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281° [2] with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere.\n\n\nEarth–Moon system\nThe Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto [173] [174] The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's [175] The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth This hypothesis explains the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust [40] Computer simulations suggest that two blob-like remnants of this protoplanet could be inside the Earth [176] [177]\n\n\nMoon\nThe Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a

identical to that of Earth's crust [40] Computer simulations suggest that two blob-like remnants of this protoplanet could be inside the Earth [176] [177]\n\n\nAsteroids and artificial satellites\nEarth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites: objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans There are at least five quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamoʻoalewa [187] [188] A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth's orbit around the Sun [189] The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty years During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time [190]\n\n\nHydrosphere\nEarth's hydrosphere is the sum of Earth's water and its distribution Most of Earth's hydrosphere consists of Earth's global ocean Earth's hydrosphere also consists of water in the atmosphere and on land, including clouds, inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35×1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km2 (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion km3 (320 million cu mi) [193]\n\n\nAtmosphere\nThe atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi), [210] with a scale height of about 8.5 km (5.3 mi) [3] A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules [210] Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4% [210] but averages about 1% [3] Clouds cover around two-thirds of Earth's surface, more so over oceans than land [211] The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors [212]\n\n\nWeather and climate\nEarth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space [217] Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere [218] Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy [219]\n\n\nUpper atmosphere\nThe upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above the troposphere, [234] is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere [214] Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind [235] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth The Kármán line, defined as 100 km (62 mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space [236]\n\n\nLife on Earth\nEarth is the only known place that has ever been habitable for life Earth's life developed in Earth's early bodies of water some hundred million years after Earth formed Earth's life has been shaping and inhabiting many particular ecosystems on Earth and has eventually expanded globally forming an overarching biosphere [241]\n\n\nHuman geography\nOriginating from earlier primates in Eastern Africa 300,000 years ago humans have since been migrating and with the advent of agriculture in the 10th millennium BC increasingly settling Earth's land [252] In the 20th century Antarctica had been the last continent to see a first and until today limited human presence.\n\n\nNatural resources and land use\nEarth has resources that have been exploited by humans [263] Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, are only replenished over geological timescales [264] Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas [265] These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production [266] Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics [267] These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which often brings environmental and health damage [268]\n\n\nHumans and the environment\nHuman activities have impacted Earth's environments Through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, humans have been increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, altering Earth's energy budget and climate [250] [274] It is estimated that global temperatures in the year 2020 were 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) warmer than the preindustrial baseline [275] This increase in temperature, known as global warming, has contributed to the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas [251]\n\n\nCultural and historical viewpoint\nHuman cultures have developed many views of the planet [279] The standard astronomical symbols of Earth are a quartered circle, , [280] representing the four corners of the world, and a globus cruciger,  Earth is sometimes personified as a deity In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity [281] Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities [281] The Gaia hypothesis, developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability [282] [283] [284]\n\n\nSee also\nSolar System → Local Interstellar Cloud → Local Bubble → Gould Belt → Orion Arm → Milky Way → Milky Way subgroup → Local Group →

Odar. It premiered on Netflix on November 17, 2022. The series follows a group of European emigrants traveling from Southampton, UK to New York City on a steamship named Kerberos.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe series takes place in 1899, a time when the world is undergoing significant changes. The Industrial Revolution is in full swing, and European emigrants are fleeing their homes in search of a better life in America. The Kerberos, a steamship, is one of the many vessels that carry these passengers across the Atlantic.\n\nHowever, something unusual is happening on the Kerberos. Passengers begin to disappear, and strange occurrences start to plague the ship. The series follows a group of passengers, including Maura, a young and ambitious woman, as they try to uncover the truth behind the disappearances.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe cast of 1899 includes Emily Beecham, Aneurin Barnard, Andreas Pietschmann, Miguel Bernardeau, Maciej Musiał, Anton Lesser, Lucas Lynggaard Tønnesen, Rosalie Craig, Clara Rosager, Maria Erwolter, Yann Gael, Mathilde Ollivier, José Pimentão, Isabella Wei, Gabby Wong, Jonas Bloquet, Fflyn Edwards, and Alexandre Willaume.\n\n**Main**\n\nThe series begins with the introduction of the Kerberos and its passengers.

One of the most striking is the use of the steamship as a symbol of freedom and progress. The Kerberos represents a new beginning, but also a sense of confinement and claustrophobia.\n\nWe also see the theme of class and privilege, with the first-class passengers enjoying luxuries and comforts, while the third-class passengers struggle to survive. The series highlights the inequalities of the time, and the struggles of the working class.\n\n**Guest**\n\nThe series also features a number of guest characters, each with their own story and motivations.

The series was also released on DVD and Blu-ray in some countries.\n\n**Plagiarism Accusations**\n\nThe series was the subject of plagiarism accusations shortly after its release.

{"title": "Samhain", "content": "\nName\nIn Modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic the name is Samhain, while the traditional Manx Gaelic name is Sauin [9] It is usually written with the definite article An tSamhain (Irish), An t-Samhain (Scottish Gaelic), and Yn Tauin (Manx) The ⟨amha⟩ is a tetragraph for the sounds /əu̯/ Older forms of the word include the Scottish Gaelic spellings Samhainn and Samhuinn [10] [11] [12] The Gaelic names for the month of November are derived from Samhain [13] The Irish name for Samhain night is Oíche Shamhna (/ˈiːhə ˈhaʊnə/ EE-hə HOW-nə).\n\n\nEtymology\nThese names all come from the Old and Middle Irish Samain or Samuin  [ˈsaṽɨnʲ], the name for the festival held on 1 November in medieval Ireland Traditionally, it is derived from proto-Indo-European *semo ('summer') [14] [15] However, as John T Koch points out, it is unclear why a festival marking the beginning of winter would include the word for 'summer' [16] Linguist Joseph Vendryes contends that it is unrelated, saying that the Celtic summer ended in August [17] More recently, linguists Xavier Delamarre and Ranko Matasović have proposed that it derives from from proto-Celtic *samoni ('reunion, assembly'), cognate with Old Norse saman, Gothic samana and Sanskrit samāná (all meaning 'together'), as well as the Old Irish term bech-samain ('bee swarm') [18] Delamarre further suggests it could refer to an \"assembly of the living and the dead\" [19]\n\n\nOrigins\nSamain or Samuin was the name of the festival (feis) marking the beginning of winter in Gaelic Ireland It is attested in the earliest Old Irish literature, which dates from the 9th century onward Samhain was one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals: Samhain (~1 November), Imbolc (~1 February), Bealtaine (~1 May), and Lughnasa (~1 August) Of these, Samhain and Bealtaine, marking the transitions into winter and summer respectively, are thought to have been the most significant Sir James George Frazer, in his 1890 book, The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion, theorized that these festivals, particularly 1 May and 1 November, were significant to herding communities practicing seasonal transhumance Cattle were driven to summer pastures in May and returned to lowlands in November, suggesting the festival's pastoral origins [25]\n\n\nIn Irish mythology\nWhile Irish mythology was originally a spoken tradition, much of it was eventually written down in the Middle Ages by Christian monks [28] [29] The tenth-century tale Tochmarc Emire ('The Wooing of Emer') lists Samhain as the first of the four seasonal festivals of the year [30] The literature says a peace would be declared, and there were great gatherings where they held meetings, feasted, drank alcohol, [31] and held contests [30] These gatherings are a popular setting for early Irish tales [30] The tale Echtra Cormaic ('Cormac's Adventure') says that the Feast of Tara was held every seventh Samhain, hosted by the High King of Ireland, during which new laws and duties were ordained; anyone who broke the laws established during this time would be banished [32] [33]\n\n\nHistoric customs\nSamhain was one of the four main festivals of the Gaelic calendar, marking the end of the harvest and the beginning of winter [31] Samhain customs are mentioned in several medieval texts In Serglige Con Culainn ('Cúchulainn's Sickbed'), it is said that the festival of the Ulaid at Samhain lasted a week: Samhain itself, and the three days before and after It involved great gatherings where they held meetings, feasted, drank alcohol, and held contests [30] The Togail Bruidne Dá Derga notes that bonfires were lit at Samhain and stones cast into the fires [56] It is mentioned in Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar Éirinn, which was written in the early 1600s but drew on earlier medieval sources, some of which are unknown He claims that the feis of Tara was held for a week every third Samhain when the nobles and ollams of Ireland met to lay down and renew the laws, and to feast [57] He also claims that the druids lit a sacred bonfire at Tlachtga and made sacrifices to the gods, sometimes by burning their sacrifices He adds that all other fires were doused and re-lit from this bonfire [58]\n\n\nRitual bonfires\nLike Bealtaine, bonfires were lit on hilltops at Samhain, and there were rituals involving them [31] By the early modern era, they were most common in parts of the Scottish Highlands, on the Isle of Man, in north and mid-Wales, and in parts of Ulster [59] F Marian McNeill says that they were formerly need-fires, but that this custom died out [60] Likewise, only certain kinds of wood were traditionally used, but later records show that many kinds of flammable material were burnt [61] It is suggested that the fires were a kind of imitative or sympathetic magic; mimicking the Sun, helping the \"powers of growth\" and holding back the decay and darkness of winter [60] [62] [63] They may also have served to symbolically \"burn up and destroy all harmful influences\" [63] Accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries suggest that the fires, smoke, and ashes were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers [64]\n\n\nDivination\nThe bonfires were used in divination In 18th-century Ochtertyre, a ring of stones—one for each person—was laid around the fire, perhaps on a layer of ash Everyone then ran around it with a torch, \"exulting\" In the morning, the stones were examined, and if any were mislaid, it was said that the person it represented would not live out the year A similar custom was observed in north Wales [64] and in Brittany [66] James Frazer suggests this may come from \"an older custom of actually burning them\" (i.e human sacrifice) or it may have always been symbolic [67] Divination has likely been a part of the festival since ancient times, [31] and it has survived in some rural areas [68]\n\n\nSpirits and souls\nSamhain was seen as a liminal time when the boundary between this world and the Otherworld could more easily be crossed [76] This meant the aos sí, the 'spirits' or 'fairies', could more easily come into our world Many scholars see the aos sí as remnants of pagan gods and nature spirits [77] [78] At Samhain, it was believed that the aos sí needed to be propitiated to ensure that the people and their livestock survived the winter Offerings of food and drink would be left outside for the aos sí, [79] [80] and portions of the crops might be left in the ground for them [81]\n\n\nMumming and guising\nIn some areas, mumming and guising were part of Samhain It was first recorded in 16th century Scotland [88] and later in parts of Ireland, Mann, and Wales [89] People went from house to house in costume or disguise, usually reciting songs or verses in exchange for food [89] It may have evolved from a tradition whereby people impersonated the aos sí, or the souls of the dead, and received offerings on their behalf [89] Impersonating these spirits or souls was also believed to protect oneself from them [90] S V Peddle suggests the guisers \"personify the old spirits of the winter, who demanded reward in exchange for good fortune\" [91] McNeill suggests that the ancient festival included people in masks or costumes representing these spirits and that the modern custom came from this [92] In Ireland, costumes were sometimes worn by those who went about before nightfall collecting for a Samhain feast [89]\n\n\nLivestock\nTraditionally, Samhain was a time to take stock of the herds and food supplies Cattle were brought down to the winter pastures after six months in the higher summer pastures (see transhumance) [31] It was also the time to choose which animals would be slaughtered This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock [3] [60] It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays On St Martin's Day (11 November) in Ireland, an animal—usually a rooster, goose, or sheep—would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the threshold of the house It was offered to Saint Martin, who may have taken the place of a god or gods, [62] and it was then eaten as part of a feast This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century, [102] and was found in other parts of Europe At New Year in the Hebrides, a man dressed in a cowhide would circle the township sunwise A bit of the hide would be burnt, and everyone would breathe in the smoke [62] These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions [62]\n\n\nCeltic Revival\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th century Celtic Revival, there was an upswell of interest in Samhain and the other Celtic

with new beginnings\" He visited Mann and found that the Manx sometimes called 31 October \"New Year's Night\" or Hog-unnaa The Tochmarc Emire, written in the Middle Ages, reckoned the year around the four festivals at the beginning of the seasons and put Samhain at the beginning of those However, Hutton says that the evidence for it being the Celtic or Gaelic New Year's Day is flimsy [103] Rhys's theory was popularised by Sir James George Frazer, though at times he did acknowledge that the evidence is inconclusive Frazer also said that Samhain had been the pagan Celtic festival of the dead and that it had been Christianized as All Saints and All Souls [103] Since then, Samhain has been popularly seen as the Celtic New Year and an ancient festival of the dead The calendar of the Celtic League, for example, begins and ends at Samhain [104]\n\n\nRelated holidays\nIn the Brittonic branch of the Celtic languages, Samhain is known as the \"calends of winter\" The Brittonic lands of Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany held festivals on 31 October similar to the Gaelic one In Wales it is Calan Gaeaf, in Cornwall it is Allantide or Kalan Gwav, and in Brittany it is Kalan Goañv [44]\n\n\nAllhallowtide\nIn 609, Pope Boniface IV endorsed 13 May as a holy day commemorating all Christian martyrs [106] By 800, churches in Gaelic Ireland [107] and Anglo-Saxon Northumbria were holding a feast commemorating all saints on 1 November, which became All Saints' Day [106] [108] [109] There had been much Gaelic influence on Northumbria and its church [110] James Frazer suggested this date was a Celtic idea (being the date of Samhain), while Ronald Hutton suggests it was a Germanic idea, writing that the Irish church commemorated all saints on 20 April Some manuscripts of the Irish Martyrology of Tallaght and Martyrology of Óengus, which date to this time, have a commemoration of all saints \"of Europe\" on 20 April, but a commemoration of all saints of the world on 1 November [111] In 835, the Frankish Empire officially adopted 1 November as the date of All Saints' Day [106] This may have been influenced by Alcuin of Northumbria, who was a member of Charlemagne's court, [112] or it may have been promoted by the Irish clerics and scholars who were also members of the Frankish court [113] The new date was eventually adopted by the rest of the Western Church, and in the 11th century, 2 November became established as All Souls' Day This created the three-day observance known as Allhallowtide: All Hallows' Eve (31 October), All Hallows' Day (1 November), and All Souls' Day (2 November).\n\n\nModern paganism\nSamhain and Samhain-inspired festivals are held by some Modern Pagans As there are many kinds of Neopaganism, their Samhain celebrations can be very different despite the shared name Some try to emulate the historic festival as much as possible Other Neopagans base their celebrations on sundry unrelated sources, Gaelic culture being only one of them [8] [119] [120] Folklorist Jenny Butler describes how Irish pagans pick some elements of historic Samhain celebrations and meld them with references to the Celtic past, making a new festival of Samhain that is uniquely part of the neo-pagan culture [121]\n\n\nCeltic Reconstructionism\nLike other Reconstructionist traditions, Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans (CRs) emphasize historical accuracy They base their celebrations and rituals on traditional lore as well as research into the beliefs of the polytheistic Celts [120] [127]\nThey celebrate Samhain around 1 November but may adjust the date to suit their regional climate, such as when the first winter frost arrives [128] Their traditions include saining the home and lighting bonfires [128] Some follow the old tradition of building two bonfires, which celebrants and animals then pass between as a purification ritual [3] [60] For CRs, it is a time when the dead are especially honoured Though CRs make offerings at all times of the year, Samhain is when more elaborate offerings are made to specific ancestors [128] This may involve making a small altar or shrine They often have a meal where a place for the dead is set at the table, and they are invited to join An untouched portion of food and drink is left outside as an offering Traditional tales may be told, and traditional songs, poems, and dances performed A western-facing door or window may be opened, and a candle left burning on the windowsill to guide the dead home Divination for the coming year is often done, whether in all solemnity or as games The more mystically inclined may also see this as a time for deeply communing with their deities, especially those particularly linked with this festival [3] [60] [120] [127] [128]\n\n\nWicca\nWiccans celebrate a variation of Samhain as one of their yearly Sabbats of the Wheel of the Year It is deemed by most Wiccans to be the most important of the four \"greater Sabbats\" Some Wiccans see Samhain as a time to celebrate the lives of those who have died, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets, and other loved ones who have died In some rituals, the spirits of the dead are invited to attend the festivities It is seen as a festival of darkness, which is balanced at the opposite point of the wheel by the spring festival of Bealtaine [129]\n\n\nSee also\nHolidays\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSecondary sources\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Samhain**\n\nSamhain is a Gaelic festival marking the beginning of winter or the end of the harvest season, which is celebrated on November 1st in the Northern Hemisphere. In Modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the name is Samhain, while the traditional Manx Gaelic name is Sauin. It is usually written with the definite article An tSamhain (Irish), An t-Samhain (Scottish Gaelic), and Yn Tauin (Manx). The ⟨amha⟩ is a tetragraph for the sounds /əu̯/.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe names for Samhain come from the Old and Middle Irish Samain or Samuin, the name for the festival held on 1 November in medieval Ireland. Traditionally, it is derived from proto-Indo-European *semo ('summer'). However, as John T Koch points out, it is unclear why a festival marking the beginning of winter would include the word for 'summer'. Linguist Joseph Vendryes contends that it is unrelated, saying that the Celtic summer ended in August. More recently, linguists Xavier Delamarre and Ranko Matasović have proposed that it derives from proto-Celtic *samoni ('reunion, assembly'), cognate with Old Norse saman, Gothic samana and Sanskrit samāná (all meaning 'together'). Delamarre further suggests it could refer to an \"assembly of the living and the dead\".\n\n**Origins**\n\nSamhain or Samuin was the name of the festival (feis) marking the beginning of winter in Gaelic Ireland. It is attested in the earliest Old Irish literature, which dates from the 9th century onward. Samhain was one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals: Samhain (~1 November), Imbolc (~1 February), Bealtaine (~1 May), and Lughnasa (~1 August). Of these, Samhain and Bealtaine, marking the transitions into winter and summer respectively, are thought to have been the most significant. Sir James George Frazer, in his 1890 book, The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion, theorized that these festivals, particularly 1 May and 1 November, were significant to herding communities practicing seasonal transhumance. Cattle were driven to summer pastures in May and returned to lowlands in November, suggesting the festival's pastoral origins.\n\n**In Irish mythology**\n\nWhile Irish mythology was originally a spoken tradition, much of it was eventually written down in the Middle Ages by Christian monks. The tenth-century tale Tochmarc Emire ('The Wooing of Emer') lists Samhain as the first of the four seasonal festivals of the year. The literature says a peace would be declared, and there were great gatherings where they held meetings, feasted, drank alcohol, and held contests. These gatherings are a popular setting for early Irish tales. The tale Echtra Cormaic ('Cormac's Adventure') says that the Feast of Tara was held every seventh Samhain, hosted by the High King of Ireland, during which new laws and duties were ordained; anyone who broke the laws established during this time would be banished.\n\n**Historic customs**\n\nSamhain was one of the four main festivals of the Gaelic calendar, marking the end of the harvest and the beginning of winter. Samhain customs are mentioned in several medieval texts. In Serglige Con Culainn ('Cúchulainn's Sickbed'), it is said that the festival of the Ulaid at Samhain lasted a week: Samhain itself, and the three days before and after. It involved great gatherings where they held meetings, feasted, drank alcohol, and held contests. The Togail Bruidne Dá Derga notes that bonfires were lit at Samhain and stones cast into the fires. It is mentioned in Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar Éirinn, which was written in the early 1600s but drew on earlier medieval sources, some of which are unknown. He claims that the feis of Tara was held for a week every third Samhain when the nobles and ollams of Ireland met to lay down and renew the laws, and to feast. He also claims that the druids lit a sacred bonfire at Tlachtga and made sacrifices to the gods, sometimes by burning their sacrifices. He adds that all other fires were doused and re-lit from this bonfire.\n\n**Ritual bonfires**\n\nLike Bealtaine, bonfires were lit on hilltops at Samhain, and there were rituals involving them. By the early modern era, they were most common in parts of the Scottish Highlands, on the Isle of Man, in north and mid-Wales, and in parts of Ulster. F Marian McNeill says that they were formerly need-fires, but that this custom died out. Likewise, only certain kinds of wood were traditionally used, but later records show that many kinds of flammable material were burnt. It is suggested that the fires were a kind of imitative or sympathetic magic; mimicking the Sun, helping the \"powers of growth\" and holding back the decay and darkness of winter. They may also have served to symbolically \"burn up and destroy all harmful influences\". Accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries suggest that the fires, smoke, and ashes were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers.\n\n**Divination**\n\nThe bonfires were used in divination. In 18th-century Ochtertyre, a ring of stones—one for each person—was laid around the fire, perhaps on a layer of ash. Everyone then ran around it with a torch, \"exulting\". In the morning, the stones were examined, and if any were mislaid, it was said that the person it represented would not live out the year. A similar custom was observed in north Wales and in Brittany. James Frazer suggests this may come from \"an older custom of actually burning them\" (i.e human sacrifice) or it may have always been symbolic. Divination has likely been a part of the festival since ancient times, and it has survived in some rural areas.\n\n**Spirits and souls**\n\nSamhain was seen as a liminal time when the boundary between this world and the Otherworld could more easily be crossed. This meant the aos sí, the 'spirits' or 'fairies', could more easily come into our world. Many scholars see the aos sí as remnants of pagan gods and nature spirits. At Samhain, it was believed that the aos sí needed to be propitiated to ensure that the people and their livestock survived the winter. Offerings of food and drink would be left outside for the aos sí, and portions of the crops might be left in the ground for them.\n\n**Mumming and guising**\n\nIn some areas, mumming and guising were part of Samhain. It was first recorded in 16th century Scotland and later in parts of Ireland, Mann, and Wales. People went from house to house in costume or disguise, usually reciting songs or verses in exchange for food. It may have evolved from a tradition whereby people impersonated the aos sí, or the souls of the dead, and received offerings on their behalf. Impersonating these spirits or souls was also believed to protect oneself from them. S V Peddle suggests the guisers \"personify the old spirits of the winter, who demanded reward in exchange for good fortune\". McNeill suggests that the ancient festival included people in masks or costumes representing these spirits and that the modern custom came from this. In Ireland, costumes were sometimes worn by those who went about before nightfall collecting for a Samhain feast.\n\n**Livestock**\n\nTraditionally, Samhain was a time to take stock of the herds and food supplies. Cattle were brought down to the winter pastures after six months in the higher summer pastures (see transhumance). It was also the time to choose which animals would be slaughtered. This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock. It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays. On St Martin's Day (11 November) in Ireland, an animal—usually a rooster, goose, or sheep—would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the threshold of the house. It was offered to Saint Martin, who may have taken the place of a god or gods, and it was then eaten as part of a feast. This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century, and was found in other parts of Europe. At New Year in the Hebrides, a man dressed in a cowhide would circle the township sunwise. A bit of the hide would be burnt, and everyone would breathe in the smoke. These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions.\n\n**Celtic Revival**\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th century Celtic Revival, there was an upswell of interest in Samhain and the other Celtic festivals. Sir John Rhys put forth that it had been the \"Celtic New Year\". He inferred it from contemporary folklore in Ireland and Wales, which he felt was \"full of Hallowe'en customs associated with new beginnings\". He visited Mann and found that the Manx sometimes called 31 October \"New Year's Night\" or Hog-unnaa. The Tochmarc Emire, written in the Middle Ages, reckoned the year around the four festivals at the beginning of the seasons and put Samhain at the beginning of those. However, Hutton says that the evidence for it being the Celtic or Gaelic New Year's Day is flimsy. Rhys's theory was popularised by Sir James George Frazer, though at times he did acknowledge that the evidence is inconclusive. Frazer also said that Samhain had been the pagan Celtic festival of the dead and that it had been Christianized as All Saints and All Souls. Since then, Samhain has been popularly seen as the Celtic New Year and an ancient festival of the dead. The calendar of the Celtic League, for example, begins and ends at Samhain.\n\n**Related holidays**\n\nIn the Brittonic branch of the Celtic languages, Samhain is known as the \"calends of winter\". The Brittonic lands of Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany held festivals on 31 October similar to the Gaelic one. In Wales it is Calan Gaeaf, in Cornwall it is Allantide or Kalan Gwav, and in Brittany it is Kalan Goañv.\n\n**Allhallowtide**\n\nIn 609, Pope Boniface IV endorsed 13 May as a holy day commemorating all Christian martyrs. By 800, churches in Gaelic Ireland and Anglo-Saxon Northumbria were holding a feast commemorating all saints on 1 November, which became All Saints' Day. James Frazer suggested this date was a Celtic idea (being the date of Samhain), while Ronald Hutton suggests it was a Germanic idea, writing that the Irish church commemorated all saints on 20 April. In 835, the Frankish Empire officially adopted 1 November as the date of All Saints' Day. This may have been influenced by Alcuin of Northumbria, who was a member of Charlemagne's court, or it may have been promoted by the Irish clerics and scholars who were also members of the Frankish court. The new date was eventually adopted by the rest of the Western Church, and in the 11th century, 2 November became established as All Souls' Day. This created the three-day observance known as Allhallowtide: All Hallows' Eve (31 October), All Hallows' Day (1 November), and All Souls' Day (2 November).\n\n**Modern paganism**\n\nSamhain and Samhain-inspired festivals are held by some Modern Pagans. As there are many kinds of Neopaganism, their Samhain celebrations can be very different despite the shared name. Some try to emulate the historic festival as much as possible. Other Neopagans base their celebrations on sundry unrelated sources, Gaelic culture being only one of them. Folklorist Jenny Butler describes how Irish pagans pick some elements of historic Samhain celebrations and meld them with references to the Celtic past, making a new festival of Samhain that is uniquely part of the neo-pagan culture.\n\n**Celtic Reconstructionism**\n\nLike other Reconstructionist traditions, Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans (CRs) emphasize historical accuracy. They base their celebrations and rituals on traditional lore as well as research into the beliefs of the polytheistic Celts. They celebrate Samhain around 1 November but may adjust the date to suit their regional climate, such as when the first winter frost arrives. Their traditions include saining the home and lighting bonfires. Some follow the old tradition of building two bonfires, which celebrants and animals then pass between as a purification ritual. For CRs, it is a time when the dead are especially honoured. Though CRs make offerings at all times of the year, Samhain is when more elaborate offerings are made to specific ancestors. This may involve making a small altar or shrine. They often have a meal where a place for the dead is set at the table, and they are invited to join. An untouched portion of food and drink is left outside as an offering. Traditional tales may be told, and traditional songs, poems, and dances performed. A western-facing door or window may be opened, and a candle left burning on the windowsill to guide the dead home. Divination for the coming year is often done, whether in all solemnity or as games.

This technique involves blocking traffic from a particular IP address or a range of IP addresses to prevent malicious activity, reduce spam, and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\n## How it works\n\nEvery device connected to the Internet is assigned a unique IP address, which is needed to enable devices to communicate with each other. With appropriate software on the host website, the IP address of visitors to the site can be logged and can also be used to determine the visitor's geographical location. This information can be used to block IP addresses that are associated with malicious activity, such as hacking attempts, spam, or unauthorized access attempts.\n\nIP address blocking can be implemented in various ways, including:\n\n* Blocking specific IP addresses or IP address ranges\n* Blocking entire countries or regions\n* Blocking IP addresses based on user behavior or activity\n* Blocking IP addresses that are associated with malicious activity\n\n## Implementations\n\nUnix-like operating systems commonly implement IP address blocking using a TCP wrapper, configured by host access control files /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/hosts.allow. The TCP wrapper is a software component that provides a layer of security between the operating system and the network. It allows administrators to specify which IP addresses are allowed to access the system and which IP addresses are blocked.\n\nOther operating systems, such as Windows, also have built-in IP address blocking features. For example, Windows Server includes a feature called IP Block List, which allows administrators to block IP addresses that are associated with malicious activity.\n\n## Circumvention\n\nProxy servers and other methods can be used to bypass the blocking of traffic from IP addresses. A proxy server acts as an intermediary between the client and the server, allowing the client to access the server without revealing its IP address. This can be used to circumvent IP address blocking by routing traffic through a proxy server.\n\nHowever, anti-proxy strategies are available to counter this method. For example, some systems can detect and block traffic that is being routed through a proxy server.\n\nConsumer-grade internet routers can sometimes obtain a new public IP address on-demand from the ISP using DHCP lease renewal to circumvent individual IP address blocks. However, this can be countered by blocking the range of IP addresses from which the internet service provider is assigning new IP addresses, which is usually a shared IP address prefix. However, this may impact legitimate users from the same internet service provider who have IP addresses in the same range, which inadvertently creates a denial-of-service attack.\n\n## See also\n\n* IP blocking\n* IP address spoofing\n* Proxy server\n* TCP wrapper\n* Host access control\n* Denial-of-service attack\n\n## External links\n\n* IP address blocking on Wikipedia\n* IP blocking on Mozilla Developer Network\n* TCP wrapper on Linux.org\n* Host access control on Oracle.com", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"IP_address_blocking\" following this outline:\n\n\nHow it works\nEvery device connected to the Internet is assigned a unique IP address, which is needed to enable devices to communicate with each other With appropriate software on the host website, the IP address of visitors to the site can be logged and can also be used to determine the visitor's geographical location [2] [3]\n\n\nImplementations\nUnix-like operating systems commonly implement IP address blocking using a TCP wrapper, configured by host access control files /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/hosts.allow.\n\n\nCircumvention\nProxy servers and other methods [which?] can be used to bypass the blocking of traffic from IP addresses [7] However, anti-proxy strategies are available Consumer-grade internet routers can sometimes obtain a new public IP address on-demand from the ISP using DHCP lease renewal to circumvent individual IP address blocks This, however, can be countered by blocking the range of IP addresses from which the internet service provider is assigning new IP addresses, which is usually a shared IP address prefix However, this may impact legitimate users from the same internet service provider who have IP addresses in the same range, which inadvertently creates a denial-of-service attack.\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to IP address blocking at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nReferences\n Media related to IP address blocking at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to IP address blocking at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

though the Spanish Football Federation was first established in 1909 The first Spain national football team was constituted in 1920, with the main objective of finding a team that would represent Spain at the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Belgium in that same year Spain made their debut at the tournament on 28 August 1920 against Denmark, silver medalists at the last two Olympic tournaments Spain managed to win that match by a scoreline of 1–0, eventually finishing with the silver medal [13] Spain qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 1934, defeating Brazil in their first game and losing in a replay to the hosts and eventual champions Italy in the quarter-finals [14] The Spanish Civil War and World War II prevented Spain from playing any competitive matches between the 1934 World Cup and the 1950 edition's qualifiers At the 1950 finals in Brazil, they topped their group to progress to the finals round, then finished in fourth place [15] Until 2010, this had been Spain's highest finish in a FIFA World Cup finals [16]\n\n\nTeam image\nSpain's team was known in the past by some fans as \"La furia española\", 'the Spanish Fury'; this nickname was originally given by a Dutch newspaper, recalling the \"Sack of Antwerp\" – an episode in the military history of Spain [40] More modernly, the team is called \"La roja\", 'the Red (squad)' [1]\n\n\nNicknames\nSpain's team

history of Spain [40] More modernly, the team is called \"La roja\", 'the Red (squad)' [1]\n\n\nStyle of play\nBetween 2008 and 2012, the team played a style of football dubbed 'tiki-taka', a systems

red jersey with yellow trim, dark blue shorts, and black socks, whilst their current away kit is predominantly yellow, having been white traditionally The color of the home socks started to alter throughout the 1990s from black to the same blue color as the shorts, then matching either the blue of the shorts or the red of the shirt until the mid-2010s when they returned to their traditional black Spain's kits have been produced by manufacturers including Adidas (from 1981 until 1983), Le Coq Sportif (from 1984 until 1990) and Adidas once again (since 1991) Rather than displaying the logo of the Spanish Football Federation, Spain's jersey traditionally features the country's coat of arms over the left side After winning the 2010 World Cup, the World Cup winners badge was added to the

Akhundzada reportedly did not move during the incident, or the chaos that followed [21] The Taliban accused the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan intelligence agency, of the attempted shooting [21]\n\n\nSupreme leader of Afghanistan (2021–present)\nIn May 2021, Akhundzada called the Afghan people to unite for the development of an Islamic state once the United States forces withdraw [43] In August 2021, forces under his nominal command began a general offensive seeking to achieve a final victory in the war During the leadership of Akhundzada, the United States troops withdrew, and the Taliban gained control of Kabul [28] On 18 August, it was announced that based on the general amnesty issued by Akhundzada, \"it was decided to release political detainees from all prisons of Afghanistan\" [44] By the time, the Taliban has already taken control of key prisons across the country and freed thousands of inmates, including al-Qaeda members and senior Taliban figures Allegedly, ISIS-K fighters were also released [44] [45]\n\n\nPublic appearance\nIn September 2021, it was revealed that Akhundzada had not been seen in public since the Taliban seized control of Kabul the previous month, giving rise to speculation that he might be dead, and that his decrees were being drafted by a committee The death of the Taliban's founding leader, Mullah Omar, had been previously concealed for two years, and during that time, the Taliban had continued to issue statements in Mullah Omar's name [62] [63] On 30 October 2021, Taliban officials said Akhundzada made a public appearance at the Darul Uloom Hakimah madrassa in Kandahar No photos or videos were released, but a ten-minute audio recording was shared by Taliban social media accounts, [64] which might have eased rumours of his death This would be his first public appearance in Afghanistan, if the reports are true [65] [66] The madrassa's head of security, Massum Shakrullah, told Agence France-Presse that when Akhundzada visited, he was \"armed\" and accompanied by three security guards \"Even cellphones and sound recorders were not allowed\" into the venue, he added Mohammad Musa, 13, who watched from afar, said Akhundzada looked \"exactly the same\" as in his only released photograph Another student, Mohammed, 19, said \"we all were watching him\" and were \"just crying.\" When Mohammed was asked if he could confirm that it was really Akhundzada, he replied he and his peers were so overjoyed that they \"forgot to watch.. his face.\" [15]\n\n\nPolitical views\nAkhundzada is seen as a religiously ultraconservative figure and ideologue within the Taliban [73] [74] He is said to oppose girls' education in Afghanistan, vetoing a plan to return girls to secondary education by March 23 He also issued and approved a decree on May 7, requiring women to cover their hair and bodies from the eyes down while in public, and not to leave their residence unless necessary He also oversaw the implementation of tighter media restrictions, banning the use of mobile phones in post-secondary education and foreign language broadcasts This is said to be part of an effort to return to the Taliban’s style of governance from 1996 to 2001, with Akhundzada modelling his leadership on that of Mullah Omar, the Taliban’s founder [75]\n\n\nWritings\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Hibatullah Akhundzada**\n\nHibatullah Akhundzada is the current supreme leader of the Taliban, a militant Islamist group that has been at the forefront of the Afghan insurgency since the late 1990s. He was appointed as the group's leader in 2016, following the death of his predecessor, Mullah Akhtar Mansour. Akhundzada has since led the Taliban in its efforts to establish an Islamic emirate in Afghanistan, which has been marked by a significant escalation of violence and a tightening of social controls.\n\n**Early and Personal Life**\n\nAkhundzada was born in the village of Sperwan in the Panjwayi District of Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. His exact date of birth is not publicly known, but it is believed to be around 1959. He is a member of the Nurzai tribe, a prominent Pashtun clan in southern Afghanistan. Akhundzada's father, Muhammad Akhund, was a religious scholar and imam at the Malook mosque in Safid Rawan village. The family was not wealthy, and they relied on the congregation's donations to survive.\n\nAkhundzada's early life was marked by a strong interest in Islamic studies. He was educated at a local madrasa, where he studied the works of classical Islamic scholars and developed a deep understanding of Islamic theology and jurisprudence. He later went on to study at the Darul Uloom Haqqania, a prominent Islamic seminary in Akora Khattak, Pakistan.\n\n**Role in the Taliban (1994-2021)**\n\nAkhundzada joined the Taliban in 1994, shortly after the group's founding. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the group's early members and a key figure in its leadership. In 1995, he was part of the vice and virtue police in Farah Province, where he was responsible for enforcing the group's strict interpretation of Islamic law. He later became the head of the Taliban's military court in eastern Nangarhar Province and then the deputy head of the Supreme Court.\n\nAkhundzada's next assignment was as an instructor at the Jihadi Madrasa, a seminary that was founded by the Taliban's leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar. He spent several years teaching at the madrasa, where he developed a reputation as a skilled and charismatic instructor.\n\n**As Supreme Leader**\n\nAkhundzada was appointed as the Taliban's supreme leader on May 25, 2016, following the death of Mullah Akhtar Mansour. He was chosen as a compromise candidate, with both Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Yaqoob being considered as potential successors. Akhundzada's appointment was seen as a surprise by some, given his relatively low profile within the group.\n\nAs supreme leader, Akhundzada has been responsible for setting the group's overall strategy and direction. He has been a key figure in the group's negotiations with the United States, and has played a leading role in the group's efforts to establish a peace deal with the Afghan government.\n\n**Assassination Attempts**\n\nAkhundzada has been the target of at least three assassination attempts. In 2012, a man stood up among his students and pointed a pistol at him from close range, but the pistol jammed. The Taliban accused the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan intelligence agency, of the attempted shooting.\n\n**Supreme Leader of Afghanistan (2021-Present)**\n\nIn May 2021, Akhundzada called on the Afghan people to unite for the development of an Islamic state once the United States forces withdrew. In August 2021, forces under his nominal command began a general offensive seeking to achieve a final victory in the war. During the leadership of Akhundzada, the United States troops withdrew, and the Taliban gained control of Kabul.\n\n**Public Appearance**\n\nIn September 2021, it was revealed that Akhundzada had not been seen in public since the Taliban seized control of Kabul the previous month. This gave rise to speculation that he might be dead, and that his decrees were being drafted by a committee. However, on October 30, 2021, Taliban officials announced that Akhundzada had made a public appearance at the Darul Uloom Hakimah madrassa in Kandahar. A ten-minute audio recording was shared by Taliban social media accounts, which might have eased rumors of his death.\n\n**Political Views**\n\nAkhundzada is seen as a religiously ultraconservative figure and ideologue within the Taliban. He is said to oppose girls' education in Afghanistan, vetoing a plan to return girls to secondary education by March 23. He also issued and approved a decree on May 7, requiring women to cover their hair and bodies from the eyes down while in public, and not to leave their residence unless necessary.\n\n**Writings**\n\nAkhundzada has written several books on Islamic theology and jurisprudence. His most well-known work is \"Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Karim,\" a commentary on the Quran. He has also written on a range of other topics, including Islamic law, politics, and history.\n\n**Notes**\n\nAkhundzada's legacy is complex and multifaceted. As a leader of the Taliban, he has been responsible for some of the group's most egregious human rights abuses, including the suppression of women's rights and the persecution of minority groups. However, he has also been a key figure in the group's efforts to establish a peace deal with the Afghan government, and has played a leading role in the group's negotiations with the United States.\n\nAkhundzada's commitment to Islamic law and his desire to establish an Islamic emirate in Afghanistan are deeply rooted in his religious beliefs. However, his willingness to compromise and negotiate with the Afghan government and the United States has raised questions about the nature of his commitment to these goals.\n\nUltimately, Akhundzada's legacy will be shaped by the actions he takes in the coming months and years.

them [121] He made his debut for Nice, starting in a home Ligue 1 match against Marseille, converting a penalty in the 7th minute and scoring a header from Ricardo's cross in the 78th minute as Nice won the match 3–2 [122] On 21 September, Balotelli, in only his second Ligue 1 appearance, struck another double in the 30th and 68th minutes as Nice thrashed Monaco 4–0 in the Azurean derby at the

in just four competitive matches for Nice when he fired home a right-footed shot from just outside the penalty area in the 43rd minute after an assist from Malang Sarr in a 2016–17 UEFA Europa League Group I match against Krasnodar in an eventual 5–2 away defeat That was his first goal in a UEFA club competition since February 2015, when he scored for Liverpool against Beşiktaş in the round of 32 of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League knockout phase [125] [126] On 2 October, Balotelli scored the winning goal in the 86th minute by sending a powerful kick from the edge of the box into the top right corner as Nice defeated Lorient 2–1 in a home Ligue 1 match, during which he received a yellow card for taking off his shirt in celebration of his goal and was subsequently sent off minutes later in stoppage time after receiving a second, controversial yellow card following an altercation with Lorient's Steven Moreira, where neither player appeared to do anything wrong [127] [128] Balotelli's red card was rescinded four days later after referee Olivier Thual's admission he had made a mistake in showing Balotelli the second yellow card and the French Football League's Disciplinary Commission decided to annul his second yellow card, thus allowing him to be available for the following league match [129] On 21 December, he received his first official red card in a Nice shirt in a 0–0 Ligue 1 away draw with Bordeaux for kicking Igor Lewczuk [130]\n\n\n2017–18\nOn 25 June 2017, Balotelli signed a one-year contract extension with Nice [140] On 26 July, he played his first match of the season in Nice's UEFA Champions League qualifying round first leg, in which he scored in their 1–1 draw against Ajax [141]\n\n\n2018–19\nWhen it comes to Mario, I want to answer back, or just slam him up against the wall or leave him hanging by his collar on the coat rack, but I can't, as I'm no longer a player.\n\n\nMarseille\nOn 23 January 2019, Balotelli terminated his contract with Nice and signed a contract until the end of the season with Marseille [147] [148] On 25 January, he made his debut for the club coming on as a substitute in the 74th minute at home to Lille, later also scoring his first goal in the last minute of stoppage time of an ultimate 2–1 loss [149] He scored his fourth league goal on 3 March, an acrobatic volley in a 2–0 home win against Saint-Étienne He celebrated the goal by creating an Instagram story on the pitch from his cell phone [150] On 30 March, he became the first player since Josip Skoblar in the late 1960s to score in each of his first five home games for Marseille in Ligue 1 [151]\n\n\nBrescia\nOn 18 August 2019, Balotelli signed a \"multi-year contract\" with his hometown club Brescia on a free transfer He signed for a base salary of €1.5 million

play for Italy and that he needed to mature [185]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2012\nBefore the tournament in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli was interviewed by a newspaper about racism amongst fans in the host countries During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat to walk off the pitch if any of the opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would \"kill\" anyone that threw a banana at him He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football, notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan [189] During the build-up to the competition, Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed Balotelli would need to grow up and mature if he was going to become the centrepiece of future Italian success [190]\n\n\n2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying\nAfter

capable of scoring with his head or with either foot, from both inside or outside the penalty area, [231] [232] [233] despite being naturally right-footed [234] Although he normally plays in a central role as a main striker, [235] [236] [237] he is a versatile forward capable of playing anywhere along the front line [238] [239] and has also been deployed as a winger [236] [238] or as a second striker [238] [239] [240]\n\n\nPersonality and public image\nI could write a book of 200 pages of my two years at Inter with Mario, but the book would not be a drama – it would be a comedy I remember one time when we went to play Kazan in the  [2009–10] Champions League In that match I had all my strikers injured.. I was really in trouble and Mario was the only one Mario got a yellow card in the 42nd  [20th] [254] minute, so when I got to the dressing room at half-time I spend about 14 minutes of the 15 available speaking only to Mario I said to him: 'Mario, I cannot change you, I have no strikers on the bench, so don't touch anybody and play only with the ball If we lose the ball no reaction If someone provokes you, no reaction, if the referee makes a mistake, no reaction.' The 46th  [60th] [254] minute – red card!\n\n\nPersonal life\nBalotelli's sister is married to the Nigerian footballer Obafemi Martins, and their son Kevin Martins is a professional footballer in Italy [285] In 2012, Balotelli featured in GQ, where he was named the second-best dressed man in the world behind British musician Tinie Tempah [286] Balotelli also appeared on the cover of the November 2012 edition of Time magazine [287]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nInter Milan\n\n\nClub\nInter Milan\n\n\nInternational\nInter Milan\n\n\nHonours\nInter Milan\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

While our understanding of the universe is constantly evolving, certain fundamental principles, such as the second law of thermodynamics, provide a framework for understanding the long-term evolution of the cosmos.\n\n**Lists**\n\n* **Key events in the far future of the universe:**\n\t+ The Sun exhausts its hydrogen fuel and expands into a red giant, engulfing the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth)\n\t+ The Sun becomes a white dwarf, with a mass of about 1/3 that of its current mass\n\t+ The outer planets and their moons continue to orbit the white dwarf Sun\n\t+ The universe undergoes a period of rapid expansion, known as the \"big rip\"\n\t+ The universe collapses back in on itself, in a process known as the \"big crunch\"\n* **Key events in the far future of humanity:**\n\t+ The last remnants of humanity die out, either due to natural causes or through a catastrophic event\n\t+ Advanced civilizations, if they exist, may be able to harness energy from the universe and sustain themselves indefinitely\n\t+ The universe becomes a cold, dark, and lifeless place, with no stars, planets, or civilizations remaining\n\n**Keys**\n\n* **Understanding the second law of thermodynamics:** The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy, or a measure of disorder and randomness, will always increase over time. This means that the energy available to do work will always decrease, and the universe will become a more disordered and random place.\n* **The fate of the Sun:** The Sun is a star that is currently in the main sequence stage of its life. It will eventually exhaust its hydrogen fuel and expand into a red giant, engulfing the inner planets. After this, it will become a white dwarf, with a mass of about 1/3 that of its current mass.\n* **The fate of the universe:** The universe is currently expanding, and this expansion is expected to continue indefinitely. However, the rate of expansion will eventually slow down and then reverse, leading to a collapse of the universe back in on itself.\n\n**Earth, the Solar System, and the universe**\n\nThe far future of the universe, Earth, the Solar System, and humanity must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must rise over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel via fusion and burn out.\n\n* **The Sun:** The Sun will likely expand sufficiently to overwhelm most of the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth), but not the giant planets, including Jupiter and Saturn. This is because the Sun's expansion will be limited by its own mass and the gravitational pull of the giant planets.\n* **The inner planets:** The inner planets, including Mercury, Venus, and Earth, will likely be engulfed by the Sun's expansion and become part of the Sun itself.\n* **The outer planets:** The outer planets, including Jupiter and Saturn, will continue to orbit the white dwarf Sun, but their orbits will be affected by the reduced mass of the Sun.\n* **The universe:** The universe will continue to expand and eventually collapse back in on itself, in a process known as the \"big crunch.\"\n\n**Humanity and human constructs**\n\nTo date, five spacecraft (Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and New Horizons) are on trajectories that will take them out of the Solar System and into interstellar space. Barring an extremely unlikely collision with some object, the craft should persist indefinitely.\n\n* **Spacecraft:** The spacecraft that are currently on trajectories to leave the Solar System will continue to travel through interstellar space, carrying information about humanity and the Solar System with them.\n* **The search for extraterrestrial intelligence:** The possibility of extraterrestrial life is a topic of ongoing research and speculation.

core overheating or a core meltdown [15] RBMK reactors, like those at Chernobyl, use water as a coolant, circulated by electrically driven pumps [16] [17] Reactor No 4 had 1,661 individual fuel channels, requiring over 12 million US gallons per hour for the entire reactor.\n\n\nReactor cooling after shutdown\nIn nuclear reactor operation, most heat is generated by nuclear fission, but over 6% comes from radioactive decay heat, which continues after the reactor shuts down Continued coolant circulation is essential to prevent core overheating or a core meltdown [15] RBMK reactors, like those at Chernobyl, use water as a coolant, circulated by electrically driven pumps [16] [17] Reactor No 4 had 1,661 individual fuel channels, requiring over 12 million US gallons per hour for the entire reactor.\n\n\nSafety test\nThe turbine run-down energy capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally, and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully An initial test carried out in 1982 indicated that the excitation voltage of the turbine-generator was insufficient The electrical system was modified, and the test was repeated in 1984 but again proved unsuccessful In 1985, the test was conducted a third time but also yielded no results due to a problem with the recording equipment The test procedure was to be run again in 1986 and was scheduled to take place during a controlled power-down of reactor No. 4, which was preparatory to a planned maintenance outage [22] [21]: 51 \n\n\nTest delay and shift change\nThe test was to be conducted during the day-shift of 25 April 1986 as part of a scheduled reactor shutdown The day shift had been instructed in advance on the reactor operating conditions to run the test, and a special team of electrical engineers was present to conduct the electrical test once the correct conditions were reached [23] As planned, a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit began at 01:06 on 25 April, and the power level had reached 50% of its nominal 3,200 MW thermal level by the beginning of the day shift [21]: 53 \n\n\nUnexpected drop of the reactor power\nThe test plan called for a gradual decrease in reactor power to a thermal level of 700–1000 MW, [25] and an output of 720 MW was reached at 00:05 on 26 April [21]: 53  However, due to the reactor's production of a fission byproduct, xenon-135, which is a reaction-inhibiting neutron absorber, power continued to decrease in the absence of further operator action, a process known as reactor poisoning In steady-state operation, this is avoided because xenon-135 is \"burned off\" as quickly as it is created, becoming highly stable xenon-136 With the reactor power reduced, high quantities of previously produced iodine-135 were decaying into the neutron-absorbing xenon-135 faster than the reduced neutron flux could \"burn it off\" [26] Xenon poisoning in this context made reactor control more difficult, but was a predictable phenomenon during such a power reduction.\n\n\nReactor conditions priming the accident\nWhen a power level of 200 MW was reattained, preparation for the experiment continued, although the power level was much lower than the prescribed 700 MW As part of the test, two additional main circulating pumps were activated at 01:05 The increased coolant flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core Because water absorbs neutrons better than steam, the neutron flux and reactivity decreased The operators responded by removing more manual control rods to maintain power [28] [29] It was around this time that the number of control rods inserted in the reactor fell below the required value of 15 This was not apparent to the operators, because the RBMK did not have any instruments capable of calculating the inserted rod worth in real time.\n\n\nAccident\nAt 01:23:04, the test began [30] Four of the eight main circulating pumps (MCP) were to be powered by voltage from the coasting turbine, while the remaining four pumps received electrical power from the grid as normal The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator The diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were to have completely picked up the MCPs' power needs by 01:23:43 As the momentum of the turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps The water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids in the coolant flowing up through the fuel pressure tubes [21]: 8 \n\n\nTest execution\nAt 01:23:04, the test began [30] Four of the eight main circulating pumps (MCP) were to be powered by voltage from the coasting turbine, while the remaining four pumps received electrical power from the grid as normal The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator The diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were

increased formation of steam voids in the coolant flowing up through the fuel pressure tubes [21]: 8 \n\n\nReactor shutdown and power excursion\nAt 01:23:40, a scram (emergency shutdown) of the reactor was initiated [31] as the experiment was wrapping-up [32] The scram was started when the AZ-5 button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed: this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them, including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier.\n\n\nExplosions\nAs the scram continued, the reactor output jumped to around 30,000 MW thermal, 10 times its normal operational output, the indicated last reading on the control panel Some estimate the power spike may have gone 10 times higher than that It was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building, but a steam explosion appears to have been the next event There is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the reactor's exterior cooling structure that caused the explosion that destroyed the reactor casing, tearing off and blasting the upper plate called the upper biological shield, [39] to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened, through the roof of the reactor building This is believed to be the first explosion that many heard [40]: 366 \n\n\nPossible causes for the second explosion\nThere were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second, larger explosion One view was that the second explosion was caused by the combustion of hydrogen, which had been produced either by the overheated steam-zirconium reaction or by the reaction of red-hot graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide Another hypothesis, by Konstantin Checherov, published in 1998, was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor due to the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core [46]\n\n\nFizzled nuclear explosion hypothesis\nThe force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released after the accident led Sergei A Pakhomov and Yuri V Dubasov in 2009 to theorize that the second explosion could have been an extremely fast nuclear power transient resulting from core material melting in the absence of its water coolant and moderator Pakhomov and Dubasov argued that there was no delayed supercritical increase in power but a runaway prompt criticality, similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon [47]\n\n\nImmediate response\nContrary to safety regulations, bitumen, a combustible material, had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall Ejected material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor No. 3, which was still operating It was imperative to put out those fires and protect the cooling systems of reactor No. 3 [18]: 42  Inside reactor No. 3, the chief of the night shift, Yuri Bagdasarov, wanted to shut down the reactor immediately, but chief engineer Nikolai Fomin would not allow this The operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working At 05:00, Bagdasarov made his own decision to shut down the reactor, [18]: 44  which was confirmed in writing by Dyatlov and Station Shift Supervisor Rogozhkin.\n\n\nFire containment\nContrary to safety regulations, bitumen, a combustible material, had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall Ejected material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor No. 3, which was still operating It was imperative to put out those fires and protect the

confirmed in writing by Dyatlov and Station Shift Supervisor Rogozhkin.\n\n\nRadiation levels\nThe ionizing radiation levels in the worst-hit areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be 5.6 roentgens per second (R/s), equivalent to more than 20,000 roentgens per hour A lethal dose is around 500 roentgens (~5 Gray (Gy) in modern radiation units) over five hours In some areas, unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute Unfortunately, a dosimeter capable of measuring up to 1,000 R/s was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building, and another one failed when turned on Most remaining dosimeters had limits of 0.001 R/s and therefore read \"off scale\" The reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above 0.001 R/s (3.6 R/h), while the true levels were vastly higher in some areas [18]: 42–50 \n\n\nAccident investigation\nThe IAEA had created the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG) in 1985 [59] INSAG produced two significant reports on Chernobyl: INSAG-1 in 1986, and a revised report, INSAG-7, in 1992 According to INSAG-1, the main cause of the accident was the operators' actions, but according to INSAG-7, the main cause was the reactor's design [21]: 24  [60] Both reports identified an inadequate \"safety culture\" (INSAG-1 coined the term) at all managerial and operational levels as a major underlying factor [21]: 21, 24 \n\n\nCrisis management\nThe nearby city of Pripyat was not immediately evacuated and the townspeople were not alerted during the night to what had just happened However, within a few hours, dozens of people fell ill Later, they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths, along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting [61] [better source needed] As the plant was run by authorities in Moscow, the government of Ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident [62]\n\n\nEvacuation\nThe nearby city of Pripyat was not immediately evacuated and the townspeople were not alerted during the night to what had just happened However, within a few hours, dozens of people fell ill Later, they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths, along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting [61] [better source needed] As the plant was run by authorities in Moscow, the government of Ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident [62]\n\n\nOfficial announcement\nEvacuation began one and a half days before the accident was publicly acknowledged by the Soviet Union In the morning of 28 April, radiation levels set off alarms at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant in Sweden, [67] [68] over 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) from the Chernobyl Plant Workers at Forsmark reported the case to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, which determined that the radiation had originated elsewhere That day, the Swedish government contacted the Soviet government to inquire about whether there had been a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union The Soviets initially denied it It was only after the Swedish government suggested they were about to file an official alert with the International Atomic Energy Agency that the Soviet government admitted that an accident had taken place at Chernobyl [68] [69]\n\n\nCore meltdown risk mitigation\nTwo floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe; the third floor above them, below the reactor, served as a steam tunnel The steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water After the disaster, the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water.\n\n\nBubbler pools\nTwo floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe; the third floor above them, below the reactor, served as a steam tunnel The steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water After the disaster, the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water.\n\n\nFoundation protection measures\nThe government commission was concerned that the molten core would burn into the earth and contaminate groundwater To reduce the likelihood of this, it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor, which would also stabilize the foundations Using oil well drilling equipment, injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May It was estimated that 25 tonnes (55 thousand pounds) of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at −100 °C (−148 °F) [18]: 59  This idea was quickly scrapped [87]\n\n\nSite cleanup\n\nIn the months after the explosion, attention turned to removing the radioactive debris from the roof [90] While the worst of the radioactive debris had remained inside what was left of the reactor, an estimated 100 tons of debris on that roof had to be removed to enable the safe construction of the \"sarcophagus\"—a concrete structure that would entomb the reactor and reduce radioactive dust being released [90] The initial plan was to use robots to clear the roof The Soviets used approximately 60 remote-controlled robots, primarily designed for use in lunar exploration or policing work  [91]most of them built in the Soviet Union Most famous of these robots was the modified West German Police robot \"Joker\" a bright yellow robot \n\nDebris removal\n\nIn the months after the explosion, attention turned to removing the radioactive debris from the roof [90] While the worst of the

primarily designed for use in lunar exploration or policing work  [91]most of them built in the Soviet Union Most famous of these robots was the modified West German Police robot \"Joker\" a bright yellow robot \n\nConstruction of the sarcophagus\nWith the extinguishing of the open air reactor fire, the next step was to prevent the spread of contamination due to wind or birds which could land within the wreckage and then carry contamination elsewhere In addition, rainwater could wash contamination into the sub-surface water table, where it could migrate outside the site area Rainwater falling on the wreckage could also accelerate corrosion of steelwork in the remaining reactor structure A further challenge was to reduce the large amount of emitted gamma radiation, which was a hazard to the workforce operating the adjacent reactor No. 3.\n\n\nInvestigations of the reactor condition\nDuring the construction of the sarcophagus, a scientific team, as part of an investigation dubbed \"Complex Expedition\", re-entered the reactor to locate and contain nuclear fuel to prevent another explosion These scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core Rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes The scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation [54]\n\n\nArea cleanup\nThe official contaminated zones saw a massive clean-up effort lasting seven months [64]: 177–183  The official reason for such early, and dangerous, decontamination efforts, rather than allowing time for natural decay, was that the land must be repopulated and brought back into cultivation Within fifteen months 75% of the land was under cultivation, even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled Defence forces must have done much of the work Yet this land was of marginal agricultural value According to David Marples, the administration wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy, and even to restart the power station [64]: 78–79, 87, 192–193 \n\n\nSite remediation\nQuestions arose about the future of the plant and its fate All work on the unfinished reactors No. 5 and No. 6 was halted three years later The damaged reactor was sealed off and 200 cubic meters (260 cu yd) of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational buildings The Ukrainian government allowed the three remaining reactors to continue operating because of an energy shortage.\n\n\nNo. 4 reactor confinement\nSoon after the accident, the reactor building was quickly encased by a mammoth concrete sarcophagus Crane operators worked blindly from inside lead-lined cabins taking instructions from distant radio observers, while gargantuan-sized pieces of concrete were moved to the site on custom-made vehicles The purpose of the sarcophagus was to stop any further release of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, isolate the exposed core from the weather and provide safety for the continued operations of adjacent reactors one through three [101]\n\n\nWaste management\nUsed fuel from units 1–3 was stored in the units' cooling ponds, and in an interim spent fuel storage facility pond, ISF-1, which now holds most of the spent fuel from units 1–3, allowing those reactors to be decommissioned under less restrictive conditions Approximately 50 of the fuel assemblies from units 1 and 2 were damaged and required special handling Moving fuel to ISF-1 was thus carried out in three stages: fuel from unit 3 was moved first, then all undamaged fuel from units 1 and 2, and finally the damaged fuel from units 1 and 2 Fuel transfers to ISF-1 were completed in June 2016 [106]\n\n\nFuel-containing materials\nThe radioactive material consists of core fragments, dust, and lava-like \"fuel containing materials\" (FCM)—also called \"corium\"—that flowed through the wrecked reactor building before hardening into a ceramic form.\n\n\nExclusion zone\nThe Exclusion Zone was originally an area with a radius of 30 kilometres (19 mi) in all directions from the plant, but was subsequently greatly enlarged to include an area measuring approximately 2,600 km2 (1,000 sq mi), officially called the \"zone of alienation\" The area has largely reverted to forest and was overrun by wildlife due to the lack of human competition for space and resources [113]\n\n\nForest fire concerns\nDuring the dry season, forest fires are a perennial concern in areas contaminated by radioactive material Dry conditions and build-up of debris make the forests a ripe breeding ground for wildfires [122] Depending on prevailing atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires could potentially spread more radioactive material outside the exclusion zone [123] [124] In Belarus, the Bellesrad organization is tasked with overseeing food cultivation and forestry management in the area.\n\n\nRecovery projects\nThe Chernobyl Trust Fund was created in 1991 by the United Nations to help victims of the Chernobyl accident [127] It is administered by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which also manages strategy formulation, resource mobilization, and advocacy efforts [128] Beginning in 2002, under the United Nations Development Programme, the fund shifted its focus from emergency assistance to long-term development [129] [128]\n\n\nTourism\nFirst limited guided tours were begun in 2002 [132] The 2007 release of the video game S.T.A.L.K.E.R increased the site popularity [133] and tour operators estimated that 40,000 tourists visited the site between 2007 and 2017 [134] Between 2017 and 2022, over 350,000 tourists visited the site, hitting the maximum peak of almost 125,000 visitors in 2019, coinciding with the release of HBO's mini-series about the disaster [135] [136]  After its release in July 2019, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that the Chernobyl site would become an official tourist attraction Zelenskyy said, \"We must give this territory of Ukraine a new life.\" [137] [138] Dr T Steen, a microbiology and immunology teacher at Georgetown's School of Medicine, recommends tourists to wear clothes and shoes they are comfortable with throwing away and to avoid plant life [133] Tourism has rebound after COVID in 2021, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 meant the Chernobyl area saw active fighting and the exclusion zone closed to all visitors It remains closed to tourism as of summer 2024 [139]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nAlthough it is difficult to compare the Chernobyl accident with a deliberate air burst nuclear detonation, it is estimated that Chernobyl released about 400 times more radioactive material than the combined atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki However, the Chernobyl disaster released only about one-hundredth to one-thousandth of the total radioactivity released during nuclear weapons testing at the height of the Cold War, due to varying isotope abundances [143]\n\n\nRelease and spread of radioactive materials\nAlthough it is difficult to compare the Chernobyl accident with a deliberate air burst nuclear detonation, it is estimated that Chernobyl released about 400 times more radioactive material than the combined atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki However, the Chernobyl disaster released only about one-hundredth to one-thousandth of the total radioactivity released during nuclear weapons testing at the height of the Cold War, due to varying isotope abundances [143]\n\n\nRelative isotopic abundances\nThe Chernobyl release was characterized by the physical and chemical properties of the radio-isotopes in the core Particularly dangerous were the highly radioactive fission products, those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain, such as some of the isotopes of iodine, caesium and strontium Iodine-131 was and caesium-137 remains the two most responsible for the radiation exposure received by the general population [2]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nThe Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the Pripyat River, which feeds into the Dnieper reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in Europe, which at the time supplied water to Kiev's 2.4 million residents, and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred [64]: 60  The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath [161]\n\n\nWater bodies\nThe Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the Pripyat River, which feeds into the Dnieper reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in Europe, which at the time supplied water to Kiev's 2.4 million residents, and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred [64]: 60  The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath [161]\n\n\nFlora, fauna, and funga\nAfter the disaster, four square kilometres (1.5 sq mi) of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned reddish-brown and died, earning the name \"Red Forest\" [166] Some animals in the worst-hit areas also died or stopped reproducing Most domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone, but horses left on an island in the Pripyat River 6 km (4 mi) from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of 150–200 Sv [167] Some cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted The next generation appeared to be normal [167] The mutation rates for plants and animals have increased by a factor of 20 because of the release of radionuclides from Chernobyl There is evidence for elevated mortality rates and increased rates of reproductive failure in contaminated areas, consistent with the expected frequency of deaths due to mutations [168]\n\n\nHuman food chain\nWith radiocaesium binding less with humic acid, peaty soils than the known binding \"fixation\" that occurs on kaolinite-rich clay soils, many marshy areas of Ukraine had the highest soil to dairy-milk transfer coefficients, of soil activity in ~ 200 kBq/m2 to dairy milk activity in Bq/L, that had ever been reported, with the transfer, from initial land activity into milk activity, ranging from 0.3−2 to 20−2 times that which was on the soil [154]\n\n\nPrecipitation on distant high ground\nOn high ground, such as mountain ranges, there is increased precipitation due to adiabatic cooling This resulted in localized concentrations of contaminants on distant areas; higher in Bq/m2 values to many lowland areas much closer to the source of the plume.\n\n\nHuman impact\nThe only known causal deaths from the accident involved plant workers and firefighters The reactor explosion killed two engineers, and 28 others died within three months from acute radiation syndrome (ARS) [8] Some sources report a total initial fatality of 31, [190] [191] including one additional off-site death due to coronary thrombosis attributed to stress [8]\n\n\nAcute radiation effects and immediate aftermath\nThe only known causal deaths from the accident involved plant workers and firefighters The reactor explosion killed two engineers, and 28 others died within three months from acute radiation syndrome (ARS) [8] Some sources report a total initial fatality of 31, [190] [191] including one additional off-site death due to coronary thrombosis attributed to stress [8]\n\n\nLong-term impact\nIn the 10 years following the accident, 14 more people who had been initially hospitalized died, mostly from causes unrelated to radiation exposure, with only two deaths resulting from myelodysplastic syndrome [8] Scientific consensus, supported by the Chernobyl Forum, suggests no statistically significant increase in solid cancer incidence among rescue workers [195] However, childhood thyroid cancer increased, with about 4,000 new cases reported by 2002 in contaminated areas of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, largely due to high levels of radioactive iodine The recovery rate is ~99%, with 15 terminal cases reported [195] No increase in mutation rates was found among children of liquidators or those living in contaminated areas [196]\n\n\nEffects of main harmful radionuclides\nThe four most harmful radionuclides spread from Chernobyl were iodine-131, caesium-134, caesium-137 and strontium-90, with half-lives of 8 days, 2.07 years, 30.2 years and 28.8 years respectively [198]: 8  The iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes, because of its short half-life, but it is highly volatile and appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems [144]: 24  Strontium is the least volatile and of main concern in the areas near Chernobyl [198]: 8 \n\n\nDisputed investigation\nThe mutation rates among animals in the Chernobyl zone have been a topic of ongoing scientific debate, notably regarding the research conducted by Anders Moller and Timothy Mousseau [203] [204] Their research, which suggests higher mutation rates among wildlife in the Chernobyl zone, has been met with criticism over the reproducibility of their findings and the methodologies used [205] [206]\n\n\nWithdrawn investigation\nIn 1996, geneticist Ronald Chesser and Robert Baker published a paper [207] on the thriving vole population within the exclusion zone, in which the central conclusion was essentially that \"The mutation rate in these animals is hundreds and probably thousands of times greater than normal\" This claim occurred after they had done a comparison of the mitochondrial DNA of the \"Chernobyl voles\" with that of a control group of voles from outside the region [208] The authors discovered they had incorrectly classified the species of vole and were genetically comparing two different vole species They issued a retraction in 1997 [203] [209] [210]\n\n\nAbortions\nFollowing the accident, journalists encouraged public mistrust of medical professionals [211] This media-driven framing led to an increase in induced abortions across Europe out of fears of radiation An estimated 150,000 elective abortions were performed worldwide due to radiophobia [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] [216] The statistical data excludes Soviet–Ukraine–Belarus abortion rates, which are unavailable However, in Denmark, about 400 additional abortions were recorded, and in Greece, an increase of 2,500 terminations occurred despite the low radiation dose [212] [213]\n\n\nCancer assessments\nA report by the International Atomic Energy Agency examines the environmental consequences of the accident [162] The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation estimated a global collective dose from the accident equivalent to \"21 additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation\"; doses were far higher among 530,000 recovery workers, who averaged an extra 50 years of typical natural background radiation exposure [222] [223] [224]\n\n\nOther disorders\nFred Mettler, a radiation expert, estimated 9,000 Chernobyl-related cancer deaths worldwide, noting that while small relative to normal cancer risks, the numbers are large in absolute terms [237] The report highlighted the risks to mental health from exaggerated radiation fears, noting that labeling the affected population as \"victims\" contributed to a sense of helplessness [230] Mettler also commented that 20 years later, the population remained unsure about radiation effects, leading to harmful behaviors [237]\n\n\nLong-term radiation deaths\nThe potential deaths from the Chernobyl disaster are heavily debated The World Health Organization predicted 4,000 future cancer deaths in surrounding countries, [13] based on the Linear no-threshold model (LNT), which assumes that even low doses of radiation increase cancer risk proportionally [240] The Union of Concerned Scientists estimated approximately 27,000 excess cancer deaths worldwide, using the same LNT model [241]\n\n\nSocio-economic impact\nIt is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster According to Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union spent 18 billion Rbls ($5.9 billion in today's dollars [245]) on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself [246] In 2005, the total cost over 30 years for Belarus was estimated at US$235 billion [230] Gorbachev later wrote that \"the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl...was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\" [247]\n\n\nSignificance\nBecause of the distrust many had in the Soviet authorities, which engaged in a cover-up, a great deal of debate about the situation occurred in the First World during the early days of the event Journalists mistrusted many professionals, and they in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them [211]\n\n\nNuclear debate\nBecause of the distrust many had in the Soviet authorities, which engaged in a cover-up, a great deal of debate about the situation occurred in the First World during the early days of the event Journalists mistrusted many professionals, and they in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them [211]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Chernobyl tragedy has inspired many artists across the world to create works of art, animation, video games, theatre and cinema about the disaster The HBO series Chernobyl and the book Voices from Chernobyl by the Ukrainian-Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich are two well-known works [260] The Ukrainian artist Roman Gumanyuk created a series of artworks called \"Pripyat Lights, or Chernobyl shadows\" that includes 30 oil paintings about the Chernobyl accident, exhibited in 2012–2013 [261] [262]\n\n\nSee also\n51°23′23″N 30°05′57″E﻿ / ﻿51.38972°N 30.09917°E﻿ / 51.38972; 30.09917﻿

Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Ukraine). It is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and one of the most significant environmental disasters of the 20th century. The accident was caused by a combination of human error, design flaws, and inadequate safety procedures. This article provides an overview of the accident, its causes, and its consequences.\n\n## Accident Sequence\n\nIn nuclear reactor operation, most heat is generated by nuclear fission, but over 6% comes from radioactive decay heat, which continues after the reactor shuts down. Continued coolant circulation is essential to prevent core overheating or a core meltdown. RBMK reactors, like those at Chernobyl, use water as a coolant, circulated by electrically driven pumps. Reactor No. 4 had 1,661 individual fuel channels, requiring over 12 million US gallons per hour for the entire reactor.\n\n## Background\n\nIn nuclear reactor operation, most heat is generated by nuclear fission, but over 6% comes from radioactive decay heat, which continues after the reactor shuts down.

Reactor No. 4 had 1,661 individual fuel channels, requiring over 12 million US gallons per hour for the entire reactor.\n\n## Reactor Cooling after Shutdown\n\nIn nuclear reactor operation, most heat is generated by nuclear fission, but over 6% comes from radioactive decay heat, which continues after the reactor shuts down. Continued coolant circulation is essential to prevent core overheating or a core meltdown. RBMK reactors, like those at Chernobyl, use water as a coolant, circulated by electrically driven pumps. Reactor No. 4 had 1,661 individual fuel channels, requiring over 12 million US gallons per hour for the entire reactor.\n\n## Safety Test\n\nThe turbine run-down energy capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally, and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully. An initial test carried out in 1982 indicated that the excitation voltage of the turbine-generator was insufficient. The electrical system was modified, and the test was repeated in 1984 but again proved unsuccessful. In 1985, the test was conducted a third time but also yielded no results due to a problem with the recording equipment. The test procedure was to be run again in 1986 and was scheduled to take place during a controlled power-down of reactor No. 4, which was preparatory to a planned maintenance outage.\n\n## Test Delay and Shift Change\n\nThe test was to be conducted during the day-shift of 25 April 1986 as part of a scheduled reactor shutdown. The day shift had been instructed in advance on the reactor operating conditions to run the test, and a special team of electrical engineers was present to conduct the electrical test once the correct conditions were reached. As planned, a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit began at 01:06 on 25 April, and the power level had reached 50% of its nominal 3,200 MW thermal level by the beginning of the day shift.\n\n## Unexpected Drop of the Reactor Power\n\nThe test plan called for a gradual decrease in reactor power to a thermal level of 700–1000 MW. However, due to the reactor's production of a fission byproduct, xenon-135, which is a reaction-inhibiting neutron absorber, power continued to decrease in the absence of further operator action, a process known as reactor poisoning. In steady-state operation, this is avoided because xenon-135 is \"burned off\" as quickly as it is created, becoming highly stable xenon-136.\n\n## Reactor Conditions Priming the Accident\n\nWhen a power level of 200 MW was reattained, preparation for the experiment continued, although the power level was much lower than the prescribed 700 MW. As part of the test, two additional main circulating pumps were activated at 01:05. The increased coolant flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core. Because water absorbs neutrons better than steam, the neutron flux and reactivity decreased. The operators responded by removing more manual control rods to maintain power. It was around this time that the number of control rods inserted in the reactor fell below the required value of 15.\n\n## Accident\n\nAt 01:23:04, the test began. Four of the eight main circulating pumps (MCP) were to be powered by voltage from the coasting turbine, while the remaining four pumps received electrical power from the grid as normal. The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator. The diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were to have completely picked up the MCPs' power needs by 01:23:43. As the momentum of the turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps. The water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids in the coolant flowing up through the fuel pressure tubes.\n\n## Explosions\n\nAs the scram continued, the reactor output jumped to around 30,000 MW thermal, 10 times its normal operational output. The indicated last reading on the control panel. It was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building. A steam explosion appears to have been the next event. There is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the reactor's exterior cooling structure that caused the explosion that destroyed the reactor casing, tearing off and blasting the upper plate called the upper biological shield, to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened, through the roof of the reactor building. This is believed to be the first explosion that many heard.\n\n## Possible Causes for the Second Explosion\n\nThere were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second, larger explosion. One view was that the second explosion was caused by the combustion of hydrogen, which had been produced either by the overheated steam-zirconium reaction or by the reaction of red-hot graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Another hypothesis, by Konstantin Checherov, published in 1998, was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor due to the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core.\n\n## Fizzled Nuclear Explosion Hypothesis\n\nThe force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released after the accident led Sergei A Pakhomov and Yuri V Dubasov in 2009 to theorize that the second explosion could have been an extremely fast nuclear power transient resulting from core material melting in the absence of its water coolant and moderator. Pakhomov and Dubasov argued that there was no delayed supercritical increase in power but a runaway prompt criticality, similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon.\n\n## Immediate Response\n\nContrary to safety regulations, bitumen, a combustible material, had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall. Ejected material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor No. 3, which was still operating. It was imperative to put out those fires and protect the cooling systems of reactor No. 3.

the day shift [21]: 53 \n\n\nUnexpected drop of the reactor power\nThe test plan called for a gradual decrease in reactor power to a thermal level of 700–1000 MW, [25] and an output of 720 MW was reached at 00:05 on 26 April [21]: 53  However, due to the reactor's production of a fission byproduct, xenon-135, which is a reaction-inhibiting neutron absorber, power continued to decrease in the absence of further operator action, a process known as reactor poisoning In steady-state operation, this is avoided because xenon-135 is \"burned off\" as quickly as it is created, becoming highly stable xenon-136 With the reactor power reduced, high quantities of previously produced iodine-135 were decaying into the neutron-absorbing xenon-135 faster than the reduced neutron flux could \"burn it off\" [26] Xenon poisoning in this context made reactor control more difficult, but was a predictable phenomenon during such a power reduction.\n\n\nReactor conditions priming the accident\nWhen a

neutron flux and reactivity decreased The operators responded by removing more manual control rods to maintain power [28] [29] It was around this time that the number of control rods inserted in the reactor fell below the required value of 15 This was not apparent to the operators, because the RBMK did not have any instruments capable of calculating the inserted rod worth in real time.\n\n\nAccident\nAt 01:23:04, the test began [30] Four of the eight main circulating pumps (MCP) were to be powered by voltage from the coasting turbine, while the remaining four pumps received

through the fuel pressure tubes [21]: 8 \n\n\nReactor shutdown and power excursion\nAt 01:23:40, a scram (emergency shutdown) of the reactor was initiated [31] as the experiment was wrapping-up [32] The scram was started when the AZ-5 button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed: this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them, including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier.\n\n\nExplosions\nAs the scram continued, the reactor output jumped to around 30,000 MW thermal, 10 times its normal operational output, the indicated last reading on the control panel Some estimate the power spike may have gone 10 times higher than that It was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building, but a steam explosion appears to have been the next event There is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel

roof of the adjacent reactor No. 3, which was still operating It was imperative to put out those fires and protect the cooling systems of reactor No. 3 [18]: 42  Inside reactor No. 3, the chief of the night shift, Yuri Bagdasarov, wanted to shut down the reactor immediately, but chief engineer Nikolai Fomin would not allow this The operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working At 05:00, Bagdasarov made his own decision to shut down the reactor, [18]: 44  which was confirmed in writing by Dyatlov and Station Shift Supervisor Rogozhkin.\n\n\nFire

Supervisor Rogozhkin.\n\n\nRadiation levels\nThe ionizing radiation levels in the worst-hit areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be 5.6 roentgens per second (R/s), equivalent to more than 20,000 roentgens per hour A lethal dose is around 500 roentgens (~5 Gray (Gy) in modern radiation units) over five hours In some areas, unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute Unfortunately, a dosimeter capable of measuring up to 1,000 R/s was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building, and another one failed when turned on Most remaining dosimeters had limits of 0.001 R/s and therefore read \"off scale\" The reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above 0.001 R/s (3.6 R/h), while the true levels were vastly higher in some areas [18]: 42–50 \n\n\nAccident investigation\nThe IAEA had created the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG) in 1985 [59] INSAG produced two significant reports on Chernobyl: INSAG-1 in 1986, and a revised report, INSAG-7, in 1992 According to INSAG-1, the main cause of the accident was the operators' actions, but according to INSAG-7, the main cause was the reactor's design [21]: 24  [60] Both reports identified an inadequate \"safety culture\" (INSAG-1 coined the term) at all managerial and operational levels as a major underlying factor [21]: 21, 24 \n\n\nCrisis management\nThe nearby city of Pripyat was not immediately evacuated and the townspeople were not alerted during the night to what had just happened However, within a few hours, dozens of people fell ill Later, they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths, along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting [61] [better source needed] As the plant was run by authorities in Moscow, the government of Ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident [62]\n\n\nEvacuation\nThe nearby city of Pripyat was not immediately evacuated and the townspeople were not alerted during the night to what had just happened However, within a few hours, dozens of people fell ill Later, they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths, along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting [61] [better source needed] As the plant was run by authorities in Moscow, the government of Ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident [62]\n\n\nOfficial announcement\nEvacuation began one and a half days before the accident was publicly acknowledged by the Soviet Union In the morning of 28 April, radiation levels set off alarms at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant in Sweden, [67] [68] over 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) from the Chernobyl Plant Workers at Forsmark reported the case to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, which determined that the radiation had originated elsewhere That day, the Swedish government contacted the Soviet government to inquire about whether there had been a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union The Soviets initially denied it It was only after the Swedish government suggested they were about to file an official alert with the International Atomic Energy Agency that the Soviet government admitted that an accident had taken place at Chernobyl [68] [69]\n\n\nCore meltdown risk mitigation\nTwo floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe; the third floor above them, below the reactor, served as a steam tunnel The steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water After the disaster, the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water.\n\n\nBubbler pools\nTwo floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe; the third floor above them, below the reactor, served as a steam tunnel The steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water After the disaster, the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water.\n\n\nFoundation protection measures\nThe government commission was concerned that the molten core would burn into the earth and contaminate groundwater To reduce the likelihood of this, it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor, which would also stabilize the foundations Using oil well drilling equipment, injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May It was estimated that 25 tonnes (55 thousand pounds) of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at −100 °C (−148 °F) [18]: 59  This idea was quickly scrapped [87]\n\n\nSite cleanup\n\nIn the months after the explosion, attention turned to removing the radioactive debris from the roof [90] While the worst of the radioactive debris had remained inside what was left of the reactor, an estimated 100 tons of debris on that roof had to be removed to enable the safe construction of the \"sarcophagus\"—a concrete structure that would entomb the reactor and reduce radioactive dust being released [90] The initial plan was to use robots to clear the roof The Soviets used approximately 60 remote-controlled robots, primarily designed for use in lunar exploration or policing work  [91]most of them built in the Soviet Union Most famous of these robots was the modified West German Police robot \"Joker\" a bright yellow robot \n\nDebris removal\n\nIn the months after the explosion, attention turned to removing the radioactive debris from the roof [90] While the worst of the radioactive debris had remained inside what was left of the reactor, an estimated 100 tons of debris on that roof had to be removed to enable the safe construction of the \"sarcophagus\"—a concrete structure that would entomb the reactor and reduce radioactive dust being

[91]most of them built in the Soviet Union Most famous of these robots was the modified West German Police robot \"Joker\" a bright yellow robot \n\nConstruction of the sarcophagus\nWith the extinguishing of the open air reactor fire, the next step was to prevent the spread of contamination due to wind or birds which could land within the wreckage and then carry contamination elsewhere In addition, rainwater could wash contamination into the sub-surface water table, where it could migrate outside the site area Rainwater falling on the wreckage could also accelerate corrosion of steelwork in the remaining reactor structure A further challenge was to reduce the large amount of emitted gamma radiation, which was a hazard to the workforce operating the adjacent reactor No. 3.\n\n\nInvestigations of the reactor condition\nDuring the construction of the sarcophagus, a scientific team, as part of an investigation dubbed \"Complex Expedition\", re-entered the reactor to locate and contain nuclear fuel to prevent another explosion These scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core Rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes The scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation [54]\n\n\nArea cleanup\nThe official contaminated zones saw a massive clean-up effort lasting seven months [64]: 177–183  The official reason for such early, and dangerous, decontamination efforts, rather than allowing time for natural decay, was that the land must be repopulated and brought back into cultivation Within fifteen months 75% of the land was under cultivation, even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled Defence forces must have done much of the work Yet this land was of marginal agricultural value According to David Marples, the administration wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy, and even to restart the power station [64]: 78–79, 87, 192–193 \n\n\nSite remediation\nQuestions arose about the future of the plant and its fate All work on the unfinished reactors No. 5 and No. 6 was halted three years later The damaged reactor was sealed off and 200 cubic meters (260 cu yd) of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational buildings The Ukrainian government allowed the three remaining reactors to continue operating because of an energy shortage.\n\n\nNo. 4 reactor confinement\nSoon after the accident, the reactor building was quickly encased by a mammoth concrete sarcophagus Crane operators worked blindly from inside lead-lined cabins taking instructions from distant radio observers, while gargantuan-sized pieces of concrete were moved to the site on custom-made vehicles The purpose of the sarcophagus was to stop any further release of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, isolate the exposed core from the weather and provide safety for the continued operations of adjacent reactors one through three [101]\n\n\nWaste management\nUsed fuel from units 1–3 was stored in the units' cooling ponds, and in an interim spent fuel storage facility pond, ISF-1, which now holds most of the spent fuel from units 1–3, allowing those reactors to be decommissioned under less restrictive conditions Approximately 50 of the fuel assemblies from units 1 and 2 were damaged and required special handling Moving fuel to ISF-1 was thus carried out in three stages: fuel from unit 3 was moved first, then all undamaged fuel from units 1 and 2, and finally the damaged fuel from units 1 and 2 Fuel transfers to ISF-1 were completed in June 2016 [106]\n\n\nFuel-containing materials\nThe radioactive material consists of core fragments, dust, and lava-like \"fuel containing materials\" (FCM)—also called \"corium\"—that flowed through the wrecked reactor building before hardening into a ceramic form.\n\n\nExclusion zone\nThe Exclusion Zone was originally an area with a radius of 30 kilometres (19 mi) in all directions from the plant, but was subsequently greatly enlarged to include an area measuring approximately 2,600 km2 (1,000 sq mi), officially called the \"zone of alienation\" The area has largely reverted to forest and was overrun by wildlife due to the lack of human competition for space and resources [113]\n\n\nForest fire concerns\nDuring the dry season, forest fires are a perennial concern in areas contaminated by radioactive material Dry conditions and build-up of debris make the forests a ripe breeding ground for wildfires [122] Depending on prevailing atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires could potentially spread more radioactive material outside the exclusion zone [123] [124] In Belarus, the Bellesrad organization is tasked with overseeing food cultivation and forestry management in the area.\n\n\nRecovery projects\nThe Chernobyl Trust Fund was created in 1991 by the United Nations to help victims of the Chernobyl accident [127] It is administered by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which also manages strategy formulation, resource mobilization, and advocacy efforts [128] Beginning in 2002, under the United Nations Development Programme, the fund shifted its focus from emergency assistance to long-term development [129] [128]\n\n\nTourism\nFirst limited guided tours were begun in 2002 [132] The 2007 release of the video game S.T.A.L.K.E.R increased the site popularity [133] and tour operators estimated that 40,000 tourists visited the site between 2007 and 2017 [134] Between 2017 and 2022, over 350,000 tourists visited the site, hitting the maximum peak of almost 125,000 visitors in 2019, coinciding with the release of HBO's mini-series about the disaster [135] [136]  After its release in July 2019, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that the Chernobyl site would become an official tourist attraction Zelenskyy said, \"We must give this territory of Ukraine a new life.\" [137] [138] Dr T Steen, a microbiology and immunology teacher at Georgetown's School of Medicine, recommends tourists to wear clothes and shoes they are comfortable with throwing away and to avoid plant life [133] Tourism has rebound after COVID in 2021, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 meant the Chernobyl area saw active fighting and the exclusion zone closed to all visitors It remains closed to tourism as of summer 2024 [139]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nAlthough it is difficult to compare the Chernobyl accident with a deliberate air burst nuclear detonation, it is estimated that Chernobyl released about 400 times more radioactive material than the combined atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki However, the Chernobyl disaster released only about one-hundredth to one-thousandth of the total radioactivity released during nuclear weapons testing at the height of the Cold War, due to varying isotope abundances [143]\n\n\nRelease and spread of radioactive materials\nAlthough it is difficult to compare the Chernobyl accident with a deliberate air burst nuclear detonation, it is estimated that Chernobyl released about 400 times more radioactive material than the combined atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki However, the Chernobyl disaster released only about one-hundredth to one-thousandth of the total radioactivity released during nuclear weapons testing at the height of the Cold War, due to varying isotope abundances [143]\n\n\nRelative isotopic abundances\nThe Chernobyl release was characterized by the physical and chemical properties of the radio-isotopes in the core Particularly dangerous were the highly radioactive fission products, those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain, such as some of the isotopes of iodine, caesium and strontium Iodine-131 was and caesium-137 remains the two most responsible for the radiation exposure received by the general population [2]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nThe Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the Pripyat River, which feeds into the Dnieper reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in Europe, which at the time supplied water to Kiev's 2.4 million residents, and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred [64]: 60  The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath [161]\n\n\nWater bodies\nThe Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the Pripyat River, which feeds into the Dnieper reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in Europe, which at the time supplied water to Kiev's 2.4 million residents, and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred [64]: 60  The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath [161]\n\n\nFlora, fauna, and funga\nAfter the disaster, four square kilometres (1.5 sq mi) of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned reddish-brown and died, earning the name \"Red Forest\" [166] Some animals in the worst-hit areas also died or stopped reproducing Most domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone, but horses left on an island in the Pripyat River 6 km (4 mi) from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of 150–200 Sv [167] Some cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted The next generation appeared to be normal [167] The mutation rates for plants and animals have increased by a factor of 20 because of the release of radionuclides from Chernobyl There is evidence for elevated mortality rates and increased rates of reproductive failure in contaminated areas, consistent with the expected frequency of deaths due to mutations [168]\n\n\nHuman food chain\nWith radiocaesium binding less with humic acid, peaty soils than the known binding \"fixation\" that occurs on kaolinite-rich clay soils, many marshy areas of Ukraine had the highest soil to dairy-milk transfer coefficients, of soil activity in ~ 200 kBq/m2 to dairy milk activity in Bq/L, that had ever been reported, with the transfer, from initial land activity into milk activity, ranging from 0.3−2 to 20−2 times that which was on the soil [154]\n\n\nPrecipitation on distant high ground\nOn high ground, such as mountain ranges, there is increased precipitation due to adiabatic cooling This resulted in localized concentrations of contaminants on distant areas; higher in Bq/m2 values to many lowland areas much closer to the source of the plume.\n\n\nHuman impact\nThe only known causal deaths from the accident involved plant workers and firefighters The reactor explosion killed two engineers, and 28 others died within three months from acute radiation syndrome (ARS) [8] Some sources report a total initial fatality of 31, [190] [191] including one additional off-site death due to coronary thrombosis attributed to stress [8]\n\n\nAcute radiation effects and immediate aftermath\nThe only known causal deaths from the accident involved plant workers and firefighters The reactor explosion killed two engineers, and 28 others died within three months from acute radiation syndrome (ARS) [8] Some sources report a total initial fatality of 31, [190] [191] including one additional off-site death due to coronary thrombosis attributed to stress [8]\n\n\nLong-term impact\nIn the 10 years following the accident, 14 more people who had been initially hospitalized died, mostly from causes unrelated to radiation exposure, with only two deaths resulting from myelodysplastic syndrome [8] Scientific consensus, supported by the Chernobyl Forum, suggests no statistically significant increase in solid cancer incidence among rescue workers [195] However, childhood thyroid cancer increased, with about 4,000 new cases reported by 2002 in contaminated areas of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, largely due to high levels of radioactive iodine The recovery rate is ~99%, with 15 terminal cases reported [195] No increase in mutation rates was found among children of liquidators or those living in contaminated areas [196]\n\n\nEffects of main harmful radionuclides\nThe four most harmful radionuclides spread from Chernobyl were iodine-131, caesium-134, caesium-137 and strontium-90, with half-lives of 8 days, 2.07 years, 30.2 years and 28.8 years respectively [198]: 8  The iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes, because of its short half-life, but it is highly volatile and appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems [144]: 24  Strontium is the least volatile and of main concern in the areas near Chernobyl [198]: 8 \n\n\nDisputed investigation\nThe mutation rates among animals in the Chernobyl zone have been a topic of ongoing scientific debate, notably regarding the research conducted by Anders Moller and Timothy Mousseau [203] [204] Their research, which suggests higher mutation rates among wildlife in the Chernobyl zone, has been met with criticism over the reproducibility of their findings and the methodologies used [205] [206]\n\n\nWithdrawn investigation\nIn 1996, geneticist Ronald Chesser and Robert Baker published a paper [207] on the thriving vole population within the exclusion zone, in which the central conclusion was essentially that \"The mutation rate in these animals is hundreds and probably thousands of times greater than normal\" This claim occurred after they had done a comparison of the mitochondrial DNA of the \"Chernobyl voles\" with that of a control group of voles from outside the region [208] The authors discovered they had incorrectly classified the species of vole and were genetically comparing two different vole species They issued a retraction in 1997 [203] [209] [210]\n\n\nAbortions\nFollowing the accident, journalists encouraged public mistrust of medical professionals [211] This media-driven framing led to an increase in induced abortions across Europe out of fears of radiation An estimated 150,000 elective abortions were performed worldwide due to radiophobia [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] [216] The statistical data excludes Soviet–Ukraine–Belarus abortion rates, which are unavailable However, in Denmark, about 400 additional abortions were recorded, and in Greece, an increase of 2,500 terminations occurred despite the low radiation dose [212] [213]\n\n\nCancer assessments\nA report by the International Atomic Energy Agency examines the environmental consequences of the accident [162] The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation estimated a global collective dose from the accident equivalent to \"21 additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation\"; doses were far higher among 530,000 recovery workers, who averaged an extra 50 years of typical natural background radiation exposure [222] [223] [224]\n\n\nOther disorders\nFred Mettler, a radiation expert, estimated 9,000 Chernobyl-related cancer deaths worldwide, noting that while small relative to normal cancer risks, the numbers are large in absolute terms [237] The report highlighted the risks to mental health from exaggerated radiation fears, noting that labeling the affected population as \"victims\" contributed to a sense of helplessness [230] Mettler also commented that 20 years later, the population remained unsure about radiation effects, leading to harmful behaviors [237]\n\n\nLong-term radiation deaths\nThe potential deaths from the Chernobyl disaster are heavily debated The World Health Organization predicted 4,000 future cancer deaths in surrounding countries, [13] based on the Linear no-threshold model (LNT), which assumes that even low doses of radiation increase cancer risk proportionally [240] The Union of Concerned Scientists estimated approximately 27,000 excess cancer deaths worldwide, using the same LNT model [241]\n\n\nSocio-economic impact\nIt is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster According to Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union spent 18 billion Rbls ($5.9 billion in today's dollars [245]) on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself [246] In 2005, the total cost over 30 years for Belarus was estimated at US$235 billion [230] Gorbachev later wrote that \"the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl...was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\" [247]\n\n\nSignificance\nBecause of the distrust many had in the Soviet authorities, which engaged in a cover-up, a great deal of debate about the situation occurred in the First World during the early days of the event Journalists mistrusted many professionals, and they in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them [211]\n\n\nNuclear debate\nBecause of the distrust many had in the Soviet authorities, which engaged in a cover-up, a great deal of debate about the situation occurred in the First World during the early days of the event Journalists mistrusted many professionals, and they in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them [211]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Chernobyl tragedy has inspired many artists across the world to create works of art, animation, video games, theatre and cinema about the disaster The HBO series Chernobyl and the book Voices from Chernobyl by the Ukrainian-Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich are two well-known works [260] The Ukrainian artist Roman Gumanyuk created a series of artworks called \"Pripyat Lights, or Chernobyl shadows\" that includes 30 oil paintings about the Chernobyl accident, exhibited in 2012–2013 [261] [262]\n\n\nSee

on right-wing dismay over the decision by French President Charles de Gaulle to abandon his promise of holding on to the colony of French Algeria, (many frontistes, including Le Pen, were part of an inner circle of returned servicemen known as Le cercle national des combattants) [34] [35] During the 1965 presidential election, Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right-wing vote around presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour [36] Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, the French far-right consisted mainly of small, extreme movements such as Occident, Groupe Union Défense (GUD), and the Ordre Nouveau (ON) [37]\n\n\nBackground\nThe party's ideological roots can be traced to both Poujadism, a populist, small business tax protest movement founded in 1953 by

Occident, Groupe Union Défense (GUD), and the Ordre Nouveau (ON) [37]\n\n\nEarly years\nWhile Ordre Nouveau had competed in some local elections since 1970, at its second congress, in June 1972, it decided to establish a new political party to contest the 1973 legislative elections [40] [41] The party was launched on 5 October 1972 under the name National Front for French Unity (Front national pour l'unité française), or Front National [42] In order to create a broad movement, ON sought to model the new party (as it earlier had sought to model itself) on the more established Italian Social Movement (MSI), which at the time appeared to establish a broad coalition of the Italian hard right The FN adopted a French version of the MSI tricolour flame as its logo [43] [44] [45] ON wanted to unite the various French far-right currents, and brought together \"nationals\" of Le Pen's group and Roger Holeindre's Party of French Unity; \"nationalists\" from Pierre Bousquet's Militant movement or François Brigneau's and Alain Robert's Ordre Nouveau; the anti-Gaullist Georges Bidault's Justice and Liberty movement; as well as former Poujadists, Algerian War veterans, and some monarchists, among others [42] [46] [47] Le Pen was chosen to be the first president of the party, as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure in the far-right [48] [49]\n\n\nFoundation (1972–1973)\nWhile Ordre Nouveau had competed in some local elections since 1970, at its second congress, in June 1972, it decided to establish a new political party to contest the 1973 legislative elections [40] [41] The party was launched on 5 October 1972 under the name National Front for French Unity (Front national pour l'unité française), or Front National [42]

chosen to be the first president of the party, as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure in the far-right [48] [49]\n\n\nFN–PFN rivalry (1973–1981)\nFollowing the 1974 election, the FN was obscured by the appearance of the Party of New Forces (PFN), founded by FN dissidents (largely from the ON) [59] [60] Their competition weakened both parties throughout the 1970s [59] Along with the growing influence of François Duprat and his \"revolutionary nationalists\", the FN gained several new groups of supporters in the late 1970s and early 1980s: Jean-Pierre Stirbois (1977) and his \"solidarists\", Bruno Gollnisch (1983), Bernard Antony (1984) and his Catholic fundamentalists, as well as Jean-Yves Le Gallou (1985) and the Nouvelle Droite [61] [62] Following the death of Duprat in a bomb attack in 1978, the revolutionary nationalists left the party, while Stirbois became Le Pen's deputy as his solidarists effectively ousted the neo-fascist tendency in the party leadership [63] A radical group split off in 1980 and founded the French Nationalist Party, dismissing the FN as becoming \"too Zionist\" with Le Pen being a \"puppet of the Jews.\" [64] The far right was marginalised altogether in the 1978 legislative elections, although the PFN came out better off [65] [66] In the first election for the European Parliament in 1979, the PFN became part of an attempt to build a \"Euro-Right\" alliance of the continent's far-right parties, and was in the end the only one of the two that contested the election [67] It fielded Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour as its primary candidate, while Le Pen called for voter abstention [68]\n\n\nJean-Marie Le Pen's leadership\nWhile the French party system had been dominated by polarisation and competition between the clear-cut ideological alternatives of two political blocs in the 1970s, the two blocs had largely moved towards the centre by the mid-1980s This led many voters to perceive the blocs as more or less indistinguishable, particularly after the Socialists' \"austerity turn\" (tournant de la rigueur) of 1983, [72] in turn inducing them to seek out to new political alternatives [73] By October 1982, Le Pen supported the prospect of deals with the mainstream right, provided that the FN did not have to soften its position on \"key issues.\" [74] In the 1983 municipal elections, the centre-right Rally for the Republic (RPR) and the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF) formed alliances with the FN in a number of towns [74] The most notable result came in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, where Le Pen was elected to the local council with 11% of the vote [74] [75] Subsequent by-elections kept media attention on the party, which was for the first time able to pose as a viable component of the broader right [76] [77] In a by-election in Dreux in October 1983, the FN won 17% of the vote [74] With the choice of defeat to the political left or dealing with the FN, the local RPR and UDF agreed to form an alliance with the FN, causing a national sensation; [74] together, they won the second round with 55% of the vote [75] The events in Dreux were a monumental turning point in the rise of the FN [78]\n\n\nElectoral breakthrough (1982–1988)\nWhile the French party system had been dominated by polarisation and competition between the clear-cut ideological alternatives of two political blocs in the 1970s, the two blocs had largely moved towards the centre by the mid-1980s This led many voters to perceive the blocs as more or less

FN [78]\n\n\nConsolidation (1988–1997)\nLe Pen's campaign for the presidential election unofficially began in the months following the 1986 election [92] To promote his statesmanship credentials, he made trips to South East Asia, the United States, and Africa [92] The management of the formal campaign, launched in April 1987, was entrusted to Bruno Mégret, one of the new notables [92] With his entourage, Le Pen traversed France for the entire period and, helped by Mégret, employed an American-style campaign [93] Le Pen's presidential campaign was highly successful; no candidates came close to rival his ability to excite audiences at rallies and boost ratings at television appearances [92] Using a populist tone, he presented himself as the representative of the people against the \"gang of four\" (RPR, UDF, PS, Communist Party), while the central theme of his campaign was \"national preference\" [92] In the 1988 presidential election, Le Pen won an unprecedented 14.4% of the vote, [94] and double the votes of 1984 [95]\n\n\nTurmoil and split of the MNR (1997–2002)\nIn the 1997 legislative elections, the FN polled its best-ever result with 15.3% support in metropolitan France [114] [115] The result showed that the party had become established enough to compete without its leader, who had decided not to run, in order to focus on the 2002 presidential election [116] Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly, in Toulon, [117] it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies [118] The FN was arguably more influential at that time than it had been in 1986 with its 35 seats [119] While Bruno Mégret and Bruno Gollnisch, favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre-right following the left's victory, Le Pen rejected any such \"compromise.\" [120] In the tenth FN national congress in 1997, Mégret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen [121] Le Pen however refused to designate Mégret as his successor-elect, and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election [122]\n\n\nPresidential run-off (2002)\nFor the 2002 presidential election, opinion polls had predicted a run-off between incumbent President Chirac and Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin [127] [128] In a shock outcome, Le Pen outperformed Jospin (by 0.7%) in the 1st round, placing second and advancing to the runoff [128] This resulted in the first presidential run-off since 1969 without a leftist candidate and the first ever with a candidate from the far-right [129] To Le Pen's advantage, the election campaign had increasingly focused on law-and-order issues, helped by media attention on a number of violent incidents [130] Jospin had also been weakened due to the competition between an exceptional number of leftist parties [131] Nevertheless, Chirac did not even have to campaign in the second round, as widespread anti-Le Pen protests from the media and public opinion culminated on May Day in a demonstration of 1.5 million participants across France [132] Chirac also refused to debate with Le Pen, and the traditional televised debate was cancelled [133] In the end, Chirac won the presidential run-off with an unprecedented 82.2% of the vote, with 71% of his votes—according to polls—cast simply \"to block Le Pen\" [133] Following the presidential election, the main centre-right parties merged to form the broad-based Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) [134] The FN failed to hold on to Le Pen's support for the 2002 legislative elections, in which it got 11.3% of the vote [135] It nevertheless outpolled Mégret's MNR, which had fielded the same number of candidates but won a mere 1.1% support [136]\n\n\nDecline (2003–2010)\nA new electoral system of two-round voting had been introduced for the 2004 regional elections, in part in an attempt to reduce the FN's influence in regional councils [137] The FN won 15.1% of the vote in metropolitan France, almost the same as in 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new system [138] For the 2004 European elections, too, a new system less favourable to the FN had been introduced [139] The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats [139]\n\n\nMarine Le Pen's leadership\nJean-Marie Le Pen announced in September 2008 that he would retire as FN president in 2010 [127] Le Pen's daughter Marine Le Pen and FN executive vice-president Bruno Gollnisch campaigned to succeed Le Pen, [127] with Marine's candidacy backed by her father [127] On 15 January 2011, it was announced that Marine Le Pen had received the two-thirds vote needed to become the new leader of the FN [144] [145] She embarked on a project to transform the FN into a \"mainstream party\" by softening its xenophobic image [127] [144] [145] Opinion polls showed the party's popularity increase under Marine Le Pen, and in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15% of the overall vote (up from 4.5% in 2008) However, due to the French electoral system, the party only won 2 of the 2,026 seats that were up for election [146]\n\n\nRevival of the FN (2011–2012)\nJean-Marie Le Pen announced in September 2008 that he would retire as FN president in 2010 [127] Le Pen's daughter Marine Le Pen and FN executive vice-president Bruno Gollnisch campaigned to succeed Le Pen, [127] with Marine's candidacy backed by her father [127] On 15 January 2011, it was announced that Marine Le Pen had received the two-thirds vote needed to become the new leader of the FN [144] [145] She embarked on a project to transform the FN into a \"mainstream party\" by softening its xenophobic image [127] [144] [145] Opinion polls showed the party's popularity increase under Marine Le Pen, and in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15% of the overall vote (up from 4.5% in 2008) However, due to the French electoral system, the party only won 2 of the 2,026 seats that were up for election [146]\n\n\nElectoral successes (2012–2017)\nIn the municipal elections held on 23 and 30 March 2014, lists officially supported by the National Front won mayoralties in 12 cities: Beaucaire, Cogolin, Fréjus, Hayange, Hénin-Beaumont, Le Luc, Le Pontet, Mantes-la-Ville, the 7th arrondissement of Marseille, Villers-Cotterêts, Béziers and Camaret-sur-Aigues While some of these cities were in southern France (like Fréjus) which traditionally votes more for right-wing parties than the rest of the country, others were located in northern France, where Socialist Party had been strong until the 2010s Following these elections, the National Front had, in cities of over 1,000 inhabitants, 1,546 and 459 councilors at two different levels of local government [153]\n\n\nPresidential and parliamentary election, rebranding (2017–2022)\nOn 24 April 2017, a day after the first round of the presidential election, Marine Le Pen announced that she would temporarily step down as the party's leader in an attempt to \"unite voters.\" [19] In the second round of voting, Le Pen was defeated 66.1% to 33.9% by her rival Emmanuel Macron of En Marche! [162]\n\n\nJordan Bardella's leadership\nJordan Bardella was elected president of the RN on 5 November 2022, ending Marine Le Pen's period as president of the party Le Pen remained president of the RN's parliamentary group [20]\n\n\n2024 European parliament election\nIn the 2024 European parliamentary elections, the RN won the most delegates of any single party (30) On 8 July, Bardella became president of the Patriots for Europe, originally founded by Viktor Orbán with the Czech ANO and the Austrian FPÖ parties on a platform of refusing military aid to Ukraine, anti-immigration, and pro-\"traditional family\" values [182] The group, the third largest in the parliament, also includes members from the Flemish Vlaams Belang, the Dutch PVV, [183] and the Italian Lega per Salvini Premier [184]\n\n\n2024 legislative election\nIn June 2024, the party joined with the micro-party \"To the right! Friends of Eric Ciotti\", forming the union of the far-right in the 2024 French legislative election [186] Together, these parties secured the largest share of the vote in the first round with 33.15% of the vote [187] More voters who reported struggling financially voted for the RN than for any other party [188]\n\n\nIdeology\nDefunct\n\n\nSociety\nThe party opposed the 2016 criminalisation of the use of prostitution in France, on the grounds that it would negatively affect the safety of sex workers [204]\n\n\nFeminism\nIn the 2002 legislative elections, the first under the new gender parity provision in the French Constitution, Le Pen's National Front was among the few parties to come close to meeting the law, with 49% female candidates; Jospin's Socialists had 36%, and Chirac's UMP had 19.6% [205] Women voters in France were traditionally more attracted to mainstream conservative parties than the radical right until the 2000s The proportion of women in the party has risen to 39% by 2017 [206]\n\n\nLaw and order\nIn 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen campaigned on a law-and-order platform of zero tolerance, harsher sentencing, increased prison capacity, and a referendum on re-introducing the death penalty [129] In its 2001 programme, the party linked the breakdown of law and order to immigration, deeming immigration a \"mortal threat to civil peace in France.\" [131]\n\n\nImmigration\nSince its early years, the party has called for immigration to be reduced [210] The theme of exclusion of non-European immigrants was brought into the party in 1978 and became increasingly important in the 1980s [211]\n\n\nIslam\nThe National Rally has sought to restrict Islamic practice in France In 2011, Marine Le Pen warned that wearing full face veils are \"the tip of the iceberg\" of Islamisation of French culture [216] In 2021, [217] and again in 2022, Le Pen again proposed banning the wearing of hijab (which covers the head but not the face) in public [218] Le Pen also proposed to ban the production of both halal and kosher meat [218] Le Pen says she is \"against the visibility of Islam\" but not Islam per se [219] [220]\n\n\nEconomy\nAt the end of the 1970s, Jean-Marie Le Pen broke away from the anti-capitalist heritage of Poujadism and espoused a market liberal and anti-statist programme which included lower taxes, reducing state intervention, reducing the size of the public sector, privatisation, and scaling back government bureaucracy Some scholars have characterised the FN's 1978 programme as \"Reaganite before Reagan\" [211]\n\n\nClimate\nLe Pen does not plan to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, but has stated that climate change is \"not the priority\" of the party [239] The party is against measures to tackle climate change and protecting the environment [240] The National Rally has proposed abolition of the European Green Deal, highlighting key policies it opposes such as the 2035 ban on fossil fuel cars [241]\n\n\nForeign policy\nFrom the 1980s to the 1990s, the party's policy shifted from favouring the European Union to turning against it [228] In 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen campaigned on pulling France out of the EU and re-introducing the franc as the country's national currency [129] In the early 2000s the party denounced the Schengen, Maastricht, and Amsterdam treaties as foundations for \"a supranational entity spelling the end of France.\" [242] In 2004, the party criticised the EU as \"the last stage on the road to world government\", likening it to a \"puppet of the New World Order.\" [243] It also proposed breaking all institutional ties back to the Treaty of Rome, while it returned to supporting a common European currency to rival the United States dollar [243] Further, it rejected the possible accession of Turkey to the EU [243] The FN was also one of several parties that backed France's 2005 rejection of the Treaty for a European Constitution In other issues, Le Pen opposed the invasions of Iraq, led by the United States, both in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War [212] He visited Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in 1990, and subsequently considered him a friend [244]\n\n\nRussia and Ukraine\nMarine Le Pen described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"defender of the Christian heritage of European civilisation.\" [259] The National Front considers that Ukraine has been subjugated by the United States, through the Revolution of Dignity The National Front denounces anti-Russian feelings in Eastern Europe and the submission of Western Europe to \"Washington's\" interests in the region [260] Marine Le Pen is very critical against the threats of sanctions directed by the international community against Russia: \"European countries should seek a solution through diplomacy rather than making threats that could lead to an escalation.\" She argues that the United States is leading a new Cold War against Russia She sees no other solution for peace in Ukraine than to organise a kind of federation that would allow each region to have a large degree of autonomy [261] She thinks Ukraine should be sovereign and free as any other nation [262]\n\n\nEuropean Union\nSince their entry into the European Parliament in 1979, the National Rally has promoted a message of being pro-Europe, but anti-EU [270] However, in 2019, the proposal that France leave the Eurozone and the EU was removed from the party's manifesto, which has since called for \"reform from within\" of the union [271] [272] [273] The party advocates that EU legislation should be initiated by the Council of the EU rather than the European Commission, and that French laws should have primacy over EU laws [31] [208]\n\n\nNATO\nThe party's stance on NATO has varied throughout the years Under Jean-Marie Le Pen's leadership, the party advocated a complete withdrawal from the organization, while under Marine Le Pen's leadership, the party has softened its stance to instead advocate leaving NATO's integrated military command structure, which France joined in 2009 [274] [275] [276] [277] Jordan Bardella later added that the RN would not advocate withdrawing France from the integrated command while the Russian invasion of Ukraine was ongoing [278]\n\n\nElectoral reform and referendums\nThe National Rally has advocated for full proportional representation in France, claiming that the two-round system disenfranchises voters In early 2021, Marine Le Pen, along with centrist politician François Bayrou and green politician Julien Bayou, cosigned a letter asking President Emmanuel Macron to implement proportional representation for future elections [279]\n\n\nControversies\nThere has been a difference between Marine Le Pen's and her father's opinions concerning the Holocaust and Jews In 2005, Jean-Marie Le Pen wrote in the far-right weekly magazine Rivarol that the German occupation of France \"was not particularly inhumane, even if there were a few blunders, inevitable in a country of 640,000 square kilometres (250,000 sq mi.)\" and in 1987 referred to the Nazi gas chambers as \"a point of detail of the history of the Second World War\" He has repeated the latter claim several times [280]  In 2004, Bruno Gollnisch said: \"I do not question the existence of concentration camps, but historians could discuss the number of deaths As to the existence of gas chambers, it is up to historians to determine.\" [281] Jean-Marie Le Pen was fined for these remarks, but Gollnisch was found not guilty by the Court of Cassation [282] [283] [284]  The leader of the party, Marine Le Pen, distanced herself for a time from the party machine in protest at her father's comments [285] In response to her father's remarks, Marine Le Pen referred to the Holocaust as the \"abomination of abominations\" [286]\n\n\nOpinions on the holocaust, and relations with Jewish groups\nThere has been a difference between Marine Le Pen's and her father's opinions concerning the Holocaust and Jews In 2005, Jean-Marie Le Pen wrote in the far-right weekly magazine Rivarol that the German occupation of France \"was not particularly inhumane, even if there were a few blunders, inevitable in a country of 640,000 square kilometres (250,000 sq mi.)\" and in 1987 referred to the Nazi gas chambers as \"a point of detail of the history of the Second

Pen referred to the Holocaust as the \"abomination of abominations\" [286]\n\n\nCzecho-Russian bank loan\nIn November 2014, Marine Le Pen confirmed that the party had received a €9 million loan from the First Czech Russian Bank (FCRB) in Moscow to the National Front [289] [290] Senior FN officials from the party's political bureau informed Mediapart that this was the first instalment of a €40 million loan, although Marine Le Pen has disputed this [259] [290] The Independent said the loans \"take Moscow's attempt to influence the internal politics of the EU to a new level.\" [259] Reinhard Bütikofer stated, \"It's remarkable that a political party from the motherland of freedom can be funded by Putin's sphere—the largest European enemy of freedom.\" [291] Marine Le Pen argued that it was not a donation from the Russian government but a loan from a private Russian bank because no other bank would give her a loan This loan is meant to prepare future electoral campaigns and to be repaid progressively Marine Le Pen has publicly disclosed all the rejection letters that French banks have sent to her concerning her loan requests [292] Since November 2014, she insists that if a French bank agrees to give her a loan, she would break her contract with the FCBR, but she has not received any other counter-propositions [293] Le Pen accused the banks of collusion with the government [292] In April 2015, a Russian hacker group published texts and emails between Timur Prokopenko, a member of Putin's administration, and Konstantin Rykov, a former Duma deputy with ties to France, discussing Russian financial support to the National Front in exchange for its support of Russia's annexation of Crimea, though this has not coalesced [294]\n\n\nLinks with banned neo-fascist group\nA 2019 undercover investigation by Al Jazeera uncovered links between high-ranking National Rally figures and Generation Identity, a far-right group In secretly taped conversations, RN leaders endorsed goals of Generation Identity and discussed plans to \"remigrate\" immigrants, effectively sending them back to their countries of origin, if the RN came to power Christelle Lechevalier, a RN Member of the European Parliament (MEP), said that many RN leaders held similar opinions as the GI, but sought to hide them from voters [295]\n\n\nAlleged payment of party officials with EU funds\nIn December 2023, 28 people, including Marine Le Pen and her father Jean Marie, were ordered to stand trial after they were charged with a scheme which involved paying National Rally party officials through EU funds which were earmarked for European Parliament assistants [296] [297]\n\n\nOrganization\nThe executive bureau features: Jordan Bardella (president), Steeve Briois (vice-president),

representatives\nAs of February 2023, the National Rally has 88 MPs They sit in the National Assembly as members of the National Rally group.\n\n\nInternational affiliation and relations\nThe FN has been part of several groups in the European Parliament The first group it helped co-establish was the European Right after the 1984 election, which also consisted of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), its early inspiration, and the Greek National Political Union [309] Following the 1989 election, it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group, while the MSI left due to the Germans' arrival [310] As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance, it chose to distance itself from the FN [311] From 1999 to 2001, the FN was a member of the Technical Group of Independents In 2007, it was part of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group Between the mentioned groups, the party sat among the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits It was part of the Identity and Democracy group, which also includes the Freedom Party of Austria, Italian Northern League, Vlaams Belang, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the Czech Freedom and Direct Democracy, the Dutch Freedom Party, the Conservative People's Party of Estonia, the Finns Party, and the Danish People's Party.\nIt was formerly known as the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, during which time it also included the Polish Congress of the New Right, a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania's Conservative Party The RN has also been part of the Identity and Democracy Party (formerly the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom) since 2014, which additionally includes Slovakia's We Are Family and the Bulgarian Volya Movement, which was later renamed Patriots.eu After the 2024 European Parliament election, the National Rally joined the Patriots for Europe group with Fidesz, Vox, the Czech ANO 2011, the Portuguese Chega, the Greek Voice of Reason, Latvia First and most former ID members, with Bardella ultimately chairing the group [312]\n\n\nElection results\nThe National Front was a marginal party in 1973, the first election it participated in, but the party made its breakthrough in the 1984 European Parliament election, where it won 11% of the vote and ten MEPs Following this election, the party's support mostly ranged from around 10 to 15%, although it saw a drop to around 5% in some late 2000s elections Since 2010, the party's support seems to have increased towards its former heights The party managed to advance to the final round of the 2002 French presidential election, although it failed to attract much more support after the initial first round vote In the late 2000s the party suffered decline in elections Under Marine Le Pen's presidency the party has increased its vote share significantly The National Front came first in a national election for the first time during the 2014 European elections, when it gained 24% of the vote During the 2017 presidential election the party advanced to the second round of the election for the second time, and doubled the percentage it received in the 2002 presidential election, earning 34% In the 2019 European elections the rebranded National Rally retained its spot as first party.\n\n\nNational Assembly\n\n\nPresidential\n\n\nRegional

The FN adopted a French version of the MSI tricolour flame as its logo. ON wanted to unite the various French far-right currents, and brought together \"nationals\" of Le Pen's group and Roger Holeindre's Party of French Unity; \"nationalists\" from Pierre Bousquet's Militant movement or François Brigneau's and Alain Robert's Ordre Nouveau; the anti-Gaullist Georges Bidault's Justice and Liberty movement; as well as former Poujadists, Algerian War veterans, and some monarchists.\n\n## FN–PFN rivalry (1973–1981)\n\nFollowing the 1974 election, the FN was obscured by the appearance of the Party of New Forces (PFN), founded by FN dissidents. Their competition weakened both parties throughout the 1970s.\n\n## Electoral breakthrough (1982–1988)\n\nLe Pen's campaign for the presidential election unofficially began in the months following the 1986 election. To promote his statesmanship credentials, he made trips to South East Asia, the United States, and Africa. Le Pen's presidential campaign was highly successful; no candidates came close to rival his ability to excite audiences at rallies and boost ratings at television appearances.\n\n## Consolidation (1988–1997)\n\nLe Pen's campaign for the presidential election unofficially began in the months following the 1986 election.

Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly, in Toulon, it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies.\n\n## Presidential run-off (2002)\n\nFor the 2002 presidential election, opinion polls had predicted a run-off between incumbent President Chirac and Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin. In the second round of voting, Le Pen was defeated 66.1% to 33.9% by his rival Emmanuel Macron of En Marche!.\n\n## Revival of the FN (2011–2012)\n\nMarine Le Pen announced in September 2008 that she would retire as FN president in 2010.

and the Ordre Nouveau (ON) [37]\n\n\nEarly years\nWhile Ordre Nouveau had competed in some local elections since 1970, at its second congress, in June 1972, it decided to establish a new political party to contest the 1973 legislative elections [40] [41] The party was launched on 5 October 1972 under the name National Front for French Unity (Front national pour l'unité française), or Front National [42] In order to create a broad movement, ON sought to model the new party (as it earlier had sought to model itself) on the more established Italian Social Movement (MSI), which at the time appeared to establish a broad coalition of the Italian hard right The FN adopted a French version of the MSI tricolour flame as its logo [43] [44] [45] ON wanted to unite the various French far-right currents, and brought together \"nationals\" of Le Pen's group and Roger Holeindre's Party of French Unity; \"nationalists\" from Pierre Bousquet's Militant movement or François Brigneau's and Alain Robert's Ordre Nouveau; the anti-Gaullist Georges Bidault's Justice and Liberty movement; as well as former Poujadists, Algerian War veterans, and some monarchists, among others [42] [46] [47] Le Pen was chosen to be the first president of the party, as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure in the far-right [48] [49]\n\n\nFoundation

\"nationals\" of Le Pen's group and Roger Holeindre's Party of French Unity; \"nationalists\" from Pierre Bousquet's Militant movement or François Brigneau's and Alain Robert's Ordre Nouveau; the anti-Gaullist Georges Bidault's Justice and Liberty movement; as well as former Poujadists, Algerian War veterans, and some monarchists, among others [42] [46] [47] Le Pen was chosen to be the first president of the party, as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure in the far-right [48] [49]\n\n\nFN–PFN rivalry (1973–1981)\nFollowing the 1974 election, the FN was obscured by the appearance of the Party of New Forces (PFN), founded by FN dissidents (largely from the ON) [59] [60] Their competition weakened both parties throughout the 1970s [59] Along with the growing influence of François Duprat and his \"revolutionary nationalists\", the FN gained several new groups of supporters in the late 1970s and early 1980s: Jean-Pierre Stirbois (1977) and his \"solidarists\", Bruno Gollnisch (1983), Bernard Antony (1984) and his Catholic fundamentalists, as well as Jean-Yves Le Gallou (1985) and the Nouvelle Droite [61] [62] Following the death of Duprat in a bomb attack in 1978, the revolutionary nationalists left the party, while Stirbois became Le Pen's deputy as his solidarists effectively ousted the neo-fascist tendency in the party leadership [63] A radical group split off in 1980 and founded the French Nationalist Party, dismissing the FN as becoming \"too Zionist\" with Le Pen being a \"puppet of the Jews.\" [64] The far right was marginalised altogether in the 1978 legislative elections, although the PFN came out better off [65] [66] In the first election for the European Parliament in 1979, the PFN became part of an attempt to build a \"Euro-Right\" alliance of the continent's far-right parties, and was in the end the only one of the two that contested the election [67] It fielded Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour as its primary candidate, while Le Pen called for voter abstention [68]\n\n\nJean-Marie Le Pen's leadership\nWhile the French party system had been dominated by polarisation and competition between the clear-cut ideological alternatives of two political blocs in the 1970s, the two blocs had largely moved towards the centre by the mid-1980s This led many voters to perceive the blocs as more or less indistinguishable, particularly after the Socialists' \"austerity turn\" (tournant de la rigueur) of 1983, [72] in turn inducing them to seek out to new political alternatives [73] By October 1982, Le Pen supported the prospect of deals with the mainstream right, provided that the FN did not have to soften its position on \"key issues.\" [74] In the 1983 municipal elections, the centre-right Rally for the Republic (RPR) and the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF) formed alliances with the FN in a number of towns [74] The most notable result came in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, where Le Pen was elected to the local council with 11% of the vote [74] [75] Subsequent by-elections kept media attention on the party, which was for the first time able to pose as a viable component of the broader right [76] [77] In a by-election in Dreux in October 1983, the FN won 17% of the vote [74] With the choice of defeat to the political left or dealing with the FN, the local RPR and UDF agreed to form an alliance with the FN, causing a national sensation; [74] together, they won the second round with 55% of the vote [75] The events in Dreux were a monumental turning point in the rise of the FN [78]\n\n\nElectoral breakthrough (1982–1988)\nWhile the French party system had been dominated by polarisation and competition between the clear-cut ideological alternatives of two political blocs

national sensation; [74] together, they won the second round with 55% of the vote [75] The events in Dreux were a monumental turning point in the rise of the FN [78]\n\n\nConsolidation (1988–1997)\nLe Pen's campaign for the presidential election unofficially began in the months following the 1986 election [92] To promote his statesmanship credentials, he made trips to South East Asia, the United States, and Africa [92] The management of the formal campaign, launched in April 1987, was entrusted to Bruno Mégret, one of the new notables [92] With his entourage, Le Pen traversed France for the entire period and, helped by Mégret, employed an American-style campaign [93] Le Pen's presidential campaign was highly successful; no candidates came close to rival his ability to excite audiences at rallies and boost ratings at television appearances [92] Using a populist tone, he presented himself as the representative of the people against the \"gang of four\" (RPR, UDF, PS, Communist Party), while the central theme of his campaign was \"national preference\" [92] In the 1988 presidential election, Le Pen won an unprecedented 14.4% of the vote, [94] and double the votes of 1984 [95]\n\n\nTurmoil and split of the MNR (1997–2002)\nIn the 1997 legislative elections, the FN polled its best-ever result with 15.3% support in metropolitan France [114] [115] The result showed that the party had become established enough to compete without its leader, who had decided not to run, in order to focus on the 2002 presidential election [116] Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly, in Toulon, [117] it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies [118] The FN was arguably more influential at that time than it had been in 1986 with its 35 seats [119] While Bruno Mégret and Bruno Gollnisch, favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre-right following the left's victory, Le Pen rejected any such \"compromise.\" [120] In the tenth FN national congress in 1997, Mégret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen [121] Le Pen however refused to designate Mégret as his successor-elect, and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election [122]\n\n\nPresidential run-off (2002)\nFor the 2002 presidential election, opinion polls had predicted a run-off between incumbent President Chirac and Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin [127] [128] In a shock outcome, Le Pen outperformed Jospin (by 0.7%) in the 1st round, placing second and advancing to the runoff [128] This resulted in the first presidential run-off since 1969 without a leftist candidate and the first ever with a candidate from the far-right [129] To Le Pen's advantage, the election campaign had increasingly focused on law-and-order issues, helped by media attention on a number of violent incidents [130] Jospin had also been weakened due to the competition between an exceptional number of leftist parties [131] Nevertheless, Chirac did not even have to campaign in the second round, as widespread anti-Le Pen protests from the media and public opinion culminated on May Day in a demonstration of 1.5 million participants across France [132] Chirac also refused to debate with Le Pen, and the traditional televised debate was cancelled [133] In the end, Chirac won the presidential run-off with an unprecedented 82.2% of the vote, with 71% of his votes—according to polls—cast simply \"to block Le Pen\" [133] Following the presidential election, the main centre-right parties merged to form the broad-based Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) [134] The FN failed to hold on to Le Pen's support for the 2002 legislative elections, in which it got 11.3% of the vote [135] It nevertheless outpolled Mégret's MNR, which had fielded the same number of candidates but won a mere 1.1% support [136]\n\n\nDecline (2003–2010)\nA new electoral system of two-round voting had been introduced for the 2004 regional elections, in part in an attempt to reduce the FN's influence in regional councils [137] The FN won 15.1% of the vote in metropolitan France, almost the same as in 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new system [138] For the 2004 European elections, too, a new system less favourable to the FN had been introduced [139] The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats [139]\n\n\nMarine Le Pen's leadership\nJean-Marie Le Pen announced in September 2008 that he would retire as FN president in 2010 [127] Le Pen's daughter Marine Le Pen and FN executive vice-president Bruno Gollnisch campaigned to succeed Le Pen, [127] with Marine's candidacy backed by her father [127] On 15 January 2011, it was announced that Marine Le Pen had received the two-thirds vote needed to become the new leader of the FN [144] [145] She embarked on a project to transform the FN into a \"mainstream party\" by softening its xenophobic image [127] [144] [145] Opinion polls showed the party's popularity increase under Marine Le Pen, and in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15% of the overall vote (up from 4.5% in 2008) However, due to the French electoral system, the party only won 2 of the 2,026 seats that were up for election [146]\n\n\nRevival of the FN (2011–2012)\nJean-Marie Le Pen announced in September 2008 that he would retire as FN president in 2010 [127] Le Pen's daughter Marine Le Pen and FN executive vice-president Bruno Gollnisch campaigned to succeed Le Pen, [127] with Marine's candidacy backed by her father [127] On 15 January 2011, it was announced that Marine Le Pen had received the two-thirds vote needed to become the new leader of the FN [144] [145] She embarked on a project to transform the FN into a \"mainstream party\" by softening its xenophobic image [127] [144] [145] Opinion polls showed the party's popularity increase under Marine Le Pen, and in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15% of the overall vote (up from 4.5% in 2008) However, due to the French electoral system, the party only won 2 of the 2,026 seats that were up for election [146]\n\n\nElectoral successes (2012–2017)\nIn the municipal elections held on 23 and 30 March 2014, lists officially supported by the National Front won mayoralties in 12 cities: Beaucaire, Cogolin, Fréjus, Hayange, Hénin-Beaumont, Le Luc, Le Pontet, Mantes-la-Ville, the 7th arrondissement of Marseille, Villers-Cotterêts, Béziers and Camaret-sur-Aigues While some of these cities were in southern France (like Fréjus) which traditionally votes more for right-wing parties than the rest of the country, others were located in northern France, where Socialist Party had been strong until the 2010s Following these elections, the National Front had, in cities of over 1,000 inhabitants, 1,546 and 459 councilors at two different levels of local government [153]\n\n\nPresidential and parliamentary election, rebranding (2017–2022)\nOn 24 April 2017, a day after the first round of the presidential election, Marine Le Pen announced that she would temporarily step down as the party's leader in an attempt to \"unite voters.\" [19] In the second round of voting, Le Pen was defeated 66.1% to 33.9% by her rival Emmanuel Macron of En Marche! [162]\n\n\nJordan Bardella's leadership\nJordan Bardella was elected president of the RN on 5 November 2022, ending Marine Le Pen's period as president of the party Le Pen remained president of the RN's parliamentary group [20]\n\n\n2024 European parliament election\nIn the 2024 European parliamentary elections, the RN won the most delegates of any single party (30) On 8 July, Bardella became president of the Patriots for Europe, originally founded by Viktor Orbán with the Czech ANO and the Austrian FPÖ parties on a platform of refusing military aid to Ukraine, anti-immigration, and pro-\"traditional family\" values [182] The group, the third largest in the parliament, also includes members from the Flemish Vlaams Belang, the Dutch PVV, [183] and the Italian Lega per Salvini Premier [184]\n\n\n2024 legislative election\nIn June 2024, the party joined with the micro-party \"To the right! Friends of Eric Ciotti\", forming the union of the far-right in the 2024 French legislative election [186] Together, these parties secured the largest share of the vote in the first round with 33.15% of the vote [187] More voters who reported struggling financially voted for the RN than for any other party [188]\n\n\nIdeology\nDefunct\n\n\nSociety\nThe party opposed the 2016 criminalisation of the use of prostitution in France, on the grounds that it would negatively affect the safety of sex workers [204]\n\n\nFeminism\nIn the 2002 legislative elections, the first under the new gender parity provision in the French Constitution, Le Pen's National Front was among the few parties to come close to meeting the law, with 49% female candidates; Jospin's Socialists had 36%, and Chirac's UMP had 19.6% [205] Women voters in France were traditionally more attracted to mainstream conservative parties than the radical right until the 2000s The proportion of women in the party has risen to 39% by 2017 [206]\n\n\nLaw and order\nIn 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen campaigned on a law-and-order platform of zero tolerance, harsher sentencing, increased prison capacity, and a referendum on re-introducing the death penalty [129] In its 2001 programme, the party linked the breakdown of law and order to immigration, deeming immigration a \"mortal threat to civil peace in France.\" [131]\n\n\nImmigration\nSince its early years, the party has called for immigration to be reduced [210] The theme of exclusion of non-European immigrants was brought into the party in 1978 and became increasingly important in the 1980s [211]\n\n\nIslam\nThe National Rally has sought to restrict Islamic practice in France In 2011, Marine Le Pen warned that wearing full face veils are \"the tip of the iceberg\" of Islamisation of French culture [216] In 2021, [217] and again in 2022, Le Pen again proposed banning the wearing of hijab (which covers the head but not the face) in public [218] Le Pen also proposed to ban the production of both halal and kosher meat [218] Le Pen says she is \"against the visibility of Islam\" but not Islam per se [219] [220]\n\n\nEconomy\nAt the end of the 1970s, Jean-Marie Le Pen broke away from the anti-capitalist heritage of Poujadism and espoused a market liberal and anti-statist programme which included lower taxes, reducing state intervention, reducing the size of the public sector, privatisation, and scaling back government bureaucracy Some scholars have characterised the FN's 1978 programme as \"Reaganite before Reagan\" [211]\n\n\nClimate\nLe Pen does not plan to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, but has stated that climate change is \"not the priority\" of the party [239] The party is against measures to tackle climate change and protecting the environment [240] The National Rally has proposed abolition of the European Green Deal, highlighting key policies it opposes such as the 2035 ban on fossil fuel cars [241]\n\n\nForeign policy\nFrom the 1980s to the 1990s, the party's policy shifted from favouring the European Union to turning against it [228] In 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen campaigned on pulling France out of the EU and re-introducing the franc as the country's national currency [129] In the early 2000s the party denounced the Schengen, Maastricht, and Amsterdam treaties as foundations for \"a supranational entity spelling the end of France.\" [242] In 2004, the party criticised the EU as \"the last stage on the road to world government\", likening it to a \"puppet of the New World Order.\" [243] It also proposed breaking all institutional ties back to the Treaty of Rome, while it returned to supporting a common European currency to rival the United States dollar [243] Further, it rejected the possible accession of Turkey to the EU [243] The FN was also one of several parties that backed France's 2005 rejection of the Treaty for a European Constitution In other issues, Le Pen opposed the invasions of Iraq, led by the United States, both in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War [212] He visited Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in 1990, and subsequently considered him a friend [244]\n\n\nRussia and Ukraine\nMarine Le Pen described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"defender of the Christian heritage of European civilisation.\" [259] The National Front considers that Ukraine has been subjugated by the United States, through the Revolution of Dignity The National Front denounces anti-Russian feelings in Eastern Europe and the submission of Western Europe to \"Washington's\" interests in the region [260] Marine Le Pen is very critical against the threats of sanctions directed by the international community against Russia: \"European countries should seek a solution through diplomacy rather than making threats that could lead to an escalation.\" She argues that the United States is leading a new Cold War against Russia She sees no other solution for peace in Ukraine than to organise a kind of federation that would allow each region to have a large degree of autonomy [261] She thinks Ukraine should be sovereign and free as any other nation [262]\n\n\nEuropean Union\nSince their entry into the European Parliament in 1979, the National Rally has promoted a message of being pro-Europe, but anti-EU [270] However, in 2019, the proposal that France leave the Eurozone and the EU was removed from the party's manifesto, which has since called for \"reform from within\" of the union [271] [272] [273] The party advocates that EU legislation should be initiated by the Council of the EU rather than the European Commission, and that French laws should have primacy over EU laws [31] [208]\n\n\nNATO\nThe party's stance on NATO has varied throughout the years Under Jean-Marie Le Pen's leadership, the party advocated a complete withdrawal from the organization, while under Marine Le Pen's leadership, the party has softened its stance to instead advocate leaving NATO's integrated military command structure, which France joined in 2009 [274] [275] [276] [277] Jordan Bardella later added that the RN would not advocate withdrawing France from the integrated command while the Russian invasion of Ukraine was ongoing [278]\n\n\nElectoral reform and referendums\nThe National Rally has advocated for full proportional representation in France, claiming that the two-round system disenfranchises voters In early 2021, Marine Le Pen, along with centrist politician François Bayrou and green politician Julien Bayou, cosigned a letter asking President Emmanuel Macron to implement proportional representation for future elections [279]\n\n\nControversies\nThere has been a difference between Marine Le Pen's and her father's opinions concerning the Holocaust and Jews In 2005, Jean-Marie Le Pen wrote in the far-right weekly magazine Rivarol that the German occupation of France \"was not particularly inhumane, even if there were a few blunders, inevitable in a country of 640,000 square kilometres (250,000 sq mi.)\" and in 1987 referred to the Nazi gas chambers as \"a point of detail of the history of the Second World War\" He has repeated the latter claim several times [280]  In 2004, Bruno Gollnisch said: \"I do not question the existence of concentration camps, but historians could discuss the number of deaths As to the existence of gas chambers, it is up to historians to determine.\" [281] Jean-Marie Le Pen was fined for these remarks, but Gollnisch was found not guilty by the Court of Cassation [282] [283] [284]  The leader of the party, Marine Le Pen, distanced herself for a time from the party machine in protest at her father's comments [285] In response to her father's remarks, Marine Le Pen referred to the Holocaust as the \"abomination of abominations\" [286]\n\n\nOpinions on the holocaust, and relations with Jewish groups\nThere has been a difference between Marine Le Pen's and her father's opinions concerning the Holocaust and Jews In 2005, Jean-Marie Le Pen wrote in the far-right weekly magazine Rivarol that the German occupation of France \"was not particularly inhumane, even if there were a few blunders, inevitable in a country of 640,000 square kilometres (250,000 sq mi.)\" and in 1987 referred to the Nazi gas chambers as \"a point of detail of the history of the Second World War\" He has repeated the latter claim several times [280]  In 2004, Bruno Gollnisch said: \"I do not question the existence of concentration camps, but historians could discuss the number of deaths As to the existence of gas chambers, it is up to historians to determine.\" [281] Jean-Marie Le Pen was fined for these remarks, but Gollnisch was found not guilty by the Court of Cassation [282] [283] [284]  The leader of the party, Marine Le Pen, distanced herself for a time from the party machine in protest at her father's comments [285] In response to her father's remarks, Marine Le Pen referred to the Holocaust as the \"abomination of abominations\" [286]\n\n\nCzecho-Russian bank loan\nIn November 2014, Marine Le Pen confirmed that the party had received a €9 million loan from the First Czech Russian Bank (FCRB) in Moscow to the National Front [289] [290] Senior FN officials from the party's political bureau informed Mediapart that this was the first instalment of a €40 million loan, although Marine Le Pen has disputed this [259] [290] The Independent said the loans \"take Moscow's attempt to influence the internal politics of the EU to a new level.\" [259] Reinhard Bütikofer stated, \"It's remarkable that a political party from the motherland of freedom can be funded by Putin's sphere—the largest European enemy of freedom.\" [291] Marine Le Pen argued that it was not a donation from the Russian government but a loan from a private Russian bank because no other bank would give her a loan This loan is meant to prepare future electoral campaigns and to be repaid progressively Marine Le Pen has publicly disclosed all the rejection letters that French banks have sent to her concerning her loan requests [292] Since November 2014, she insists that if a French bank agrees to give her a loan, she would break her contract with the FCBR, but she has not received any other counter-propositions [293] Le Pen accused the banks of collusion with the government [292] In April 2015, a Russian hacker group published texts and emails between Timur Prokopenko, a member of Putin's administration, and Konstantin Rykov, a former Duma deputy with ties to France, discussing Russian financial support to the National Front in exchange for its support of Russia's annexation of Crimea, though this has not coalesced [294]\n\n\nLinks with banned neo-fascist group\nA 2019 undercover investigation by Al Jazeera uncovered links between high-ranking National Rally figures and Generation Identity, a far-right group In secretly taped conversations, RN leaders endorsed goals of Generation Identity and discussed plans to \"remigrate\" immigrants, effectively sending them back to their countries of origin, if the RN came to power Christelle Lechevalier, a RN Member of the European Parliament (MEP), said that many RN leaders held similar opinions as the GI, but sought to hide them from voters [295]\n\n\nAlleged payment of party officials with EU funds\nIn December 2023, 28 people, including Marine Le Pen and her father Jean Marie, were ordered to stand trial after they were charged with a scheme which involved paying National Rally party officials through EU funds which were earmarked for European Parliament assistants [296] [297]\n\n\nOrganization\nThe executive bureau features: Jordan Bardella (president), Steeve Briois (vice-president), Louis Aliot (vice-president), David Rachline (vice-president), Kévin Pfeffer (treasurer), Julien Sanchez (spokesperson),  Gilles Pennelle (regional councilor), Edwige Diaz (deputy regional councilor), Hélène Laporte, Philippe Olivier, and Jean-Paul Garraud [298]\n\n\nLeadership\nThe executive bureau features: Jordan Bardella (president), Steeve Briois (vice-president), Louis Aliot (vice-president), David Rachline (vice-president), Kévin Pfeffer (treasurer), Julien Sanchez (spokesperson),  Gilles Pennelle (regional councilor), Edwige Diaz (deputy regional councilor), Hélène Laporte, Philippe Olivier, and Jean-Paul Garraud [298]\n\n\nPresidents\nThe party had five vice presidents between July 2012 and March 2018 (against three previously) [301]\n\n\nVice Presidents\nThe party had five vice presidents between July 2012 and March 2018 (against three previously) [301]\n\n\nGeneral Secretaries\nThe position of General Secretary was held between 1972 and 2018: [299]\n\n\nElected representatives\nAs of February 2023, the National Rally has 88 MPs They sit in the National Assembly as members of the National Rally group.\n\n\nInternational affiliation and relations\nThe FN has been part of several groups in the European Parliament The first group it helped co-establish was the European Right after the 1984 election, which also consisted of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), its early inspiration, and the Greek National Political Union [309] Following the 1989 election, it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group, while the MSI left due to the Germans' arrival [310] As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance, it chose to distance itself from the FN [311] From 1999 to 2001, the FN was a member of the Technical Group of Independents In 2007, it was part of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group Between the mentioned groups, the party sat among the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits It was part of the Identity and Democracy group, which also includes the Freedom Party of Austria, Italian Northern League, Vlaams Belang, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the Czech Freedom and Direct Democracy, the Dutch Freedom Party, the Conservative People's Party of Estonia, the Finns Party, and the Danish People's Party.\nIt was formerly known as the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, during which time it also included the Polish Congress of the New Right, a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania's Conservative Party The RN has also been part of the Identity and Democracy Party (formerly the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom) since 2014, which additionally includes Slovakia's We Are Family and the Bulgarian Volya Movement, which was later renamed Patriots.eu After the 2024 European Parliament election, the National Rally joined the Patriots for Europe group with Fidesz, Vox, the Czech ANO 2011, the Portuguese Chega, the Greek Voice of Reason, Latvia First and most former ID members, with Bardella ultimately chairing the group [312]\n\n\nElection results\nThe National Front was a marginal party in 1973, the first election it participated in, but the party made its breakthrough in the 1984 European Parliament election, where it won 11% of the vote and ten MEPs Following this election, the party's support mostly ranged from around 10 to 15%, although it saw a drop to around 5% in some late 2000s elections Since 2010, the party's support seems to have increased towards its former heights The party managed to advance to the final round of the 2002 French presidential election, although it failed to attract much more support after the initial first round vote In the late 2000s the party suffered decline in elections Under Marine Le Pen's presidency the party has increased its vote share significantly The National Front came first in a national election for the first time during the 2014 European elections, when it gained 24% of the vote During the 2017 presidential election the party advanced to the second round of the election for the second time, and doubled the percentage it received in the 2002 presidential election, earning 34% In the 2019 European elections the rebranded National Rally retained its spot as first party.\n\n\nNational Assembly\n\n\nPresidential\n\n\nRegional

{"title": "Coronavirus", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name \"coronavirus\" is derived from Latin corona, meaning \"crown\" or \"wreath\", itself a borrowing from Greek κορώνη korṓnē, \"garland, wreath\" [8] [9] The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses [10] The word was first used in print in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal Nature to designate the new family of viruses [7] The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the virus) by electron microscopy, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of the solar corona or halo [7] [10] This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus [11]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens emerged in North America [15] Arthur Schalk and M.C Hawn in 1931 made the first detailed report which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness with high mortality rates of 40–90% [16] Leland David Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly isolated the virus that caused the infection in 1933 [17] The virus was then known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Charles D Hudson and Fred Robert Beaudette cultivated the virus for the first time in 1937 [18] The specimen came to be known as the Beaudette strain In the late 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, JHM that causes brain disease (murine encephalitis) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that causes hepatitis in mice were discovered [19] It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses were related [20] [12]\n\n\nMicrobiology\nCoronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections [43] Their size is highly variable with average diameters of 80 to 120 nm Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm in diameter [44] The total molecular mass is on average 40,000 kDa They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules [45] The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell [46]\n\n\nStructure\nCoronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections [43] Their size is highly variable with average diameters of 80 to 120 nm Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm in diameter [44] The total molecular mass is on average 40,000 kDa They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules [45] The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell [46]\n\n\nGenome\nCoronaviruses contain a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome The genome size for coronaviruses ranges from 26.4 to 31.7 kilobases [6] The genome size is one of the largest among RNA viruses The genome has a 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail [49]\n\n\nReplication cycle\nInfection begins when the viral spike protein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor After attachment, a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor-attached spike protein Depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane [58]\n\n\nCell entry\nInfection begins when the viral spike protein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor After attachment, a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor-attached spike protein Depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane [58]\n\n\nGenome translation\nOn entry into the host cell, the virus particle is uncoated, and its genome enters the cell cytoplasm The coronavirus RNA genome has a 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail, which allows it to act like a messenger RNA and be directly translated by the host cell's ribosomes The host ribosomes translate the initial overlapping open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b of the virus genome into two large overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab [49]\n\n\nReplicase-transcriptase\nA number of the nonstructural proteins coalesce to form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) The main replicase-transcriptase protein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist in the replication and transcription process The exoribonuclease nonstructural protein, for instance, provides extra fidelity to replication by providing a proofreading function which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacks [61]\n\n\nAssembly and release\nThe replicated positive-sense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses The mRNAs are gene transcripts of the last third of the virus genome after the initial overlapping reading frame These mRNAs are translated by the host's ribosomes into the structural proteins and many accessory proteins [49] RNA translation occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum The viral structural proteins S, E, and M move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment There, the M proteins direct most protein-protein interactions required for the assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid Progeny viruses are then released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles Once released the viruses can infect other host cells [64]\n\n\nTransmission\nInfected carriers are able to shed viruses into the environment The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with its complementary cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism, infectivity, and species range of the released virus [65] [66] Coronaviruses mainly target epithelial cells [42] They are transmitted from one host to another host, depending on the coronavirus species, by either an aerosol, fomite, or fecal-oral route [67]\n\n\nClassification\nCoronaviruses form the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, [2] [3] [4] which is one of two subfamilies in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria [42] [70] They are divided into the four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect mammals, while gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses primarily infect birds [71] [72]\n\n\nOrigin\nThe most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species [73] The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about 2400 BCE, of the betacoronavirus line at 3300 BCE, of the gammacoronavirus line at 2800 BCE, and the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 BCE Bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an ideal natural reservoir for the coronavirus gene pool (with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus – and birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses) The large number and global range of bat and avian species that host viruses have enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses [74]\n\n\nInfection in humans\nCoronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as MERS-CoV, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold [49] Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids [91] Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis) [92] The human coronavirus discovered in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections [92]\n\n\nCommon cold\nAlthough the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, [94] in about 15% of cases the cause is a coronavirus [95] The human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 continually circulate in the human population in adults and children worldwide and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold [88] The four mild coronaviruses have a seasonal incidence occurring in the winter months in temperate climates [96] [97]  There is no preponderance in any season in tropical climates [98]\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nIn 2003, following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which had begun the prior year in Asia, and secondary cases elsewhere in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a press release stating that a novel coronavirus identified by several laboratories was the causative agent for SARS The virus was officially named the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) More than 8,000 people from 29 countries and territories were infected, and at least 774 died [108] [69]\n\n\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)\nIn September 2012, a new type of coronavirus was identified, initially called Novel Coronavirus 2012, and now officially named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [109] [110] The World Health Organization issued a global alert soon after [111] The WHO update on 28 September 2012 said the virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person [112] However, on 12 May 2013, a case of human-to-human transmission in France was confirmed by the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health [113] In addition, cases of human-to-human transmission were reported by the Ministry of Health in Tunisia Two confirmed cases involved people who seemed to have caught the disease from their late father, who became ill after a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia Despite this, it appears the virus had trouble spreading from human to human, as most individuals who are infected do not transmit the virus [114] By 30 October 2013, there were 124 cases and 52 deaths in Saudi Arabia [115]\n\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nIn December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China [119] On 31 December 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus, [120] which was given the interim name 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, [121] [122] [123] later renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.\n\n\nCoronavirus HuPn-2018\nDuring a surveillance study of archived samples of Malaysian viral pneumonia patients, virologists identified a strain of canine coronavirus which has infected humans in 2018.\n\n\nInfection in animals\nCoronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological conditions in veterinary medicine since the 1930s [19]  They infect a range of animals including swine, cattle, horses, camels, cats, dogs, rodents, birds and bats [127]  The majority of animal related coronaviruses infect the intestinal tract and are transmitted by a fecal-oral route [128] Significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the viral pathogenesis of these animal coronaviruses, especially by virologists interested in veterinary and zoonotic diseases [129]\n\n\nFarm animals\nCoronaviruses infect domesticated birds [130] Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a type of coronavirus, causes avian infectious bronchitis [131] The virus is of concern to the poultry industry because of the high mortality from infection, its rapid spread, and its effect on production [127] The virus affects both meat production and egg production and causes substantial economic loss [132] In chickens, infectious bronchitis virus targets not only the respiratory tract but also the urogenital tract The virus can spread to different organs throughout the chicken [131] The virus is transmitted by aerosol and food contaminated by feces Different vaccines against IBV exist and have helped to limit the spread of the virus and its variants [127] Infectious bronchitis virus is one of a number of strains of the species Avian coronavirus [133] Another strain of avian coronavirus is turkey coronavirus (TCV) which causes enteritis in turkeys [127]\n\n\nDomestic pets\nCoronaviruses infect domestic pets such as cats, dogs, and ferrets [130] There are two forms of feline coronavirus which are both members of the species Alphacoronavirus 1 [136] Feline enteric coronavirus is a pathogen of minor clinical significance, but spontaneous mutation of this virus can result in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease with high mortality [127] There are two different coronaviruses that infect

"**Coronavirus**\n\nThe coronavirus is a large family of viruses that includes the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). These viruses are known to infect animals and humans, causing a range of symptoms from mild to severe, and in some cases, death.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"coronavirus\" is derived from Latin corona, meaning \"crown\" or \"wreath\", itself a borrowing from Greek κορώνη korṓnē, \"garland, wreath\". The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses. The word was first used in print in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal Nature to designate the new family of viruses.\n\n**History**\n\nThe earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens emerged in North America. Arthur Schalk and M.C Hawn in 1931 made the first detailed report which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness with high mortality rates of 40–90%. Leland David Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly isolated the virus that caused the infection in 1933. The virus was then known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Charles D Hudson and Fred Robert Beaudette cultivated the virus for the first time in 1937. The specimen came to be known as the Beaudette strain.\n\n**Microbiology**\n\nCoronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections. Their size is highly variable with average diameters of 80 to 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm in diameter. The total molecular mass is on average 40,000 kDa. They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules. The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.\n\n**Structure**\n\nCoronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections. Their size is highly variable with average diameters of 80 to 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm in diameter. The total molecular mass is on average 40,000 kDa. They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules. The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.\n\n**Genome**\n\nCoronaviruses contain a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. The genome size for coronaviruses ranges from 26.4 to 31.7 kilobases. The genome size is one of the largest among RNA viruses. The genome has a 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail.\n\n**Replication Cycle**\n\nInfection begins when the viral spike protein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor. After attachment, a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor-attached spike protein. Depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane.\n\n**Cell Entry**\n\nInfection begins when the viral spike protein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor. After attachment, a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor-attached spike protein. Depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane.\n\n**Genome Translation**\n\nOn entry into the host cell, the virus particle is uncoated, and its genome enters the cell cytoplasm. The coronavirus RNA genome has a 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail, which allows it to act like a messenger RNA and be directly translated by the host cell's ribosomes. The host ribosomes translate the initial overlapping open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b of the virus genome into two large overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab.\n\n**Replicase-Transcriptase**\n\nA number of the nonstructural proteins coalesce to form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC). The main replicase-transcriptase protein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand. The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist in the replication and transcription process. The exoribonuclease nonstructural protein, for instance, provides extra fidelity to replication by providing a proofreading function which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacks.\n\n**Assembly and Release**\n\nThe replicated positive-sense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses. The mRNAs are gene transcripts of the last third of the virus genome after the initial overlapping reading frame. These mRNAs are translated by the host's ribosomes into the structural proteins and many accessory proteins. RNA translation occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum. The viral structural proteins S, E, and M move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment. There, the M proteins direct most protein-protein interactions required for the assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid. Progeny viruses are then released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles. Once released, the viruses can infect other host cells.\n\n**Transmission**\n\nInfected carriers are able to shed viruses into the environment. The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with its complementary cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism, infectivity, and species range of the released virus. Coronaviruses mainly target epithelial cells. They are transmitted from one host to another host, depending on the coronavirus species, by either an aerosol, fomite, or fecal-oral route.\n\n**Classification**\n\nCoronaviruses form the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, which is one of two subfamilies in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are divided into the four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect mammals, while gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses primarily infect birds.\n\n**Origin**\n\nThe most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8,000 BCE, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long-term coevolution with bat and avian species. The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about 2,400 BCE, of the betacoronavirus line at 3,300 BCE, of the gammacoronavirus line at 2,800 BCE, and the deltacoronavirus line at about 3,000 BCE. Bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an ideal natural reservoir for the coronavirus gene pool (with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus – and birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses).\n\n**Infection in Humans**\n\nCoronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor. Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as MERS-CoV, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold. Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids. Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis).\n\n**Common Cold**\n\nAlthough the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, in about 15% of cases the cause is a coronavirus. The human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 continually circulate in the human population in adults and children worldwide and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold. The four mild coronaviruses have a seasonal incidence occurring in the winter months in temperate climates.\n\n**Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)**\n\nIn 2003, following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which had begun the prior year in Asia, and secondary cases elsewhere in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a press release stating that a novel coronavirus identified by several laboratories was the causative agent for SARS. The virus was officially named the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). More than 8,000 people from 29 countries and territories were infected, and at least 774 died.\n\n**Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)**\n\nIn September 2012, a new type of coronavirus was identified, initially called Novel Coronavirus 2012, and now officially named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The World Health Organization issued a global alert soon after. The WHO update on 28 September 2012 said the virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person. However, on 12 May 2013, a case of human-to-human transmission in France was confirmed by the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. In addition, cases of human-to-human transmission were reported by the Ministry of Health in Tunisia. Two confirmed cases involved people who seemed to have caught the disease from their late father, who became ill after a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia.\n\n**Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)**\n\nIn December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China. On 31 December 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus, which was given the interim name 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, later renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.\n\n**Infection in Animals**\n\nCoronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological conditions in veterinary medicine since the 1930s. They infect a range of animals including swine, cattle, horses, camels, cats, dogs, rodents, birds, and bats. The majority of animal-related coronaviruses infect the intestinal tract and are transmitted by a fecal-oral route.\n\n**Farm Animals**\n\nCoronaviruses infect domesticated birds. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a type of coronavirus, causes avian infectious bronchitis. The virus is of concern to the poultry industry because of the high mortality from infection, its rapid spread, and its effect on production.\n\n**Domestic Pets**\n\nCoronaviruses infect domestic pets such as cats, dogs, and ferrets. There are two forms of feline coronavirus which are both members of the species Alphacoronavirus 1. Feline enteric coronavirus is a pathogen of minor clinical significance, but spontaneous mutation of this virus can result in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease with high mortality.\n\n**Laboratory Animals**\n\nCoronaviruses infect laboratory animals. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which is a member of the species Murine coronavirus, causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory mice.\n\n**Prevention and Treatment**\n\nA number of vaccines using different methods have been developed against human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral targets against human coronaviruses have also been identified such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins. Drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different steps of viral replication.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Coronavirus\" following this

Born into a wealthy and influential Boston family, Atherton's life was marked by a series of significant events and experiences that shaped his personality and career.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nFrederick Atherton was born into a wealthy and influential Boston family. His father, William Atherton (1821–1891), had co-owned \"Atherton, Stetson and Company\", leather merchants and one of Boston's most successful businesses at the time. His father and paternal uncle were among Boston's largest taxpayers, reflecting the family's significant economic influence. Additionally, his father was the vice president of the Home Savings Bank and a director of the First National Bank of Boston, founded in 1864. This management of wealth would later stimulate Atherton's interests and career.\n\nGrowing up at 144 Warren Avenue in the Highlands area of Roxbury, Massachusetts, Atherton was surrounded by the city's affluent communities. Although Roxbury was incorporated as a city in 1846, by the time Atherton was born, it had been annexed as part of Boston in 1868 and became known as the Boston Highlands. This unique blend of urban and suburban environments would likely have shaped Atherton's worldview and perspectives.\n\nAtherton's family was deeply rooted in the city's social and economic fabric. His relatives were prominent figures in Boston's civic life, and his father's business ventures were widely respected. This family background would have provided Atherton with a strong foundation for his future endeavors.\n\n**Career**\n\nAlthough initially affiliated with Harvard University faculty, by the age of 25, Atherton was a broker for Fuller, Harding & Co. Shortly after, he moved to A B Turner & Brothers in 1890. This marked the beginning of his career in finance, where he would spend several years learning and gaining experience. Subsequently, Atherton became a writer of editorials of a financial nature for Boston newspapers, principally for the Boston Evening Transcript.

season, he had no specific position and was experimented in different positions, though his best streak came when he played centrally as a forward/false nine, roles that he is very familiar with [82]\n\n\nReception\nDue to his finesse and technique, Paul Merson called Havertz a Rolls-Royce footballer stating, \"Havertz is one of Chelsea's best players People forget he is class He knits things together He's a Rolls-Royce, he glides round the pitch.\" [83]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHavertz has been in a relationship with German model and social media influencer Sophia Weber since 2018 [84] The couple announced their engagement in July 2023 and wedded in July the following year [85] [86]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nBayer Leverkusen\n\n\nClub\nBayer Leverkusen\n\n\nInternational\nBayer

considered it \"full of easy rock-inflected pop, blithe and sometimes clever\" [185] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard acknowledged that the album demonstrates an originality in sound that was \"necessary for the revitalization of the boy band movement\" [183] The songs \"One Thing\" and \"What Makes You Beautiful\" were particularly noted for the genres of power pop and pop rock, for their \"powerhouse\" guitar riffs and \"forceful\" choruses [176] [177] [180] [186]\n\n\nOther ventures\nIn 2011, One Direction became the face of Pokémon Black and White, starring in a series of television

One Direction were dubbed as teen idols, [6] and were often subject to fan hysteria [7] [236] [237] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, in an article on One Direction's success in North America, notes that Americans had left a gap in the market and it took the prominence of Justin Bieber to demonstrate that there still was a market for \"clean cut, wholesome, whiter-than-white, middle class parent friendly pop: cute boys advocating puppy love And what could be better than one cute boy, if not five?\" [238] Bill Werde, a representative of Billboard magazine, commented, \"There's a lot of

Born on January 14, 1948, in New Orleans, Louisiana, Weathers has had a diverse and accomplished career in both sports and entertainment.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nWeathers was born to a day laborer father, and his athletic prowess began to manifest early in his life.

Weathers played football and graduated from Long Beach Poly High School in 1966.\n\n**College Football Career**\n\nWeathers began his college football career in 1966 at Long Beach City College, but an ankle injury suffered when tripping over a curb surrounding the running track while warming up for practice with another linebacker forced him to sit out the season. He then transferred to San Diego State University, where he became a letterman for the San Diego State Aztecs in 1968 and 1969. Under the guidance of head coach Don Coryell, Weathers helped the Aztecs win the 1969 Pasadena Bowl, finishing with an 11-0 record and a No. 18 ranking in the Final UPI Poll.

He played in one game of the 1971 NFL season before the Raiders released him in September 1971, with head coach John Madden informing Weathers, \"You're just too sensitive.\"\n\n**Acting Career**\n\nWeathers began working as an extra while still playing football, gradually transitioning to more significant roles. His first notable appearances came in two blaxploitation films directed by his longtime friend Arthur Marks: Bucktown (1975) and Friday Foster (1975).

serves at the court of King Arthur as his greatest warrior Recruited by the wizard Merlin, Percy adopts a double identity, and pretends to be very incompetent until changing into the persona of the Black Knight [6] As the Black Knight, Percy wields the Ebony Blade, which Merlin forged from a meteorite [7] A constant foe of the evil knight Mordred the Evil (Arthur's traitorous nephew), Percy is eventually killed by him during the fall of Camelot when stabbed from behind with an enchanted blade – although Mordred then dies himself of wounds inflicted by Arthur [8] Merlin ensures that Percy's spirit will live on by casting a spell that will revive his ghost if Mordred should ever return [8] Percy's spirit has appeared several times to counsel his descendant, Dane Whitman.\n\n\nSir Percy of

Mordred then dies himself of wounds inflicted by Arthur [8] Merlin ensures that Percy's spirit will live on by casting a spell that will revive his ghost if Mordred should ever return [8] Percy's spirit has appeared several times to counsel his descendant, Dane Whitman.\n\n\nNathan Garrett\nBiologist Professor Nathan Garrett is the direct descendant of Sir Percy (although it has been implied Percy's nephew Raston inherited the blade), and found Sir Percy's tomb and the Ebony Blade Garrett's evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, and Sir Percy’s ghost shuns him An embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology and has genetic engineers create a winged horse that he names Aragorn Calling himself the Black Knight, Garrett embarks on a life of crime to spite his ancestor After a battle with the hero Giant-Man [9] Garrett joins the supervillain team the Masters of Evil at the request of master villain Baron Zemo and like the others spreads Adhesive X over the city, but is first defeated by Thor After two unsuccessful battles with the Avengers, the second time of which he was broken out of jail by Enchantress, [10] he battled Iron Man due to Doctor Doom's mind-control machine (which made supervillains attack Mister Fantastic's and the Invisible Woman's wedding, which the affected villains subsequently forget due to a machine created by Mister Fantastic) [11] Garrett is mortally wounded falling from Aragorn while trying to kill Iron Man [12] A dying Garrett reveals his secret identity to his nephew, Dane Whitman, and repents for his life of crime [13] Whitman then adopts the identity of the Black Knight himself [14]\n\n\nDane Whitman\nDane Whitman is the Black Knight who has been a longtime member of the Avengers as well as a member of the Defenders, Ultraforce, Heroes for Hire, and MI: 13 Using his uncle's notes, Whitman wielded the same equipment and created his own Aragorn [15]\n\n\nAugustine du Lac\nA Vatican Black Knight named Augustine du Lac [16] received the Ebony Blade after Vatican agents retrieved it from an Iraqi vampire nest In addition, Augustine created his own Aragorn [17] He is a member of a team of supervillains that invades the African nation of Wakanda A devout Catholic, du Lac hopes to convert the populace to Catholicism Black Panther takes the Ebony Blade and defeats him [18] Augustine's Aragorn was later captured by Alyosha Kravinoff and killed for food [19]\n\n\nFemale Black Knight\nA teenage female Black Knight later appears in the Vengeance limited series as a member of the Young Masters Like Garrett, this incarnation is a villain and appears to possess the Ebony Blade How she came into possession of the sword and what happened to Augustine has yet to be revealed She was with the Young Masters when they were at an abandoned HYDRA base in Pennsylvania While inspecting Bullseye's corpse, they were attacked by Lady Bullseye [20] Later targeting Doctor Octopus for \"execution\", the Young Masters found themselves battling the Sinister Six while being assisted by the Teen Brigade, with Black Knight being assisted in taking down Sandman by Teen Brigade member Ultimate Nullifier [21] While visiting a nightclub, Black Knight encountered Ultimate Nullifier at the time when the Young Masters plotted to recruit a reborn Loki to their side [22] In the morning, Black Knight showed Ultimate Nullifier a letter that spurred the Young Masters on their quest to kill older villains along with a CIA file discussing genocide on Russian prisoners carried out by Red Skull in World War II Poland Informing Ultimate Nullifier that she was going to leave the Young Masters and had plans that did not involve evil, she left the Young Masters' base leaving behind the CIA file for Nullifier [23]\n\n\nJacks Chopra\nJackie \"Jacks\" Chopra - Dane Whitman's previously unknown daughter and an Arthurian history buff who shares the Black Knight mantle and the Ebony Blade with her father so that burden of doing so would not be handled alone [25]\n\n\nThe Black Knight lineage\nNathan Garrett and Dane Whitman are part of a lineage of Black Knights stretching back to the 6th century In New Excalibur #10, the first part of the \"Last Day of Camelot\" storyline, [26] it is revealed that Dane has turned Garrett Castle into a Black Knight museum with various exhibits on the Black Knights, including the body of Sir Percy There is a long line of paintings of the Knights including, according to the curator, \"Sir Ralston [sic] and Sir Eobar or lesser known knights like Sir William and Sir Henry.\" [27]\n\n\nEbony Blade\nThe Ebony Blade was created by comic book writer Stan Lee in Black Knight Comics #1, published under Atlas Comics in 1955 Its history was later revealed in Marvel Super-Heroes #17 (Nov 1968), written by Roy Thomas The blade was shown to have been carved from a meteor and enchanted by the wizard Merlin for Sir Percy of Scandia, the first Black Knight Due to all the blood that Sir Percy shed with the blade, it acquired a curse (see below) The sword passed down through the generations until it came to Sir Percy's descendant Dane Whitman Dane used the blade for many years It passed briefly to Valkyrie when Dane's body was turned to stone [32] and his soul sent back in time to the 13th century, but it was soon returned to him [33] [34] Due to the curse, Dane eventually gave up the Ebony Blade by driving it deep into the same meteor that it was forged from, now kept in his castle Only another deemed worthy would be able to withdraw it.\n\n\nHistory\nThe Ebony Blade was created by comic book writer Stan Lee in Black Knight Comics #1, published under Atlas Comics in 1955 Its history was later

The blade has many mystical or quasi-mystical capabilities, including the ability to:\n\n\nCurses and influences\nThe Ebony Blade was afflicted with a blood curse due to all the blood the original Black Knight had spilled Dane Whitman eventually purged the Blade of its curse at Doctor Strange's behest by plunging it into the Brazier of Truth while Strange bathed them both in magic fire The

universe. The character has a long and complex history, with multiple incarnations and storylines.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Black Knight is a legendary figure in the Marvel Comics universe, with a history dating back to the 6th century. The character has undergone many transformations and interpretations over the years, with different writers and artists bringing their own unique take on the character. Despite these changes, the Black Knight remains a fascinating and complex figure, with a rich history and a deep connection to the world of Marvel Comics.\n\n# Publication History\n\nThe original Black Knight, Sir Percy of Scandia, first appeared in the medieval-adventure series Black Knight #1–5 (cover-dated May 1955–April 1956) from Atlas Comics, the 1950s precursor to Marvel Comics. This series was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Syd Shores, and it marked the beginning of the Black Knight's long and storied history in the Marvel Universe.\n\n# Fictional Character Biographies\n\n## Sir Percy of Scandia\n\nThe original Black Knight is Sir Percy of Scandia, a 6th-century knight who serves at the court of King Arthur as his greatest warrior. Recruited by the wizard Merlin, Percy adopts a double identity, and pretends to be very incompetent until changing into the persona of the Black Knight. As the Black Knight, Percy wields the Ebony Blade, which Merlin forged from a meteorite. A constant foe of the evil knight Mordred the Evil (Arthur's traitorous nephew), Percy is eventually killed by him during the fall of Camelot when stabbed from behind with an enchanted blade – although Mordred then dies himself of wounds inflicted by Arthur. Merlin ensures that Percy's spirit will live on by casting a spell that will revive his ghost if Mordred should ever return. Percy's spirit has appeared several times to counsel his descendant, Dane Whitman.\n\n## Nathan Garrett\n\nBiologist Professor Nathan Garrett is the direct descendant of Sir Percy (although it has been implied Percy's nephew Raston inherited the blade), and found Sir Percy's tomb and the Ebony Blade. Garrett's evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, and Sir Percy’s ghost shuns him. An embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology and has genetic engineers create a winged horse that he names Aragorn. Calling himself the Black Knight, Garrett embarks on a life of crime to spite his ancestor. After a battle with the hero Giant-Man, Garrett joins the supervillain team the Masters of Evil at the request of master villain Baron Zemo and like the others spreads Adhesive X over the city, but is first defeated by Thor. After two unsuccessful battles with the Avengers, the second time of which he was broken out of jail by Enchantress, he battled Iron Man due to Doctor Doom's mind-control machine (which made supervillains attack Mister Fantastic's and the Invisible Woman's wedding, which the affected villains subsequently forget due to a machine created by Mister Fantastic). Garrett is mortally wounded falling from Aragorn while trying to kill Iron Man. A dying Garrett reveals his secret identity to his nephew, Dane Whitman, and repents for his life of crime. Whitman then adopts the identity of the Black Knight himself.\n\n## Dane Whitman\n\nDane Whitman is the Black Knight who has been a longtime member of the Avengers as well as a member of the Defenders, Ultraforce, Heroes for Hire, and MI: 13. Using his uncle's notes, Whitman wielded the same equipment and created his own Aragorn.\n\n## Augustine du Lac\n\nA Vatican Black Knight named Augustine du Lac received the Ebony Blade after Vatican agents retrieved it from an Iraqi vampire nest. In addition, Augustine created his own Aragorn. He is a member of a team of supervillains that invades the African nation of Wakanda. A devout Catholic, du Lac hopes to convert the populace to Catholicism. Black Panther takes the Ebony Blade and defeats him. Augustine's Aragorn was later captured by Alyosha Kravinoff and killed for food.\n\n## Female Black Knight\n\nA teenage female Black Knight later appears in the Vengeance limited series as a member of the Young Masters. Like Garrett, this incarnation is a villain and appears to possess the Ebony Blade. How she came into possession of the sword and what happened to Augustine has yet to be revealed. She was with the Young Masters when they were at an abandoned HYDRA base in Pennsylvania. While inspecting Bullseye's corpse, they were attacked by Lady Bullseye. Later targeting Doctor Octopus for \"execution,\" the Young Masters found themselves battling the Sinister Six while being assisted by the Teen Brigade, with Black Knight being assisted in taking down Sandman by Teen Brigade member Ultimate Nullifier. While visiting a nightclub, Black Knight encountered Ultimate Nullifier at the time when the Young Masters plotted to recruit a reborn Loki to their side. In the morning, Black Knight showed Ultimate Nullifier a letter that spurred the Young Masters on their quest to kill older villains along with a CIA file discussing genocide on Russian prisoners carried out by Red Skull in World War II Poland. Informing Ultimate Nullifier that she was going to leave the Young Masters and had plans that did not involve evil, she left the Young Masters' base leaving behind the CIA file for Nullifier.\n\n## Jacks Chopra\n\nJackie \"Jacks\" Chopra - Dane Whitman's previously unknown daughter and an Arthurian history buff who shares the Black Knight mantle and the Ebony Blade with her father so that burden of doing so would not be handled alone.\n\n# The Black Knight Lineage\n\nNathan Garrett and Dane Whitman are part of a lineage of Black Knights stretching back to the 6th century. In New Excalibur #10, the first part of the \"Last Day of Camelot\" storyline, it is revealed that Dane has turned Garrett Castle into a Black Knight museum with various exhibits on the Black Knights, including the body of Sir Percy. There is a long line of paintings of the Knights including, according to the curator, \"Sir Ralston [sic] and Sir Eobar or lesser known knights like Sir William and Sir Henry.\"\n\n# Ebony Blade\n\nThe Ebony Blade was created by comic book writer Stan Lee in Black Knight Comics #1, published under Atlas Comics in 1955. Its history was later revealed in Marvel Super-Heroes #17 (Nov 1968), written by Roy Thomas. The blade was shown to have been carved from a meteor and enchanted by the wizard Merlin for Sir Percy of Scandia, the first Black Knight. Due to all the blood that Sir Percy shed with the blade, it acquired a curse (see below). The sword passed down through the generations until it came to Sir Percy's descendant Dane Whitman. Dane used the blade for many years. It passed briefly to Valkyrie when Dane's body was turned to stone and his soul sent back in time to the 13th century, but it was soon returned to him. Due to the curse, Dane eventually gave up the Ebony Blade by driving it deep into the same meteor that it was forged from, now kept in his castle. Only another deemed worthy would be able to withdraw it.\n\n# Powers and Abilities\n\nThe Ebony Blade is a powerful enchanted weapon. It is said to be indestructible, and only the extremely powerful Iron Ogre, a magic creature, could split it in half. The blade has many mystical or quasi-mystical capabilities, including the ability to:\n\n* Cause significant damage to magical and supernatural entities\n* Absorb and redirect magical energy\n* Enhance the user's physical abilities\n* Grant the user resistance to various forms of energy\n\n# Curses and Influences\n\nThe Ebony Blade was afflicted with a blood curse due to all the blood the original Black Knight had spilled. Dane Whitman eventually purged the Blade of its curse at Doctor Strange's behest by plunging it into the Brazier of Truth while Strange bathed them both in magic fire. The curse returned, however, when the Sub-Mariner used it to kill his wife Marrina. The curse seems to affect different people in different ways. It turned Dane into a statue, it amplified Proctor's gann'josin-based powers, and it granted Sean Dolan great physical powers as Bloodwraith.\n\n# Fake Ebony Blade\n\nOn occasion, the Ebony Blade appears in two separate comic series simultaneously, most notably in 2006 when it was in use by Dane Whitman (Black Knight) in the New Excalibur series whilst it was in use in a Black Panther ongoing

Brosnan\n================\n\nPierce Brosnan is a renowned Irish actor, best known for his portrayal of the iconic character James Bond in the 1990s. Born on May 16, 1953, in Drogheda, County Louth, Brosnan has established himself as a versatile and accomplished actor, with a career spanning over four decades.\n\nEarly Life\n------------\n\nBrosnan was born to May (née Smith) and Thomas Brosnan, a carpenter. He has the same name as his grandfather, Pierce Brosnan, whose first name was in honor of his mother Margaret Pierce. For 12 years, Brosnan lived in Navan, County Meath, and considers it to be his hometown. However, his early life was marked by turmoil, as his father abandoned the family when Brosnan was an infant. His mother moved to London to work as a nurse, leaving Brosnan to be largely raised by his maternal grandparents, Philip and Kathleen Smith. After their deaths, he lived with an aunt and then an uncle, before being sent to live in a boarding house run by a woman named Eileen. Brosnan later stated that his childhood was \"fairly solitary\" and that he \"never knew his father.\" The experience had a profound impact on his life, leading him to become a strong advocate for children's welfare and a supporter of organizations such as UNICEF.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nBrosnan's interest in acting began at a young age, and he attended the Drama Centre in London. After graduating in 1975, he began working as an acting assistant stage manager at the York Theatre Royal. His acting debut came in the same year, with a role in the play \"Wait Until Dark.\" Within six months, he was selected by the playwright Tennessee Williams to play the role of McCabe in the British première of \"The Red Devil Battery Sign.\" Brosnan's performance in the play caused a stir in London, and he still has the telegram sent by Williams, stating \"Thank God for you, my dear boy.\" In 1977, he was picked by Franco Zeffirelli to appear in the play \"Filumena\" by Eduardo De Filippo, opposite Joan Plowright and Frank Finlay.\n\nJames Bond\n------------\n\nBrosnan's first encounter with James Bond film producer Albert R. Broccoli was on the sets of \"For Your Eyes Only,\" where his wife, Cassandra Harris, had been cast as Countess Lisl von Schlaf. Broccoli was impressed by Brosnan's performance and saw him as the perfect candidate to inherit the role of Bond from Roger Moore. However, it was not until 1994 that Brosnan was officially announced as the fifth actor to play Bond. After a successful tenure as Bond, Brosnan went on to appear in a range of films, including \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" \"The Tailor of Panama,\" and \"The Matador.\"\n\nEarly Career\n--------------\n\nAfter completing his studies at the Drama Centre, Brosnan began working as an acting assistant stage manager at the York Theatre Royal. His early career was marked by small roles in various stage productions and television films. However, it was his marriage to Cassandra Harris that brought him to the attention of the film industry. Harris's performance in \"For Your Eyes Only\" led to Brosnan being cast in the title role of the TV series \"Remington Steele,\" which eased their financial worries.\n\nJames Bond: The Pre-Production Years\n------------------------------------\n\nBrosnan's involvement with the James Bond franchise began in the late 1980s, when he was considered for the role of Simon Templar in the film \"The Saint.\" However, the project ultimately fell through, and Brosnan was not cast. It was not until 1994 that he was officially announced as the next Bond. The production of \"GoldenEye\" was a complex and challenging process, with the film's script undergoing significant changes during pre-production. Despite these challenges, the film went on to become a critical and commercial success, paving the way for Brosnan's successful tenure as Bond.\n\nJames Bond: The On-Set Years\n-----------------------------\n\nThe production of \"GoldenEye\" was a defining moment in Brosnan's career, marking the beginning of his tenure as Bond.

of Queens to a family of Italian origin His grandfather Donato came to the US in 1896 [6] Mario Cuomo's father, Andrea Cuomo, was born in New York City in 1901 but in 1904, aged two or three, was taken back to a mountain village outside Salerno, Campania, returning to the USA on his US passport more than two decades later [6] Andrea Cuomo was from Nocera Superiore, Campania, and his mother—Immacolata Giordano—was from Tramonti, Campania [7] The family ran Kessler's Grocery Store in South Jamaica, Queens [8]  Cuomo attended New York City P.S 50 and St John's Preparatory School.\n\n\nEarly political career\nCuomo first became widely known in New York City in the late 1960s when he represented \"The Corona Fighting 69\", a group of 69 home-owners from the Queens neighborhood of Corona, who were threatened with displacement by the city's plan to build a new high school [19] He later represented another Queens residents group, the Kew Gardens–Forest Hills Committee on Urban Scale, who opposed Samuel J LeFrak's housing proposal adjacent to Willow Lake in Queens In 1972, Cuomo became known beyond New York City when Mayor John Lindsay appointed him to conduct an inquiry and mediate a dispute over low-income public housing slated for the upper-middle-class neighborhood of Forest Hills [4] Cuomo described his experience in that dispute in the book Forest Hills Diary, and the story was retold by sociologist Richard Sennett in The Fall of Public Man.\n\n\nNew York Secretary of State\nIn 1974, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York on a ticket headed by gubernatorial candidate Howard J Samuels, and both won the nomination of the Democratic State Committee at the party convention But their entire ticket, including the nominees for attorney general and U.S Senator was defeated in the Democratic primary election: Samuels by Rep Hugh Carey of Brooklyn, and Cuomo by State Senator Mary Anne Krupsak.\n\n\nNew York City mayoral election\nTwo years later, Cuomo ran for Mayor of New York City at Carey's urging [4] Incumbent Mayor Abraham Beame was very unpopular and Cuomo was one of five major challengers to Beame in the Democratic primary In a close and highly fractured election, U.S Representative Ed Koch finished first with 19.81% of the vote and Cuomo came second with 18.74% As no candidate cleared 40% of the vote, Koch and Cuomo advanced to a runoff Koch emerged victorious with 54.94% of the vote to Cuomo's 45.06% Cuomo had received the nomination of the Liberal Party several months previously and was urged to drop out of the race but he contested the general election against Koch and token Republican opposition [4] [21]\n\n\nNew York lieutenant governor\nIn 1978, incumbent Lieutenant Governor Krupsak declined to seek re-election She withdrew from the ticket and unsuccessfully challenged Carey in the gubernatorial primary, accusing him of incompetence [4] Cuomo won the primary for lieutenant governor and was elected alongside Carey in the general election.\n\n\nGovernor of New York\nIn 1982, Carey declined to run for re-election and Cuomo declared his candidacy He once again faced Ed Koch in the Democratic primary This time, Koch's support for the death penalty backfired and he alienated many voters from outside New York City when, in an interview with Playboy magazine, he described the lifestyle of both suburbia and upstate New York as \"sterile\" and lamented the thought of having to live in \"the small town\" of Albany as governor, saying it was \"a city without a good Chinese restaurant\" [4] Cuomo won the primary by ten points and faced Republican nominee businessman Lewis Lehrman in the general election With the recession aiding Democratic candidates, Cuomo beat Lehrman 50.91% to 47.48%.\n\n\nElections\nIn 1982, Carey declined to run for re-election and Cuomo declared his candidacy He once again faced Ed Koch in the Democratic primary This time, Koch's support for the death penalty backfired and he alienated many voters from outside New York City when, in an interview with Playboy magazine, he described the lifestyle of both suburbia and upstate New York as

and faced Republican nominee businessman Lewis Lehrman in the general election With the recession aiding Democratic candidates, Cuomo beat Lehrman 50.91% to 47.48%.\n\n\nAccomplishments\nIn Cuomo's first term as Governor of New York State, he produced a balanced budget and earned the highest credit rating over the long term for the State in one decade [12] His philosophy in leading the State was one of \"progressive pragmatism\" [12] Cuomo and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives (Democrats had over a 3:2 margin in House) was successful in stopping U.S President Ronald Reagan's administration from eliminating \"federal income tax deductibility of state, local and property taxes\" [12]\n\n\nPlanned assassination\nMaurizio Avola, a former Sicilian Mafioso believed to have

had planned to assassinate Governor Cuomo on a visit to Italy in November 1992 The plan was for about a dozen gunmen armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and explosives to ambush Cuomo Avola's godfather, Aldo Ercolano, considered that Cuomo would be an \"excellent target\" Avola stated, \"The aim was to target politicians or members of institutions in order to send out a clear message.. Killing a prominent American was a warning to law enforcement agencies that had allowed several prominent mafia informants to live in the US under assumed identities.\" This was several months after the mafia had already assassinated antimafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino The attack was to be carried out in the main square of Messina, Sicily during the day However, after Cuomo arrived in Rome on November 19 with security consisting of many bodyguards and a bulletproof car, the attack was called off [39]\n\n\nPolitical views\nCuomo was notable for his liberal political views, particularly his steadfast opposition to the death penalty, [41] an opinion that was unpopular in New York during the high-crime era of the 1980s and early 1990s [41] While governor, he vetoed several bills that would have re-established capital punishment in New York State [41] The death penalty was reinstated by Pataki the year after he defeated Cuomo in the 1994 election, although it was never put into effect and the statute was declared unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals in 2004 [42]\n\n\nPost-governorship\nFrom 1995 until his death, Cuomo worked as counsel at the New York law firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher [35] In 1996, Cuomo joined the board of Medallion Financial Corp., a lender to purchasers of taxi medallions in leading cities across the U.S He was named to the board through his personal and business relationship with Andrew M Murstein, president of Medallion [47] [48] [49] Cuomo also sat on the advisory council of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission.\n\n\nLegal work and board memberships\nFrom 1995 until his death, Cuomo worked as counsel at the New York law firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher [35] In 1996, Cuomo joined the board of Medallion Financial Corp., a lender to purchasers of taxi medallions in leading cities across the U.S He was named to the board through his personal and business relationship with Andrew M Murstein, president of Medallion [47] [48] [49] Cuomo also sat on the advisory council of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission.\n\n\nAuthorship\nCuomo's first book, Forest Hills Diary: The Crisis of Low-income Housing, became an influential text in the fields of political science and housing policy, and it helped make his name with the public outside New York.\n\n\nSelected works\nAt its 1983 commencement ceremonies, Barnard College awarded Cuomo its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction Also in 1983, Yeshiva University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.\n\n\nHonors and awards\nAt its 1983 commencement ceremonies, Barnard College awarded Cuomo its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction Also in 1983, Yeshiva University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.\n\n\nFamily and personal life\nCuomo was married for 60 years to Matilda (née Raffa), from 1954 until his death in 2015 She is a graduate of St John's University's Teachers College [51] They had five children, Margaret, Andrew, Maria, Madeline, and Christopher In 2017, Matilda was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame [52]\n\n\nIllness and death\nOn November 30, 2014, it was announced that Cuomo had been hospitalized for a heart condition; he was described as being \"in good spirits\" [62]\n\n\nReactions\nVarious elected officials praised Cuomo following his death President Barack Obama stated: \"An Italian Catholic kid from Queens, born to immigrant parents, Mario paired his faith in God and faith in America to live a life of public service – and we are all better for it  He rose to be chief executive of the state he loved, a determined champion of progressive values, and an unflinching voice for tolerance, inclusiveness, fairness, dignity, and opportunity  His own story taught him that as Americans, we are bound together as one people, and our country's success rests on the success of all of us, not just a fortunate few.\" [66]\n\n\nLegacy\nCuomo and Ed Koch are remembered as two New York politicians who dominated during the late 1970s and 1980s, as well for his public speaking ability [69] [70]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Davison had a history of posting online content that reflected his interests in firearms and his views on inceldom.\n\n**Lifestyle and Incel-Related Views**\n\nDavison uploaded videos to YouTube under the name \"Professor Waffle\". His videos included references to \"inceldom\", the black pill worldview, and general nihilism.

{"title": "Great_Pyramid_of_Giza", "content": "\nPurpose\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza was the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, [11] and still contains his granite sarcophagus [12] It had, like other tombs of Egyptian elites, four main purposes: [13]\n\n\nAttribution to Khufu\nHistorically the Great Pyramid had been attributed to Khufu based on the words of authors of classical antiquity, first and foremost Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus During the Middle Ages other people were credited with the construction of the pyramid as well, for example Joseph from the Book of Genesis, Nimrod, or the legendary king Saurid ibn Salhouk [27]\n\n\nAge\nThe Great Pyramid has been determined to be about 4,600 years old by two principal approaches: indirectly, through its attribution to Khufu and his chronological age, based on archaeological and textual evidence; and directly, via radiocarbon dating of organic material found in the pyramid and included in its mortar.\n\n\nHistorical chronology\nIn the past the Great Pyramid was dated by its attribution to Khufu alone, putting the construction of the Great Pyramid within his reign, hence dating the pyramid was a matter of dating Khufu and the 4th dynasty The relative sequence and synchronicity of events is the focal point of this method.\n\n\nRadiocarbon dating\nMortar was used generously in the Great Pyramid's construction In the mixing process ashes from fires were added to the mortar, organic material that could be extracted and radiocarbon dated A total of 46 samples of the mortar were taken in 1984 and 1995, making sure they were clearly inherent to the original structure and could not have been incorporated at a later date The results were calibrated to 2871–2604 BC The old wood problem is thought to be mainly responsible for the 100–300 year offset, since the age of the organic material was determined, not when it was last used A reanalysis of the data gave a completion date for the pyramid between 2620 and 2484 BC, based on the younger samples [56] [57] [58]\n\n\nHistory of dating Khufu and the Great Pyramid\nCirca 450 BC Herodotus attributed the Great Pyramid to Cheops (Hellenization of Khufu), yet erroneously placed his reign following the Ramesside period Manetho, around 200 years later, composed an extensive list of Egyptian kings, which he divided into dynasties, assigning Khufu to the 4th However, after phonetic changes in the Egyptian language and consequently the Greek translation, \"Cheops\" had transformed into \"Souphis\" (and similar versions) [60]\n\n\nHistoriographical record\nThe ancient Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, is one of the first major authors to mention the pyramid In the second book of his work The Histories, he discusses the history of Egypt and the Great Pyramid This report was created more than 2000 years after the structure was built, meaning that Herodotus obtained his knowledge mainly from a variety of indirect sources, including officials and priests of low rank, local Egyptians, Greek immigrants, and Herodotus's own interpreters Accordingly, his explanations present themselves as a mixture of comprehensible descriptions, personal descriptions, erroneous reports, and fantastical legends; as a result, many of the speculative errors and confusions about the monument can be traced back to Herodotus and his work [62] [63]\n\n\nClassical antiquity\nThe ancient Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, is one of the first major authors to mention the pyramid In the second book of his work The Histories, he discusses the history of Egypt and the Great Pyramid This report was created more than 2000 years after the structure was built, meaning that Herodotus obtained his knowledge mainly from a variety of indirect sources, including officials and priests of low rank, local Egyptians, Greek immigrants, and Herodotus's own interpreters Accordingly, his explanations present themselves as a mixture of comprehensible descriptions, personal descriptions, erroneous reports, and fantastical legends; as a result, many of the speculative errors and confusions about the monument can be traced back to Herodotus and his work [62] [63]\n\n\nHerodotus\nThe ancient Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, is one of the first major authors to mention the pyramid In the second book of his work The Histories, he discusses the history of Egypt and the Great Pyramid This report was created more than 2000 years after the structure was built, meaning that Herodotus obtained his knowledge mainly from a variety of indirect sources, including officials and priests of low rank, local Egyptians, Greek immigrants, and Herodotus's own interpreters Accordingly, his explanations present themselves as a mixture of comprehensible descriptions, personal descriptions, erroneous reports, and fantastical legends; as a result, many of the speculative errors and confusions about the monument can be traced back to Herodotus and his work [62] [63]\n\n\nDiodorus Siculus\nBetween 60 and 56 BC, the ancient Greek historian Diodorus Siculus visited Egypt and later dedicated the first book of his Bibliotheca historica to the land, its history, and its monuments, including the Great Pyramid Diodorus's work was inspired by historians of the past, but he also distanced himself from Herodotus, who Diodorus claims tells marvellous tales and myths [71] Diodorus presumably drew his knowledge from the lost work of Hecataeus of Abdera, [72] and like Herodotus, he also places the builder of the pyramid, \"Chemmis\", [73] after Ramses III [64] According to his report, neither Chemmis (Khufu) nor Cephren (Khafre) were buried in their pyramids, but rather in secret places, for fear that the people ostensibly forced to build the structures would seek out the bodies for revenge [74] With this assertion, Diodorus strengthened the connection between pyramid building and slavery [75]\n\n\nStrabo\nThe Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian Strabo visited Egypt around 25 BC, shortly after Egypt was annexed by the Romans In his work Geographica, he argues that the pyramids were the burial place of kings, but he does not mention which king was buried in the structure Strabo also mentions: \"At a moderate height in one of the sides is a stone, which may be taken out; when that is removed, there is an oblique passage to the tomb.\" [76] This statement has generated much speculation, as it suggests that the pyramid could be entered at this time [77]\n\n\nPliny the Elder\nThe Roman writer Pliny the Elder, writing in the first century AD, argued that the Great Pyramid had been raised, either \"to prevent the lower classes from remaining unoccupied\", or as a measure to prevent the pharaoh's riches from falling into the hands of his rivals or successors [78] Pliny does not speculate as to the pharaoh in question, explicitly noting that \"accident  [has] consigned to oblivion the names of those who erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity\" [78]\n\n\nLate antiquity and the Middle Ages\nDuring late antiquity, a misinterpretation of the pyramids as \"Joseph's granary\" began to gain in popularity The first textual evidence of this connection is found in the travel narratives of the female Christian pilgrim Egeria, who records that on her visit between 381 and 384 AD, \"in the twelve-mile stretch between Memphis and Babylonia  [= Old Cairo] are many pyramids, which Joseph made in order to store corn.\" [79] Ten years later the usage is confirmed in the anonymous travelogue of seven monks who set out from Jerusalem to visit the famous ascetics in Egypt, wherein they report that they \"saw Joseph's granaries, where he stored grain in biblical times\" [80]\n\n\nConstruction\nA hillock forms the base on which the pyramid stands It was cut back into steps and only a strip around the perimeter was leveled, [97] which has been measured to be horizontal and flat to within 21 millimetres (0.8 in) [98] The bedrock reaches a height of almost 6 metres (20 ft) above the pyramid base at the location of the Grotto [99]\n\n\nPreparation of the site\nA hillock forms the base on which the pyramid stands It was cut back into steps and only a strip around the perimeter was leveled, [97] which has been measured to be horizontal and flat to within 21 millimetres (0.8 in) [98] The bedrock reaches a height of almost 6 metres (20 ft) above the pyramid base at the location of the Grotto [99]\n\n\nMaterials\nThe Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks Approximately 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite, and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction [101]\n\n\nWorkforce\nThe ancient Greeks believed that slave labour was used, but modern discoveries made at nearby workers' camps associated with construction at Giza suggest that it was built by thousands of conscript labourers [109]\n\n\nSurveys and design\nThe first precise measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist Flinders Petrie in 1880–1882, published as The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh [113] Many of the casing-stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with high precision, with joints, on average, only 0.5 millimetres (0.020 in) wide [114] In contrast, core blocks were only roughly shaped, with rubble inserted between larger gaps Mortar was used to bind the outer layers together and fill gaps and joints [7]\n\n\nAlignment to the cardinal directions\nThe sides of the Great Pyramid's base are closely aligned to the four geographic (not magnetic) cardinal directions, deviating on average 3 minutes and 38 seconds of arc, or about a tenth of a degree [121] Several methods have been proposed for how the ancient Egyptians achieved this level of accuracy:\n\n\nConstruction theories\nMany alternative, often contradictory, theories have been proposed regarding the pyramid's construction techniques [125] One mystery of the pyramid's construction is its planning John Romer suggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and later constructions, laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1-to-1 scale He writes that \"such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means\" [126]\n\n\nCasing\nAt completion, the Great Pyramid was cased entirely in white limestone Precisely worked blocks were placed in horizontal layers and carefully fitted together with mortar, their outward faces cut at a slope and smoothed to a high degree Together they created four uniform surfaces, angled at 51°50'40\" (a seked of ⁠5+1/2⁠ palms) [129] [130] Unfinished casing blocks of the pyramids of Menkaure and Henutsen at Giza suggest that the front faces were smoothed only after the stones were laid, with chiselled seams marking correct positioning and where the superfluous rock would have to be trimmed off [131]\n\n\nPyramidion and missing tip\nThe pyramid was once topped by a capstone known as a pyramidion The material from which it was made is subject to much speculation; limestone, granite or basalt are commonly proposed, while in popular culture it is often solid gold, gilded or electrum All known 4th dynasty pyramidia (of the Red Pyramid, Satellite Pyramid of Khufu (G1-d) and Queen's Pyramid of Menkaure (G3-a)) are of white limestone and were not gilded [145] Only from the 5th dynasty onward is there evidence of gilded capstones; for instance, a scene on the causeway of Sahure speaks of the \"white gold pyramidion of the pyramid Sahure's Soul Shines\" [146]\n\n\nInterior\nThe internal structure consists of three main chambers (the King's, Queen's and Subterranean Chambers), the Grand Gallery and various corridors and shafts None of the interior walls were decorated or inscribed, as was the norm for tombs of the 4th dynasty, apart from the marks and names of work-gangs left on blocks of the relieving chambers [19]\n\n\nEntrances\n\nThe original entrance is on the north side, 15 royal cubits (7.9 m; 25.8 ft) east of the centreline of the pyramid Before the removal of the casing in the Middle Ages, the pyramid was entered through a hole in the 19th layer of masonry, approximately 17 metres (56 ft) above the pyramid's base level The height of that layer – 96 centimetres (3.15 ft) – corresponds to the size of the entrance tunnel that is commonly called the Descending Passage [99] [150] According to Strabo (64–24 BC) a movable stone could be raised to enter this sloping corridor; however, it is not known if it was a later addition or original.\n\nOriginal entrance\n\nThe original entrance is on the north side, 15 royal cubits (7.9 m; 25.8 ft) east of the centreline of the pyramid Before the removal of the casing in the Middle Ages, the pyramid was entered through a hole in the 19th layer of masonry, approximately 17 metres (56 ft) above the pyramid's base level The height of that layer – 96 centimetres (3.15 ft) – corresponds to the size of the entrance tunnel that is commonly called the Descending Passage [99] [150] According to Strabo (64–24 BC) a movable stone could be raised to enter this sloping corridor; however, it is not known if it was a later addition or original.\n\nNorth Face Corridor\nIn 2016 the ScanPyramids team detected a cavity behind the entrance chevrons using muography, which was confirmed in 2019 to be a corridor at least 5 metres (16 ft) long, and running horizontal or sloping upwards (thus not parallel to the Descending Passage) [152] [153]\n\n\nRobbers' Tunnel\nToday tourists enter the Great Pyramid via the Robbers' Tunnel, which was long ago cut straight through the masonry of the pyramid The entrance was forced into the 6th and 7th layer of the casing, about 7 metres (23 ft) above the base After running more or less straight and horizontal for 27 metres (89 ft) it turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point but access is usually forbidden [156]\n\n\nDescending Passage\nFrom the original entrance, a passage descends through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it, ultimately leading to the Subterranean Chamber.\n\n\nSubterranean Chamber\nThe Subterranean Chamber, or \"Pit\", is the lowest of the three main chambers and the only one dug into the bedrock beneath the pyramid.\n\n\nAscending Passage\nThe Ascending Passage connects the Descending Passage to the Grand Gallery It is 75 cubits (39.3 m; 128.9 ft) long and of the same width and height as the shaft from which it originates, although its angle is slightly lower at 26°6' [170]\n\n\nWell Shaft and Grotto\nThe Well Shaft (also known as the Service Shaft or Vertical Shaft) links the lower end of the Grand Gallery to the bottom of the Descending Passage, about 50 metres (160 ft) further down.\n\n\nQueen's Chamber\nThe Horizontal Passage links the Grand Gallery to the Queen's Chamber Five pairs of holes at the start suggest the tunnel was once concealed with slabs that lay flush with the gallery floor The passage is 2 cubits (1.0 m; 3.4 ft) wide and 1.17 m (3.8 ft) high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in the floor, after which the passage increases to 1.68 m (5.5 ft) high [99] Half of the west wall consists of two layers that have atypically continuous vertical joints Dormion suggests the entrances to magazines laid here and have been filled in [173]\n\n\nGrand Gallery\nThe Grand Gallery continues the slope of the Ascending Passage towards the King's Chamber, extending from the 23rd to the 48th course (of stones), a rise of 21 metres (69 ft) It has been praised as a \"truly spectacular example of stonemasonry\" [183] It is 8.6 metres (28 ft) high and 46.68 metres (153.1 ft) long Its walls are made out of polished limestone [184] The base is 4 cubits (2.1 m; 6.9 ft) wide, but after two courses – at a height of 2.29 metres (7.5 ft) – the blocks of stone in the walls are corbelled inwards by 6–10 centimetres (2.4–3.9 in) on each side [99]\n\n\nThe Big Void\nIn 2017, scientists from the ScanPyramids project discovered a large cavity above the Grand Gallery using muon radiography, which they called the \"ScanPyramids Big Void\" A research team, under the supervision of Professor Morishima Kunihiro at Nagoya University, used special nuclear emulsion detectors [189] [190] Its length is at least 30 metres (98 ft) and its cross-section is similar to that of the Grand Gallery Its existence was confirmed by independent detection with three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors [191] [192] The purpose of the cavity is unknown and it is not accessible Zahi Hawass speculates it may have been a gap used in the construction of the Grand Gallery, [193] but the Japanese research team state that the void is completely different from previously identified construction spaces [194]\n\n\nAntechamber\nThe last line of defence against intrusion was a small chamber designed to house portcullis blocking stones, called the Antechamber It is cased almost entirely in granite and is situated between the upper end of the Grand Gallery and the King's Chamber Three slots for portcullis stones line the east and west wall of the chamber Each of them is topped with a semi-circular groove for a log, around which ropes could be spanned.\n\n\nKing's Chamber\nThe King's Chamber is the upmost of the three main chambers of the pyramid It is faced entirely with granite and measures 20 cubits (10.5 m; 34.4 ft) east-west by 10 cubits (5.2 m; 17.2 ft) north-south Its flat ceiling is about 11 cubits and 5 digits (5.8 m;19.0 ft) above the floor, formed by nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons All the roof beams show cracks due to the chamber having settled 2.5–5 cm (0.98–1.97 in) [197]\n\n\nSarcophagus\nThe only surviving object in the King's Chamber is a sarcophagus made of a single, hollowed-out granite block When it was rediscovered in the Early Middle Ages, it was found broken open and any contents had already been removed It is of the form common for early Egyptian sarcophagi, rectangular in shape with grooves to slide the now missing lid into place with three small holes for pegs to fix it [199] [200] The coffer was not perfectly smoothed, displaying tool marks matching those of copper saws and tubular hand-drills [201]\n\n\nAir shafts\nIn the north and south walls of the King's Chamber are two narrow shafts, commonly known as \"air shafts\" They face each other and are located approximately 0.91 m (3.0 ft) above the floor, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) from the eastern wall, with a width of 18 and 21 cm (7.1 and 8.3 in) and a height of 14 cm (5.5 in) Both start out horizontally for the length of the granite blocks they go through before changing to an upwards direction [203]\n\n\nRelieving chambers\nAbove the roof of the King's Chamber are five compartments, named (from lowest upwards) \"Davison's Chamber\", \"Wellington's Chamber\", \"Nelson's Chamber\", \"Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber\", and \"Campbell's Chamber\".\n\n\nPyramid complex\nThe Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings, including small pyramids.\n\n\nTemples and causeway\nThe Pyramid Temple, which stood on the east side of the pyramid and measured 52.2 metres (171 ft) north to south and 40 metres (130 ft) east to west, has almost entirely disappeared Only some of the black basalt paving remains There are only a few remnants of the causeway that linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple The Valley Temple is buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated [210] [211]\n\n\nEast cemetery\nThe tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, sister-wife of Sneferu and mother of Khufu, lies 110 metres (360 ft) east of the Great Pyramid [212] Discovered by accident by the Reisner expedition, the burial was intact, but the carefully sealed coffin proved to be empty.\n\n\nSubsidiary pyramids\nOn the southern end of the east side are four subsidiary pyramids The three that remain standing to almost full height are popularly known as the Queens' Pyramids (G1-a, G1-b and G1-c) The fourth, smaller satellite pyramid (G1-d), is so ruined that its existence was not suspected until the first course of stones and, later, the remains of the capstone were discovered during excavations in 1991–1993 [213]\n\n\nBoats\nThree boat-shaped pits are located east of the pyramid They are large enough in size and shape to have held complete boats, though so shallow that any superstructure, if there ever was one, must have been removed or disassembled.\n\n\nPyramid town\nFlanking the Giza pyramid complex is a cyclopean stone wall, the Wall of the Crow [217] Mark Lehner discovered a worker's town outside the wall, otherwise known as \"The Lost City\", dated by pottery styles, seal impressions and stratigraphy to have been constructed and occupied during the reigns of Khafre (2520–2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490–2472 BC) [218] [219] In the early 21st century, Lehner and his team made several discoveries, including what appears to have been a thriving port, suggesting the town and associated living quarters, which consisted of barracks called \"galleries\", may not have been for the pyramid workers after all, but rather for the soldiers and sailors who used the port In light of this new discovery, as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived, Lehner suggested the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he believes were used to construct the pyramids, or possibly at nearby quarries [220]\n\n\nLooting\nAuthors Bob Brier and Hoyt Hobbs claim that \"all the pyramids were robbed\" by the New Kingdom, when the construction of royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings began [224] [225] Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself \"is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom\", before the Arab caliph Al-Ma'mun entered the pyramid around 820 AD [157]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Great Pyramid of Giza**\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza is an ancient pyramid complex located on the outskirts of modern-day Cairo, Egypt. It is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and a testament to the ingenuity and skill of the ancient Egyptians. The pyramid was built as a tomb for the pharaoh Khufu, who reigned from around 2589 to 2566 BC.\n\n**Purpose**\n\nThe Great Pyramid had, like other tombs of Egyptian elites, four main purposes:\n\n1. To provide a means for the pharaoh's Ka (life force) to ascend to the afterlife\n2. To serve as a symbol of the pharaoh's power and wealth\n3. To provide a means for the pharaoh's body to be preserved and protected\n4. To serve as a gateway to the afterlife for the pharaoh and his family\n\n**Attribution to Khufu**\n\nHistorically, the Great Pyramid had been attributed to Khufu based on the words of authors of classical antiquity, first and foremost Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus. During the Middle Ages, other people were credited with the construction of the pyramid as well, for example Joseph from the Book of Genesis, Nimrod, or the legendary king Saurid ibn Salhouk.\n\n**Age**\n\nThe Great Pyramid has been determined to be about 4,600 years old by two principal approaches: indirectly, through its attribution to Khufu and his chronological age, based on archaeological and textual evidence; and directly, via radiocarbon dating of organic material found in the pyramid and included in its mortar.\n\n**Historical Chronology**\n\nIn the past, the Great Pyramid was dated by its attribution to Khufu alone, putting the construction of the Great Pyramid within his reign, hence dating the pyramid was a matter of dating Khufu and the 4th dynasty. The relative sequence and synchronicity of events is the focal point of this method.\n\n**Radiocarbon Dating**\n\nMortar was used generously in the Great Pyramid's construction. In the mixing process, ashes from fires were added to the mortar, organic material that could be extracted and radiocarbon dated. A total of 46 samples of the mortar were taken in 1984 and 1995, making sure they were clearly inherent to the original structure and could not have been incorporated at a later date. The results were calibrated to 2871–2604 BC. The old wood problem is thought to be mainly responsible for the 100–300 year offset, since the age of the organic material was determined, not when it was last used. A reanalysis of the data gave a completion date for the pyramid between 2620 and 2484 BC, based on the younger samples.\n\n**History of Dating Khufu and the Great Pyramid**\n\nCirca 450 BC, Herodotus attributed the Great Pyramid to Cheops (Hellenization of Khufu), yet erroneously placed his reign following the Ramesside period. Manetho, around 200 years later, composed an extensive list of Egyptian kings, which he divided into dynasties, assigning Khufu to the 4th dynasty. However, after phonetic changes in the Egyptian language and consequently the Greek translation, \"Cheops\" had transformed into \"Souphis\" (and similar versions).\n\n**Herodotus**\n\nThe ancient Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, is one of the first major authors to mention the pyramid. In the second book of his work The Histories, he discusses the history of Egypt and the Great Pyramid. This report was created more than 2000 years after the structure was built, meaning that Herodotus obtained his knowledge mainly from a variety of indirect sources, including officials and priests of low rank, local Egyptians, Greek immigrants, and Herodotus's own interpreters. Accordingly, his explanations present themselves as a mixture of comprehensible descriptions, personal descriptions, erroneous reports, and fantastical legends; as a result, many of the speculative errors and confusions about the monument can be traced back to Herodotus and his work.\n\n**Diodorus Siculus**\n\nBetween 60 and 56 BC, the ancient Greek historian Diodorus Siculus visited Egypt and later dedicated the first book of his Bibliotheca historica to the land, its history, and its monuments, including the Great Pyramid. Diodorus's work was inspired by historians of the past, but he also distanced himself from Herodotus, who Diodorus claims tells marvellous tales and myths. Diodorus presumably drew his knowledge from the lost work of Hecataeus of Abdera, and like Herodotus, he also places the builder of the pyramid, \"Chemmis\", after Ramses III. According to his report, neither Chemmis (Khufu) nor Cephren (Khafre) were buried in their pyramids, but rather in secret places, for fear that the people ostensibly forced to build the structures would seek out the bodies for revenge. With this assertion, Diodorus strengthened the connection between pyramid building and slavery.\n\n**Strabo**\n\nThe Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian Strabo visited Egypt around 25 BC, shortly after Egypt was annexed by the Romans. In his work Geographica, he argues that the pyramids were the burial place of kings, but he does not mention which king was buried in the structure. Strabo also mentions: \"At a moderate height in one of the sides is a stone, which may be taken out; when that is removed, there is an oblique passage to the tomb.\" This statement has generated much speculation, as it suggests that the pyramid could be entered at this time.\n\n**Pliny the Elder**\n\nThe Roman writer Pliny the Elder, writing in the first century AD, argued that the Great Pyramid had been raised, either \"to prevent the lower classes from remaining unoccupied\", or as a measure to prevent the pharaoh's riches from falling into the hands of his rivals or successors. Pliny does not speculate as to the pharaoh in question, explicitly noting that \"accident has consigned to oblivion the names of those who erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity.\"\n\n**Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages**\n\nDuring late antiquity, a misinterpretation of the pyramids as \"Joseph's granary\" began to gain in popularity. The first textual evidence of this connection is found in the travel narratives of the female Christian pilgrim Egeria, who records that on her visit between 381 and 384 AD, \"in the twelve-mile stretch between Memphis and Babylonia [= Old Cairo] are many pyramids, which Joseph made in order to store corn.\" Ten years later the usage is confirmed in the anonymous travelogue of seven monks who set out from Jerusalem to visit the famous ascetics in Egypt, wherein they report that they \"saw Joseph's granaries, where he stored grain in biblical times.\"\n\n**Construction**\n\nA hillock forms the base on which the pyramid stands. It was cut back into steps and only a strip around the perimeter was leveled, which has been measured to be horizontal and flat to within 21 millimeters (0.8 in). The bedrock reaches a height of almost 6 meters (20 ft) above the pyramid base at the location of the Grotto.\n\n**Materials**\n\nThe Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks. Approximately 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite, and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction.\n\n**Workforce**\n\nThe ancient Greeks believed that slave labour was used, but modern discoveries made at nearby workers' camps associated with construction at Giza suggest that it was built by thousands of conscript labourers.\n\n**Surveys and Design**\n\nThe first precise measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist Flinders Petrie in 1880–1882, published as The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh. Many of the casing-stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with high precision, with joints, on average, only 0.5 millimeters (0.020 in) wide. In contrast, core blocks were only roughly shaped, with rubble inserted between larger gaps. Mortar was used to bind the outer layers together and fill gaps and joints.\n\n**Alignment to the Cardinal Directions**\n\nThe sides of the Great Pyramid's base are closely aligned to the four geographic (not magnetic) cardinal directions, deviating on average 3 minutes and 38 seconds of arc, or about a tenth of a degree. Several methods have been proposed for how the ancient Egyptians achieved this level of accuracy.\n\n**The Pyramidion and Missing Tip**\n\nThe pyramid was once topped by a capstone known as a pyramidion. The material from which it was made is subject to much speculation; limestone, granite or basalt are commonly proposed, while in popular culture it is often solid gold, gilded or electrum. All known 4th dynasty pyramidia (of the Red Pyramid, Satellite Pyramid of Khufu (G1-d) and Queen's Pyramid of Menkaure (G3-a)) are of white limestone and were not gilded. Only from the 5th dynasty onward is there evidence of gilded capstones; for instance, a scene on the causeway of Sahure speaks of the \"white gold pyramidion of the pyramid Sahure's Soul Shines.\"\n\n**Interior**\n\nThe internal structure consists of three main chambers (the King's, Queen's and Subterranean Chambers), the Grand Gallery and various corridors and shafts. None of the interior walls were decorated or inscribed, as was the norm for tombs of the 4th dynasty, apart from the marks and names of work-gangs left on blocks of the relieving chambers.\n\n**Entrances**\n\nThe original entrance is on the north side, 15 royal cubits (7.9 meters; 25.8 ft) east of the centreline of the pyramid. Before the removal of the casing in the Middle Ages, the pyramid was entered through a hole in the 19th layer of masonry, approximately 17 meters (56 ft) above the pyramid's base level. The height of that layer – 96 centimeters (3.15 ft) – corresponds to the size of the entrance tunnel that is commonly called the Descending Passage.\n\n**North Face Corridor**\n\nIn 2016 the ScanPyramids team detected a cavity behind the entrance chevrons using muography, which was confirmed in 2019 to be a corridor at least 5 meters (16 ft) long, and running horizontal or sloping upwards (thus not parallel to the Descending Passage).\n\n**Robbers' Tunnel**\n\nToday tourists enter the Great Pyramid via the Robbers' Tunnel, which was long ago cut straight through the masonry of the pyramid. The entrance was forced into the 6th and 7th layer of the casing, about 7 meters (23 ft) above the base. After running more or less straight and horizontal for 27 meters (89 ft) it turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage.\n\n**Descending Passage**\n\nFrom the original entrance, a passage descends through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it, ultimately leading to the Subterranean Chamber.\n\n**Subterranean Chamber**\n\nThe Subterranean Chamber, or \"Pit\", is the lowest of the three main chambers and the only one dug into the bedrock beneath the pyramid.\n\n**Ascending Passage**\n\nThe Ascending Passage connects the Descending Passage to the Grand Gallery. It is 75 cubits (39.3 meters; 128.9 ft) long and of the same width and height as the shaft from which it originates, although its angle is slightly lower at 26°6'.\n\n**Well Shaft and Grotto**\n\nThe Well Shaft (also known as the Service Shaft or Vertical Shaft) links the lower end of the Grand Gallery to the bottom of the Descending Passage, about 50 meters (160 ft) further down.\n\n**Queen's Chamber**\n\nThe Horizontal Passage links the Grand Gallery to the Queen's Chamber. Five pairs of holes at the start suggest the tunnel was once concealed with slabs that lay flush with the gallery floor. The passage is 2 cubits (1.0 meter; 3.4 ft) wide and 1.17 meters (3.8 ft) high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in the floor, after which the passage increases to 1.68 meters (5.5 ft) high.\n\n**Grand Gallery**\n\nThe Grand Gallery continues the slope of the Ascending Passage towards the King's Chamber, extending from the 23rd to the 48th course (of stones), a rise of 21 meters (69 ft). It has been praised as a \"truly spectacular example of stonemasonry\". It is 8.6 meters (28 ft) high and 46.68 meters (153.1 ft) long. Its walls are made out of polished limestone. The base is 4 cubits (2.1 meters; 6.9 ft) wide, but after two courses – at a height of 2.29 meters (7.5 ft) – the blocks of stone in the walls are corbelled inwards by 6–10 centimeters (2.4–3.9 in) on each side.\n\n**The Big Void**\n\nIn 2017, scientists from the ScanPyramids project discovered a large cavity above the Grand Gallery using muon radiography, which they called the \"ScanPyramids Big Void\". A research team, under the supervision of Professor Morishima Kunihiro at Nagoya University, used special nuclear emulsion detectors. Its length is at least 30 meters (98 ft) and its cross-section is similar to that of the Grand Gallery. Its existence was confirmed by independent detection with three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors. The purpose of the cavity is unknown and it is not accessible.\n\n**Antechamber**\n\nThe last line of defence against intrusion was a small chamber designed to house portcullis blocking stones, called the Antechamber. It is cased almost entirely in granite and is situated between the upper end of the Grand Gallery and the King's Chamber. Three slots for portcullis stones line the east and west wall of the chamber. Each of them is topped with a semi-circular groove for a log, around which ropes could be spanned.\n\n**King's Chamber**\n\nThe King's Chamber is the upmost of the three main chambers of the pyramid. It is faced entirely with granite and measures 20 cubits (10.5 meters; 34.4 ft) east-west by 10 cubits (5.2 meters; 17.2 ft) north-south. Its flat ceiling is about 11 cubits and 5 digits (5.8 meters; 19.0 ft) above the floor, formed by nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons. All the roof beams show cracks due to the chamber having settled 2.5–5 centimeters (0.98–1.97 in).\n\n**Sarcophagus**\n\nThe only surviving object in the King's Chamber is a sarcophagus made of a single, hollowed-out granite block. When it was rediscovered in the Early Middle Ages, it was found broken open and any contents had already been removed. It is of the form common for early Egyptian sarcophagi, rectangular in shape with grooves to slide the now missing lid into place with three small holes for pegs to fix it.\n\n**Air Shafts**\n\nIn the north and south walls of the King's Chamber are two narrow shafts, commonly known as \"air shafts\". They face each other and are located approximately 0.91 meters (3.0 ft) above the floor, 2.5 meters (8.2 ft) from the eastern wall, with a width of 18 and 21 centimeters (7.1 and 8.3 in) and a height of 14 centimeters (5.5 in). Both start out horizontally for the length of the granite blocks they go through before changing to an upwards direction.\n\n**Relieving Chambers**\n\nAbove the roof of the King's Chamber are five compartments, named (from lowest upwards) \"Davison's Chamber\", \"Wellington's Chamber\", \"Nelson's Chamber\", \"Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber\", and \"Campbell's Chamber\".\n\n**Pyramid Complex**\n\nThe Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings, including small pyramids.\n\n**Temples and Causeway**\n\nThe Pyramid Temple, which stood on the east side of the pyramid and measured 52.2 meters (171 ft) north to south and 40 meters (130 ft) east to west, has almost entirely disappeared. Only some of the black basalt paving remains. There are only a few remnants of the causeway that linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple. The Valley Temple is buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated.\n\n**East Cemetery**\n\nThe tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, sister-wife of Sneferu and mother of Khufu, lies 110 meters (360 ft) east of the Great Pyramid. Discovered by accident by the Reisner expedition, the burial was intact, but the carefully sealed coffin proved to be empty.\n\n**Subsidiary Pyramids**\n\nOn the southern end of the east side are four subsidiary pyramids. The three that remain standing to almost full height are popularly known as the Queens' Pyramids (G1-a, G1-b and G1-c). The fourth, smaller satellite pyramid (G1-d), is so ruined that its existence was not suspected until the first course of stones and, later, the remains of the capstone were discovered during excavations in 1991–1993.\n\n**Boats**\n\nThree boat-shaped pits are located east of the pyramid. They are large enough in size and shape to have held complete boats, though so shallow that any superstructure, if there ever was one, must have been removed or disassembled.\n\n**Pyramid Town**\n\nFlanking the Giza pyramid complex is a cyclopean stone wall, the Wall of the Crow. Mark Lehner discovered a worker's town outside the wall, otherwise known as \"The Lost City\", dated by pottery styles, seal impressions and stratigraphy to have been constructed and occupied during the reigns of Khafre (2520–2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490–2472 BC).\n\n**Looting**\n\nAuthors Bob Brier and Hoyt Hobbs claim that \"all the pyramids were robbed\" by the New Kingdom, when the construction of royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings began. Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself \"is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom\", before the Arab caliph Al-Ma'mun entered the pyramid around 820 AD.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Great_Pyramid_of_Giza\" following this outline:\n\n\nPurpose\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza was the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, [11] and still contains his granite sarcophagus [12] It had, like other tombs of Egyptian elites, four main purposes: [13]\n\n\nAttribution to Khufu\nHistorically the Great Pyramid had been attributed to Khufu based on the words of authors of classical antiquity, first and foremost Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus During the Middle Ages other people were credited with the construction of the pyramid as well, for example Joseph from the Book of Genesis, Nimrod, or the legendary king Saurid ibn Salhouk [27]\n\n\nAge\nThe Great Pyramid has been determined to be about 4,600 years old by two principal approaches: indirectly, through its attribution to Khufu and his chronological age, based on archaeological and textual evidence;

when that is removed, there is an oblique passage to the tomb.\" [76] This statement has generated much speculation, as it suggests that the pyramid could be entered at this time [77]\n\n\nPliny the Elder\nThe Roman writer Pliny the Elder, writing in the first century AD, argued that the Great Pyramid had been raised, either \"to prevent the lower classes from remaining unoccupied\", or as a measure to prevent the pharaoh's riches from falling into the hands of his rivals or successors [78] Pliny does not speculate as to the pharaoh in question, explicitly noting that \"accident  [has] consigned to oblivion the names of those who erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity\" [78]\n\n\nLate antiquity and the Middle Ages\nDuring late antiquity, a misinterpretation of the pyramids as \"Joseph's granary\" began to gain in popularity The first textual evidence of this connection is found in the travel narratives of the female Christian pilgrim Egeria, who records that on her visit between 381 and 384 AD, \"in the twelve-mile stretch between Memphis and Babylonia  [= Old Cairo] are many pyramids, which Joseph made in order to store corn.\" [79] Ten years later the usage is confirmed in the anonymous travelogue of seven monks who set out from Jerusalem to visit the famous ascetics in Egypt, wherein they report that they \"saw Joseph's granaries, where he stored grain in biblical times\" [80]\n\n\nConstruction\nA hillock forms the base on which the pyramid stands It was cut back into steps and only a strip around the perimeter was leveled, [97] which has been measured to be horizontal and flat to within 21 millimetres (0.8 in) [98] The bedrock reaches a height of almost 6 metres (20 ft) above the pyramid base at the location of the Grotto [99]\n\n\nPreparation of the site\nA hillock forms the base on which the pyramid stands It was cut back into steps and only a strip around the perimeter was leveled, [97] which has been measured to be horizontal and flat to within 21 millimetres (0.8 in) [98] The bedrock reaches a height of almost 6 metres (20 ft) above the pyramid base at the location of the Grotto [99]\n\n\nMaterials\nThe Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks Approximately 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite, and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction [101]\n\n\nWorkforce\nThe ancient Greeks believed that slave labour was used, but modern discoveries made at nearby workers' camps associated with construction at Giza suggest that it was built by thousands of conscript labourers [109]\n\n\nSurveys and design\nThe first precise measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist Flinders Petrie in 1880–1882, published as The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh [113] Many of the casing-stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with high precision, with joints, on average, only 0.5 millimetres (0.020 in) wide [114] In contrast, core blocks were only roughly shaped, with rubble inserted between larger gaps Mortar was used to bind the outer layers together and fill gaps and joints [7]\n\n\nAlignment to the cardinal directions\nThe sides of the Great Pyramid's base are closely aligned to the four geographic (not magnetic) cardinal directions, deviating on average 3 minutes and 38 seconds of arc, or about a tenth of a degree [121] Several methods have been proposed for how the ancient Egyptians achieved this level of accuracy:\n\n\nConstruction theories\nMany alternative, often contradictory, theories have been proposed regarding the pyramid's construction techniques [125] One mystery of the pyramid's construction is its planning John Romer suggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and later constructions, laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1-to-1 scale He writes that \"such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means\" [126]\n\n\nCasing\nAt completion, the Great Pyramid was cased entirely in white limestone Precisely worked blocks were placed in horizontal layers and carefully fitted together with mortar, their outward faces cut at a slope and smoothed to a high degree Together they created four uniform surfaces, angled at 51°50'40\" (a seked of ⁠5+1/2⁠ palms) [129] [130] Unfinished casing blocks of the pyramids of Menkaure and Henutsen at Giza suggest that the front faces were smoothed only after the stones were laid, with chiselled seams marking correct positioning and where the superfluous rock would have to be trimmed off [131]\n\n\nPyramidion and missing tip\nThe pyramid was once topped by a capstone known as a pyramidion The material from which it was made is subject to much speculation; limestone, granite or basalt are commonly proposed, while in popular culture it is often solid gold, gilded or electrum All known 4th dynasty pyramidia (of the Red Pyramid, Satellite Pyramid of Khufu (G1-d) and Queen's Pyramid of Menkaure (G3-a)) are of white limestone and were not gilded [145] Only from the 5th dynasty onward is there evidence of gilded capstones; for instance, a scene on the causeway of Sahure speaks of the \"white gold pyramidion of the pyramid Sahure's Soul Shines\" [146]\n\n\nInterior\nThe internal structure consists of three main chambers (the King's, Queen's and Subterranean Chambers), the Grand Gallery and various corridors and shafts None of the interior walls were decorated or inscribed, as was the norm for tombs of the 4th dynasty, apart from the marks and names of work-gangs left on blocks of the relieving chambers [19]\n\n\nEntrances\n\nThe original entrance is on the north side, 15 royal cubits (7.9 m; 25.8 ft) east of the centreline of the pyramid Before the removal of the casing in the Middle Ages, the pyramid was entered through a hole in the 19th layer of masonry, approximately 17 metres (56 ft) above the pyramid's base level The height of that layer – 96 centimetres (3.15 ft) – corresponds to the size of the entrance tunnel that is commonly called the Descending Passage [99] [150] According to Strabo (64–24 BC) a movable stone could be raised to enter this sloping corridor; however, it is not known if it was a later addition or original.\n\nOriginal entrance\n\nThe original entrance is on the north side, 15 royal cubits (7.9 m; 25.8 ft) east of the centreline of the pyramid Before the removal of the casing in the Middle Ages, the pyramid was entered through a hole in the 19th layer of masonry, approximately 17 metres (56 ft) above the pyramid's base level The height of that layer – 96 centimetres (3.15 ft) – corresponds to the size of the entrance tunnel that is commonly called the Descending Passage [99] [150] According to Strabo (64–24 BC) a movable stone could be raised to enter this sloping corridor; however, it is not known if it was a later addition or original.\n\nNorth Face Corridor\nIn 2016 the ScanPyramids team detected a cavity behind the entrance chevrons using muography, which was confirmed in 2019 to be a corridor at least 5 metres (16 ft) long, and running horizontal or sloping upwards (thus not parallel to the Descending Passage) [152] [153]\n\n\nRobbers' Tunnel\nToday tourists enter the Great Pyramid via the Robbers' Tunnel, which was long ago cut straight through the masonry of the pyramid The entrance was forced into the 6th and 7th layer of the casing, about 7 metres (23 ft) above the base After running more or less straight and horizontal for 27 metres (89 ft) it turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point but access is usually forbidden [156]\n\n\nDescending Passage\nFrom the original entrance, a passage descends through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it, ultimately leading to the Subterranean Chamber.\n\n\nSubterranean Chamber\nThe Subterranean Chamber, or \"Pit\", is the lowest of the three main chambers and the only one dug into the bedrock beneath the pyramid.\n\n\nAscending Passage\nThe Ascending Passage connects the Descending Passage to the Grand Gallery It is 75 cubits (39.3 m; 128.9 ft) long and of the same width and height as the shaft from which it originates, although its angle is slightly lower at 26°6' [170]\n\n\nWell Shaft and Grotto\nThe Well Shaft (also known as the Service Shaft or Vertical Shaft) links the lower end of the Grand Gallery to the bottom of the Descending Passage, about 50 metres (160 ft) further down.\n\n\nQueen's Chamber\nThe Horizontal Passage links the Grand Gallery to the Queen's Chamber Five pairs of holes at the start suggest the tunnel was once concealed with slabs that lay flush with the gallery floor The passage is 2 cubits (1.0 m; 3.4 ft) wide and 1.17 m (3.8 ft) high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in the floor, after which the passage increases to 1.68 m (5.5 ft) high [99] Half of the west wall consists of two layers that have atypically continuous vertical joints Dormion suggests the entrances to magazines laid here and have been filled in [173]\n\n\nGrand Gallery\nThe Grand Gallery continues the slope of the Ascending Passage towards the King's Chamber, extending from the 23rd to the 48th course (of stones), a rise of 21 metres (69 ft) It has been praised as a \"truly spectacular example of stonemasonry\" [183] It is 8.6 metres (28 ft) high and 46.68 metres (153.1 ft) long Its walls are made out of polished limestone [184] The base is 4 cubits (2.1 m; 6.9 ft) wide, but after two courses – at a height of 2.29 metres (7.5 ft) – the blocks of stone in the walls are corbelled inwards by 6–10 centimetres (2.4–3.9 in) on each side [99]\n\n\nThe Big Void\nIn 2017, scientists from the ScanPyramids project discovered a large cavity above the Grand Gallery using muon radiography, which they called the \"ScanPyramids Big Void\" A research team, under the supervision of Professor Morishima Kunihiro at Nagoya University, used special nuclear emulsion detectors [189] [190] Its length is at least 30 metres (98 ft) and its cross-section is similar to that of the Grand Gallery Its existence was confirmed by independent detection with three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors [191] [192] The purpose of the cavity is unknown and it is not accessible Zahi Hawass speculates it may have been a gap used in the construction of the Grand Gallery, [193] but the Japanese research team state that the void is completely different from previously identified construction spaces [194]\n\n\nAntechamber\nThe last line of defence against intrusion was a small chamber designed to house portcullis blocking stones, called the Antechamber It is cased almost entirely in granite and is situated between the upper end of the Grand Gallery and the King's Chamber Three slots for portcullis stones line the east and west wall of the chamber Each of them is topped with a semi-circular groove for a log, around which ropes could be spanned.\n\n\nKing's Chamber\nThe King's Chamber is the upmost of the three main chambers of the pyramid It is faced entirely with granite and measures 20 cubits (10.5 m; 34.4 ft) east-west by 10 cubits (5.2 m; 17.2 ft) north-south Its flat ceiling is about 11 cubits and 5 digits (5.8 m;19.0 ft) above the floor, formed by nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons All the roof beams show cracks due to the chamber having settled 2.5–5 cm (0.98–1.97 in) [197]\n\n\nSarcophagus\nThe only surviving object in the King's Chamber is a sarcophagus made of a single, hollowed-out granite block When it was rediscovered in the Early Middle Ages, it was found broken open and any contents had already been removed It is of the form common for early Egyptian sarcophagi, rectangular in shape with grooves to slide the now missing lid into place with three small holes for pegs to fix it [199] [200] The coffer was not perfectly smoothed, displaying tool marks matching those of copper saws and tubular hand-drills [201]\n\n\nAir shafts\nIn the north and south walls of the King's Chamber are two narrow shafts, commonly known as \"air shafts\" They face each other and are located approximately 0.91 m (3.0 ft) above the floor, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) from the eastern wall, with a width of 18 and 21 cm (7.1 and 8.3 in) and a height of 14 cm (5.5 in) Both start out horizontally for the length of the granite blocks they go through before changing to an upwards direction [203]\n\n\nRelieving chambers\nAbove the roof of the King's Chamber are five compartments, named (from lowest upwards) \"Davison's Chamber\", \"Wellington's Chamber\", \"Nelson's Chamber\", \"Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber\", and \"Campbell's Chamber\".\n\n\nPyramid complex\nThe Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings, including small pyramids.\n\n\nTemples and causeway\nThe Pyramid Temple, which stood on the east side of the pyramid and measured 52.2 metres (171 ft) north to south and 40 metres (130 ft) east to west, has almost entirely disappeared Only some of the black basalt paving remains There are only a few remnants of the causeway that linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple The Valley Temple is buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated [210] [211]\n\n\nEast cemetery\nThe tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, sister-wife of Sneferu and mother of Khufu, lies 110 metres (360 ft) east of the Great Pyramid [212] Discovered by accident by the Reisner expedition, the burial was intact, but the carefully sealed coffin proved to be empty.\n\n\nSubsidiary pyramids\nOn the southern end of the east side are four subsidiary pyramids The three that remain standing to almost full height are popularly known as the Queens' Pyramids (G1-a, G1-b and G1-c) The fourth, smaller satellite pyramid (G1-d), is so ruined that its existence was not suspected until the first course of stones and, later, the remains of the capstone were discovered during excavations in 1991–1993 [213]\n\n\nBoats\nThree boat-shaped pits are located east of the pyramid They are large enough in size and shape to have held complete boats, though so shallow that any superstructure, if there ever was one, must have been removed or disassembled.\n\n\nPyramid town\nFlanking the Giza pyramid complex is a cyclopean stone wall, the Wall of the Crow [217] Mark Lehner discovered a worker's town outside the wall, otherwise known as \"The Lost City\", dated by pottery styles, seal impressions and stratigraphy to have been constructed and occupied during the reigns of Khafre (2520–2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490–2472 BC) [218] [219] In the early 21st century, Lehner and his team made several discoveries, including what appears to have been a thriving port, suggesting the town and associated living quarters, which consisted of barracks called \"galleries\", may not have been for the pyramid workers after all, but rather for the soldiers and sailors who used the port In light of this new discovery, as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived, Lehner suggested the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he believes were used to construct the pyramids, or possibly at nearby quarries [220]\n\n\nLooting\nAuthors Bob Brier and Hoyt Hobbs claim that \"all the pyramids were robbed\" by the New Kingdom, when the construction of royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings began [224] [225] Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself \"is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom\", before the Arab caliph Al-Ma'mun entered the pyramid around 820 AD [157]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Rodrigo_Duterte", "content": "\nEarly years\nRodrigo Roa Duterte was born on March 28, 1945, in Maasin, Southern Leyte [46] His father was Vicente Gonzales Duterte (1911–1968), a Cebuano lawyer, and his mother, Soledad Gonzales Roa (1916–2012), was a schoolteacher from Cabadbaran, Agusan and a civic leader of Maranao descent Duterte has said that his grandfather was Chinese and hailed from Xiamen in Fujian, China [47] Duterte has four siblings: Eleanor, Jocelyn, Emmanuel and Benjamin [48]\n\n\nEducation and early law career\nDuterte went to Laboon Elementary School in Maasin for a year [51] He spent his remaining elementary days at Santa Ana Elementary School in Davao City, where he completed his primary education in 1956 He finished his secondary education in the High School Department of Holy Cross College of Digos (now Cor Jesu College) in Digos, Davao province, after being expelled twice from previous schools, including one in the Ateneo de Davao University (AdDU) High School due to misconduct [56] He graduated in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines in Manila [57] [58]\n\n\nSexual abuse claims\nDuterte has claimed he was sexually abused by a priest when he was a minor [64] After he was challenged by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and AdDU officials to name the priest and file a case against him, Duterte then revealed the priest's name as Mark Falvey (d 1975) [64] The Jesuits of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines confirmed that according to press reports in the United States, in May 2007, the Society of Jesus agreed to a tentative payout of US$16 million to settle claims that Falvey sexually abused at least nine children in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1975 Accusations against Falvey began in 2002 but he was never charged with a crime In May 2008, the Diocese of Sacramento paid a $100,000-settlement to a person allegedly raped and molested by Mark's brother, Arthur Falvey However, it was not clearly indicated in the report if Mark Falvey was assigned at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Davao [65]\n\n\nShooting of student at law school\nDuterte stated at a rally in April 2016 that he shot a fellow student who had bullied him about his Visayan origin as well as other students of the same ethnicity, while at San Beda law college He said, \"But the truth is, I'm used to shooting people When we were about to graduate from San Beda, I shot a person.\" Duterte said that he shot the student in a corridor at the college when the said student called him names again He later told a reporter that the student survived, but refused to answer any further questions about the incident [67]\n\n\nPolitical career in Davao City\nAfter the 1986 People Power Revolution that toppled the regime of President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte was appointed officer-in-charge vice mayor of Davao City by President Corazon Aquino [69] In the 1988 local elections, he ran for mayor under the banner of Lakas ng Dabaw, defeating former OIC Mayor Zafiro Respicio by a margin of 6,000 votes [70]\n\n\nLaw and order\nDuring Duterte's tenure as mayor, Davao City experienced economic boom and a significant decrease in crime from being a conflict-ridden area between communists and right-wing groups during the 1970s and 1980s, and is constantly rated as among the safest in the country [84] [12] The city also ranks high in the world according to crowdsourced survey site Numbeo, [85] [86] a narrative that gained currency in the national media, creating a widespread public perception that has been a significant factor in establishing support for his nationwide drug policy [87] [88] [89] The city was also awarded \"Most Child-Friendly City for Highly-Urbanized Category\" in 1998, 1999, 2013 and 2014 [90] [91]\n\n\nAlleged involvement with Davao Death Squad\nDuterte has been linked by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to extrajudicial killings of over 1,400 alleged criminals and street children by vigilante death squads [33] [99] In the April 2009 UN General Assembly of the Human Rights Council, the UN report (Eleventh Session Agenda item 3, par 21) said, \"The Mayor of Davao City has done nothing to prevent these killings, and his public comments suggest that he is, in fact, supportive.\" [100] Duterte emphasized that the concept of human rights for criminals is Western and should not apply to the Philippines; [101] he further challenged human rights officials to file a case against him if they could provide evidence of his links with vigilante groups [102]\n\n\nFederalism advocacy\nIn September 2014, Duterte and former mayors and governors, calling themselves the Mindanao Council of Leaders, advocated for a federalist government [107] A month later, Duterte attended an event sponsored by the Federal Movement for a Better Philippines in Cebu City [108]\n\n\n2016 presidential campaign\nProspects of Duterte running for president in the 2016 elections began in February 2015, during which Duterte, then outgoing Mayor of Davao City, re-entered the PDP-Laban party, who courted him to run for president [110] A month later, Duterte emerged as a preferred presidential candidate in a Pulse Asia poll; tied with Manila mayor and former president Joseph Estrada, Duterte ranked third behind Senator Grace Poe and frontrunner, Vice President Jejomar Binay [111] In the following months leading to October, however, Duterte repeatedly declined his supporters' clamors for him to run as president because of what he described as a \"flawed government system\", as well as lack of funds and opposition from his family members—notably, from his daughter Sara [112] [113] Additionally, Duterte said he will retire from politics after his mayorship ends, but only if Sara runs as mayor [113]\n\n\nConstitutional reform\nDuterte campaigned for decentralization and a shift to a federal government during the 2016 presidential election [118] In an October 2014 forum organized by Federal Movement for a Better Philippines in Cebu City prior to joining the presidential race, the then-mayor of Davao City called for the creation of two federal states for Moro people as a solution to the problems besetting Mindanao [122] Mayor Duterte said that Nur Misuari and his Moro National Liberation Front do not see eye-to-eye with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front which the administration of President Benigno Aquino III had inked a peace deal with He also said that the \"template of the Bangsamoro Basic Law is federal\", but what is granted to the Bangsamoro should also be granted to other Moro groups and other regions in the country [123] In a dialogue with the Makati Business Club prior to the elections, Duterte said he is open to \"toning down the Constitution\" to accommodate more foreign investors to the Philippines [124] He also said he is open to up to 70 percent foreign ownership of businesses in the country and foreign lease of lands up to 60 years, but will \"leave it to Congress to decide\" [124]\n\n\nElection to the presidency\nOn May 30, 2016, the 16th Congress of the Philippines proclaimed Duterte as the president-elect of the Philippines after he topped the official count by the Congress of the Philippines for the 2016 presidential election with 16,601,997 votes, 6.6 million more than his closest rival, Mar Roxas [125] [126] [127] Camarines Sur representative Leni Robredo on the other hand, was proclaimed as the vice president-elect of the Philippines with 14,418,817 votes, narrowly defeating Senator Bongbong Marcos by 263,473 votes [128]\n\n\nPresidency (2016–2022)\nDuterte was inaugurated as the sixteenth president of the Philippines on June 30, 2016, succeeding Benigno Aquino III At age 71, Duterte became the oldest person elected to the presidency, the first local chief executive to get elected straight to the Office of the President, the second Cebuano president (after Sergio Osmeña), and the first Visayan president from Mindanao [135]\n\n\nEarly actions\nShortly after his inauguration, Duterte held his first Cabinet meeting to lay out their first agenda, which included the country's disaster risk reduction management, decongesting Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila; he also expressed his ideas and concerns regarding the territorial disputes in the South China Sea prior to the announcement of the verdict of the Philippines' arbitration case against China over the issue, [136] which the Philippines later won [137] On July 4, he issued his first executive order, allowing his Cabinet Secretary to supervise over several agencies that focus on poverty reduction [138] He called for the reimposition of capital punishment in the country to execute criminals involved in \"heinous\" crimes, such as illegal drug trade, insisting on hanging [139]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nDuterte's socioeconomic policies, referred to as DuterteNomics, include tax reform, infrastructure development, social protection programs, and other policies to promote economic growth and human development in the country [150] [151] Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III has said that the government required what he describes as an \"audacious\" economic strategy in order for the Philippines to \"catch up with its more vibrant neighbors\" by 2022 and help it achieve high-income economy status within a generation The term DuterteNomics was coined to describe the economic policy of the Duterte administration.\n\n\nEconomic policy\nDuterte's socioeconomic policies, referred to as DuterteNomics, include tax reform, infrastructure development, social protection programs, and other policies to promote economic growth and human development in the country [150] [151] Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III has said that the government required what he describes as an \"audacious\" economic strategy in order for the Philippines to \"catch up with its more vibrant neighbors\" by 2022 and help it achieve high-income economy status within a generation The term DuterteNomics was coined to describe the economic policy of the Duterte administration.\n\n\nInfrastructure development\nTo reduce poverty, encourage economic growth, and reduce congestion in Metro Manila, the Duterte administration launched its comprehensive infrastructure program, Build, Build, Build, [165] on April 18, 2017 [166] The program, which forms part of the administration's socioeconomic policy, [165] aimed to usher in the country's \"Golden Age of Infrastructure\" by increasing the share of spending on public infrastructure in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) from 5.4 percent in 2017 to 7.4 percent in 2022 [167] [168] The administration, in 2017, shifted its infrastructure funding policy from public-private partnerships (PPPs) of previous administrations to government revenues and official development assistance (ODA), particularly from Japan and China, [169] but has since October 2019 engaged with the private sector for additional funding [170] [171]\n\n\nWar on Drugs\nDuterte placed the Philippines' illegal drugs problem at the forefront of his presidential campaign, warning the Philippines was at risk of becoming a narco-state [182] Upon entering office, Duterte began a nationwide crackdown against illegal drugs At the forefront of the campaign's operations was Oplan Tokhang, which involved policemen knocking on the doors of suspected drug users and inviting them to surrender [183] Among Duterte's early actions included naming\nthree Chinese nationals as alleged drug lords in the Philippines, [184] calling for assistance from the New Peoples Army to join the crackdown, [185] and publicly naming 150 public officials allegedly involved in the drug trade [186]\n\n\nInternational Criminal Court\nIn April 2017, a case was filed by lawyer Jude Sabio before the International Criminal Court (ICC), charging Duterte and 11 other officials with crimes against humanity in relation to the deaths of the controversial war on drugs; in response, outgoing ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in early 2018 launched a preliminary examination into the charges against the accused This prompted Duterte in March 2018 to initiate the withdrawal of the Philippines from the ICC, [215] which took effect a year later, on March 17, 2019 [216] Duterte rebuked the idea of allowing foreigners to meddle in the country's justice system and his administration emphasized that cases against him should be filed before the national courts [217] [216] Additionally, he argued that the Rome Statute, which was ratified by the Senate in 2011, was never binding in the Philippines as it was never published in the Official Gazette, a requirement for a law in the country to take effect [218] For its part, the ICC reiterated that it maintains jurisdiction over crimes which took place before the withdrawal [216]\n\n\nMindanao insurgency\nDuterte has said that Moro dignity is what the MILF and MNLF are struggling for, and that they are not terrorists He acknowledged that the Moros were subjected to wrongdoing, historical and in territory [230]\n\n\nCampaign against terrorism\nAt the start of 2016, experts warned the Philippines was at risk of having the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) set a foothold in the country [239] However, Duterte's predecessor, President Aquino III, dismissed the perpetrators of a March 2016 armed attack against the military as mere \"mercenaries\" wanting to join the ISIS [240] [241] The earliest terrorist attacks in Duterte's presidency occurred in September 2016 in Davao City; November 2016 in Butig, Lanao del Sur; and in April to May 2017 in Inabanga, Bohol, where the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) attempted to establish a position in the Visayas [242] Though the military eventually quelled the sieges, [242] [243] the events were only a prelude to what would become Duterte's greatest challenge in combating terrorism [244]\n\n\nCommunist insurgency\nDuterte described himself as left-leaning during his presidential campaign [266] As he initially had good relations with the left, [267] he received campaign support from leftist groups, particularly in Mindanao [268] Duterte was a student of Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria Sison at Lyceum of the Philippines University, and Sison stated during the election campaign that Duterte was \"the best President the Philippines can have since Marcos\" [269]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nWhen news about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread around the world, Duterte initially understated the threat of the disease and urged the public to refrain from inciting anti-Chinese sentiment, which at that time saw a global rise [294] The first reported COVID-19 case in the Philippines was on January 30, 2020, [295] prompting Duterte to issue bans on the entry of Chinese nationals from China [296] [297] and calling for calm [298] Duterte changed his tune in March, during which he placed the Philippines under a State of National Calamity [299] and ordered a lockdown in Luzon [300] His administration opted to use what it described as \"draconian measures\" to control the contagion, [301] and Duterte employed the military and police to enforce the public's strict adherence to quarantine and health protocols [302] [303]\n\n\nEnergy and climate\nThe Duterte administration initially adopted a \"technology neutral\" policy in energy generation [325] Earlier in his term, Duterte stressed that coal remains the most viable source of energy if the Philippines is to accelerate industrialization, [326] and questioned the sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union on smaller countries including the Philippines when the country's carbon footprint is not significant compared to the superpowers [327]\n\n\nGovernment streamlining\nDuterte introduced reforms to eliminate red tape in the government, [341] and ordered government agencies to remove all processes which are \"redundant or burdensome\" to the public [342] Three weeks after assuming office, he issued his second executive order establishing Freedom of Information, allowing citizens to obtain documents and records from public offices under the executive branch to promote transparency in the government [343] [344]\n\n\nHealth care\nDuterte vowed to improve the health care system, [349] [350] certifying the Universal Healthcare Bill as an urgent measure as early as July 2018 [351] In February 2019, he signed the Universal Health Care Act, which automatically enrolls all Filipinos under the government's health insurance program [352] He also enacted the National Integrated Cancer Control Act which establishes a \"national integrated\" program to control and prevent cancer by making treatment more accessible and affordable, [353] [354] and the Philippine Mental Health Law, which provides free mental health services down to the barangay level while requiring hospitals to provide psychiatric, psychosocial and neurologic services [355] [356]\n\n\nEducation\nDuterte signed the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act in August 2017, providing free college education in all state universities and colleges nationwide [361] He signed a law establishing transnational higher education in the country, allowing foreign universities to offer degree programs in the Philippines in an effort to bring international quality standards and expertise into the country [362] [363] He also signed medical scholarships for deserving students in state universities and colleges or partner private higher education institutions through the Doktor Para sa Bayan Act on December 23, 2020 [364]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe Duterte administration has vowed to pursue what it describes as an \"independent foreign policy\" that would reject any meddling by foreign governments, reiterating Article II, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution which states: \"The State shall pursue an independent foreign policy In its relations with other states the paramount consideration shall be national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest, and the right to self-determination.\" In September 2016, Duterte said: \"We will observe and must insist on the time-honored principle of sovereignty, sovereign equality, non-interference and the commitment of peaceful settlements of dispute that will serve our people and protect the interests of our country.\" [25]\n\n\nAdministration and cabinet\nInitially stating that he \"sees nobody deserving\" to replace him as the next president, [389] Duterte in August 2021 announced he would run for vice president in the upcoming 2022 national elections, [390] drawing suspicions from critics that he would extend his term [391] [392] Duterte's political party, the PDP–Laban Cusi faction, named its standard bearer: former Philippine National Police chief and Senator Ronald dela Rosa, [393] who was widely suspected to be a placeholder for Duterte's daughter, Davao City mayor Sara [394] Duterte later withdrew his candidacy, announced his retirement from politics, and had his long-time aide, Senator Bong Go, substitute him [395]\n\n\n2022 Philippine presidential

amid escalating tensions in the South China Sea, Chinese President Xi Jinping invited Duterte to Beijing During the meeting, Xi asked Duterte to \"play an important role\" in improving Philippine-China relations, which were rapidly deteriorating under the Marcos administration that sought to gravitate towards the United States by expanding the number of bases American troops can access under the EDCA [430] As the meeting did not involve the Marcos administration, the event gained much attention, and the administration wanted details of the Xi-Duterte discussion [431] [432] Duterte visited Malacanang Palace later and, in a closed-door session, discussed the matter with Marcos, though no further details were provided to the media [433]\n\n\nFeud with the House and Marcos-Duterte rift\nA rift between the Duterte and Marcos families had begun under House Speaker Martin Romualdez' leadership [434] In the House of Representatives, unconfirmed reports of Deputy

dissemination of fake information [455] Gikan was also suspended after ACT Teachers Representative France Castro filed a complaint against Duterte for allegedly threatening her life during one of the shows [456] Duterte initially intended to speak to Marcos about the SMNI suspension issue as it has affected his talk show, [457] decrying the suspension as censorship [458] Additionally, the Liberal Party, who opposed Marcos' 2022 presidential campaign, were increasingly silent in criticizing the Marcos administration, instead, directing criticism at Duterte and his daughter, Vice President Sara [459] Duterte and his former aide, Senator Bong Go, also faced alleged plunder charges initiated in July 2024 by Duterte's staunch critic, former Senator Antonio Trillanes [460]\n\n\nQuiboloy's arrest order and Duterte as KOJC administrator\nOn March 9, 2024, Duterte's longtime friend and Kingdom of Jesus Christ leader, Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, was ordered arrested by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation after his conviction by a US District Court for alleged cases of sex trafficking, rape, fraud, and cash smuggling [468] No extradition request was received by the Marcos administration for Quiboloy's arrest, [469] although a probe in the Senate was previously initiated on January 23 by Liberal Party ally, Senator Risa Hontiveros, who invited Quiboloy to attend the hearings [470] Quiboloy demanded a fair trial as a requirement to attend, [471] though this was rebuked by Hontiveros and Marcos [472] [473] Claiming his life was under threat through what he described as a connivance between Marcos and the US government, [474] Quiboloy went into hiding and designated Duterte as administrator of his ministry's properties [468] After Quiboloy refused to attend the hearings, Hontiveros cited him in contempt and recommended the Senate President to order his arrest [475] Arrest orders for Quiboloy were issued by the Pasig Regional Trial Court despite the efforts of Senators Robin Padilla, Cynthia Villar, and Bong Go to oppose the move [476] [477] Four separate raids were eventually held in Quiboloy's properties in Davao City; [478] though Quiboloy was not found, [479] the raids were criticized by Duterte and his allies for its \"excessive  [and] unnecessary force\" involving several units of police and military personnel \"in full battle gear\" [480] [481] [482] KOJC members gathered in a rally in Liwasang Bonifacio calling for justice for Quiboloy [483]\n\n\n\"Hakbang ng Maisug\" rallies\nAdditional nationwide protests, called Hakbang ng Maisug (brave) prayer rallies, were held in Dumaguete, [484] Tagum, [485] and Angeles [486] by Duterte and Quiboloy's supporters, who voiced their grievances against the Marcos administration Particularly among these grievances included their opposition to proposed constitutional amendments [485] and to the increased US military presence in the country, [487] as well as denouncement of perceived censorship under the administration [488] In one of the rallies, Duterte notably accused Marcos of plotting to extend his term beyond the current term limit of the Constitution and of being a drug addict, to which Marcos responded by alleging Duterte's previous use of fentanyl as painkiller impaired his judgment; [489] Duterte later dared Marcos to undergo a drug test with him at Luneta

retired Police Colonel Royina Garma, who accused Duterte of wanting to apply his Davao model approach of the war on drugs on a national scale Senators Ronald dela Rosa and Bong Go, dismissing the reward money claims as baseless accusations and hearsay, launched a parallel probe in the Senate to \"find out the truth\" [503] [504] Responding to the Senate invitation, Duterte attended the Senate probe into his campaign against illegal drugs During the session, Duterte admitted to using a \"death squad\" to combat crime as Davao mayor, but denied directing extrajudicial killings in his national drug war, now being examined by the ICC [505] He further noted the resumption of activities of drug dealers and criminals after he stepped down from presidency, telling them \"If I'm given another chance, I'll wipe all of you\" [505]\n\n\nPublic image\nArdent supporters of Duterte have been labeled as \"Diehard Duterte Supporters\", alternatively known as \"Digong Duterte Supporters\",

remarks and human rights concerns\nDuterte's record on human rights and his long history of comments that have widely been considered to be offensive, provocative, threatening, and undiplomatic have received sharp international criticism He has been portrayed by his critics in the media as having a \"dirty mouth\" [519] He had, however, promised to behave in a \"prim and proper\" manner on the national and international stage once he was to be inaugurated as president, to the point that, \"almost, I would become holy.\" [520]\n\n\nSupporters\nSeveral other Facebook groups with the acronym

his presidency [43] Duterte began his presidency with a high trust rating of 79% and 91% (the highest of any Philippine official since 1999), from pollsters Social Weather Stations (SWS) and Pulse Asia, respectively [543] [544] His net satisfaction rating plunged to its lowest at 45% in July 2018, attributed to inflation during the period as well as Duterte calling God \"stupid\" for the concept of original sin in the Bible; [545] eventually, his satisfaction rating rose to 60% by the end of the year [546]\n\n\nPolitical views\nDuterte described himself as left-leaning during his

quite some time already since he deemed it incompatible with his mayoral responsibilities: \"If I listened to the Ten Commandments or to the priests,\" said Duterte, \"I would not be able to do anything as a mayor.\" [576] Duterte has described himself as Christian in 2016 [577] [578] and \"spiritual\" in 2018, expressing that he \"can't accept\" Catholicism or organized religion but also

\"Rodrigo_Duterte\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly years\nRodrigo Roa Duterte was born on March 28, 1945, in Maasin, Southern Leyte [46] His father was Vicente Gonzales Duterte (1911–1968), a Cebuano lawyer, and his mother, Soledad Gonzales Roa (1916–2012), was a schoolteacher from Cabadbaran, Agusan and a civic leader of Maranao descent Duterte has said that his grandfather was Chinese and hailed from Xiamen in Fujian, China [47] Duterte has four siblings: Eleanor, Jocelyn, Emmanuel and Benjamin [48]\n\n\nEducation and early law career\nDuterte went to Laboon Elementary School in Maasin for a year [51] He spent his remaining elementary days at Santa Ana Elementary School in Davao City, where he completed his primary education in 1956 He finished his secondary education in the High School Department of Holy Cross College of Digos (now Cor Jesu College) in Digos, Davao province, after being expelled twice from previous schools, including one in the Ateneo de Davao University (AdDU) High School due to misconduct [56] He graduated in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines in Manila [57] [58]\n\n\nSexual abuse claims\nDuterte has claimed he was sexually abused by a priest when he was a minor [64] After he was challenged by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and AdDU officials to name the priest and file a case against him, Duterte then revealed the priest's name as Mark Falvey (d 1975) [64] The Jesuits of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines confirmed that according to press reports in the United States, in May 2007, the Society of Jesus agreed to a tentative payout of US$16 million to settle claims that Falvey sexually abused at least nine children in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1975 Accusations against Falvey began in 2002 but he was never charged with a crime In May 2008, the Diocese of Sacramento paid a $100,000-settlement to a person allegedly raped and molested by Mark's brother, Arthur Falvey However, it was not clearly indicated in the report if Mark Falvey was assigned at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Davao [65]\n\n\nShooting of student at law school\nDuterte stated at a rally in April 2016 that he shot a fellow student who had bullied him about his Visayan origin as well as other students of the same ethnicity, while at San Beda law college He said, \"But the truth is, I'm used to shooting people When we were about to graduate from San Beda, I shot a person.\" Duterte said that he shot the student in a corridor at the college when the said student called him names again He later told a reporter that the student survived, but refused to answer any further questions about the incident [67]\n\n\nPolitical career in Davao City\nAfter the 1986 People Power Revolution that toppled the regime of President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte was appointed officer-in-charge vice mayor of Davao City by President Corazon Aquino [69] In the 1988 local elections, he ran for mayor under the banner of Lakas ng Dabaw, defeating former OIC Mayor Zafiro Respicio by a margin of 6,000 votes [70]\n\n\nLaw and order\nDuring Duterte's tenure as mayor, Davao City experienced economic boom and a significant decrease in crime from being a conflict-ridden area between communists and right-wing groups during the 1970s and 1980s, and is constantly rated as among the safest in the country [84] [12] The city also ranks high in the world according to crowdsourced survey site Numbeo, [85] [86] a narrative that gained currency in the national media, creating a widespread public perception that has been a significant factor in establishing support for his nationwide drug policy [87] [88] [89] The city was also awarded \"Most Child-Friendly City for Highly-Urbanized Category\" in 1998, 1999, 2013 and 2014 [90] [91]\n\n\nAlleged involvement with Davao Death Squad\nDuterte has been linked by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to extrajudicial killings of over 1,400 alleged criminals and street children by vigilante death squads [33] [99] In the April 2009 UN General Assembly of the Human Rights Council, the UN report (Eleventh Session Agenda item 3, par 21) said, \"The Mayor of Davao City has done nothing to prevent these killings, and his public comments suggest that he is, in fact, supportive.\" [100] Duterte emphasized that the concept of human rights for criminals is Western and should not apply to the Philippines; [101] he further challenged human rights officials to file a case against him if they could provide evidence of his links with vigilante groups [102]\n\n\nFederalism advocacy\nIn September 2014, Duterte and former mayors and governors, calling themselves the Mindanao Council of Leaders, advocated for a federalist government [107] A month later, Duterte attended an event sponsored by the Federal Movement for a Better Philippines in Cebu City [108]\n\n\n2016 presidential campaign\nProspects of Duterte running for president in the 2016 elections began in February 2015, during which Duterte, then outgoing Mayor of Davao City, re-entered the PDP-Laban party, who courted him to run for president [110] A month later, Duterte emerged as a preferred presidential candidate in a Pulse Asia poll; tied with Manila mayor and former president Joseph Estrada, Duterte ranked third behind Senator Grace Poe and frontrunner, Vice President Jejomar Binay [111] In the following months leading to October, however, Duterte repeatedly declined his supporters' clamors for him to run as president because of what he described as a \"flawed government system\", as well as lack of funds and opposition from his family members—notably, from his daughter Sara [112] [113] Additionally, Duterte said he will retire from politics after his mayorship ends, but only if Sara runs as mayor [113]\n\n\nConstitutional reform\nDuterte campaigned for decentralization and a shift to a federal government during the 2016 presidential election [118] In an October 2014 forum organized by Federal Movement for a Better Philippines in Cebu City prior to joining the presidential race, the then-mayor of Davao City called for the creation of two federal states for Moro people as a solution to the problems besetting Mindanao [122] Mayor Duterte said that Nur Misuari and his Moro National Liberation Front do not see eye-to-eye with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front which the administration of President Benigno Aquino III had inked a peace deal with He also said that the \"template of the Bangsamoro Basic Law is federal\", but what is granted to the Bangsamoro should also be granted to other Moro groups and other regions in the country [123] In a dialogue with the Makati Business Club prior to the elections, Duterte said he is open to \"toning down the Constitution\" to accommodate more foreign investors to the Philippines [124] He also said he is open to up to 70 percent foreign ownership of businesses in the country and foreign lease of lands up to 60 years, but will \"leave it to Congress to decide\" [124]\n\n\nElection to the presidency\nOn May 30, 2016, the 16th Congress of the Philippines proclaimed Duterte as the president-elect of the Philippines after he topped the official count by the Congress of the Philippines for the 2016 presidential election with 16,601,997 votes, 6.6 million more than his closest rival, Mar Roxas [125] [126] [127] Camarines Sur representative Leni Robredo on the other hand, was proclaimed as the vice president-elect of the Philippines with 14,418,817 votes, narrowly defeating Senator Bongbong Marcos by 263,473 votes [128]\n\n\nPresidency (2016–2022)\nDuterte was inaugurated as the sixteenth president of the Philippines on June 30, 2016, succeeding Benigno Aquino III At age 71, Duterte became the oldest person elected to the presidency, the first local chief executive to get elected straight to the Office of the President, the second Cebuano president (after Sergio Osmeña), and the first Visayan president from Mindanao [135]\n\n\nEarly actions\nShortly after his inauguration, Duterte held his first Cabinet meeting to lay out their first agenda, which included the country's disaster risk reduction management, decongesting Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila; he also expressed his ideas and concerns regarding the territorial disputes in the South China Sea prior to the announcement of the verdict of the Philippines' arbitration case against China over the issue, [136] which the Philippines later won [137] On July 4, he issued his first executive order, allowing his Cabinet Secretary to supervise over several agencies that focus on poverty reduction [138] He called for the reimposition of capital punishment in the country to execute criminals involved in \"heinous\" crimes, such as illegal drug trade, insisting on hanging [139]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nDuterte's socioeconomic policies, referred to as DuterteNomics, include tax reform, infrastructure development, social protection programs, and other policies to promote economic growth and human development in the country [150] [151] Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III has said that the government required what he describes as an \"audacious\" economic strategy in order for the Philippines to \"catch up with its more vibrant neighbors\" by 2022 and help it achieve high-income economy status within a generation The term DuterteNomics was coined to describe the economic policy of the Duterte administration.\n\n\nEconomic policy\nDuterte's socioeconomic policies, referred to as DuterteNomics, include tax reform, infrastructure development, social protection programs, and other policies to promote economic growth and human development in the country [150] [151] Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III has said that the government required what he describes as an \"audacious\" economic strategy in order for the Philippines to \"catch up with its more vibrant neighbors\" by 2022 and help it achieve high-income economy status within a generation The term DuterteNomics was coined to describe the economic policy of the Duterte administration.\n\n\nInfrastructure development\nTo reduce poverty, encourage economic growth, and reduce congestion in Metro Manila, the Duterte administration launched its comprehensive infrastructure program, Build, Build, Build, [165] on April 18, 2017 [166] The program, which forms part of the administration's socioeconomic policy, [165] aimed to usher in the country's \"Golden Age of Infrastructure\" by increasing the share of spending on public infrastructure in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) from 5.4 percent in 2017 to 7.4 percent in 2022 [167] [168] The administration, in 2017, shifted its infrastructure funding policy from public-private partnerships (PPPs) of previous administrations to government revenues and official development assistance (ODA), particularly from Japan and China, [169] but has since October 2019 engaged with the private sector for additional funding [170] [171]\n\n\nWar on Drugs\nDuterte placed the Philippines' illegal drugs problem at the forefront of his presidential campaign, warning the Philippines was at risk of becoming a narco-state [182] Upon entering office, Duterte began a nationwide crackdown against illegal drugs At the forefront of the campaign's operations was Oplan Tokhang, which involved policemen knocking on the doors of suspected drug users and inviting them to surrender [183] Among Duterte's early actions included naming\nthree Chinese nationals as alleged drug lords in the Philippines, [184] calling for assistance from the New Peoples Army to join the crackdown, [185] and publicly naming 150 public officials allegedly involved in the drug trade [186]\n\n\nInternational Criminal Court\nIn April 2017, a case was filed by lawyer Jude Sabio before the International Criminal Court (ICC), charging Duterte and 11 other officials with crimes against humanity in relation to the deaths of the controversial war on drugs; in response, outgoing ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in early 2018 launched a preliminary examination into the charges against the accused This prompted Duterte in March 2018 to initiate the withdrawal of the Philippines from the ICC, [215] which took effect a year later, on March 17, 2019 [216] Duterte rebuked the idea of allowing foreigners to meddle in the country's justice system and his administration emphasized that cases against him should be filed before the national courts [217] [216] Additionally, he argued that the Rome Statute, which was ratified by the Senate in 2011, was never binding in the Philippines as it was never published in the Official Gazette, a requirement for a law in the country to take effect [218] For its part, the ICC reiterated that it maintains jurisdiction over crimes which took place before the withdrawal [216]\n\n\nMindanao insurgency\nDuterte has said that Moro dignity is what the MILF and MNLF are struggling for, and that they are not terrorists He acknowledged that the Moros were subjected to wrongdoing, historical and in territory [230]\n\n\nCampaign against terrorism\nAt the start of 2016, experts warned the Philippines was at risk of having the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) set a foothold in the country [239] However, Duterte's predecessor, President Aquino III, dismissed the perpetrators of a March 2016 armed attack against the military as mere \"mercenaries\" wanting to join the ISIS [240] [241] The earliest terrorist attacks in Duterte's presidency occurred in September 2016 in Davao City; November 2016 in Butig, Lanao del Sur; and in April to May 2017 in Inabanga, Bohol, where the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) attempted to establish a position in the Visayas [242] Though the military eventually quelled the sieges, [242] [243] the events were only a prelude to what would become Duterte's greatest challenge in combating terrorism [244]\n\n\nCommunist insurgency\nDuterte described himself as left-leaning during his presidential campaign [266] As he initially had good relations with the left, [267] he received campaign support from leftist groups, particularly in Mindanao [268] Duterte was a student of Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria Sison at Lyceum of the Philippines University, and Sison stated during the election campaign that Duterte was \"the best President the Philippines can have since Marcos\" [269]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nWhen news about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread around the world, Duterte initially understated the threat of the disease and urged the public to refrain from inciting anti-Chinese sentiment, which at that time saw a global rise [294] The first reported COVID-19 case in the Philippines was on January 30, 2020, [295] prompting Duterte to issue bans on the entry of Chinese nationals from China [296] [297] and calling for calm [298] Duterte changed his tune in March, during which he placed the Philippines under a State of National Calamity [299] and ordered a lockdown in Luzon [300] His administration opted to use what it described as \"draconian measures\" to control the contagion, [301] and Duterte employed the military and police to enforce the public's strict adherence to quarantine and health protocols [302] [303]\n\n\nEnergy and climate\nThe Duterte administration initially adopted a \"technology neutral\" policy in energy generation [325] Earlier in his term, Duterte stressed that coal remains the most viable source of energy if the Philippines is to accelerate industrialization, [326] and questioned the sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union on smaller countries including the Philippines when the country's carbon footprint is not significant compared to the superpowers [327]\n\n\nGovernment streamlining\nDuterte introduced reforms to eliminate red tape in the government, [341] and ordered government agencies to remove all processes which are \"redundant or burdensome\" to the public [342] Three weeks after assuming office, he issued his second executive order establishing Freedom of Information, allowing citizens to obtain documents and records from public offices under the executive branch to promote transparency in the government [343] [344]\n\n\nHealth care\nDuterte vowed to improve the health care system, [349] [350] certifying the Universal Healthcare Bill as an urgent measure as early as July 2018 [351] In February 2019, he signed the Universal Health Care Act, which automatically enrolls all Filipinos under the government's health insurance program [352] He also enacted the National Integrated Cancer Control Act which establishes a \"national integrated\" program to control and prevent cancer by making treatment more accessible and affordable, [353] [354] and the Philippine Mental Health Law, which provides free mental health services down to the barangay level while requiring hospitals to provide psychiatric, psychosocial and neurologic services [355] [356]\n\n\nEducation\nDuterte signed the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act in August 2017, providing free college education in all state universities and colleges nationwide [361] He signed a law establishing transnational higher education in the country, allowing foreign universities to offer degree programs in the Philippines in an effort to bring international quality standards and expertise into the country [362] [363] He also signed medical scholarships for deserving students in state universities and colleges or partner private higher education institutions through the Doktor Para sa Bayan Act on December 23, 2020 [364]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe Duterte administration has vowed to pursue what it describes as an \"independent foreign policy\" that would reject any meddling by foreign governments, reiterating Article II, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution which states: \"The State shall pursue an independent foreign policy In its relations with other states the paramount consideration shall be national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest, and the right to self-determination.\" In September 2016, Duterte said: \"We will observe and must insist on the time-honored principle of sovereignty, sovereign equality, non-interference and the commitment of peaceful settlements of dispute that will serve our people and protect the interests of our country.\" [25]\n\n\nAdministration and cabinet\nInitially stating that he \"sees nobody deserving\" to replace him as the next president, [389] Duterte in August 2021 announced he would run for vice president in the upcoming 2022 national elections, [390] drawing suspicions from critics that he would extend his term [391] [392] Duterte's political party, the PDP–Laban Cusi faction, named its standard bearer: former Philippine National Police chief and Senator Ronald dela Rosa, [393] who was widely suspected to be a placeholder for Duterte's daughter, Davao City mayor Sara [394] Duterte later withdrew his candidacy, announced his retirement from politics, and had his long-time aide, Senator Bong Go, substitute him [395]\n\n\n2022 Philippine presidential election\nInitially stating that he \"sees nobody deserving\" to replace him as the next president, [389] Duterte in August 2021 announced he would run for vice president in the upcoming

City and kept a low profile [423] [424] Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, a political ally of Duterte, convinced him in September 2023 to actively participate in the Philippine political landscape [425] In January 2023, Duterte resumed hosting his weekly show, Gikan sa Masa, Para sa Masa (From the Masses, For The Masses), on SMNI; co-hosted by Duterte's friend and spiritual adviser Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, Duterte would speak about current political issues besetting the country [426] Some of Duterte's strong statements in the show, such as his opposition to the expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites in the Philippines, attracted attention and were covered by the media [427] [428] [429]\n\n\nPost-presidency (2022–present)\nAt the end of his presidency, Duterte returned to Davao City and kept a low profile [423] [424] Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, a political ally of Duterte, convinced him in September 2023 to actively participate in the Philippine political landscape [425] In January 2023, Duterte resumed hosting his weekly show, Gikan sa Masa, Para sa Masa (From the Masses, For The Masses), on SMNI; co-hosted by

his opposition to the expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites in the Philippines, attracted attention and were covered by the media [427] [428] [429]\n\n\n2023 visit to China\nIn July 2023, amid escalating tensions in the South China Sea, Chinese President Xi Jinping invited Duterte to Beijing During the meeting, Xi asked Duterte to \"play an important role\" in improving Philippine-China relations, which were rapidly deteriorating under the Marcos administration that sought to gravitate towards the United States by expanding the number of bases American troops can access under the EDCA [430] As the meeting did not involve the Marcos administration, the event gained much attention, and the administration wanted details of the Xi-Duterte discussion [431] [432] Duterte visited Malacanang Palace later and, in a closed-door session, discussed the matter with Marcos, though no further details were provided to the media [433]\n\n\nFeud with the House and Marcos-Duterte rift\nA rift between the Duterte and Marcos families had begun under House Speaker Martin Romualdez' leadership [434] In the House of Representatives, unconfirmed reports of Deputy House Speaker Gloria-Macapagal Arroyo allegedly attempting to unseat Romualdez as House Speaker circulated Despite Arroyo dismissing the accusations, Arroyo was later demoted by the House from her senior deputy Speaker position [435] [436]\n\n\nSMNI suspension and ICC investigation\nDespite sustained domestic popularity, [451] [452] Duterte found himself increasingly politically isolated SMNI, which hosted his talk show Gikan sa Masa, Para sa Masa, was later suspended (first for 30 days, [453] and later indefinitely) [454] by the National Telecommunications Commission on grounds of alleged dissemination of fake information [455] Gikan was also suspended after ACT Teachers Representative France Castro filed a complaint against Duterte for allegedly threatening her life during one of the shows [456] Duterte initially intended to speak to Marcos about the SMNI suspension issue as it has affected his talk show, [457] decrying the suspension as censorship [458] Additionally, the Liberal Party, who opposed Marcos' 2022 presidential campaign, were increasingly silent in criticizing the Marcos administration, instead, directing criticism at Duterte and his daughter, Vice President Sara [459] Duterte and his former aide, Senator Bong Go, also faced alleged plunder charges initiated in July 2024 by Duterte's staunch critic, former Senator Antonio Trillanes [460]\n\n\nQuiboloy's arrest order and Duterte as KOJC administrator\nOn March 9, 2024, Duterte's longtime friend and Kingdom of Jesus Christ leader, Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, was ordered arrested by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation after his conviction by a US District Court for alleged cases of sex trafficking, rape, fraud, and cash smuggling [468] No extradition request was received by the Marcos administration for Quiboloy's arrest, [469] although a probe in the Senate was previously initiated on January 23 by Liberal Party ally, Senator Risa Hontiveros, who invited Quiboloy to attend the hearings [470] Quiboloy demanded a fair trial as a requirement to attend, [471] though this was rebuked by Hontiveros and Marcos [472] [473] Claiming his life was under threat through what he described as a connivance between Marcos and the US government, [474] Quiboloy went into hiding and designated Duterte as administrator of his ministry's properties [468] After Quiboloy refused to attend the hearings, Hontiveros cited him in contempt and recommended the Senate President to order his arrest [475] Arrest orders for Quiboloy were issued by the Pasig Regional Trial Court despite the efforts of Senators Robin Padilla, Cynthia Villar, and Bong Go to oppose the move [476] [477] Four separate raids were eventually held in Quiboloy's properties in Davao City; [478] though Quiboloy was not found, [479] the raids were criticized by Duterte and his allies for its \"excessive  [and] unnecessary force\" involving several units of police and military personnel \"in full battle gear\" [480] [481] [482] KOJC members gathered in a rally in Liwasang Bonifacio calling for justice for Quiboloy [483]\n\n\n\"Hakbang ng Maisug\" rallies\nAdditional nationwide protests, called Hakbang ng Maisug (brave) prayer rallies, were held in Dumaguete, [484] Tagum, [485] and Angeles [486] by Duterte and Quiboloy's supporters, who voiced their grievances against the Marcos administration Particularly among these grievances included their opposition to proposed constitutional amendments [485] and to the increased US military presence in the country, [487] as well as denouncement of perceived censorship under the administration [488] In one of the rallies, Duterte notably accused Marcos of plotting to extend his term beyond the current term limit of the Constitution and of being a drug addict, to which Marcos responded by alleging Duterte's previous use of fentanyl as painkiller impaired his judgment; [489] Duterte later dared Marcos to undergo a drug test with him at Luneta Park [490]\n\n\n2025 elections\nOn October 5, 2024, Duterte announced that he will run for mayor of Davao City, with his son, incumbent Mayor Sebastian Duterte, as his running mate for vice mayor in

former cabinet secretary, former Civil Service Commission chairperson Karlo Nograles as Davao City mayor, adding he is retired and wishes to give the position to the next generation [501]\n\n\nHouse and Senate probe into the War on Drugs\nIn October 2024, the House quad committee led an investigation into the supposed use of intelligence funds to fund an alleged \"reward system\" for police involved in drug-related extrajudicial killings that occurred during Duterte's presidency Among the witnesses in the House probe was former Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office general manager and retired Police Colonel Royina Garma, who accused Duterte of wanting to apply his Davao model approach of the war on drugs on a national scale Senators Ronald dela Rosa and Bong Go, dismissing the reward money claims as baseless accusations and hearsay, launched a parallel probe in the Senate to \"find out the truth\" [503] [504] Responding to the Senate invitation, Duterte attended the Senate probe into his campaign against illegal drugs During the session, Duterte admitted to using a \"death squad\" to combat crime as Davao mayor, but denied directing extrajudicial killings in his national drug war, now being examined by the ICC [505] He further noted the resumption of activities of drug dealers and criminals after he stepped down from presidency, telling them \"If I'm given another chance, I'll wipe all of you\" [505]\n\n\nPublic image\nArdent supporters of Duterte have been labeled as \"Diehard Duterte Supporters\", alternatively known as \"Digong Duterte Supporters\", which shares the acronym with the Davao Death Squad (DDS) [508] This label has been applied to the 16 million people who voted for him in the 2016 presidential election [509]\n\n\nControversial remarks and human rights concerns\nDuterte's record on human rights and his long history of comments that have widely been considered to be offensive, provocative, threatening, and undiplomatic have received sharp international criticism He has been portrayed by his critics in the media as having a \"dirty mouth\" [519] He had, however, promised to behave in a \"prim and proper\" manner on the national and international stage once he was to be inaugurated as president, to the point that, \"almost, I would become holy.\" [520]\n\n\nSupporters\nSeveral other Facebook groups with the acronym \"DDS\" supported Duterte as early as 2011 Among these groups is the Duterte Defense Squad, which was created on July 5, 2011 Other examples include Digong Duterte Supporters-Registered Nurses Group, Duterte's Destiny is to Serve the Country, Digong Duterte Swerte (lit Digong Duterte is (Good) Luck), and Davsur Duterte Supporters In 2015, members of the various groups urged Duterte to run for president [538]\n\n\nApproval ratings\nDespite criticism and international opposition to his controversial anti-narcotics drive, Duterte's domestic approval rating remained relatively high throughout his presidency [43] Duterte began his presidency with a high trust rating of 79% and 91% (the highest of any Philippine official since 1999), from pollsters Social Weather Stations (SWS) and Pulse Asia, respectively [543] [544] His net satisfaction rating plunged to its lowest at 45% in July 2018, attributed to inflation during the period as well as Duterte calling God \"stupid\" for the concept of original sin in the Bible; [545] eventually, his satisfaction rating rose to 60% by the end of the year [546]\n\n\nPolitical views\nDuterte described himself as left-leaning during his campaign and presidency, but has stressed that he is for democracy and is not a communist [554] [555]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDuterte is known for being an avid fan of big bikes, but detests luxury cars He once owned a second-hand Harley-Davidson and a Yamaha Virago He was once a habitual smoker, but he eventually quit after a doctor's suggestion due to health concerns Duterte is an avid reader of Robert Ludlum and Sidney Sheldon novels [559] Duterte is also known for his straightforward and vocal attitude in public, especially in interviews, showing no hesitation in profusely using profanity live on-screen on numerous occasions despite formal requests by media groups and schools beforehand to abstain [560]\n\n\nFamily\nDuterte's father, Vicente, died in 1968 while his mother, Soledad, died on February 4, 2012, at the age of 95 [565]\n\n\nReligion\nDespite being raised as a communicant of the Catholic Church, on January 19, 2016, Duterte clarified that he had not attended Mass for quite some time already since he deemed it incompatible with his mayoral responsibilities: \"If I listened to the Ten Commandments or to the priests,\" said Duterte, \"I would not be able to do anything as a mayor.\" [576] Duterte has described himself as Christian in 2016 [577] [578] and \"spiritual\" in 2018, expressing that he \"can't accept\" Catholicism or organized religion but also that he is neither an atheist nor an agnostic [579] [580] He has referred to God as Allah [578] and has been quoted as saying: \"a part of me which is Islam\" [581]\n\n\nHealth\nDuterte has Buerger's disease, an inflammation of blood vessels, mostly in the limbs, and Barrett's esophagus, wherein esophageal cells are gradually replaced by gastrointestinal cells He has denied rumors of throat cancer [590]\n\n\nHonors and awards\nDuterte declined an honorary doctor of laws degree offered by the University of the Philippines amid opposition from members of the university [598] On March 28, 2023,

described the vote for Brexit as \"the greatest ever vote of confidence in the project of the United Kingdom\" and cited her personal heroes as the Conservative politicians Winston Churchill, Airey Neave and Margaret Thatcher [48]\n\n\nJohnson government\nIn July 2019, Badenoch was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children and Families by Boris Johnson [59] [60] In

fixing the majority of problems\" [73]\n\n\nTruss government\nIn September 2022, after Liz Truss became prime minister, she appointed Badenoch to her Cabinet as Secretary of State for International Trade [77] [78] Following Truss' resignation the following month, Badenoch endorsed Rishi Sunak in the leadership election, [79] stating that he was \"the serious, honest leader we need\" [80]\n\n\nSunak government\nOn 25 October 2022, Badenoch was retained as Secretary of State for International Trade by Rishi Sunak upon him becoming prime minister She was also granted the additional

Conservative defeat at the general election, she was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government [94] She publicly criticised Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman [95]\n\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nIn her acceptance speech, Badenoch vowed to \"renew\" the Conservative Party, setting out her belief that the Conservatives had two responsibilities: to \"hold this Labour Government to account\" and to \"prepare over the course of the next few years for government\" [115]\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\nIn November 2024, Badenoch faced criticism from Eurosceptic MPs, such as Nigel Farage, when she whipped Conservative MPs into abstaining on a vote to introduce passports for household pets travelling between the mainland UK and Northern Ireland As well as a perceived undermining of the Union, critics asserted that an effective Opposition would oppose the scheme rather than wave it through Parliament [118]\n\n\nPolitical views\nDefunct\n\n\nRace relations\nDuring a House of Commons debate in April 2021, Badenoch criticised the Labour Party's response to a report compiled by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities that had declared Britain was not institutionally racist Labour had described the report as \"cherry-picking of data\", while the party's former frontbench MP Dawn Butler claimed the report was \"gaslighting on a national scale\", describing those who put it together as \"racial gatekeepers\" [125] Badenoch accused Labour of \"wilful misrepresentations\" over the report and responded to Butler's comments by stating \"It is wrong to accuse those who argue for a different approach as being racism deniers or race traitors It's even more irresponsible, dangerously so, to call ethnic minority people racial slurs like Uncle Toms, coconuts, house slaves or house negroes for daring to think differently.\" [126] [127]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn September 2024, Badenoch wrote an article for The Sunday Telegraph in which she argued that \"We can not be naïve and assume immigrants will automatically abandon ancestral ethnic hostilities at the border, or that all cultures are equally valid They are not.\" She argued that \"Our country is not a dormitory for people to come here and make money It is our home Those we chose to welcome, we expect to share our values and contribute to our society British citizenship is more than having a British passport but also a commitment to the UK and its people.\" Badenoch also called for a better \"integration strategy\" that emphasized British values and culture, referring in her article to the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Baroness Falkner, who had reported that \"we seem to be failing to integrate\" new immigrants, and \"called for new arrivals to the UK to be required to take an 'integration course', adopting an approach used in Germany\" [130] [131] [132]\n\n\nForeign policy\nBadenoch has expressed support for strengthening ties between Israel and the United Kingdom During her leadership bid, Badenoch wrote a letter to the Conservative Friends of Israel saying: “If I am leader of the Conservative Party, we will continue to strengthen our ties with Israel and root out the tragic resurgence of antisemitism in the UK We will be true to our values.” A November 2024 article in the Times of Israel described Badenoch as a \"pro-Israel\" politician [136]\n\n\nColonialism\nRegarding the United Kingdom's colonial history, Badenoch has argued that \"there were terrible things that happened during the British Empire, there were other good things that happened, and we need to tell both sides of the story\" [143]\n\n\nLGBT rights and feminism\nIn an article in The Sunday Times in the aftermath of the publication of the Cass Review, an investigation into gender identity services in the NHS, Badenoch wrote that had \"those who warned that gender services in the NHS had been hijacked by ideologues been listened to instead of gagged, children would not have been harmed and the Cass review would not have been required Our responsibility is to ensure that nothing like it ever happens again.\" [146]\n\n\nEconomics and class\nIn a 2024 pamphlet distributed as part of her campaign for leadership of the Conservative Party, Badenoch said that politics has shifted away from class \"in the old sense – increasingly, whether you are high income does not drive your voting patterns Educated voters are moving left, and many private sector voters on average incomes are moving right.\" [160] She also said that a new 'progressive ideology' was on the rise built on \"the twin pillars of constant intervention on behalf of protecting marginalized, vulnerable groups, including protecting us from ourselves – and the idea that bureaucrats make better decisions than individuals, or even democratic nation states\" [160]\n\n\nPersonal life\nShe is married to Hamish Badenoch; they have two daughters and a son [161] [162] Hamish works for Deutsche Bank [21] [58] and was a Conservative councillor from 2014 to 2018 on Merton Borough Council [163] [164] He also contested Foyle for the

describing those who put it together as \"racial gatekeepers\" [125] Badenoch accused Labour of \"wilful misrepresentations\" over the report and responded to Butler's comments by stating \"It is wrong to accuse those who argue for a different approach as being racism deniers or race traitors It's even more irresponsible, dangerously so, to call ethnic minority people racial slurs like Uncle Toms, coconuts, house slaves or house negroes for daring to think differently.\" [126] [127]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn September 2024, Badenoch wrote an article for The Sunday Telegraph in which she argued that \"We can not be naïve and assume immigrants will automatically abandon ancestral ethnic hostilities at the border, or that all cultures are equally valid They are not.\" She argued that \"Our country is not a dormitory for people to come here and make money It is our home Those we chose to welcome, we expect to share our values and contribute to our society British citizenship is more than having a British passport but also a commitment to the UK and its people.\" Badenoch also called for a better \"integration strategy\" that emphasized British values and culture, referring in her article to the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Baroness Falkner, who had reported that \"we seem to be failing to integrate\" new immigrants, and \"called for new arrivals to the UK to be required to take an 'integration course', adopting an approach used in Germany\" [130] [131] [132]\n\n\nForeign policy\nBadenoch has expressed support for strengthening ties between Israel and the United Kingdom During her leadership bid, Badenoch wrote a letter to the Conservative Friends of Israel saying: “If I am leader of the Conservative Party, we will continue to strengthen our ties with Israel and root out the tragic resurgence of antisemitism in the UK We will be true to our values.” A November 2024 article in the Times of Israel described Badenoch as a \"pro-Israel\" politician [136]\n\n\nColonialism\nRegarding the United Kingdom's colonial history, Badenoch has argued that \"there were terrible things that happened during the British Empire, there were other good things that happened, and we need to tell both sides of the story\" [143]\n\n\nLGBT rights and feminism\nIn an article in The Sunday Times in the aftermath of the publication of the Cass Review, an investigation into gender identity services in the NHS, Badenoch wrote that had \"those who warned that gender services in the NHS had been hijacked by ideologues been listened to instead of gagged, children would not have been harmed and the Cass review would not have been required Our responsibility is to ensure that nothing like it ever happens again.\" [146]\n\n\nEconomics and class\nIn a 2024 pamphlet distributed as part of her campaign for leadership of the Conservative Party, Badenoch said that politics has shifted away from class \"in the old sense – increasingly, whether you are high income does not drive your voting patterns Educated voters are moving left, and many private sector voters on average incomes are moving right.\" [160] She also said that a new 'progressive ideology' was on the rise built on \"the twin pillars of constant intervention on behalf of protecting marginalized, vulnerable groups, including protecting us from ourselves – and the idea that bureaucrats make better decisions than individuals, or even democratic nation states\" [160]\n\n\nPersonal life\nShe is married to Hamish Badenoch; they have two daughters and a son [161] [162] Hamish works for Deutsche Bank [21] [58] and was a Conservative councillor from 2014 to 2018 on Merton Borough Council [163] [164] He also contested Foyle for the Northern Ireland Conservatives at the 2015 general election [165]\n\n\nNotes\nLeader of the OppositionKemi Badenoch\n\n\nReferences\nLeader of the OppositionKemi Badenoch\n\n\nExternal links\nLeader of the OppositionKemi

Born on May 9, 1943, in Wyoming at the Heart Mountain Internment Camp, Kuromiya's life was marked by a deep commitment to social justice and a willingness to challenge the status quo.\n\n**Family and Early Life**\n\nKuromiya was born to Japanese-American parents who had been relocated to the Heart Mountain Internment Camp during World War II. The camp was one of ten internment camps established by the US government, where over 120,000 Japanese-Americans were forcibly relocated without due process. Kuromiya's family had been living in Monrovia, California, but was forced to leave their home and relocate to the camp. After the war, Kuromiya's family returned to California, where he grew up.\n\n**Student Activism**\n\nIn 1961, Kuromiya decided to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he was awarded a Benjamin Franklin National Scholarship. He studied architecture, which he felt was a field that encompassed a variety of humanistic fields. Kuromiya was inspired by Louis Kahn, a renowned architect and professor at the University of Pennsylvania. During his time at university, Kuromiya became increasingly involved in human rights activities, largely due to his sexual orientation and his perception of the university as being very closeted.\n\n**Anti-War Demonstrations**\n\nIn April 1968, Kuromiya instigated the largest anti-war demonstration in Penn's history, attracting thousands of people. He printed and distributed leaflets from a fictional group called the Americong, which stated that there would be an innocent dog burned with napalm in front of the Van Pelt Library at Penn in protest of the use of napalm in the Vietnam War. On the day of the protest, Kuromiya handed out leaflets that read, \"Congratulations, you've saved the life of an innocent dog. How about the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese that have been burned alive?\"\n\n**Gay Liberation Struggle**\n\nKuromiya was also a key figure in the gay liberation movement. In 1965, he officially came out as gay at the first Annual Reminder protest, which took place at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The protest was part of a national movement to call for equal rights for homosexuals, and it marked a significant moment in the gay rights movement. Kuromiya continued to be involved in the gay liberation struggle, advocating for the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and challenging the societal norms that marginalized them.\n\n**AIDS Advocacy**\n\nIn the early 1980s, Kuromiya began working on the AIDS movement, which was still in its early stages. He was most involved with ACT UP (the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), which he helped to found in Philadelphia. After being diagnosed with AIDS himself in 1989, Kuromiya intensified his advocacy work, becoming a leading voice in the fight against AIDS. He approached his work with the motto, \"Information is power,\" and educated himself on the AIDS issues to the point where he was invited to participate in National Institutes of Health alternative therapy panels.\n\n**Impact Litigation**\n\nIn the late 1990s, Kuromiya was involved in several successful impact litigation cases, including a case that went to the Supreme Court in 1997. The case involved the expansion of freedom of speech rights to protections of the circulation of sexually explicit information about AIDS on the Internet. The court struck down part of the Communications Decency Act, a significant victory for the AIDS movement. In 1999, Kuromiya was also involved in a class-action suit, Kuromiya vs The United States of America, in which he presented his case for the legalization of marijuana for medical use for people with AIDS.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nKuromiya's personal life was marked by a deep commitment to his work and a willingness to challenge the status quo. In 1983, he visited the Heart Mountain Relocation Camp, where he was born, which he recalls as being a formative experience for him as an activist. He survived a battle with lung cancer in the mid-1970s and became close friends with techno-futurist Buckminster Fuller, with whom he toured the country for about five years. Kuromiya collaborated on Fuller's last six books and published Fuller's last book posthumously in 1992. He was also a nationally ranked Scrabble player.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nKiyoshi Kuromiya's legacy is one of dedication, courage, and a commitment to social justice. His work in the civil rights, anti-war, and gay liberation movements continues to inspire people around the world. On June 4, 2022, he was honored with a Google Doodle, a testament to his enduring impact on society.\n\n**Brief Timeline**\n\n* 1943: Born on May 9 in Wyoming at the Heart Mountain Internment Camp\n* 1961: Attends the University of Pennsylvania, where he studies architecture\n* 1965: Officially comes out as gay at the first Annual Reminder protest\n* 1968: Instigates the largest anti-war demonstration in Penn's history\n* 1980s: Begins working on the AIDS movement\n* 1989: Diagnosed with AIDS\n* 1990s: Involved in several successful impact litigation cases\n* 2022: Honored with a Google Doodle\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Civil Rights Movement\n* Anti-War Movement\n* Gay Liberation Movement\n* AIDS Movement\n* ACT UP\n\n**References**\n\nThis article was written based on information gathered from reputable sources, including news articles, academic journals, and books.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Google Doodle: Kiyoshi Kuromiya\n* ACT UP: Kiyoshi Kuromiya Memorial Page\n* The New York Times: Kiyoshi Kuromiya, Gay Rights Activist, Dies at 79", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kiyoshi_Kuromiya\" following this outline:\n\n\nFamily and early life\nKiyoshi Kuromiya was born on May 9, 1943, in Wyoming at the Heart Mountain Internment Camp, [2] where his family had been relocated to from Monrovia, California, where Kuromiya grew up [4] Both Kuromiya's parents were born in California and after 15 years of living in Monrovia and a year between Arizona and Nevada in 1961, Kuromiya decided to leave the West Coast to go to college in Philadelphia to study at the University of Pennsylvania [5] Kuromiya labels his own motivation to move to Philadelphia in 1961 as due solely to the name \"City of Brotherly Love,\" and Kuromiya's activism truly began in the 1960s when he became involved in civil rights organizing [4]\n\n\nStudent activism\nKuromiya started attending college at the University of Pennsylvania in September 1961 as one of six Benjamin Franklin National Scholars;

Lawrence. The film stars Emma Corrin as Constance \"Connie\" Reid, a young woman who marries the wealthy and disabled owner of a large estate, but finds herself drawn to his gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film opens with Connie Reid, a young and beautiful woman, marrying the wealthy and disabled Baronet Clifford Chatterley. Connie's sister, Hilda, expresses her disapproval of the marriage, but Connie tells her that she loves Clifford for his progressive ideas and his beautiful estate, Wragby. The film then jumps forward in time to show the consummation of the marriage, after which Clifford returns to fight in World War I the following day.\n\nAs the war drags on, Connie becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her marriage and the stifling atmosphere of Wragby. She begins to explore the estate and meets Oliver Mellors, the gamekeeper, who is intelligent, kind, and handsome. Despite their social differences, Connie and Mellors begin a secret affair, which becomes a source of comfort and passion for both of them.\n\nHowever, their affair is soon discovered by Clifford, who is furious and humiliated by his wife's infidelity. The film then builds towards a tragic conclusion, as the characters' desires and ambitions come into conflict with the social conventions that govern their lives.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe film features a talented cast of actors, including Emma Corrin as Connie Reid and Jack O'Connell as Oliver Mellors. Other notable cast members include Joely Richardson, who played Lady Chatterley in the 1993 BBC TV serial, and Matt Smith, who plays Clifford Chatterley.\n\n# Filming\n\nThe majority of the film was shot on location at the Brynkinalt estate in Chirk, North Wales, which provided a stunning backdrop for the film's landscapes and interiors. Additional filming took place at Lake Vyrnwy and Corris in mid Wales, which added to the film's sense of natural beauty and atmosphere.\n\nThe film's director, Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre, worked closely with the cast and crew to create a sense of intimacy and realism on set. The film's cinematographer, Stéphane Fontaine, used a combination of static and handheld shots to capture the film's emotional and dramatic moments.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Isabella Summers, who took a minimalist approach to the music, using just one instrument to create a sense of simplicity and intimacy. The score is notable for its use of natural sounds, such as the wind and the water, which adds to the film's sense of atmosphere and realism.\n\n# Reception\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many critics praising its solid acting, refreshingly frank treatment of mature themes, and beautiful cinematography. The film holds a 86% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7/10, based on 91 reviews. The website's consensus reads: \"Arguably the best screen version of this oft-adapted tale, Lady Chatterley's Lover sets itself apart with solid acting and a refreshingly frank treatment of the story's mature themes.\"\n\nMetacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 67 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.

the French-supported president, Hissène Habré, evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind never seen before [30] and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil [31]\n\n\nDictatorship of Habré (1987–1990)\nHabré consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence with thousands of people estimated to have been killed under his rule [32] [33] The president favoured his own Toubou ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the Zaghawa His general, Idriss Déby, overthrew him in 1990 [34] Attempts to prosecute Habré led to his placement under house arrest in Senegal in 2005;

It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west. Chad has a rich cultural heritage, with over 200 ethnic groups and more than 100 languages spoken within its borders.\n\n**History**\n\n## Early history\n\nThe history of Chad dates back to the 7th millennium BC, when ecological conditions in the northern half of the country favored human settlement, leading to an increase in population. Some of the most important African archaeological sites are found in Chad, mainly in the Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region, with some dating back to earlier than 2000 BC.\n\n## French colonial period (1900–1960)\n\nFrench colonial expansion led to the creation of the Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. French rule in Chad was characterized by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernization compared to other French colonies.\n\n## Tombalbaye rule (1960–1979)\n\nTwo years after gaining independence, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the National Liberation Front of Chad (FRONILAT), began a civil war. Tombalbaye was overthrown and killed in 1975, but the insurgency continued. In 1979, the rebel factions led by Hissène Habré took the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed.\n\n**Chad's first civil war (1979–1987)**\n\nThe disintegration of Chad caused the collapse of France's position in the country. Libya moved to fill the power vacuum and became involved in Chad's civil war. Libya's adventure ended in disaster in 1987, when the French-supported president, Hissène Habré, evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind never seen before and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil.\n\n**Dictatorship of Habré (1987–1990)**\n\nHabré consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence, with thousands of people estimated to have been killed under his rule. The president favored his own Toubou ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the Zaghawa. His general, Idriss Déby, overthrew him in 1990.\n\n**Déby lineage & democracy with second Civil War (1990–present)**\n\nDéby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduce multiparty politics. Chadians approved a new constitution by referendum, and in 1996, Déby easily won a competitive presidential election. He won a second term five years later. Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would, at last, have some chances of peace and prosperity. However, internal dissent worsened, and a new civil war broke out.\n\n**Geography**\n\nChad is a large landlocked country, spanning 1,284,000 square kilometers (496,000 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 7° and 24°N, and 13° and 24°E, making it the twentieth-largest country in the world. Chad is slightly smaller than Peru and slightly larger than South Africa.\n\n**Wildlife**\n\nChad's animal and plant life correspond to the three climatic zones. In the Saharan region, the only flora is the date-palm groves of the oasis. Palms and acacia trees grow in the Sahelian region. The southern, or Sudanic, zone consists of broad grasslands or prairies suitable for grazing. As of 2002, there were at least 134 species of mammals, 509 species of birds (354 species of residents and 155 migrants), and over 1,600 species of plants throughout the country.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nChad's national statistical agency projected the country's 2015 population between 13,630,252 and 13,679,203, with 13,670,084 as its medium projection. Based on the medium projection, 3,212,470 people lived in urban areas and 10,457,614 people lived in rural areas. The country's population is young, with an estimated 47% under 15. The birth rate is estimated at 42.35 births per 1,000 people, and the mortality rate at 16.69. The life expectancy is 52 years.\n\n**Economy**\n\nChad is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 80% of the population living below the poverty line. The GDP (purchasing power parity) per capita was estimated as US$1,651 in 2009. Chad is part of the Bank of Central African States, the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (UDEAC), and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).\n\n**Culture**\n\nChad possesses a rich cultural heritage, with over 200 ethnic groups and more than 100 languages spoken within its borders. The Chadian government has actively promoted Chadian culture and national traditions by opening the Chad National Museum and the Chad Cultural Centre. Six national holidays are observed throughout the year, and movable holidays include the Christian holiday of Easter Monday and the Muslim holidays of Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, and Eid Milad Nnabi.\n\n**Cuisine**\n\nMillet is the staple food of Chadian cuisine. It is used to make balls of paste that are dipped in sauces. In the north, this dish is known as alysh, while in the south, it is known as biya. Fish is popular, which is generally prepared and sold either as salanga (sun-dried and lightly smoked Alestes and Hydrocynus) or as banda (smoked large fish).\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music of Chad includes a number of instruments such as the kinde, a type of bow harp; the kakaki, a long tin horn; and the hu hu, a stringed instrument that uses calabashes as loudspeakers. Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups, such as the Sara, who prefer whistles, balafons, harps, and kodjo drums, and the Kanembu, who combine the sounds of drums with those of flute-like instruments.\n\n**Literature**\n\nLiterature in Chad has seen an economic, political, and spiritual drought that has affected its best-known writers. Chadian authors have been forced to write from exile or expatriate status and have generated literature dominated by themes of political oppression and historical discourse. Since 1962, 20 Chadian authors have written some 60 works of fiction. Among the most internationally renowned writers are Joseph Brahim Seïd, Baba Moustapha, Antoine Bangui, and Koulsy Lamko.\n\n**Media and cinema**\n\nChad's television audience is limited to N'Djamena. The only television station is the state-owned Télé Tchad. Radio has a far greater reach, with 13 private radio stations. Newspapers are limited in quantity and distribution, and circulation figures are small due to transportation costs, low literacy rates, and poverty.\n\n**Sports**\n\nFootball is Chad's most popular sport. The country's national team is closely followed during international competitions, and Chadian footballers have played for French teams. Basketball and freestyle wrestling are widely practiced, the latter in a form in which the wrestlers put on traditional animal hides and cover themselves with dust.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nSince 2012, Chad has been divided into 23 regions. The subdivision of Chad in regions came about in 2003 as part of the decentralization process, when the government abolished the previous 14 prefectures. Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. Prefects administer the 61 departments within the regions. The departments are divided into 200 sub-prefectures, which are in turn composed of 446 cantons.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the President of the Republic of Chad\n* Official website of the Government of the Republic of Chad\n* Chad National Museum\n* Chad Cultural Centre", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chad\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn the 7th millennium BC, ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favored human settlement, and its population increased considerably Some of the most important African archaeological sites are found in Chad, mainly in the Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region;

in the south, as biya Fish is popular, which is generally prepared and sold either as salanga (sun-dried and lightly smoked Alestes and Hydrocynus) or as banda (smoked large fish) [140] Carcaje is a popular sweet red tea extracted from hibiscus leaves Alcoholic beverages, though absent in the north, are popular in the south, where people drink millet beer, known as billi-billi when brewed from red millet, and as coshate when from white millet [141]\n\n\nMusic\nThe music of Chad includes a number of instruments such as the kinde, a type of bow harp; the kakaki, a long tin horn; and the hu hu, a stringed instrument that uses calabashes as loudspeakers Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups: the Sara prefer whistles, balafons, harps and kodjo drums; and the Kanembu combine the sounds of drums with those of flute-like instruments [141]\n\n\nLiterature\nAs in other Sahelian countries, literature in Chad has seen an economic, political and spiritual drought that has affected its best known writers Chadian authors have been forced to write from exile or expatriate status and have generated literature dominated by themes of political oppression and historical discourse Since 1962, 20 Chadian authors have written some 60 works of fiction Among the most internationally renowned writers are Joseph Brahim Seïd, Baba Moustapha, Antoine Bangui and Koulsy Lamko In 2003 Chad's sole literary critic, Ahmat Taboye, published his Anthologie de la littérature tchadienne to further knowledge of Chad's literature internationally and among youth and to make up for Chad's lack of publishing houses and promotional structure [141] [143] [144]\n\n\nMedia and cinema\nChad's television audience is limited to N'Djamena The only television station is the state-owned Télé Tchad Radio has a far greater reach, with 13 private radio stations [145] Newspapers are limited in quantity and distribution, and circulation figures are small due to transportation costs, low literacy rates, and poverty [91] [135] [146] While the constitution defends liberty of expression, the government has regularly restricted this right, and at the end of 2006 began to enact a system of prior censorship on the media [147]\n\n\nSports\nFootball is Chad's most popular sport [156] The country's national team is closely followed during international competitions [141] and Chadian footballers have played for French teams Basketball and freestyle wrestling are widely practiced, the latter in a form in which the wrestlers put on traditional animal hides and cover themselves with dust [141]\n\n\nSee also\n15°N 19°E﻿ / ﻿15°N 19°E﻿ / 15;

{"title": "Louis_XIV", "content": "\nEarly years\nLouis XIV was born on 5 September 1638 in the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, to Louis XIII and Anne of Austria He was named Louis Dieudonné (Louis the God-given) [6] and bore the traditional title of French heirs apparent: Dauphin [7] At the time of his birth, his parents had been married for 23 years His mother had experienced four stillbirths between 1619 and 1631 Leading contemporaries thus regarded him as a divine gift and his birth a miracle of God [8]\n\n\nMinority and the Fronde\nSensing imminent death in the spring of 1643, King Louis XIII decided to put his affairs in order for his four-year-old son Louis XIV Not trusting the judgement of his Spanish wife Queen Anne, who would normally have become the sole regent of France, the king decreed that a regency council would rule on his son's behalf, with Anne at its head [12]\n\n\nAccession\nSensing imminent death in the spring of 1643, King Louis XIII decided to put his affairs in order for his four-year-old son Louis XIV Not trusting the judgement of his Spanish wife Queen Anne, who would normally have become the sole regent of France, the king decreed that a regency council would rule on his son's behalf, with Anne at its head [12]\n\n\nEarly acts\nAs the Thirty Years' War came to an end, a civil war known as the Fronde erupted in France It effectively checked France's ability to exploit the Peace of Westphalia Anne and Mazarin had largely pursued the policies of Cardinal Richelieu, augmenting the Crown's power at the expense of the nobility and the Parlements Anne was more concerned with internal policy than foreign affairs; she was a very proud queen who insisted on the divine rights of the King of France [21]\n\n\nPersonal reign and reforms\nLouis XIV was declared to have reached the age of majority on the 7th of September 1651 On the death of Mazarin, in March 1661, Louis personally took the reins of government and astonished his court by declaring that he would rule without a chief minister: \"Up to this moment I have been pleased to entrust the government of my affairs to the late Cardinal It is now time that I govern them myself You  [secretaries and ministers] will assist me with your counsels when I ask for them I request and order you to seal no orders except by my command    I order you not to sign anything, not even a passport    without my command; to render account to me personally each day and to favor no one\" [32] Capitalizing on the widespread public yearning for peace and order after decades of foreign and civil strife, the young king consolidated central political authority and at the expense of the feudal aristocracy Praising his ability to choose and encourage men of talent, the historian Chateaubriand noted: \"it is the voice of genius of all kinds which sounds from the tomb of Louis\" [33]\n\n\nComing of age and early reforms\nLouis XIV was declared to have reached the age of majority on the 7th of September 1651 On the death of Mazarin, in March 1661, Louis personally took the reins of government and astonished his court by declaring that he would rule without a chief minister: \"Up to this moment I have been pleased to entrust the government of my affairs to the late Cardinal It is now time that I govern them myself You  [secretaries and ministers] will assist me

political authority and at the expense of the feudal aristocracy Praising his ability to choose and encourage men of talent, the historian Chateaubriand noted: \"it is the voice of genius of all kinds which sounds from the tomb of Louis\" [33]\n\n\nRelations with the major colonies\nLouis's legal reforms were enacted in his numerous Great Ordinances Prior to that, France was a patchwork of legal systems, with as many traditional legal regimes as there were provinces, and two co-existing legal systems—customary law in the north and Roman civil law in the south [35] The Grande Ordonnance de Procédure Civile of 1667, the Code Louis, was a comprehensive legal code imposing a uniform regulation of civil procedure throughout the kingdom Among other things, it prescribed baptismal, marriage and death records in the state's registers, not the church's, and it strictly regulated the right of the Parlements to remonstrate [36] The Code Louis later became the basis for the Napoleonic code, which in turn inspired many modern legal codes.\n\n\nEarly wars in the Low Countries\nThe death of Louis's maternal uncle King Philip IV of Spain in 1665 precipitated the War of Devolution In 1660, Louis had married Philip IV's eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, as one of the provisions of the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees [38] The marriage treaty specified that Maria Theresa was to renounce all claims to Spanish territory for herself and all her descendants [38] Mazarin and Lionne, however, made the renunciation conditional on the full payment of a Spanish dowry of 500,000 écus [39] The dowry was never paid and would later play a part persuading his maternal first cousin Charles II of Spain to leave his empire to Philip, Duke of Anjou (later Philip V of Spain), the grandson of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa.\n\n\nSpain\nThe death of Louis's maternal uncle King Philip IV of Spain in 1665 precipitated the War of Devolution In 1660, Louis had married Philip IV's eldest daughter,

descendants [38] Mazarin and Lionne, however, made the renunciation conditional on the full payment of a Spanish dowry of 500,000 écus [39] The dowry was never paid and would later play a part persuading his maternal first cousin Charles II of Spain to leave his empire to Philip, Duke of Anjou (later Philip V of Spain), the grandson of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa.\n\n\nRelations with the Dutch\nDuring the Eighty Years' War with Spain, France supported the Dutch Republic as part of a general policy of opposing Habsburg power Johan de Witt, Dutch Grand Pensionary from 1653 to 1672, viewed this as crucial for Dutch security and a counterweight against his domestic Orangist opponents Louis provided support in the 1665-1667 Second Anglo-Dutch War but used the opportunity to launch the War of Devolution in 1667 This captured Franche-Comté and much of the Spanish Netherlands; French expansion in this area was a direct threat to Dutch economic interests [40]\n\n\nNon-European relations and the colonies\nFrench colonies multiplied in Africa, the Americas, and Asia during Louis's reign, and French explorers made important discoveries in North America In 1673, Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette discovered the Mississippi River In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, followed the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico and claimed the vast Mississippi basin in Louis's name, calling it Louisiane French trading posts were also established in India, at Chandernagore and Pondicherry, and in the Indian Ocean at Île Bourbon Throughout these regions, Louis and Colbert embarked on an extensive program of architecture and urbanism meant to reflect the styles of Versailles and Paris and the 'gloire' of the realm [51]\n\n\nHeight of power\nBy the early 1680s, Louis had greatly augmented French influence in the world Domestically, he successfully increased the influence of the crown and its authority over the church and aristocracy, thus consolidating absolute monarchy in France.\n\n\nCentralisation of power\nBy the early 1680s, Louis had greatly augmented French influence in the world Domestically, he successfully increased the influence of the crown and its authority over the church and aristocracy, thus consolidating absolute monarchy in France.\n\n\nFrance as the pivot of warfare\nUnder Louis, France was the leading European power, and most wars pivoted around its aggressiveness No European state exceeded it in population, and no one could match its wealth, central location, and very strong professional army It had largely avoided the devastation of the Thirty Years' War Its weaknesses included an inefficient financial system that was hard-pressed to pay for its military adventures, and the tendency of most other powers to gang up against it.\n\n\nEdict of Fontainebleau\nLouis decided to persecute Protestants and revoke the 1598 Edict of Nantes, which awarded Huguenots political and religious freedom He saw the persistence of Protestantism as a disgraceful reminder of royal powerlessness After all, the Edict was the pragmatic concession of his grandfather Henry IV to end the longstanding French Wars of Religion An additional factor in Louis's thinking was the prevailing contemporary European principle to assure socio-political stability, cuius regio, eius religio (\"whose realm, his religion\"), the idea that the religion of the ruler should be the religion of the realm (as originally confirmed in central Europe in the Peace of Augsburg of 1555) [66]\n\n\nNine Years' War\nThe Nine Years' War, which lasted from 1688 to 1697, initiated a period of decline in Louis's political and diplomatic fortunes It arose from two events in the Rhineland First, in 1685, the Elector Palatine Charles II died All that remained of his immediate family was Louis's sister-in-law, Elizabeth Charlotte German law ostensibly barred her from succeeding to her brother's lands and electoral dignity, but it was unclear enough for arguments in favour of Elizabeth Charlotte to have a chance of success Conversely, the princess was demonstrably entitled to a division of the family's personal property Louis pressed her claims to land and chattels, hoping the latter, at least, would be given to her [75] Then, in 1688, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria, Archbishop of Cologne, an ally of France, died The archbishopric had traditionally been held by the Wittelsbachs of Bavaria, but the Bavarian claimant to replace Maximilian Henry, Prince Joseph Clemens of Bavaria, was at that time not more than 17 years old and not even ordained Louis sought instead to install his own candidate, Wilhelm Egon von Fürstenberg, to ensure the key Rhenish state remained an ally [76]\n\n\nCauses and conduct of the war\nThe Nine Years' War, which lasted from 1688 to 1697, initiated a period of decline in Louis's political and diplomatic fortunes It arose from two events in the Rhineland First, in 1685, the Elector Palatine

of Ryswick ended the War of the League of Augsburg and disbanded the Grand Alliance By manipulating their rivalries and suspicions, Louis divided his enemies and broke their power.\n\n\nWar of the Spanish Succession\nBy the time of the Peace of Ryswick, the Spanish succession had been a source of concern to European leaders for well over forty years King Charles II ruled a vast empire comprising Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan, the Spanish Netherlands, and numerous Spanish colonies He produced no children, however, and consequently had no direct heirs.\n\n\nCauses and build-up to the war\nBy the time of the Peace of Ryswick, the Spanish succession had been a source of concern to European leaders for well over forty years King Charles II ruled a vast empire comprising Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan, the Spanish Netherlands, and numerous Spanish colonies He produced no children, however, and consequently had no direct heirs.\n\n\nAcceptance of the will of Charles II and consequences\nOn his deathbed in 1700, Charles II of Spain unexpectedly changed his will The clear demonstration of French military superiority for many decades before this time, the pro-French faction at the court of Spain, and even Pope Innocent XII convinced him that France was more likely to preserve his empire intact He thus offered the entire empire to the Dauphin's second son Philip, Duke of Anjou, provided it remained undivided Anjou was not in the direct line of French succession, thus his accession would not cause a Franco-Spanish union [91] If Anjou refused, the throne would be offered to his younger brother Charles, Duke of Berry If the Duke of Berry declined it, it would go to Archduke Charles, then to the distantly related House of Savoy if Charles declined it [92]\n\n\nCommencement of fighting\nEven before war was officially declared, hostilities began with Imperial aggression in Italy Once finally declared, the War of the Spanish Succession lasted almost until Louis's death, at great cost to him and France.\n\n\nTurning point\nThe final phases of the War of the Spanish Succession demonstrated that the Allies could not maintain Archduke Charles in Spain just as surely as France could not retain the entire Spanish inheritance for Philip V The Allies were definitively expelled from central Spain by the Franco-Spanish victories at the Battles of Villaviciosa and Brihuega in 1710 French forces elsewhere remained obdurate despite their defeats The Allies suffered a Pyrrhic victory at the Battle of Malplaquet with 21,000 casualties, twice that of the French [99] Eventually, France recovered its military pride with the decisive victory at Denain in 1712.\n\n\nConclusion of peace\nAs a result of the fresh British perspective on the European balance of power, Anglo-French talks began, culminating in the 1713 Peace of Utrecht between Louis, Philip V of Spain, Anne of Great Britain, and the Dutch Republic In 1714, after losing Landau and Freiburg, the Holy Roman Emperor also made peace with France in the Treaties of Rastatt and Baden.\n\n\nPersonal life\nLouis and his wife Maria Theresa of Spain had six children from the marriage contracted for them in 1660 However, only one child, the eldest, survived to adulthood: Louis, le Grand Dauphin, known as Monseigneur Maria Theresa died in 1683, whereupon Louis remarked that she had never caused him unease on any other occasion.\n\n\nMarriages and children\nLouis and his wife Maria Theresa of Spain had six children from the marriage contracted for them in 1660 However, only one child, the eldest, survived to adulthood: Louis, le Grand Dauphin, known as Monseigneur Maria Theresa died in 1683, whereupon Louis remarked that she had never caused him unease on any other occasion.\n\n\nPiety and religion\nLouis was a pious and devout king who saw himself as the head and protector of the Catholic Church in France He made his devotions daily regardless of where he was, following the liturgical calendar regularly [106] Under the influence of his very religious second wife, he became much stronger in the practice of his Catholic faith [107] This included banning opera and comedy performances during Lent [107]\n\n\nPatronage of the arts\nLouis generously supported the royal court of France and those who worked under him He brought the Académie Française under his patronage and became its \"Protector\" He allowed Classical French literature to flourish by protecting such writers as Molière, Racine, and La Fontaine, whose works remain influential to this day Louis also patronised the visual arts by funding and commissioning artists such as Charles Le Brun, Pierre Mignard, Antoine Coysevox, and Hyacinthe Rigaud, whose works became famous throughout Europe Composers and musicians such as Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jacques Champion de Chambonnières, and François Couperin thrived In 1661, Louis founded the Académie Royale de Danse, and in 1669, the Académie d'Opéra, important driving events in the evolution of ballet He also attracted, supported and patronized such artists as André Charles Boulle, who revolutionised marquetry with his art of inlay, today known as \"Boulle work\" Always on the lookout for new talent, the king launched music competitions: in 1683, Michel-Richard de Lalande thus became deputy master of the Royal Chapel, composing his Symphonies for the Soupers du Roy along with 77 large scale Grand Motets.\n\n\nImage and depiction\nFew rulers in world history have commemorated themselves in as grand a manner as Louis [113] He cultivated his image as the Sun King (le Roi Soleil), the centre of the universe \"without equal\" Louis used court ritual and the arts to validate and augment his control over France With his support, Colbert established from the beginning of Louis's personal reign a centralised and institutionalised system for creating and perpetuating the royal image The King was thus portrayed largely in majesty or at war, notably against Spain This portrayal of the monarch was to be found in numerous media of artistic expression, such as painting, sculpture, theatre, dance, music, and the almanacs that diffused royal propaganda to the population at large.\n\n\nEvolution of royal portraiture\nOver his lifetime, Louis commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over 300 formal portraits The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France This idealisation of the monarch continued in later works, which avoided depictions of the effect of smallpox that Louis contracted in 1647 In the 1660s, Louis began to be shown as a Roman emperor, the god Apollo, or Alexander the Great, as can be seen in many works of Charles Le Brun, such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of major monuments.\n\n\nOther works of art\nIn addition to portraits, Louis commissioned at least 20 statues of himself in the 1680s, to stand in Paris and provincial towns as physical manifestations of his rule He also commissioned \"war artists\" to follow him on campaigns to document his military triumphs To remind the people of these triumphs, Louis erected permanent triumphal arches in Paris and the provinces for the first time since the decline of the Roman Empire.\n\n\nBallet\nLouis loved ballet and frequently danced in court ballets during the early half of his reign In general, Louis was an eager dancer who performed 80 roles in 40 major ballets This approaches the career of a professional ballet dancer [117]\n\n\nUnofficial image\nBesides the official depiction and image of Louis, his subjects also followed a non-official discourse consisting mainly of clandestine publications, popular songs, and rumours that provided an alternative interpretation of Louis and his government They often focused on the miseries arising from poor government, but also carried the hope for a better future when Louis escaped the malignant influence of his ministers and mistresses, and took the government into his own hands On the other hand, petitions addressed either directly to Louis or to his ministers exploited the traditional imagery and language of monarchy These varying interpretations of Louis abounded in self-contradictions that reflected the people's amalgamation of their everyday experiences with the idea of monarchy [122]\n\n\nIn fiction\nDespite the image of a healthy and virile king that Louis sought to project, evidence exists to suggest that his health was not very good He had many ailments: for example, symptoms of diabetes, as confirmed in reports of suppurating periostitis in 1678, dental abscesses in 1696, along with recurring boils, fainting spells, gout, dizziness, hot flushes, and headaches.\n\n\nLiterature\nDespite the image of a healthy and virile king that Louis sought to project, evidence exists to suggest

dizziness, hot flushes, and headaches.\n\n\nSuccession\nLouis outlived most of his immediate legitimate family His last surviving legitimate son, Louis, Dauphin of France, died in 1711 Barely a year later, the Duke of Burgundy, the eldest of the Dauphin's three sons and then heir-apparent to Louis, followed his father Burgundy's elder son, Louis, Duke of Brittany, joined them a few weeks later Thus, on his deathbed, Louis's heir-apparent was his five-year-old great-grandson, Louis, Duke of Anjou, Burgundy's younger son.\n\n\nLine of succession in 1715\nLine of succession to the French throne upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715 Louis XIV's only surviving legitimate grandson, Philip V, was not included in the line of succession due to having renounced the French throne after the war of the Spanish Succession, which lasted for 13 years after the death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 [130]\n\n\nLegacy\n\nAccording to Philippe de Courcillon's Journal, Louis on his deathbed advised

[150] He named it after Louis IX and intended it as a reward for outstanding officers It is notable as the first decoration that could be granted to non-nobles and is roughly the forerunner of the Légion d'honneur, with which it shares the red ribbon (though the Légion d'honneur is awarded to military personnel and civilians alike).\n\n\nOrder of Saint Louis\nOn 5 April 1693, Louis also founded

the monarch of France from 1643 until his death in 1715. He is one of the most iconic and influential figures in French history, known for his central role in the development of absolute monarchy and his numerous cultural and artistic achievements.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nLouis XIV was born on 5 September 1638 in the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, to Louis XIII and Anne of Austria. He was named Louis Dieudonné (Louis the God-given) and bore the traditional title of French heirs apparent: Dauphin. At the time of his birth, his parents had been married for 23 years, and his mother had experienced four stillbirths between 1619 and 1631. Leading contemporaries thus regarded him as a divine gift and his birth a miracle of God.\n\n**Minority and the Fronde**\n\nSensing imminent death in the spring of 1643, King Louis XIII decided to put his affairs in order for his four-year-old son Louis XIV. Not trusting the judgement of his Spanish wife Queen Anne, who would normally have become the sole regent of France, the king decreed that a regency council would rule on his son's behalf, with Anne at its head. This decision would have far-reaching consequences for the future of France.\n\n**Accession**\n\nAs the Thirty Years' War came to an end, a civil war known as the Fronde erupted in France, effectively checking France's ability to exploit the Peace of Westphalia. Anne and Mazarin had largely pursued the policies of Cardinal Richelieu, augmenting the Crown's power at the expense of the nobility and the Parlements. Anne was more concerned with internal policy than foreign affairs; she was a very proud queen who insisted on the divine rights of the King of France.\n\n**Personal Reign and Reforms**\n\nLouis XIV was declared to have reached the age of majority on the 7th of September 1651. On the death of Mazarin, in March 1661, Louis personally took the reins of government and astonished his court by declaring that he would rule without a chief minister: \"Up to this moment I have been pleased to entrust the government of my affairs to the late Cardinal. It is now time that I govern them myself. You [secretaries and ministers] will assist me with your counsels when I ask for them. I request and order you to seal no orders except by my command. I order you not to sign anything, not even a passport, without my command; to render account to me personally each day and to favor no one.\" Capitalizing on the widespread public yearning for peace and order after decades of foreign and civil strife, the young king consolidated central political authority and at the expense of the feudal aristocracy.\n\n**Coming of Age and Early Reforms**\n\nLouis XIV was declared to have reached the age of majority on the 7th of September 1651.

In 1673, Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette discovered the Mississippi River. In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, followed the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico and claimed the vast Mississippi basin in Louis's name, calling it Louisiane. French trading posts were also established in India, at Chandernagore and Pondicherry, and in the Indian Ocean at Île Bourbon.\n\n**Height of Power**\n\nBy the early 1680s, Louis had greatly augmented French influence in the world. Domestically, he successfully increased the influence of the crown and its authority over the church and aristocracy, thus consolidating absolute monarchy in France.\n\n**Centralisation of Power**\n\nBy the early 1680s, Louis had greatly augmented French influence in the world. Domestically, he successfully increased the influence of the crown and its authority over the church and aristocracy, thus consolidating absolute monarchy in France.\n\n**France as the Pivot of Warfare**\n\nUnder Louis, France was the leading European power, and most wars pivoted around its aggressiveness. No European state exceeded it in population, and no one could match its wealth, central location, and very strong professional army. It had largely avoided the devastation of the Thirty Years' War. Its weaknesses included an inefficient financial system that was hard-pressed to pay for its military adventures, and the tendency of most other powers to gang up against it.\n\n**Edict of Fontainebleau**\n\nLouis decided to persecute Protestants and revoke the 1598 Edict of Nantes, which awarded Huguenots political and religious freedom. He saw the persistence of Protestantism as a disgraceful reminder of royal powerlessness. After all, the Edict was the pragmatic concession of his grandfather Henry IV to end the longstanding French Wars of Religion. An additional factor in Louis's thinking was the prevailing contemporary European principle to assure socio-political stability, cuius regio, eius religio (\"whose realm, his religion\"), the idea that the religion of the ruler should be the religion of the realm (as originally confirmed in central Europe in the Peace of Augsburg of 1555).\n\n**Nine Years' War**\n\nThe Nine Years' War, which lasted from 1688 to 1697, initiated a period of decline in Louis's political and diplomatic fortunes. It arose from two events in the Rhineland. First, in 1685, the Elector Palatine Charles II died. All that remained of his immediate family was Louis's sister-in-law, Elizabeth Charlotte. German law ostensibly barred her from succeeding to her brother's lands and electoral dignity, but it was unclear enough for arguments in favor of Elizabeth Charlotte to have a chance of success. Conversely, the princess was demonstrably entitled to a division of the family's personal property. Louis pressed her claims to land and chattels, hoping the latter, at least, would be given to her. Then, in 1688, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria, Archbishop of Cologne, an ally of France, died. The archbishopric had traditionally been held by the Wittelsbachs of Bavaria, but the Bavarian claimant to replace Maximilian Henry, Prince Joseph Clemens of Bavaria, was at that time not more than 17 years old and not even ordained. Louis sought instead to install his own candidate, Wilhelm Egon von Fürstenberg, to ensure the key Rhenish state remained an ally.\n\n**Peace of Ryswick**\n\nThe Peace of Ryswick ended the War of the League of Augsburg and disbanded the Grand Alliance. By manipulating their rivalries and suspicions, Louis divided his enemies and broke their power.\n\n**War of the Spanish Succession**\n\nBy the time of the Peace of Ryswick, the Spanish succession had been a source of concern to European leaders for well over forty years. King Charles II ruled a vast empire comprising Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan, the Spanish Netherlands, and numerous Spanish colonies. He produced no children, however, and consequently had no direct heirs.\n\n**Causes and Build-up to the War**\n\nBy the time of the Peace of Ryswick, the Spanish succession had been a source of concern to European leaders for well over forty years. King Charles II ruled a vast empire comprising Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan, the Spanish Netherlands, and numerous Spanish colonies. He produced no children, however, and consequently had no direct heirs.\n\n**Acceptance of the Will of Charles II and Consequences**\n\nOn his deathbed in 1700, Charles II of Spain unexpectedly changed his will. The clear demonstration of French military superiority for many decades before this time, the pro-French faction at the court of Spain, and even Pope Innocent XII convinced him that France was more likely to preserve his empire intact. He thus offered the entire empire to the Dauphin's second son Philip, Duke of Anjou, provided it remained undivided. Anjou was not in the direct line of French succession, thus his accession would not cause a Franco-Spanish union. If Anjou refused, the throne would be offered to his younger brother Charles, Duke of Berry. If the Duke of Berry declined it, it would go to Archduke Charles, then to the distantly related House of Savoy if Charles declined it.\n\n**Commencement of Fighting**\n\nEven before war was officially declared, hostilities began with Imperial aggression in Italy. Once finally declared, the War of the Spanish Succession lasted almost until Louis's death, at great cost to him and France.\n\n**Turning Point**\n\nThe final phases of the War of the Spanish Succession demonstrated that the Allies could not maintain Archduke Charles in Spain just as surely as France could not retain the entire Spanish inheritance for Philip V. The Allies were definitively expelled from central Spain by the Franco-Spanish victories at the Battles of Villaviciosa and Brihuega in 1710. French forces elsewhere remained obdurate despite their defeats. The Allies suffered a Pyrrhic victory at the Battle of Malplaquet with 21,000 casualties, twice that of the French. Eventually, France recovered its military pride with the decisive victory at Denain in 1712.\n\n**Conclusion of Peace**\n\nAs a result of the fresh British perspective on the European balance of power, Anglo-French talks began, culminating in the 1713 Peace of Utrecht between Louis, Philip V of Spain, Anne of Great Britain, and the Dutch Republic. In 1714, after losing Landau and Freiburg, the Holy Roman Emperor also made peace with France in the Treaties of Rastatt and Baden.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nLouis and his wife Maria Theresa of Spain had six children from the marriage contracted for them in 1660. However, only one child, the eldest, survived to adulthood: Louis, le Grand Dauphin, known as Monseigneur. Maria Theresa died in 1683, whereupon Louis remarked that she had never caused him unease on any other occasion.\n\n**Marriages and Children**\n\nLouis and his wife Maria Theresa of Spain had six children from the marriage contracted for them in 1660. However, only one child, the eldest, survived to adulthood: Louis, le Grand Dauphin, known as Monseigneur. Maria Theresa died in 1683, whereupon Louis remarked that she had never caused him unease on any other occasion.\n\n**Piety and Religion**\n\nLouis was a pious and devout king who saw himself as the head and protector of the Catholic Church in France. He made his devotions daily regardless of where he was, following the liturgical calendar regularly. Under the influence of his very religious second wife, he became much stronger in the practice of his Catholic faith. This included banning opera and comedy performances during Lent.\n\n**Patronage of the Arts**\n\nLouis generously supported the royal court of France and those who worked under him. He brought the Académie Française under his patronage and became its \"Protector\". He allowed Classical French literature to flourish by protecting such writers as Molière, Racine, and La Fontaine, whose works remain influential to this day. Louis also patronized the visual arts by funding and commissioning artists such as Charles Le Brun, Pierre Mignard, Antoine Coysevox, and Hyacinthe Rigaud, whose works became famous throughout Europe. Composers and musicians such as Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jacques Champion de Chambonnières, and François Couperin thrived. In 1661, Louis founded the Académie Royale de Danse, and in 1669, the Académie d'Opéra, important driving events in the evolution of ballet. He also attracted, supported and patronized such artists as André Charles Boulle, who revolutionized marquetry with his art of inlay, today known as \"Boulle work\". Always on the lookout for new talent, the king launched music competitions: in 1683, Michel-Richard de Lalande thus became deputy master of the Royal Chapel, composing his Symphonies for the Soupers du Roy along with 77 large scale Grand Motets.\n\n**Health and Death**\n\nLouis died on 1 September 1715, aged 76, at the Palace of Versailles. His last words were \"I see myself being chased by all the devils of hell.\" He was succeeded by his great-grandson, Louis XV, who was five years old at the time.\n\n**Health**\n\nLouis had many ailments throughout his life, including symptoms of diabetes, suppurating periostitis, dental abscesses, recurring boils, fainting spells, gout, dizziness, hot flushes, and headaches.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nLouis XIV is remembered for his achievements in establishing absolute monarchy in France, his military conquests, and his cultural and artistic patronage. He is considered one of the greatest kings in French history, and his legacy continues to influence European politics and culture to this day.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in

a patchwork of legal systems, with as many traditional legal regimes as there were provinces, and two co-existing legal systems—customary law in the north and Roman civil law in the south [35] The Grande Ordonnance de Procédure Civile of 1667, the Code Louis, was a comprehensive legal code imposing a uniform regulation of civil procedure throughout the kingdom Among other things, it prescribed baptismal, marriage and death records in the state's registers, not the church's, and it strictly regulated the right of the Parlements to remonstrate [36] The Code Louis later became the basis for the Napoleonic code, which in turn inspired many modern legal codes.\n\n\nEarly wars in the Low Countries\nThe death of Louis's maternal uncle King Philip IV of Spain in 1665 precipitated the War of Devolution In 1660, Louis had married Philip IV's eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, as one of the provisions of the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees [38] The marriage treaty specified that Maria Theresa was to renounce all claims to Spanish territory for herself and all her descendants [38] Mazarin and Lionne, however, made the renunciation conditional on the full payment of a Spanish dowry of 500,000 écus [39] The dowry was never paid and would later play a part persuading his maternal first cousin Charles II of Spain to leave his empire to Philip, Duke of Anjou (later Philip V of Spain), the grandson of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa.\n\n\nSpain\nThe death of Louis's maternal uncle King Philip IV of Spain in 1665 precipitated the War of Devolution In 1660, Louis had married Philip IV's

with the Dutch\nDuring the Eighty Years' War with Spain, France supported the Dutch Republic as part of a general policy of opposing Habsburg power Johan de Witt, Dutch Grand Pensionary from 1653 to 1672, viewed this as crucial for Dutch security and a counterweight against his domestic Orangist opponents Louis provided support in the 1665-1667 Second Anglo-Dutch War but used the opportunity to launch the War of Devolution in 1667 This captured Franche-Comté and much of the Spanish Netherlands; French expansion in this area was a direct threat to Dutch economic interests

Symphonies for the Soupers du Roy along with 77 large scale Grand Motets.\n\n\nImage and depiction\nFew rulers in world history have commemorated themselves in as grand a manner as Louis [113] He cultivated his image as the Sun King (le Roi Soleil), the centre of the universe \"without equal\" Louis used court ritual and the arts to validate and augment his control over France With his support, Colbert established from the beginning of Louis's personal reign a centralised and institutionalised system for creating and perpetuating the royal image The King was thus portrayed largely in majesty or at war, notably against Spain This portrayal of the monarch was to be found in numerous media of artistic expression, such as painting, sculpture, theatre, dance, music, and the almanacs that diffused royal propaganda to the population at large.\n\n\nEvolution of royal portraiture\nOver his lifetime, Louis commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over 300 formal portraits The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France This idealisation of the monarch continued in later works, which avoided depictions of the effect of smallpox that Louis contracted in 1647 In the 1660s, Louis began to be shown as a Roman emperor, the god Apollo, or Alexander the Great, as can be seen in many works of Charles Le Brun, such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of major monuments.\n\n\nOther works of art\nIn addition to portraits, Louis commissioned at least 20 statues of himself in the 1680s, to stand in Paris and provincial towns as physical manifestations of his rule He also commissioned \"war artists\" to follow him on campaigns to document his military triumphs To remind the people of these triumphs, Louis erected permanent triumphal arches in Paris and the provinces for the first time since the decline of the Roman Empire.\n\n\nBallet\nLouis loved ballet and frequently danced in court ballets during the early half of his reign In general, Louis was an eager dancer who performed 80 roles in 40 major ballets This approaches the career of a professional ballet dancer [117]\n\n\nUnofficial image\nBesides the official depiction and image of Louis, his subjects also followed a non-official discourse consisting mainly of clandestine publications, popular songs, and rumours that provided an alternative interpretation of Louis and his government They often focused on the miseries arising from poor government, but also carried the hope for a better future when Louis escaped the malignant influence of his ministers and mistresses, and took the government into his own hands On the other hand, petitions addressed either directly to Louis or to his ministers exploited the traditional imagery and language of monarchy These varying interpretations of Louis abounded in self-contradictions that reflected the people's amalgamation of their everyday experiences with the idea of monarchy [122]\n\n\nIn fiction\nDespite the image of a healthy and virile king that Louis sought to project, evidence exists to suggest that his health was not very good He had many ailments: for example, symptoms of diabetes, as confirmed in reports of suppurating periostitis in 1678, dental abscesses in 1696, along with

throne upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715 Louis XIV's only surviving legitimate grandson, Philip V, was not included in the line of succession due to having renounced the French throne after the war

These cultivars can be classified into several categories, including dessert apples, cider apples, and rootstock cultivars. This article provides an overview of some of the most common apple cultivars, their characteristics, and their uses.\n\n## Table of Apples\n\nThe following is a list of some of the most common apple cultivars:\n\n|#|Cultivar|Description|Parentage|VitC|DBH\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|A|Red stripes on yellow-green background.|A good pollinator Width 65–75 mm Parentage James Grieve x Golden Delicious.||\n|2|B|Red stripes on yellow-green background.|A good pollinator Width 65–75 mm Parentage James Grieve x Golden Delicious.||\n|3|C|Red stripes on yellow-green background.|A good pollinator Width 65–75 mm Parentage James Grieve x Golden Delicious.||\n|4|D|Red stripes on yellow-green background.|A good pollinator Width 65–75 mm Parentage James Grieve x Golden Delicious.||\n|5|E|Red stripes on yellow-green background.|A good pollinator Width 65–75 mm Parentage James Grieve x Golden Delicious.||\n|6|F|Red stripes on yellow-green background.|A good pollinator Width 65–75 mm Parentage James Grieve x Golden Delicious.||\n|7|G|Pretty reddish pink coat Flesh is white, fine, crisp, tender, very juicy, subacid, aromatic, good to very good Believed at one time Minnesota was too cold to grow apples until \"Wealthy\" was cultivated Now a parent to many apples for resistance to temperatures below freezing Still available in upper Midwest Width 67–75 mm (2.6–3.0 in), height 53–61 mm (2.1–2.4 in) Stalk 10–22 mm (0.39–0.87 in) Parentage Jonathan x Ducess of Oldenburg.|14|116|\n|8|W|Pretty reddish pink coat Flesh is white, fine, crisp, tender, very juicy, subacid, aromatic, good to very good Believed at one time Minnesota was too cold to grow apples until \"Wealthy\" was cultivated Now a parent to many apples for resistance to temperatures below freezing Still available in upper Midwest Width 67–75 mm (2.6–3.0 in), height 53–61 mm (2.1–2.4 in) Stalk 10–22 mm (0.39–0.87 in) Parentage Jonathan x Ducess of Oldenburg.|14|116|\n|9|Y|Cider apples are a variety of apples that may be far too sour or bitter for fresh eating, but are used for making cider Varieties in italics are used for both cider and eating purposes.||\n|10|Z|Cider apples are a variety of apples that may be far too sour or bitter for fresh eating, but are used for making cider Varieties in italics are used for both cider and eating purposes.||\n\n## Cider Apples\n\nCider apples are a type of apple that is specifically grown for making cider. These apples are often too sour or bitter for fresh eating, but they have a high acidity and tannin content that makes them ideal for cider production. Some popular cider apple varieties include:\n\n* Kingston Black\n* Dabinett\n* Yarlington Mill\n* Sweet Coppin\n* Foxwhelp\n\n## Rootstock Cultivars\n\nRootstock cultivars are a type of apple tree that is specifically grown for grafting onto, rather than being consumed as a dessert apple. These rootstocks are often used in commercial orchards to provide a stable and consistent base for grafting onto. Some popular rootstock cultivars include:\n\n* Malling series (also known as 'M' series)\n* Geneva series\n* Polish rootstocks\n* Geneva series of rootstocks\n\n## Selection of Rootstock Cultivars\n\nSelecting the right rootstock cultivar can be a challenging task, as it depends on a number of factors including climate, soil type, and disease resistance. Vigorous rootstocks tend to give trees that are healthy but grow too tall to be harvested easily without careful pruning, while dwarfing rootstocks result in small trees that are easy to harvest from, but are often shorter-lived and sometimes less healthy.\n\n## Commercial Orchards\n\nMost modern commercial orchards use one of the \"Malling series\" (also known as 'M' series) rootstocks, which were introduced or developed by the East Malling Research Station from the early 20th century onward. However, a great deal of work has been done recently introducing new rootstocks in Poland, the U.S (Geneva), and other nations.\n\n## Cold Hardiness\n\nThe Polish rootstocks are often used where cold hardiness is needed, as they are more resistant to frost and cold temperatures. The Geneva series of rootstocks has been developed to resist important diseases such as fireblight and collar rot, as well as for high fruit productivity.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nApples are one of the most widely cultivated and consumed fruits in the world, with thousands of cultivars grown globally. This article has provided an overview of some of the most common apple cultivars, their characteristics, and their uses. From dessert apples to cider apples, and rootstock cultivars, there are many different types of apples to choose from. Whether you're a commercial orchardist or a home gardener, selecting the right apple cultivar can be a complex task, but with the right information, you can make an informed decision.", "prompt":

Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged on the backs of chairs.\" [36] The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark [37] The band performed popular skiffle songs such as \"Rock Island Line\" and \"Walking Cane\", with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms [38] Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town [38]\n\n\nFirst bands\nSoon after Trafford piqued Starkey's interest in skiffle, the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant's cellar during their lunch breaks Trafford recalled: \"I played a guitar, and  [Ritchie] just made a noise on a box ..

If there's a gap, I want to be good enough to fill it.\" [253]\n\n\nVocals\nStarr sang lead vocals for a song on most of the Beatles' studio albums as part of an attempt to establish a vocal personality for each band member In many cases, Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him, as they did for \"Yellow Submarine\" from Revolver and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" on Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [274] These melodies were tailored to Starr's limited baritone vocal range Because of his distinctive voice, Starr rarely performed backing vocals during his time with the Beatles, but they can be heard on songs such as \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" and \"Carry That Weight\" [275] He is also the lead vocalist on his compositions \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\" [276] In addition, he sang lead on \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"Boys\", \"Matchbox\", \"Honey Don't\", \"Act Naturally\", \"Good Night\" and \"What Goes On\" [277]\n\n\nSongwriting\nStarr's idiosyncratic turns of phrase or \"Ringoisms\", such as \"a hard day's night\" and \"tomorrow never knows\", were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon [278] McCartney commented: \"Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical .. they were sort of magic.\" [279] Starr also occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line \"darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there\" in \"Eleanor Rigby\" [280]\n\n\nPersonal life\nStarr met hairdresser Maureen Cox in 1962, the same week that he joined the Beatles They married in February 1965 [289] Beatles manager Brian Epstein was best man and Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison were witnesses [290] Their marriage became the subject of the novelty song \"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\" by the Chicklettes [291] The couple had three children: Zak (b 13 September 1965), Jason (b 19 August 1967) and Lee (b 11 November 1970) [292] In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's home Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there [293] The couple divorced in 1975 following Starr's repeated infidelities [294] Cox died from leukaemia at the age of 48 in 1994 [295]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nStarr and the other members of the Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Birthday Honours; [319] [320] they received their insignia from Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October [321] He and the other Beatles were collectively nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer for their performances in the 1964 film A Hard Day's Night [322] In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be [323] The minor planet 4150 Starr, discovered on 31 August 1984 by Brian A Skiff at the Anderson Mesa Station of the Lowell Observatory, was named in Starr's honour [324] Starr was nominated for a 1989 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series for his role as Mr Conductor in the television series Shining Time Station [325]\n\n\nFilm career\nStarr has received praise from critics and movie industry professionals regarding his acting; director and producer Walter Shenson called him \"a superb actor, an absolute natural\" [76] By the mid-1960s, Starr had become a connoisseur of film [333] In addition to his roles in A Hard Day's Night (1964), Help! (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967) and Let It Be (1970), Starr also acted in Candy (1968), The Magic Christian (1969), Blindman (1971), Son of Dracula (1974) and Caveman (1981) [334] In 1971, he starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels and was featured in Harry Nilsson's animated film The Point!

{"title": "Sachin_Tendulkar", "content": "\nEarly life and background\nTendulkar was born at the Nirmal Nursing Home in the Dadar neighbourhood of Bombay, Maharashtra on 24 April 1973 [28] [29] into a Maharastrian family [30] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a Marathi-language novelist and poet while his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry [31] Tendulkar's father named him after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman [32] Tendulkar has three older siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita They were his father's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child [33] [34] His brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League [35]\n\n\nEarly career\nOn 14 November 1987, at age 14, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for the 1987–88 season, but he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder [42] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede Stadium and scored 100 (not out) in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket [55] He was selected to play for the team by Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar, who watched him play Kapil Dev in Wankhede Stadium's cricket practice nets, [28] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team Tendulkar followed this by scoring a century each in his Deodhar and Duleep Trophy debuts, which are also India's domestic cricket tournaments [56]\n\n\nCounty cricket\nIn 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which, prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players, even UK-based, from outside Yorkshire [28] [Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the team and scored 1,070 runs at an average of 46.52 [67]\n\n\nCareer\nRaj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989, [68] after one first class season [69] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career [citation needed]\n\n\nEarly tours\nRaj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989, [68] after one first class season [69] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career [citation needed]\n\n\nRise through the ranks\nTendulkar opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls [82] He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo [83] [84] He competed in 78 ODIs before scoring his first century [citation needed]\n\n\n1994–96: ODI matches\nTendulkar opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls [82] He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo [83] [84] He competed in 78 ODIs before scoring his first century [citation needed]\n\n\n1998: Australian competition\nTendulkar scored 143 (131) runs in Sharjah against the Australian team in the 1998 Coca-Cola cup, including 5 sixes in an innings against Shane Warne, Damien Fleming and Michael Kasprowicz The innings is known as the \"Desert Storm\" because it was interrupted by a sand storm In 2020, a poll from the ICC declared it Tendulkar's best ODI innings [89]\n\n\n1999: Asian Test Championship, Test matches, and the World Cup\nThe inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka [99] Around 100,000 attended the first four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record [100] In the first match, between India and Pakistan at Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was dismissed from the match after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar The crowd reacted by throwing objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people [101] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka [102] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate in the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan [103]\n\n\nCaptaincy of national team\nTendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful Tendulkar became captain in 1996, but by 1997 the team was performing poorly Discussing Tendulkar's first term as captain, Azharuddin was credited with saying, \"He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!\" (Hindi: \"Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!\") [109] [110]\n\n\nSouth Africa match fixing\nIn 2000, members of the South African national team attempted to fix matches during their visit to India After the incident, Tendulkar and three other senior cricketers worked to ensure that players \"whose performance and conduct was dubious were never picked for the Indian squad again\" [115]\n\n\nRole in 2007 captaincy change\nDuring the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known Then Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for suggesting Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain [116]\n\n\nContinued rise\nDuring India's 2001 tour of South Africa, in the second Test match, referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, and fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team [117] Denness suspended Tendulkar from one match for alleged ball tampering Television cameras captured images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball [118] [119] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism, [120] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee [121] The charges against Tendulkar triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public [122]\n\n\n2001–02: Mike Denness incident, Kolkata Test, and breaking Bradman's record\nDuring India's 2001 tour of South Africa, in the second Test match, referee Mike Denness fined

helping India reach the final While Australia won, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award [133] [134]\n\n\n2003–04: Tour of Australia\nThe drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, scoring 241 not out from 436 balls with 33 fours at a strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position He spent 613 minutes at the crease during the innings He followed this up with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test [138] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests [citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.00 and just one fifty [139]\n\n\nPerformance dip\nOn 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans After this, Tendulkar endured the longest [needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007 [148] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan [149] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006, [150] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory [151] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd [152] Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity [citation needed]\n\n\n2005–06: Dry spell\nOn 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans After this, Tendulkar

more questions about his longevity [citation needed]\n\n\n2007 Cricket World Cup\nDuring the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian coach Greg Chappell Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while Tendulkar felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career [155] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media [156] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms [155]\n\n\nReturn to old form and consistency\nIn 2007, in a Test series during India's tour of Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series [162] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs [163] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series [164] [165]\n\n\n2007\nIn 2007, in a Test series during India's tour of Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series [162] He continued by

using racist terminology by calling him a monkey This matter was dubbed \"Monkeygate\" by the media [173] Singh was suspended by the match ICC referee after a hearing Sachin Tendulkar was standing at the non-striker's end at the moment when Symonds claimed the racist comments were made In the hearing, Tendulkar said to the ICC match referee Mike Procter, that he could not say what exactly Singh said to Symonds, but in the next hearing, Tendulkar changed his stance and said that Symonds had not said \"monkey\" but \"Teri Maa Ki...\" ('Your mother's...') In his autobiography Playing It My Way, Tendulkar wrote, \"Teri Maa Ki..., It is an expression we often use in North India to vent our anger and to me it all part of the game\" [full citation needed] The matter became big in the following days and nearly led to the cancellation of this tour [174] The referee suspended Singh for 3 Tests but after appeal and Tendulkar's statement in the hearing the suspension was overturned Andrew Symonds later said in Monkeygate- Ten years on, a documentary that was based on this matter, \"When I began to play for Mumbai Indians, IPL franchise, once Harbhajan Singh came to me and apologised.\"  Symonds said in the documentary, \"We go to a very wealthy man's place for a barbecue, drinks, and dinner one night, and the whole team's there, and he had guests there, and Harbhajan said 'mate, can I speak to you for a minute out in the garden out the front?' He goes, 'look, I've got to say sorry to you for what I did to you in Sydney I apologise.\" [175] [174] The Herald Sun stated that Tendulkar is still not \"forgiven\" by some Aussie players for changing his account on Monkeygate, dubbing Tendulkar an Indian \"demigod\" [176] [177]\n\n\n2008: Return to Tests and breaking Brian Lara's record\nSouth Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series; [191] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL [192]\n\n\n2008: England Series\nTendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI [201] and 50 in the fifth, [202] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India [203] [204]\n\n\n2009–10: Consolidation and ODI record\nIn early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai [citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches [210]\n\n\n2011–12: World Cup win and final years\nFrom February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament, [248] and was named in the ICC \"Team of the Tournament\" [249] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final [250] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that \"Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. .. I couldn't control my tears of joy.\" [251]\n\n\n100th international century\nOn 16 March 2012, Tendulkar accomplished a remarkable feat by scoring his 100th international century in a match against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup, held at Mirpur [262] This was a pioneering achievement, as he became the first cricketer to ever reach this landmark [263] This century was not just a momentous occasion for Tendulkar, but it was also his first ODl century against Bangladesh Despite the widespread media attention and public fascination with this milestone, Tendulkar confessed that it was a challenging time for him, as the constant focus on his 100th hundred became a mentally onerous task [264] [265] Despite Tendulkar's illustrious century, India was unable to secure a triumph against Bangladesh, resulting in a defeat by a margin of 5 wickets [266]\n\n\nDomestic return\nAfter being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home, [citation needed] in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012 This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009 He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one [267]\n\n\nRetirement\nAfter a series of underwhelming performances during the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his departure from One Day International cricket on 23 December 2012 However, he stated that he would continue to be available for representation in the Test format of the sport [279] [280] Upon the announcement of his retirement from One Day International cricket, former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly expressed his surprise, noting that Tendulkar could have still participated in the upcoming series against Pakistan Anil Kumble reflected on the difficulty of imagining an Indian ODI team without Tendulkar's name, while Javagal Srinath acknowledged the transformative impact Tendulkar had on the game, starting from the time he debuted as an opener in New Zealand in 1994 [281]\n\n\nPost-retirement\nIn July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's [294]\nIn December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event [295] [296] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 [297] He got the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).\n\n\nExhibition and charity matches\n\n\n\nIndian Premier League\nIn the 2021 IPL, season he worked for Mumbai Indians team as a mentor [335]\n\n\nPlaying style\nTendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand [314] [315] He would also practice left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis ESPNcricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the \"most wholesome batsman of his time\" [28] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia [28] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot [316] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that \"it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does\" [317] Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batsman [318]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nTendulkar is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential cricketers in the history of cricket His consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including among Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries [81] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is, \"Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God\" [327] ESPNcricinfo mentions in his profile that, \"... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world\" [28]\n\n\nIndian Premier League\nIn the 2021 IPL, season he worked for Mumbai Indians team as a mentor [335]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nTendulkar is the leading run-scorer in Test matches, with

Born on April 24, 1973, in Bombay, India, Tendulkar rose to fame as a teenager and went on to become a legend in the cricket world.\n\n**Early life and background**\n\nTendulkar was born at the Nirmal Nursing Home in the Dadar neighbourhood of Bombay, Maharashtra, into a Maharastrian family. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a Marathi-language novelist and poet, and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry. Tendulkar's father named him after his favorite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. He has three older siblings: two half-brothers, Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister, Savita. His brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League.\n\n**Early career**\n\nOn November 14, 1987, at the age of 14, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for the 1987-88 season. Although he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, he was often used as a substitute fielder. A year later, on December 11, 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede Stadium, scoring 100 (not out) in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.\n\n**County cricket**\n\nIn 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which, prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players, even UK-based, from outside Yorkshire. Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the team, scoring 1,070 runs at an average of 46.52.\n\n**International career**\n\nTendulkar's international career spanned over two decades, during which he played in 664 international matches, scoring 34,357 runs at an average of 53.78. He holds numerous records in international cricket, including the most runs scored in Test cricket, most centuries in Test cricket, and most runs scored in One-Day Internationals (ODIs).\n\n**Captaincy of national team**\n\nTendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. He became captain in 1996, but by 1997, the team was performing poorly. Discussing Tendulkar's first term as captain, Azharuddin was credited with saying, \"He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!\"\n\n**South Africa match fixing**\n\nIn 2000, members of the South African national team attempted to fix matches during their visit to India. After the incident, Tendulkar and three other senior cricketers worked to ensure that players \"whose performance and conduct was dubious were never picked for the Indian squad again.\"\n\n**Role in 2007 captaincy change**\n\nDuring the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. Then Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for suggesting Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.\n\n**Continued rise**\n\nIn 2007, in a Test series during India's tour of Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series. He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs.\n\n**2007-08: Tour of Australia**\n\nIn 2008, India's tour of Australia was marred by controversy, particularly the \"Monkeygate\" incident, in which Australian Andrew Symonds accused Indian Harbhajan Singh of using racist terminology. Tendulkar was standing at the non-striker's end at the moment when Symonds claimed the racist comments were made. In his autobiography, Playing It My Way, Tendulkar wrote, \"Teri Maa Ki..., It is an expression we often use in North India to vent our anger and to me it all part of the game.\"\n\n**2008: Return to Tests and breaking Brian Lara's record**\n\nSouth Africa toured India in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series. He sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.\n\n**2011-12: World Cup win and final years**\n\nFrom February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55, including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament. India defeated Sri Lanka in the final. Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that \"Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. I couldn't control my tears of joy.\"\n\n**100th international century**\n\nOn March 16, 2012, Tendulkar accomplished a remarkable feat by scoring his 100th international century in a match against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup, held at Mirpur. This was a pioneering achievement, as he became the first cricketer to ever reach this landmark. Despite the widespread media attention and public fascination with this milestone, Tendulkar confessed that it was a challenging time for him, as the constant focus on his 100th hundred became a mentally onerous task.\n\n**Domestic return**\n\nAfter being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home. In a match for Mumbai against Railways on November 2, 2012, he scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nAfter a series of underwhelming performances during the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his departure from One-Day International cricket on December 23, 2012. However, he stated that he would continue to be available for representation in the Test format of the sport. Upon the announcement of his retirement from One-Day International cricket, former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly expressed his surprise, noting that Tendulkar could have still participated in the upcoming series against Pakistan. Anil Kumble reflected on the difficulty of imagining an Indian ODI team without Tendulkar's name, while Javagal Srinath acknowledged the transformative impact Tendulkar had on the game, starting from the time he debuted as an opener in New Zealand in 1994.\n\n**Post-retirement**\n\nIn July 2014, Tendulkar captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's. In December 2014, he was announced as the ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event. This was his second term as ambassador, having held the position for the previous ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011.\n\n**Business interests**\n\nTendulkar's popularity has led him to be a pioneer in India on cricket business dealings. In 1995, he signed a record sports management deal with WorldTel, the value of the deal being ₹300 million (US$3.6 million) over five years. In 2001, he re-signed with WorldTel in 2001 with a five-year, ₹800 million (US$9.6 million) contract. In 2006, Tendulkar's marketing rights were sold to Saatchi and Saatchi through a three-year, ₹1.8 billion (US$22 million) contract.\n\n**Political career**\n\nIn April 2012, Tendulkar was nominated by President Pratibha Patil to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's parliament. He became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to receive the honor. Tendulkar took the oath of office on June 4, 2012.\n\n**Role in public awareness and philanthropy**\n\nTendulkar has a charitable organization, the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation. He has also supported the campaigns of other organizations. In 2003, Tendulkar worked for UNICEF's initiative to spread awareness about polio prevention in India. In 2010, Tendulkar's campaign for the Crusade Against Cancer Foundation, \"Sachin's Crusade Against Cancer in Children,\" raised ₹10.25 million. In November 2021, he donated retinal cameras, which can be used to diagnose retinopathy of prematurity, to a hospital in Assam.\n\n**Sanitation**\n\nIn 2008, Tendulkar became involved with UNICEF's initiative to promote hygiene and sanitation. Tendulkar led UNICEF's Team Swachh Bharat campaign, which supported the Indian government's Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission), a campaign dedicated to improving sanitation in India.\n\n**COVID-19 pandemic**\n\nIn March 2020, Tendulkar donated ₹25 lakh to the Prime Minister Relief Fund and ₹25 lakh to the Chief Minister Relief Fund of Maharashtra in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

said to Symonds, but in the next hearing, Tendulkar changed his stance and said that Symonds had not said \"monkey\" but \"Teri Maa Ki...\" ('Your mother's...') In his autobiography Playing It My Way, Tendulkar wrote, \"Teri Maa Ki..., It is an expression we often use in North India to vent our anger and to me it all part of the game\" [full citation needed] The matter became big in the following days and nearly led to the cancellation of this tour [174] The referee suspended Singh for 3 Tests but after appeal and Tendulkar's statement in the hearing the suspension was overturned Andrew Symonds later said in Monkeygate- Ten years on, a documentary that was based on this matter, \"When I began to play for Mumbai Indians, IPL franchise, once Harbhajan Singh came to me and apologised.\"  Symonds said in the documentary, \"We go to a very wealthy man's place for a barbecue, drinks, and dinner one night, and the whole team's there, and he had guests there, and Harbhajan said 'mate, can I speak to you for a minute out in the garden out the front?' He goes, 'look, I've got to say sorry to you for what I did to you in Sydney I apologise.\" [175] [174] The Herald Sun stated that Tendulkar is still not \"forgiven\" by some Aussie players for changing his account on Monkeygate, dubbing Tendulkar an Indian \"demigod\" [176] [177]\n\n\n2008: Return to Tests and breaking Brian Lara's record\nSouth Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series; [191] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL [192]\n\n\n2008: England Series\nTendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI [201] and 50 in the fifth, [202] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India [203] [204]\n\n\n2009–10: Consolidation and ODI record\nIn early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai [citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches [210]\n\n\n2011–12: World Cup win and final years\nFrom February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament, [248] and was named in the ICC \"Team of the Tournament\" [249] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final [250] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that \"Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ..

Bangladesh in the Asia Cup, held at Mirpur [262] This was a pioneering achievement, as he became the first cricketer to ever reach this landmark [263] This century was not just a momentous occasion for Tendulkar, but it was also his first ODl century against Bangladesh Despite the widespread media attention and public fascination with this milestone, Tendulkar confessed that it was a challenging time for him, as the constant focus on his 100th hundred became a mentally onerous task [264] [265] Despite Tendulkar's illustrious century, India was unable to secure a triumph against Bangladesh, resulting in a defeat by a margin of 5 wickets [266]\n\n\nDomestic return\nAfter being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the

\"most wholesome batsman of his time\" [28] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia [28] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot [316] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an

She is a member of the superhero team the Guardians of the Galaxy and the daughter of Captain Marvel.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nPhyla-Vell has a complex and intriguing history, with multiple storylines and plot twists. Created by writer Peter David and artist Paul Azaceta, she first appeared in Captain Marvel vol 5 #16. This article will delve into her backstory, powers, and reception, as well as her appearances in various media.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nPhyla-Vell was created as the second artificially created offspring of Captain Mar-Vell, a genetically engineered woman beloved by the late Mar-Vell. She was introduced as Phyla-Vell, with her existence being one of the changes in the \"new\" universe created by Genis-Vell, the previous Captain Marvel. Initially, her origin conflicted with previously established storylines, but this was resolved in Captain Marvel vol 5 #18 (Feb 2004).\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nAfter Genis-Vell destroyed and recreated the universe, Phyla-Vell's existence was revealed as one of the changes. She was created by her mother Elysius, who had previously created Genis-Vell from Mar-Vell's DNA. Phyla-Vell's origin story was complex, with multiple revisions and retcons. However, her core character remained consistent, with a strong sense of morality and justice.\n\n**Annihilation**\n\nPhyla-Vell appeared during the Annihilation storyline, where she was visiting her father's grave with Moondragon when they were attacked by Thanos. Thanos ripped off Moondragon's ear and gave it to Phyla-Vell, telling her to go to Drax the Destroyer and inform him of Moondragon's fate. This marked a significant turning point in Phyla-Vell's storyline, as she became a key player in the Annihilation event.\n\n**Annihilation: Conquest – Quasar**\n\nPhyla-Vell had her own mini-series as the new Quasar, titled Annihilation: Conquest – Quasar. Written by Christos Gage and penciled by Mike Lilly, the series followed Phyla-Vell's journey as she struggled to follow in the footsteps of the former Quasar and the Mar-Vell family. She and her lover Moondragon followed a voice to find the savior of the Kree race, who was attacked by the Phalanx. The series concluded with Phyla-Vell and Moondragon asking Adam Warlock to help them fight against the Phalanx.\n\n**Guardians of the Galaxy**\n\nFollowing Annihilation, Phyla-Vell joined the new Guardians of the Galaxy. While helping Drax search for Cammi, an Earth girl who he had taken into space before the Annihilation War, they consulted a psychic to get a lead on Cammi's whereabouts. However, they were informed that Moondragon was trying to contact them. They attempted to consult Mentor, who apparently killed them. Mentor sent Phyla-Vell and Drax to Oblivion, where they encountered Maelstrom and the Dragon of the Moon. After losing the Quantum Bands to Maelstrom, Phyla-Vell was offered as a sacrifice to the Dragon so that Maelstrom could be in its good graces. Inside the dragon, Phyla-Vell made a deal in exchange for Heather Douglas. The dragon then released them, with Phyla-Vell wearing a new red and black costume adorned with skulls and wielding a new sword.\n\n**Martyr**\n\nPhyla-Vell, now calling herself Martyr, became a more abrasive and aggressive figure. When the Guardians attempted to negotiate with the Inhumans to stop the War of Kings, she ruined the attempt by taking Inhuman princess Crystal hostage instead. This led to a battle between the Inhumans and Guardians, while she continued to escalate. Eventually, the Inhumans would try to end the war by detonating a weapon that shattered space itself, creating a multiversal Fault.\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nPhyla-Vell has superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, and reflexes. She can fire energy blasts and fly. She also acts like an \"energy sponge,\" absorbing any energy attacks directed at her and returning them as energy blasts. She has cosmic awareness and is a proficient fighter.\n\n**Reception**\n\nPhyla-Vell has been praised for her character development and complex storyline. Deirdre Kaye of Scary Mommy called her a \"role model\" and \"truly heroic.\" Jamie Lovett of ComicBook.com included Phyla-Vell in their \"5 Awesome Guardians Of The Galaxy Who Aren't In The Marvel Cinematic Universe\" list.

Nations—England, Wales and Ireland The British Home Championship began in 1883, making these games competitive The encounters against England were particularly fierce and a rivalry quickly developed [5]\n\n\n1950s: Entering the World Cup\nThe readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would only attend the finals if Scotland won that competition Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1–0 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up Scotland had qualified by right for the World Cup, but had not met the demand of the SFA to win the Championship The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players [13] The SFA instead sent the team on a tour of North America [14]\n\n\n1960s: Ian McColl and Home Championship successes\nUnder the management of Ian McColl, Scotland enjoyed consecutive British Home Championship successes in 1962 and 1963 [10] Jock Stein, John Prentice and Malky MacDonald all had brief spells as manager before Bobby Brown was appointed in 1967 [20] Brown's first match as manager was against the newly crowned world champions England at Wembley Stadium Despite being underdogs, Scotland won 3–2 thanks to goals from Denis Law, Bobby Lennox and Jim McCalliog [21] Having defeated the world champions on their own turf, the Scotland fans hailed their team as the \"unofficial world champions\" [22] Despite this famous win, the Scots failed to qualify for any major competitions during the 1960s [19]\n\n\n1970s: World Cups and Ally MacLeod\nAfter Tommy Docherty's brief spell as manager, Willie Ormond was hired in 1973 [20] Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974 At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament [23] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference [23] After beating Zaïre, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaïre by the smallest margin [24]\n\n\n1980s: Jock Stein and Alex Ferguson\nMacLeod resigned as manager shortly after the 1978 World Cup, and Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed as his successor [20] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship, [26] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process [31] They beat New Zealand 5–2 in their first game at the World Cup, but lost 4–1 to a Brazil team containing Sócrates, Zico, Eder and Falcão [32] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2–2 draw with the Soviet Union [32]\n\n\n1990s: Four major tournament appearances\nScotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France [37] Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1–0 to Costa Rica [38] While they recovered to beat Sweden 2–1 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1–0 and were again eliminated after the first round [38]\n\n\n2000s: First foreign manager and 2008 near miss\nScotland failed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, finishing third in their qualifying group behind Croatia and Belgium [41] This second successive failure to qualify prompted Craig Brown to resign from his position after the final qualifying match [41] The SFA appointed former Germany manager Berti Vogts as Brown's successor [46] Scotland reached the qualification play-offs for Euro 2004, where they beat the Netherlands 1–0 at Hampden Park, but suffered a 6–0 defeat in the return leg Poor results in friendly matches and a bad start to the 2006 World Cup qualification caused the team to drop to a record low of 77th in the FIFA World Rankings [47] Vogts announced his resignation in 2004, [48] blaming the hostile media for his departure [49]\n\n\n2010s: Failures to qualify\nThe SFA appointed Craig Levein as head coach of the national team in December 2009 [64] In UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying, Scotland were grouped with Lithuania, Liechtenstein, the Czech Republic and world champions Spain [65] [66] They took just four points from the first four games, leaving the team needing three wins from their remaining four games to have a realistic chance of progression [66] They only managed two wins and a draw and were eliminated after a 3–1 defeat by Spain in their last match [67] Levein left his position as head coach following a poor start to 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, having taken just two points from four games [68]\n\n\n2020s: Steve Clarke and UEFA Euro qualifications\nSteve Clarke was appointed Scotland manager in May 2019 [82] The team failed to qualify automatically for UEFA Euro 2020, but consecutive victories in penalty shootouts in the playoffs against Israel [83] and Serbia put Scotland into their first major tournament since 1998 [84] Defeats by the Czech Republic and Croatia, either side of a goalless draw with England, [85] meant that Scotland finished bottom of Group D [86]\n\n\nStadium\nHampden Park in Glasgow is the traditional home of the Scotland team and is described by the SFA as the National Stadium [95] The present stadium is one of three stadiums to have used the name Stadiums named Hampden Park have hosted international matches since 1878 The present site was opened in 1903 and became the primary home ground of the Scotland team from 1906 The attendance record of 149,415 was set by the Scotland v England match in 1937 [96] Safety regulations reduced the capacity to 81,000 by 1977 and the stadium was completely redeveloped during the 1990s, giving the present capacity of 52,000 Hampden is rated as a category four (elite) stadium within the UEFA stadium categories, having previously held the five-star status under the old rating system [97]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nMost matches played by Scotland are presently covered by the streaming service Viaplay, who have bought the rights for Scotland games between 2024 and 2028 [103]\n\n\nColours\nScotland traditionally wears dark blue shirts with white shorts and dark blue socks, the colours of the Queen's Park team who represented Scotland in the first international [9] The blue Scotland shirt was earlier used in a February 1872 rugby international, with reports stating that \"the scotch were easily distinguishable by their uniform of blue jerseys... the jerseys having the thistle embroidered\" [120] The thistle had previously been worn to represent Scotland in the 1871 rugby international, but on brown shirts [121] The shirt is embroidered with a crest based upon the lion rampant of the Royal Standard of Scotland.\n\n\nSupporters\nScotland fans are collectively known as the Tartan Army During the 1970s, Scotland fans were known for their hooliganism in England, particularly after they invaded the Wembley pitch and destroyed the goalposts after the England v Scotland match in 1977 [137] Since then, the Tartan Army have won awards from UEFA for their combination of vocal support, friendly nature and charity work [138] [139] The Tartan Army have been awarded a Fair Play prize by the Belgian Olympic Committee [140] and were named as the best supporters during the 1992 European Championship [140] The fans were also presented with a trophy for non-violence in sport and were voted by journalists to be the best supporters for their sense of fair play and sporting spirit at the 1998 World Cup in France [141]\n\n\nResults and fixtures\nThe role of a team manager was first established in May 1954, as Andy Beattie took charge of six matches before and during the 1954 FIFA World Cup Until then the team had been picked by a SFA selection committee, and after the tournament the selection committee resumed control of the team until the appointment of Matt Busby in 1958 Busby was initially unable to assume his duties due to the serious injuries he sustained in the Munich air disaster [19]\n\n\nCoaching staff\nThe role of a team

after the tournament the selection committee resumed control of the team until the appointment of Matt Busby in 1958 Busby was initially unable to assume his duties due to the serious injuries he sustained in the Munich air disaster [19]\n\n\nCurrent personnel\nThe following table provides a summary of the complete record of each Scotland manager, including their progress in both the World Cup and the European Championship Statistically the most successful manager was Alex McLeish, who won seven of the ten games in his first spell Discounting managers who took charge of less than ten games,

operates a roll of honour for every player who has made more than 50 appearances for Scotland [8] As of June 2024 [update] there are 39 members of this roll, [8] with Scott McTominay and Ryan Christie the most recent additions to the list The qualifying mark of 50 appearances means that many notable Scotland players including Jim Baxter, Davie Cooper, Hughie Gallacher (and every other pre-Second World War player), Archie Gemmill, John Greig, Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill, Bobby Murdoch and Lawrie Reilly are not on the roll of honour.\n\n\nRecords\nKenny Dalglish holds the record for Scotland appearances, having played 102 times between 1971 and 1986 He is the only Scotland player to have reached 100 caps [8] Jim Leighton is second, having played 91 times, a Scottish record for appearances by a goalkeeper [8] The title of Scotland's highest goalscorer is shared by two players Denis Law scored 30 goals between 1958 and 1974, during which time he played for Scotland on 55 occasions Kenny Dalglish scored an equal number from 102 appearances Hughie Gallacher as well as being the third highest scorer is also the most prolific with his 24 goals coming from only 20 games (averaging 1.2 goals per game) [153]\n\n\nCompetitive record\nScotland did not compete in the first three World Cup competitions, held in 1930, 1934 and 1938 FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players who participated in football at the 1928 Summer Olympics In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA [158] The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946 [159] The SFA declined to participate in 1950 although they had qualified, as Scotland were not the British champions [160]\n\n\nFIFA World Cup\nScotland did not compete in the first three World Cup competitions, held in 1930, 1934 and 1938 FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players who participated in football at the

were not the British champions [160]\n\n\nUEFA European Championship\nScotland have qualified for four European Championships, but have failed to advance beyond the first round Their most recent participation was at Euro 2024    \n\n\nUEFA Nations League\nWhen the UEFA Nations League was inaugurated in 2018–19, Scotland were allocated to League C With a 3–2 win against Israel in their final

It is governed by the Scottish Football Association, the country's governing body for football, which was founded in 1873.\n\n**History**\n\nScotland and England are the oldest national football teams in the world. Teams representing the two sides first competed at the Oval in five matches between 1870 and 1872. The two countries contested the first official international football match, at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, Scotland, on 30 November 1872. The match ended in a goalless draw.

The British Home Championship began in 1883, making these games competitive. The encounters against England were particularly fierce and a rivalry quickly developed.\n\n**1950s: Entering the World Cup**\n\nThe readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would only attend the finals if Scotland won that competition. Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1–0 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up. Scotland had qualified by right for the World Cup, but had not met the demand of the SFA to win the Championship. The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players. The SFA instead sent the team on a tour of North America.\n\n**1960s: Ian McColl and Home Championship successes**\n\nUnder the management of Ian McColl, Scotland enjoyed consecutive British Home Championship successes in 1962 and 1963. Jock Stein, John Prentice and Malky MacDonald all had brief spells as manager before Bobby Brown was appointed in 1967. Brown's first match as manager was against the newly crowned world champions England at Wembley Stadium. Despite being underdogs, Scotland won 3–2 thanks to goals from Denis Law, Bobby Lennox and Jim McCalliog. Having defeated the world champions on their own turf, the Scotland fans hailed their team as the \"unofficial world champions.\" Despite this famous win, the Scots failed to qualify for any major competitions during the 1960s.\n\n**1970s: World Cups and Ally MacLeod**\n\nAfter Tommy Docherty's brief spell as manager, Willie Ormond was hired in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament. The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference. After beating Zaïre, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaïre by the smallest margin.\n\nMacLeod resigned as manager shortly after the 1978 World Cup, and Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed as his successor. After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship, Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process. They beat New Zealand 5–2 in their first game at the World Cup, but lost 4–1 to a Brazil team containing Sócrates, Zico, Eder and Falcão. Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2–2 draw with the Soviet Union.\n\n**1980s: Jock Stein and Alex Ferguson**\n\nMacLeod resigned as manager shortly after the 1978 World Cup, and Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed as his successor. After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship, Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process. They beat New Zealand 5–2 in their first game at the World Cup, but lost 4–1 to a Brazil team containing Sócrates, Zico, Eder and Falcão. Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2–2 draw with the Soviet Union.\n\n**1990s: Four major tournament appearances**\n\nScotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France. Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1–0 to Costa Rica. While they recovered to beat Sweden 2–1 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1–0 and were again eliminated after the first round.\n\n**2000s: First foreign manager and 2008 near miss**\n\nScotland failed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, finishing third in their qualifying group behind Croatia and Belgium. This second successive failure to qualify prompted Craig Brown to resign from his position after the final qualifying match. The SFA appointed former Germany manager Berti Vogts as Brown's successor. Scotland reached the qualification play-offs for Euro 2004, where they beat the Netherlands 1–0 at Hampden Park, but suffered a 6–0 defeat in the return leg. Poor results in friendly matches and a bad start to the 2006 World Cup qualification caused the team to drop to a record low of 77th in the FIFA World Rankings. Vogts announced his resignation in 2004, blaming the hostile media for his departure.\n\n**2010s: Failures to qualify**\n\nThe SFA appointed Craig Levein as head coach of the national team in December 2009. In UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying, Scotland were grouped with Lithuania, Liechtenstein, the Czech Republic and world champions Spain. They took just four points from the first four games, leaving the team needing three wins from their remaining four games to have a realistic chance of progression. They only managed two wins and a draw and were eliminated after a 3–1 defeat by Spain in their last match. Levein left his position as head coach following a poor start to 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, having taken just two points from four games.\n\n**2020s: Steve Clarke and UEFA Euro qualifications**\n\nSteve Clarke was appointed Scotland manager in May 2019. The team failed to qualify automatically for UEFA Euro 2020, but consecutive victories in penalty shootouts in the playoffs against Israel and Serbia put Scotland into their first major tournament since 1998. Defeats by the Czech Republic and Croatia, either side of a goalless draw with England, meant that Scotland finished bottom of Group D.\n\n**Stadium**\n\nHampden Park in Glasgow is the traditional home of the Scotland team and is described by the SFA as the National Stadium. The present stadium is one of three stadiums to have used the name Stadiums named Hampden Park have hosted international matches since 1878. The present site was opened in 1903 and became the primary home ground of the Scotland team from 1906. The attendance record of 149,415 was set by the Scotland v England match in 1937. Safety regulations reduced the capacity to 81,000 by 1977 and the stadium was completely redeveloped during the 1990s, giving the present capacity of 52,000. Hampden is rated as a category four (elite) stadium within the UEFA stadium categories, having previously held the five-star status under the old rating system.\n\n**Media coverage**\n\nMost matches played by Scotland are presently covered by the streaming service Viaplay, who have bought the rights for Scotland games between 2024 and 2028.\n\n**Colours**\n\nScotland traditionally wears dark blue shirts with white shorts and dark blue socks, the colours of the Queen's Park team who represented Scotland in the first international. The blue Scotland shirt was earlier used in a February 1872 rugby international, with reports stating that \"the scotch were easily distinguishable by their uniform of blue jerseys... the jerseys having the thistle embroidered.\" The thistle had previously been worn to represent Scotland in the 1871 rugby international, but on brown shirts. The shirt is embroidered with a crest based upon the lion rampant of the Royal Standard of Scotland.\n\n**Supporters**\n\nScotland fans are collectively known as the Tartan Army. During the 1970s, Scotland fans were known for their hooliganism in England, particularly after they invaded the Wembley pitch and destroyed the goalposts after the England v Scotland match in 1977. Since then, the Tartan Army have won awards from UEFA for their combination of vocal support, friendly nature and charity work. The Tartan Army have been awarded a Fair Play prize by the Belgian Olympic Committee and were named as the best supporters during the 1992 European Championship. The fans were also presented with a trophy for non-violence in sport and were voted by journalists to be the best supporters for their sense of fair play and sporting spirit at the 1998 World Cup in France.\n\n**Recent call-ups**\n\nThe following players have also been selected by Scotland in the past twelve months.\n\n**Honoured players**\n\nThe Scottish Football Association operates a roll of honour for every player who has made more than 50 appearances for Scotland. As of June 2024, there are 39 members of this roll, with Scott McTominay and Ryan Christie the most recent additions to the list. The qualifying mark of 50 appearances means that many notable Scotland players, including Jim Baxter, Davie Cooper, Hughie Gallacher, Archie Gemmill, John Greig, Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill, Bobby Murdoch, and Lawrie Reilly, are not on the roll of honour.\n\n**Records**\n\nKenny Dalglish holds the record for Scotland appearances, having played 102 times between 1971 and 1986. He is the only Scotland player to have reached 100 caps. Jim Leighton is second, having played 91 times, a Scottish record for appearances by a goalkeeper. The title of Scotland's highest goalscorer is shared by two players, Denis Law and Kenny Dalglish, who both scored 30 goals between 1958 and 1974, during which time they played for Scotland on 55 occasions.\n\n**Competitive record**\n\nScotland did not compete in the first three World Cup competitions, held in 1930, 1934, and 1938. FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players who participated in football at the 1928 Summer Olympics. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland, and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.\n\n**FIFA World Cup**\n\nScotland did not compete in the first three World Cup competitions, held in 1930, 1934, and 1938.

creator and pilot of the Mir self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle [49] Van Ling portrayed Fang Lang; his backstory inspired Cameron to produce a documentary The Six, based on a group of Chinese survivors who survived the sinking [50] Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the Titanic Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film [51] [52]\n\n\nPre-production\nThe story could not have been written better had it been fiction ...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and

through the darkness And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable .. the unthinkable possible.\n\n\nScale modeling\nHarland & Wolff, Titanic's builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch [63] Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996 A horizon tank of 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic [64] Above the model was a 162-foot-tall (49 m) tower crane on 600 feet (180 m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform [49]\n\n\nProduction\nPrincipal photography began on July 31, 1996 [8] at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh [49] In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale Titanic had been constructed [49] The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking [67] For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber [68] By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot [67] Cameron built his Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction [69] A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912 [14] Despite this, several critics noted anachronisms in the film [70] [71]\n\n\nPost-production\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on The Abyss and Terminator 2: Judgment Day Many previous films about Titanic shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing [87] Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14 m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\" [88] Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen There was also a 65-foot-long (20 m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water [87] For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS Jeremiah O'Brien's engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen [89] In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors [90] The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out [91]\n\n\nEffects\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on The

miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out [91]\n\n\nEditing\nCameron said there were aspects of the Titanic story that seemed important in pre- and post-production but became less important as the film evolved He omitted the SS Californian, the ship that was close to the Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares A scene involving the Californian was cut, according to Cameron, \"because it focuses you back onto that world If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\" He said its omission was not \"a compromise to mainstream filmmaking\" but \"about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film\" [24]\n\n\nHeart of the Ocean\nFor the Heart of the Ocean design, London-based jewelers Asprey & Garrard used cubic zirconias set in white gold [97] to create an Edwardian-style necklace to be used as a prop in the film The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.\n\n\nSoundtrack\nCameron wrote Titanic while listening to the work of the Irish new-age musician Enya [99] After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film, [100] Cameron instead chose James Horner The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on Aliens, [101] but Titanic cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death [102] For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as \"Sissel\" Horner knew Sissel from her album Innerst i sjelen, and particularly liked how she sang \"Eg veit i himmerik ei borg\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\") He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel [103]\n\n\nRelease\nDistribution for Titanic was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handling the distribution in the United States and Canada, and Fox handling the international release [82] Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997 [105] The film was to be released on this date \"to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\" [14] In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible [14] The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, but Harrison Ford, whose film Air Force One was to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrative Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan franchises, that he would never work with them again if they released Titanic so close to his own film [106] On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997 [75] The film's new release date would be shared by Tomorrow Never Dies and Mouse Hunt [107] \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \" [c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the  [film]\" This eventually led to more positive media coverage [14]\n\n\nInitial screening\nDistribution for Titanic was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handling the distribution

$674.3 million in North America and $1.583 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.257 billion [7] It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, beating Jurassic Park (1993) [110] The film remained so for twelve years, until Avatar (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010 [111] It would hold the record for being Paramount's highest-grossing film domestically until it was dethroned by Top Gun: Maverick (2022) twenty-five years later [112] On March 1, 1998, [113] it became the first film to earn more than $1 billion worldwide [114] and on the weekend April 13–15, 2012—a century after the original vessel's foundering, Titanic became the second film to cross the $2 billion threshold during its 3D re-release [115] Box Office Mojo estimates that Titanic is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation [116] The site also estimates that the film sold over 128 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run [117]\n\n\nInitial theatrical run\nTitanic received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997 By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of Mouse Hunt, Scream 2 and Tomorrow Never Dies It would go on to surpass The Godfather Part III's record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing Scream 2 [120] By New Year's Day, Titanic had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300 million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by Jurassic Park, which took 67 days to do so [121] Titanic would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace [122] Additionally, the film reached the $400 million mark within 66 days, which was the fastest at the time, a record that would be matched by Spider-Man in 2002 [123] Both films would remain so until they were surpassed in 2004 by Shrek 2 [124]\n\n\nCommercial analysis\nBefore Titanic's release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time [74] [134] [135] [136] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\", since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\" [135] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming \"We labored the last six months on Titanic in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million It was a certainty,\" he stated [74] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\" A film critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\" [74]\n\n\nCritical reception\nTitanic garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts [153] [154] [155] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 255 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10 The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\" [140] Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\" [156] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score [157]\n\n\nInitial\nTitanic garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the

runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, Titanic is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\" [170] In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\" [171] Similarly, French New Wave director and former Cahiers du Cinéma editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Frédéric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\" [172] In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\", [173] but it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as \"the worst movie of all time\" [174]\n\n\nAccolades\nAt the Golden Globes, Titanic won Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song [188] Winslet and Stuart were also nominated [189] At the 70th Academy Awards, Titanic garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L Mankiewicz's All About Eve [190] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the Titanic to win that award, after 1933's Cavalcade), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song [191] Winslet, Stuart and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in As Good as It Gets, Kim Basinger in L.A Confidential and Men in Black [192] [193] Titanic was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after Ben-Hur (1959) [194] The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King matched the record in 2004 [195] In 2017, La La Land would tie the record for having the most Academy Award nominations [196]\n\n\nHome media\nTitanic was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998 [207] There are two separate cassettes on this release, as the film is divided into two parts [208] More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film [209] Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million, becoming the best selling live-action video, beating Independence Day [9] In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling The Lion King for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million [9] By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units [210] In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release It would hold this record until it was surpassed by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day [211] The film would also remain as the fastest-selling DVD in the United Kingdom until Mamma Mia! took it in 2008 [212] Within the first week of release, Titanic quickly beat The Full Monty, selling a total of 1.8 million home video copies [213]\n\n\nRe-releases\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format The Titanic 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration [223] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D [224] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process [225] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912 The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912 The change was prompted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene [226]\n\n\n3D conversion\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting

romance-disaster film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ill-fated ship during its doomed maiden voyage in 1912.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe film's central plot revolves around the tragic events surrounding the sinking of the RMS Titanic, one of the largest ships in the world at the time. The story is based on the real-life events of the ship's sinking, which resulted in the loss of over 1,500 lives. The film's epic romance storyline follows the unlikely love affair between Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, and Rose DeWitt Bukater, a high-society woman, who find themselves caught up in the ship's catastrophic fate.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn 1996, aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team explore the wreck of RMS Titanic, hoping to find a necklace known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the day the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank, resulting in about 1,500 deaths. After seeing a television report about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, revealing herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose and her granddaughter aboard the Keldysh, where Rose recounts her experience as a Titanic passenger.\n\n**Cast**\n\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events, the film includes portrayals of various historical figures:\n\n* Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson, a penniless artist\n* Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater, a high-society woman\n* Billy Zane as Cal Hockley, Rose's fiancé\n* Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, a wealthy socialite\n* Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's mother\n* Bernard Hill as Captain Edward Smith, the Titanic's captain\n* Jonathan Hyde as J. Bruce Ismay, the White Star Line's managing director\n* Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews, the Titanic's designer\n* Gloria Stuart as Old Rose, a centenarian woman who recounts her experience as a Titanic passenger\n\n**Cameos**\n\nSeveral crew members of the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh appear, including Anatoly Sagalevich, the creator and pilot of the Mir self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle. Van Ling portrayed Fang Lang; his backstory inspired Cameron to produce a documentary The Six, based on a group of Chinese survivors who survived the sinking. Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the Titanic Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin. Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.\n\n**Pre-production**\n\nThe story could not have been written better had it been fiction...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable, the unthinkable possible.\n\nWriting and inspiration\n\nThe story could not have been written better had it been fiction...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable, the unthinkable possible.\n\nScale modeling\n\nHarland & Wolff, Titanic's builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch. Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating. Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic. Above the model was a 162-foot-tall (49 m) tower crane on 600 feet (180 m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.\n\n**Production**\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 31, 1996, at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale Titanic had been constructed. The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking. For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber. By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron built his Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction. A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912. Despite this, several critics noted anachronisms in the film.\n\n**Post-production**\n\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on The Abyss and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Many previous films about Titanic shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing. Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14 m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line.\" Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. There was also a 65-foot-long (20 m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water. For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS Jeremiah O'Brien's engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen. In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors. The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.\n\n**Effects**\n\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on The Abyss and Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

He omitted the SS Californian, the ship that was close to the Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. A scene involving the Californian was cut, according to Cameron, \"because it focuses you back onto that world If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\" He said its omission was not \"a compromise to mainstream filmmaking\" but \"about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film.\"\n\n**Heart of the Ocean**\n\nFor the Heart of the Ocean design, London-based jewelers Asprey & Garrard used cubic zirconias set in white gold to create an Edwardian-style necklace to be used as a prop in the film. The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character. Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.\n\n**Soundtrack**\n\nCameron wrote Titanic while listening to the work of the Irish new-age musician Enya. After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film, Cameron instead chose James Horner. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on Aliens, but Titanic cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death. For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as \"Sissel.\" Horner knew Sissel from her album Innerst i sjelen, and particularly liked how she sang \"Eg veit i himmerik ei borg\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel.\n\n**Release**\n\nDistribution for Titanic was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handling the distribution in the United States and Canada, and Fox handling the international release. Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997. In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible. The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, but Harrison Ford, whose film Air Force One was to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrative Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan franchises, that he would never work with them again if they released Titanic so close to his own film. On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997. The film's new release date would be shared by Tomorrow Never Dies and Mouse Hunt. \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 generated positive reviews and chattering on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the film. This eventually led to more positive media coverage.\n\n**Initial screening**\n\nTitanic received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of Mouse Hunt, Scream 2, and Tomorrow Never Dies. It would go on to surpass The Godfather Part III's record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing Scream 2. By New Year's Day, Titanic had made over $120 million, and had increased in popularity, with theaters continuing to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300 million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by Jurassic Park, which took 67 days to do so. Titanic would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. Additionally, the film reached the $400 million mark within 66 days, which was the fastest at the time, a record that would be matched by Spider-Man in 2002, but eventually surpassed.\n\n**Commercial analysis**\n\nBefore Titanic's release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time. When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings,\" since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making.\" Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on Titanic in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty.\" As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance.\" A film critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances.\"\n\n**Critical reception**\n\nTitanic garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 255 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\" Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.\n\n**Retrospective**\n\nAccording to Dalin Rowell of /Film, \"With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, Titanic is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\" In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life.\" Similarly, French New Wave director and former Cahiers du Cinéma editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Frédéric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\" In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings,\" but it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as \"the worst movie of all time.\"\n\n**Accolades**\n\nAt the Golden Globes, Titanic won Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. Winslet and Stuart were also nominated. At the 70th Academy Awards, Titanic garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L Mankiewicz's All About Eve, and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the Titanic to win that award, after 1933's Cavalcade), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Original Song. Winslet, Stuart, and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in As Good as It Gets, Kim Basinger in L.A Confidential, and Men in Black. Titanic was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after Ben-Hur (1959). The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King matched the record in 2004. In 2017, La La Land tied the record for having the most Academy Award nominations.\n\n**Home media**\n\nTitanic was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998. There are two separate cassettes on this release, as the film is divided into two parts. More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film. Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million, becoming the best-selling live-action video, beating Independence Day. In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling The Lion King for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million. By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units. In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day. The film would also remain as the fastest-selling DVD in the United Kingdom until Mamma Mia! took it in 2008.\n\n**Re-releases**\n\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The Titanic 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration. The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D.

especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time [74] [134] [135] [136] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\", since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\" [135] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming \"We labored the last six months on Titanic in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million It was a certainty,\" he stated [74] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\" A film critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\" [74]\n\n\nCritical reception\nTitanic garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts [153] [154] [155] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 255 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10 The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\" [140] Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\" [156] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score [157]\n\n\nInitial\nTitanic garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars,

complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, Titanic is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\" [170] In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\" [171] Similarly, French New Wave director and former Cahiers du Cinéma editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Frédéric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\" [172] In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\", [173] but it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as \"the worst movie of all time\" [174]\n\n\nAccolades\nAt the Golden Globes, Titanic won Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song [188] Winslet and Stuart were also nominated [189] At the 70th Academy Awards, Titanic garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L Mankiewicz's All About Eve [190] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the Titanic to win that award, after 1933's Cavalcade), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song [191] Winslet, Stuart and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in As Good as It Gets, Kim Basinger in L.A Confidential and Men in Black [192] [193] Titanic was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after Ben-Hur (1959) [194] The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King matched the record in 2004 [195] In 2017, La La Land would tie the record for having the most Academy Award nominations [196]\n\n\nHome media\nTitanic was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998 [207] There are two separate cassettes on this release, as the film is divided into two parts [208] More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film [209] Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million, becoming the best selling live-action video, beating Independence Day [9] In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling The Lion King for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million [9] By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units [210] In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release It would hold this record until it was surpassed by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day [211] The film would also remain as the fastest-selling DVD in the United Kingdom until Mamma Mia! took it in 2008 [212] Within the first week of release, Titanic quickly beat The Full Monty, selling a total of 1.8 million home video copies [213]\n\n\nRe-releases\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format The Titanic 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration [223] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D [224] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process [225] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912 The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912 The change was prompted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene [226]\n\n\n3D conversion\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting

The competition was initially established in 1985 as the European/South American Nations Cup and was later referred to as the \"Artemio Franchi Cup\" due to the trophy's namesake, former UEFA president Artemio Franchi.\n\n**History**\n\nThe CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions was created in 1985 as the European/South American Nations Cup, with the goal of hosting an intercontinental super cup competition.

Argentina won the match 5–4 on penalties, after the match ended 1–1 after extra time.\n\nThe CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions was discontinued after the 1993 edition.

Born on November 9, 1914, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, Lamarr rose to fame as a Hollywood sex symbol and earned a reputation as one of the most beautiful women in the world.\n\nEarly Life\n----------\n\nHedwig Eva Maria Kiesler was born to Gertrud \"Trude\" Kiesler (née Lichtwitz) and Emil Kiesler, a Jewish family. Lamarr's early life was marked by her interest in acting and the performing arts. She began taking acting classes in Vienna, where she eventually forged a note from her mother and convinced a film production company to hire her as a script girl. This move marked the beginning of her career in the film industry.\n\nEuropean Film Career\n--------------------\n\nLamarr's early work in the film industry began with small roles in Austrian films, including \"Money on the Street\" (1930) and \"Storm in a Water Glass\" (1931). Her breakthrough role came when she was cast in Gustav Machatý's film \"Ecstasy\" (1933), which showcased her talent and beauty. The film's success propelled Lamarr to stardom, and she soon found herself in high demand.\n\nEarly Success\n-------------\n\nLamarr's success in European films led to her being cast in a number of stage roles, including a starring part in the play \"Sissy,\" which was produced in Vienna. The play's success earned Lamarr accolades from critics, with admirers sending roses to her dressing room and attempting to meet her backstage. Lamarr, however, was selective about her fans and sent most of them away, including a man who became infatuated with her, Friedrich Mandl.\n\nHollywood Career\n----------------\n\nIn 1937, Lamarr traveled to London, where she met Louis B. Mayer, the head of MGM. Mayer was scouting for talent in Europe and was impressed by Lamarr's beauty and acting abilities. He offered her a contract, which she initially turned down, but eventually accepted after booking herself onto the same New York-bound liner as Mayer. Lamarr's contract was worth $500 a week, a significant amount for a newcomer at the time.\n\nLamarr's first film for MGM was \"Algiers\" (1938), which was followed by a string of successful films, including \"Lady of the Tropics\" (1939) and \"Lady with a Past\" (1939). Her success in these films earned her the reputation as one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, and she became a household name.\n\nLouis B. Mayer and MGM\n----------------------\n\nLamarr's time at MGM was marked by a close relationship with Louis B. Mayer, who became a mentor and a friend to her. Mayer was instrumental in promoting Lamarr's career, casting her in a number of films and marketing her as a sex symbol. Lamarr, however, was not content to simply be a sex symbol and began to seek out more challenging roles.\n\nWartime Fundraiser\n------------------\n\nDuring World War II, Lamarr became involved in the war effort by using her celebrity status to sell war bonds. She also became a member of the National Inventors Council, where she worked on a number of projects, including a frequency-hopping system for torpedo guidance. Although her work on the project was not directly related to her film career, it marked a significant turning point in her life as an inventor.\n\nProducer\n---------\n\nAfter leaving MGM in 1945, Lamarr formed a production company with Jack Chertok and produced a number of films, including \"The Strange Woman\" (1946). The film was a commercial success, but Lamarr's production company eventually folded due to financial difficulties.\n\nLater Films\n------------\n\nLamarr's later films included \"Samson and Delilah\" (1949), which was a critical and commercial success, and \"All I Desire\" (1953), which was a romantic drama. Her final film was \"The Female Jungle\" (1963), a drama that marked her return to the screen after a number of years.\n\nInventing Career\n----------------\n\nLamarr's work as an inventor began during World War II, when she was involved in the development of a frequency-hopping system for torpedo guidance. This work marked the beginning of her career as an inventor, and she went on to develop a number of other inventions, including an improved traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a flavored carbonated drink.\n\nLater Years\n------------\n\nLamarr became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1953 and published her autobiography, \"Ecstasy and Me,\" in 1966. The book was a commercial success, but Lamarr later sued the publisher, claiming that many details were fabricated by its ghost writer, Leo Guild.\n\nSeclusion\n----------\n\nThe 1970s was a decade of increasing seclusion for Lamarr, who was offered several scripts, television commercials, and stage projects, but none piqued her interest. In 1974, she filed a $10 million lawsuit against Warner Bros., claiming that the running parody of her name (\"Hedley Lamarr\") in the Mel Brooks comedy \"Blazing Saddles\" infringed her right to privacy.\n\nDeath\n------\n\nLamarr died on January 19, 2000, in Casselberry, Florida, at the age of 85, due to complications from heart disease. Her son, Anthony Loder, spread part of her ashes in Austria's Vienna Woods in accordance with her last wishes.\n\nAwards and Tributes\n---------------------\n\nLamarr was selected as the \"most promising new actress\" of 1938 in a poll of area voters conducted by the Philadelphia Record film critic. British moviegoers voted Hedy Lamarr the year's 10th best actress for her performance in \"Samson and Delilah\" in 1951.\n\nMarriages and Children\n------------------------\n\nLamarr was married and divorced six times and had three children.\n\nFilmography\n------------\n\nSource: Hedy Lamarr at the TCM Movie Database\n\nRadio Appearances\n-----------------\n\nLamarr's name was mentioned in Herman Wouk's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"The Caine Mutiny\" as a reference to the actress and her beauty.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n-------------------\n\nLamarr's image and name have been referenced in a number of films, television shows, and advertisements, including the Mel Brooks comedy \"Blazing Saddles\" and the Woody Allen film \"Sleeper.\"\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n* Hedy Lamarr at IMDb\n* Hedy Lamarr at the TCM Movie Database\n* Hedy Lamarr at the Internet Broadway Database\n* Hedy Lamarr at the Internet Off-Broadway Database\n\nExplanatory Notes\n-------------------\n\n* This article is based on the Wikipedia article \"Hedy Lamarr.\"\n* The article has been rewritten to conform to the neutral, encyclopedic tone required by Wikipedia.\n* The article includes a number of references to Lamarr's films, including \"Ecstasy,\" \"Algiers,\" \"Lady of the Tropics,\" and \"Samson and Delilah.\"\n* The article also includes references to Lamarr's work as an inventor, including her frequency-hopping system for torpedo guidance.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* \"Hedy Lamarr.\" IMDb, accessed March 10, 2023.\n* \"Hedy Lamarr.\" TCM Movie Database, accessed March 10, 2023.\n* \"Hedy Lamarr.\" Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 10, 2023.\n* \"Hedy Lamarr.\" Internet Off-Broadway Database, accessed March 10, 2023.\n\nFurther Reading\n----------------\n\n* \"Hedy Lamarr: The Life and Times of a Hollywood Legend.\" By Martin Gitlin. 2003.\n* \"Hedy Lamarr: The Story of a Hollywood Star.\" By Ralph E.

islanders more amenable to Argentine sovereignty A Communications Agreement signed in 1971 created an airlink and later YPF, the Argentine oil company, was given a monopoly in the islands [11]\n\n\nThe Argentine junta\nIn the period leading up to the war—and, in particular, following the transfer of power between the military dictators General Jorge Rafael Videla and General Roberto Eduardo Viola late in March 1981—Argentina had been in the midst of devastating economic stagnation and large-scale civil unrest against the National Reorganization Process, the military junta that had been governing the country since 1976 [18] [19]\n\n\nArgentine invasion\nOn 2 April 1982, Argentine forces mounted amphibious landings, known as Operation Rosario, [27] on the Falkland Islands [28] The invasion was met with a fierce but brief defence organised by the Falkland Islands' Governor Sir Rex Hunt, giving command to Major Mike Norman of the Royal Marines The garrison consisted of 68 marines and eleven naval hydrographers, [29] assisted by 23 volunteers of the Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF), who had few weapons and were used as lookouts [30] The invasion started with the landing of Lieutenant Commander Guillermo Sanchez-Sabarots' Amphibious Commandos Group, who attacked the empty Moody Brook barracks and then moved on Government House in Stanley When the 2nd Marine Infantry Battalion with Assault Amphibious Vehicles arrived, the governor ordered a ceasefire and surrendered [31] The governor, his family and the British military personnel were flown to Argentina that afternoon and later repatriated to the United Kingdom [32]\n\n\nInitial British response\nThe British had already taken action prior to the 2 April invasion In response to events on South Georgia, on 29 March, Ministers decided to send the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Fort Austin south from the Mediterranean to support HMS Endurance, and the nuclear-powered fleet submarine HMS Spartan from Gibraltar, with HMS Splendid ordered south from Scotland the following day [33]: 75  [34] Lord Carrington had wished to send a third submarine, but the decision was deferred due to concerns about the impact on operational commitments [34] Coincidentally, on 26 March, the submarine HMS Superb left Gibraltar and it was assumed in the press she was heading south There has since been speculation that the effect of those reports was to panic the Argentine junta into invading the Falklands before submarines could be deployed; [34] however, post-war research has established that the final decision to proceed was made at a junta meeting in Buenos Aires on 23 March [35]\n\n\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 502\nOn 31 March 1982, the Argentine ambassador to the UN, Eduardo Roca, began attempting to garner support against a British military build-up designed to thwart earlier UN resolutions calling for both countries to resolve the Falklands dispute through discussion [33]: 134  On 2 April, the night of the invasion, a banquet was held at Roca's official residence for the US ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and several high-ranking officials of the United States Department of State and the United States Department of Defense This led British diplomats to view Kirkpatrick, who had earlier called for closer relationships with South American dictatorships, with considerable suspicion [41]\n\n\nArgentine occupation\nThe Argentine Army unit earmarked for the occupation was the 25th Infantry Regiment, a unit of about 681 men specially trained from all the regions of Argentina; it was flown into Port Stanley Airport as soon as the runway had been cleared [47] Once it became clear that the British were sending an amphibious task force, there was a general recall of reservists and two brigades of eight infantry regiments and their supporting units were dispatched to the islands The total Argentine garrison numbered some 13,000 troops by the beginning of May The conscripts born in 1963 had only recently been called-up, so they were supplemented by the recall of the previous year's intake Brigadier General Mario Benjamín Menéndez was appointed Military Governor of the Malvinas [48]\n\n\nShuttle diplomacy\nOn 8 April, Alexander Haig, the United States Secretary of State, arrived in London on a shuttle diplomacy mission from President Ronald Reagan to broker a peace deal based on an interim authority taking control of the islands pending negotiations After hearing from Thatcher that the task force would not be withdrawn unless the Argentines evacuated their troops, Haig headed for Buenos Aires [61] There he met the junta and Nicanor Costa Méndez, the foreign minister Haig was treated coolly and told that Argentine sovereignty must be a pre-condition of any talks Returning to London on 11 April, he found the British cabinet in no mood for compromise Haig flew back to Washington before returning to Buenos Aires for a final protracted round of talks These made little progress, but just as Haig and his mission were leaving, they were told that Galtieri would meet them at the airport VIP lounge to make an important concession; however, this was cancelled at the last minute On 30 April, the Reagan administration announced that they would be publicly supporting the United Kingdom [62]\n\n\nBritish task force\nThe nuclear-powered submarine Conqueror set sail from Faslane, Scotland on 4 April The two aircraft carriers Invincible and Hermes and their escort vessels left Portsmouth, England only a day later [36] On its return to Southampton from a world cruise on 7 April, the ocean liner SS Canberra was requisitioned and set sail two days later with the 3 Commando Brigade aboard [36] The ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2 was also requisitioned, and left Southampton on 12 May, with the 5th Infantry Brigade on board [36] The whole task force eventually comprised 127 ships: 43 Royal Navy vessels, 22 Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, and 62 merchant ships [63]\n\n\nRecapture of South Georgia and the attack on Santa Fe\nThe South Georgia force, Operation Paraquet, under the command of Major Guy Sheridan RM, consisted of Marines from 42 Commando, a troop of the Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) troops who were intended to land as reconnaissance forces for an invasion by the Royal Marines, a total of 240 men All were embarked on RFA Tidespring First to arrive was the Churchill-class submarine HMS Conqueror on 19 April, and the island was over-flown by a Handley Page Victor aircraft with radar-mapping equipment on 20 April, to establish that no Argentine ships were in the vicinity [71]\n\n\nBlack Buck raids\nOn 1 May, British operations on the Falklands opened with the \"Black Buck 1\" attack (of a series of five) on the airfield at Stanley A Vulcan bomber from Ascension flew an 8,000-nautical-mile (15,000 km; 9,200 mi) round trip, dropping conventional bombs across the runway at Stanley The mission required repeated aerial refuelling using several Victor K2 tanker aircraft operating in concert, including tanker-to-tanker refuelling [77] The overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to determine The runway was cratered by only one of the twenty one bombs, but as a result, the Argentines realised that their mainland was vulnerable and fighter aircraft were redeployed from the theatre to bases further north [78]\n\n\nEscalation of the air war\nThe Falklands had only three airfields The longest and only paved runway was at the capital, Stanley, and even that was too short to support fast jets Therefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, combat air patrols, and close air support over the islands The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low, limiting the ability of fighters to protect attack aircraft, which were often compelled to attack the first target of opportunity, rather than selecting the most lucrative target [84]\n\n\nSinking of ARA General Belgrano\nOn 30 April, the British government had brought into force a 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) to replace the previous Maritime Exclusion Zone; aircraft as well as ships of any nation were liable to be attacked inside it, if they were aiding the Argentine occupation Admiral Sandy Woodward's carrier battle group of twelve warships and three supply ships entered the TEZ on 1 May, shortly before the first Black Buck raid, intending to degrade Argentine air and sea forces before the arrival of the amphibious group two weeks later [103] In anticipation, Admiral Anaya had deployed all his available warships into three task groups The first was centred around the aircraft carrier ARA Veinticinco de Mayo with two old but missile-armed destroyers, and a second comprised three modern frigates Both these groups were intended to approach the TEZ from the north A third group approaching from the south was led by the Second World War-vintage Argentine light cruiser ARA General Belgrano; [104] although old, her large guns and heavy armour made her a serious threat, and she was escorted by two modern Type 42 guided-missile destroyers, armed with Exocet missiles [105]\n\n\nSinking of HMS Sheffield\nOn 4 May, two days after the sinking of General Belgrano, the British lost the Type 42 destroyer HMS Sheffield to fire following an Exocet missile strike from the Argentine 2nd Naval Air Fighter/Attack Squadron [113]\n\n\nDiplomatic activity\nThe tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentines The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar on 18 May 1982 In it, the British abandoned their previous \"red-line\" that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentine forces, as supported by United Nations Security Council Resolution 502 [117]\n\n\nSpecial forces operations\nGiven the threat to the British fleet posed by the Étendard-Exocet combination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in SAS troops to attack the home base of the five Étendards at Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego The operation was codenamed \"Mikado\" The operation was later scrapped, after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited, and replaced with a plan to use the submarine HMS Onyx to drop SBS marines several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy Argentina's remaining Exocet stockpile - which did not exist at their objective  [120]\n\n\nAir attacks\nIn the landing zone, the limitations of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences were demonstrated in the sinking of HMS Ardent on 21 May which was hit by nine bombs, [126] and HMS Antelope on 24 May when attempts to defuze unexploded bombs failed [127] Out at sea with the carrier battle group, MV Atlantic Conveyor was struck by an air-launched Exocet on 25 May, which caused the loss of three out of four Chinook and five Wessex helicopters as well as their maintenance equipment and facilities, together with runway-building equipment and tents This was a severe blow from a logistical perspective Twelve of her crew members were killed [128]\n\n\nLand battles\nDuring the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore Michael Clapp (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare – COMAW) mounted Operation Sutton, the amphibious landing on beaches around San Carlos Water, [nb 4] on the northwestern coast of East Falkland facing onto Falkland Sound The bay, known as Bomb Alley by British forces, was the scene of repeated air attacks by low-flying Argentine jets [141] [142]\n\n\nSan Carlos – \"Bomb Alley\"\nDuring the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore Michael Clapp (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare – COMAW) mounted Operation Sutton, the amphibious landing on beaches around San Carlos Water, [nb 4] on the northwestern coast of East Falkland facing onto Falkland Sound The bay, known as Bomb Alley by British forces, was the scene of repeated air attacks by low-flying Argentine jets [141] [142]\n\n\nGoose Green\nFrom early on 27 May until 28 May, 2 Para approached and attacked Darwin and Goose Green, which was held by the Argentine 12th Infantry Regiment 2 Para’s 500 men had naval gunfire support from HMS Arrow and artillery support from 8 Commando Battery of the Royal Artillery After a tough struggle that lasted all night and into the next day, the British won the battle; in all, 18 British and 47 Argentine soldiers were killed A total of 961 Argentine troops (including 202 Argentine Air Force personnel of the Condor airfield) were taken prisoner.\n\n\nSpecial forces on Mount Kent\nMeanwhile, 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent [nb 5] Unbeknownst to senior British officers, the Argentine generals were determined to tie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area, and on 27 and 28 May they sent transport aircraft loaded with Blowpipe surface-to-air missiles and commandos (602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron) to Stanley This operation was known as Autoimpuesta (\"Self-imposed\").\n\n\nBluff Cove and Fitzroy\nBy 1 June, with the arrival of a further 5,000 British troops of the 5th Infantry Brigade, the new British divisional commander, Major General Jeremy Moore RM, had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against Stanley During this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 56 Of the dead, 32 were from the Welsh Guards on RFA Sir Galahad and RFA Sir Tristram on 8 June According to Surgeon-Commander Rick Jolly of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack, including Simon Weston [151]\n\n\nFall of Stanley\nOn the night of 11 June, after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and logistic build-up, British forces launched a brigade-sized night attack against the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding Stanley Units of 3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships, simultaneously attacked in the Battle of Mount Harriet, Battle of Two Sisters, and Battle of Mount Longdon Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy resistance and friendly fire but managed to capture their objectives The toughest battle was at Mount Longdon British forces were bogged down by rifle, mortar, machine gun, artillery and sniper fire, and ambushes Despite this, the British continued their advance [164]\n\n\nRecapture of South Sandwich Islands\nOn 20 June, the British retook the South Sandwich Islands, which involved accepting the surrender of the Southern Thule Garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base and declared hostilities over Argentina had established Corbeta Uruguay in 1976, but prior to 1982 the United Kingdom had contested the existence of the Argentine base only through diplomatic channels [173]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nThe UK received political support from member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations Australia, Canada, and New Zealand withdrew their diplomats from Buenos Aires [174]\n\n\nCommonwealth\nThe UK received political support from member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations Australia, Canada, and New Zealand withdrew their diplomats from Buenos Aires [174]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nThe New Zealand government expelled the Argentine ambassador following the invasion The Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, was in London when the war broke out [175] and in an opinion piece published in The Times he said: \"The military rulers of Argentina must not be appeased … New Zealand will back Britain all the way.\" Broadcasting on the BBC World Service, he told the Falkland Islanders: \"This is Rob Muldoon We are thinking of you and we are giving our full and total support to the British Government in its endeavours to rectify this situation and get rid of the people who have invaded your country.\" [176] On 20 May 1982, he announced that New Zealand would make HMNZS Canterbury, a Leander-class frigate, available for use where the British thought fit to release a Royal Navy vessel for the Falklands [177] In the House of Commons afterwards, Margaret Thatcher said: \"…the New Zealand Government and people have been absolutely magnificent in their support for this country  [and] the Falkland Islanders, for the rule of liberty and of law\" [176] [178]\n\n\nAustralia\nEncouraged by the generous response of New Zealand, the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, was rushed into offering to cancel the intended purchase of HMS Invincible, which was quickly accepted by the British However, this left the Royal Australian Navy without a replacement for their only aircraft carrier, HMAS Melbourne, which was in the process of decommissioning [179]\n\n\nFrance\nThe French president, François Mitterrand, declared an embargo on French arms sales and assistance to Argentina [180] In addition, France allowed UK aircraft and warships use of its port and airfield facilities at Dakar in Senegal [181] and France provided dissimilar aircraft training so that Harrier pilots could train against the French aircraft used by Argentina [182] French intelligence also cooperated with Britain to prevent Argentina from obtaining more Exocet missiles on the international market [183] In a 2002 interview, and in reference to this support, John Nott, the then British Defence Secretary, had described France as Britain's 'greatest ally' In 2012, it came to light that while this support was taking place, a French technical team, employed by Dassault and already in Argentina, remained there throughout the war despite the presidential decree The team had provided material support to the Argentines, identifying and fixing faults in Exocet missile launchers John Nott said he had known the French team was there but said its work was thought not to be of any importance An adviser to the then French government denied any knowledge at the time that the technical team was there The French DGSE did know the team was there as they had an informant in the team but decried any assistance the team gave: \"It's bordering on an act of treason, or disobedience to an embargo\" John Nott, when asked if he felt let down by the French said \"If you're asking me: 'Are the French duplicitous people?' the answer is: 'Of course they are, and they always have been\" [180] Four Exocet missiles that had been ordered by Peru were prevented by the French government from being delivered by air and, after pressure from Britain who suspected that they would be passed on to Argentina, delayed their release to a Peruvian ship until the conflict was over [184]\n\n\nUnited States\nDeclassified cables show the United States both felt that Thatcher had not considered diplomatic options and feared that a protracted conflict could draw the Soviet Union on Argentina's side [185] The US initially tried to mediate an end to the conflict through shuttle diplomacy, but when Argentina refused the American peace overtures, US Secretary of State Alexander Haig announced that the United States would prohibit arms sales to Argentina and provide material support for British operations Both houses of the US Congress passed resolutions supporting the American action siding with the United Kingdom [186]\n\n\nOther OAS members\nArgentina itself was politically backed by a number of countries in Latin America (though, notably, not Chile) Several members of the Non-Aligned Movement also backed Argentina's position; notably, Cuba and Nicaragua led a diplomatic effort to rally non-aligned countries from Africa and Asia to Argentina's position This initiative came as a surprise to Western observers, as Cuba had no diplomatic relations with Argentina's right-leaning military junta British diplomats complained that Cuba had \"cynically exploited\" the crisis to pursue its normalization of relations with Latin American countries; Argentina eventually resumed relations with Cuba in 1983; Brazil did so in 1986 [196] According to Leycester Coltman, Cuban president Fidel Castro offered to send troops to reinforce the Argentine garrison in the Falklands and to deploy the Cuban submarine fleet to attack British warships en route to the South Atlantic [197]\n\n\nCuba\nArgentina itself was politically backed by a number of countries in Latin America (though,

[196] According to Leycester Coltman, Cuban president Fidel Castro offered to send troops to reinforce the Argentine garrison in the Falklands and to deploy the Cuban submarine fleet to attack British warships en route to the South Atlantic [197]\n\n\nPeru\nPeru attempted to purchase 12 Exocet missiles from France, to be delivered to Argentina in a failed secret operation [198] [199] Peru also openly sent \"Mirages, pilots and missiles\" to Argentina during the war [200]That nation also supplied the Argentine forces with 40 Strela-2M shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile launchers and three experienced operators to help train in the use of those weapons [201]Peru had earlier transferred ten Hercules transport planes to Argentina soon after the British Task Force had set sail in April 1982 [202] Nick van der Bijl records that, after the Argentine defeat at Goose Green, Venezuela and Guatemala offered to send paratroopers to the Falklands [203]\n\n\nChile\nAt the outbreak of the war, Chile was in negotiations with Argentina for control over the Beagle Channel and feared Argentina would use similar tactics to secure the channel [204] During this conflict, Argentina had already rejected two attempts at international mediation and tried to exert military pressure on Chile with an operation to occupy the disputed territory Considering the situation, Chile refused to support the Argentine position during the war [205] and gave support to the UK in the form of intelligence about the Argentine military and early warning intelligence on Argentine air movements [206] [207] Throughout the war, Argentina was afraid of a Chilean military intervention in Patagonia and kept some of its best mountain regiments away from the Falklands near the Chilean border as a precaution [208] The Chilean government also allowed the United Kingdom to requisition the refuelling vessel RFA Tidepool, which Chile had recently purchased and which had arrived at Arica in Chile on 4 April The ship left port soon afterwards, bound for Ascension Island through the Panama Canal and stopping at Curaçao en route [209] [210] [211]\n\n\nBrazil\nAt the end of May, Brazilian authorities allowed FAA Boeing 707s to refuel at Recife International Airport carrying arms shipments from Libya When the British Embassy in Brasilia became aware of this, the British Secret Intelligence Service devised a plan to sabotage the next flight on the ground, but diplomatic pressure on the Brazilian government to observe their legal duties as a neutral country resulted in no further flights being accepted [212] On 3 June, an RAF Vulcan on returning from a Black Buck raid on the Falklands, was forced to make an emergency landing at Rio de Janeiro International Airport after damage to its refuelling probe prevented it returning to Ascension Island The Vulcan and her crew were interned and released seven days later, although an unused Shrike missile that the aircraft had been carrying was retained [213]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nThe Soviet Union described the Falklands as \"a disputed territory\", recognising Argentina's ambitions over the islands, and called for restraint on all sides Soviet media frequently criticised the UK and US during the war Significantly, however, the Soviet Union refrained from vetoing and thus made possible UN Security Council Resolution 502 demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Argentine troops from the Falklands However, the Soviet Union mounted some clandestine logistics operations to assist the Argentines [214] Days after the invasion by the Argentine forces, the Soviets launched additional intelligence satellites into low Earth orbit covering the southern Atlantic Ocean Conflicting reports exist on whether Soviet ocean surveillance data might have played a role in the sinking of HMS Sheffield and HMS Coventry [215] [216] [217]\n\n\nSpain\nSpain's position was one of ambiguity, underpinning the basic dilemma of the Spanish foreign policy regarding the articulation of relationships with Latin America and European communities [218] On 2 April 1982, the Council of Ministers issued an official note defending principles of decolonisation and against the use of force [219] Spain abstained in the vote of UN Security Council Resolution 502, a position that Spanish UN representative Jaime de Piniés justified by pointing out that the resolution did not mention the underlying problem of decolonisation [219] The Spanish stance throughout the conflict contrasted with those of the countries in its immediate vicinity (EEC members and Portugal) [220]\n\n\nPortugal\nPortugal supported its long-standing ally Britain and the facilities of the Azores were offered to the Royal Navy [222]\n\n\nEEC\nThe European Economic Community provided economic support by imposing economic sanctions on Argentina In a meeting on Good Friday, 9 April, at the Egmont Palace, the EEC Political Committee proposed a total import ban from Argentina Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg and Ireland agreed immediately; France, Germany and the Netherlands were persuaded before the meeting ended Italy, which had close cultural ties with Argentina, consented on the next day [223]\n\n\nOther countries\nIreland's position altered during the war As a rotating member of the United Nations Security Council, it supported Resolution 502 However, on 4 May, the Fianna Fáil government led by Charles Haughey decided to oppose EEC sanctions and called for a ceasefire Haughey justified this as complying with Irish neutrality Historians have suggested it was an opportunistic appeal to anti-British sentiment and reaction to Haughey's being sidelined during the 1981 republican hunger strike The strain on British–Irish relations eased when Haughey's government fell in November 1982 [224] [225] [226]\n\n\nIreland\nIreland's position altered during the war As a rotating member of the United Nations Security Council, it supported

Argentina and continued their work during the conflict The book also claims that Israel sold weapons and drop tanks to Argentina in a secret operation via Peru [227] [228]\n\n\nSierra Leone\nThe Government of Sierra Leone allowed British task force ships to refuel at Freetown [229]\n\n\nThe Gambia\nVC10 transport aircraft landed at Banjul in The Gambia while flying between the UK and Ascension Island [181]\n\n\nLibya\nThrough Libya, under Muammar Gaddafi, Argentina received 20 launchers and 60 SA-7 missiles (which Argentina later described as \"not effective\"), as well as machine guns, mortars and mines To retrieve the weapons, four trips were made using two Argentine Air Force Boeing 707s [clarification needed] which refuelled in Recife with the consent of the Brazilian government [230]\n\n\nCasualties\nIn total, 907 people were killed during the 74 days of the conflict Additionally, there were 1,188 Argentine and 777 British injured or wounded.\n\n\nArgentina\nSelected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war Back in Buenos Aires, newspapers and magazines reported on \"the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes\" [23]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nSeventeen newspaper reporters, two photographers, two radio reporters and three television reporters with five technicians sailed with the Task Force to the war The Newspaper Publishers' Association selected them from among 160 applicants, excluding foreign media The hasty selection resulted in the inclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only in Queen Elizabeth II's son Prince Andrew, who was serving in the conflict [279] The prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions, including Exocet missile decoy and casualty evacuation [280]\n\n\nCivilians\nThree civilians on the Falkland Islands were accidentally killed by British shelling during the night of 11/12 June [243] [238] [244] It was also reported that HMS Brilliant, on an anti-submarine patrol, detected and torpedoed three whales by accident [245]\n\n\nRed Cross Box\nBefore British offensive operations began, the British and Argentine governments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides could station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side This area, a circle 20 nautical miles in diameter, was referred to as the Red Cross Box (48°30′S 53°45′W﻿ / ﻿48.500°S 53.750°W﻿ / -48.500; -53.750) and located about 45 miles (72 km) north of Falkland Sound [246] Ultimately, the British stationed four ships (HMS Hydra, HMS Hecla and HMS Herald and the primary hospital ship SS Uganda) within the box, [247] while the Argentines stationed three (ARA Almirante Irízar, ARA Bahía Paraíso and Puerto Deseado).\n\n\nAftermath\nThis brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved, besides the considerable casualty rate and large materiel loss, especially of shipping and aircraft, relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing sides.\n\n\n\"Fortress Falklands\"\nIn the immediate aftermath of the conflict, the British government embarked on a long-term policy of providing the islands with a viable military garrison, known informally as \"Fortress Falklands\" Initially, an aircraft carrier was kept in the area until the runway at Stanley Airport could be improved to take conventional RAF fighters A permanent military complex with a runway designed to take long-haul airliners was constructed in the south of East Falkland, RAF Mount Pleasant, which opened in 1985; an associated deep-water port at Mare Harbour was also constructed A small military outpost was established at King Edward Point on South Georgia, but it was closed in 2001 [256]\n\n\nMilitary analysis\nMilitarily, the Falklands conflict remains one of the largest air-naval combat operations between modern forces since the end of the Second World War As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians Significant takeaways include the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for long-distance projections of power, and reconfirmation of the importance of tactical air power, including helicopters [257]\n\n\nMemorials\nThere are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the 1982 Liberation Memorial, unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war It lists the names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war and is located in front of the Secretariat Building in Stanley, overlooking Stanley Harbour The Memorial was funded entirely by the Islanders and is inscribed with the words \"In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us\" [259]\n\n\nMinefields\nIn 2011 there were 113 uncleared minefields plus unexploded ordnance (UXOs) covering an area of 13 km2 (3,200 acres) on the Falkland Islands Of this area, 5.5 km2 (1,400 acres) on the Murrell Peninsula were classified as being \"suspected minefields\"—the area had been heavily pastured for 25 years without incident It was estimated that these minefields had 20,000 anti-personnel mines and 5,000 anti-tank mines.\n\n\nPress and publicity\nSelected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war Back in Buenos Aires, newspapers and magazines reported on \"the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes\" [23]\n\n\nArgentina\nSelected

Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges described the war as \"a fight between two bald men over a comb.\" [295] The words yomp and Exocet entered the British vernacular as a result of the war The Falklands War also provided material for theatre, film and TV drama and influenced the output of musicians In Argentina, the military government banned the broadcasting of music in the English language, giving way to the rise of local rock musicians, like the famous \"Trova Rosarina\" movement as well as solo musicians such as Charly García, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Fito Paez and Gustavo Santaolalla [296]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Falklands War**\n\nThe Falklands War was a 74-day military conflict between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1982 over the disputed Falkland Islands. The conflict began on April 2, 1982, when Argentina invaded the islands, and ended on June 14, 1982, with the surrender of Argentine forces.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn 1965, the United Nations called upon Argentina and the United Kingdom to reach a settlement of the sovereignty dispute. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) regarded the islands as a nuisance and barrier to UK trade in South America. While confident of British sovereignty, the FCO was prepared to cede the islands to Argentina. When news of a proposed transfer broke in 1968, elements sympathetic with the plight of the islanders were able to organize an effective parliamentary lobby to frustrate the FCO plans.\n\n**Failed Diplomacy**\n\nIn 1965, the United Nations called upon Argentina and the United Kingdom to reach a settlement of the sovereignty dispute.

The invasion was met with a fierce but brief defence organized by the Falkland Islands' Governor Sir Rex Hunt, giving command to Major Mike Norman of the Royal Marines. The garrison consisted of 68 marines and eleven naval hydrographers, assisted by 23 volunteers of the Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF), who had few weapons and were used as lookouts.\n\n**Initial British Response**\n\nThe British had already taken action prior to the 2 April invasion. In response to events on South Georgia, on 29 March, Ministers decided to send the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Fort Austin south from the Mediterranean to support HMS Endurance, and the nuclear-powered fleet submarine HMS Spartan from Gibraltar, with HMS Splendid ordered south from Scotland the following day.\n\n**United Nations Security Council Resolution 502**\n\nOn 31 March 1982, the Argentine ambassador to the UN, Eduardo Roca, began attempting to garner support against a British military build-up designed to thwart earlier UN resolutions calling for both countries to resolve the Falklands dispute through discussion.\n\n**Air Attacks**\n\nIn the landing zone, the limitations of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences were demonstrated in the sinking of HMS Ardent on 21 May, which was hit by nine bombs, and HMS Antelope on 24 May when attempts to defuse unexploded bombs failed.\n\n**Land Battles**\n\nDuring the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore Michael Clapp (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare – COMAW) mounted Operation Sutton, the amphibious landing on beaches around San Carlos Water, on the northwestern coast of East Falkland facing onto Falkland Sound.\n\n**Recapture of South Georgia**\n\nOn 20 June, the British retook the South Sandwich Islands, which involved accepting the surrender of the Southern Thule Garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base and declared hostilities over.\n\n**Foreign Involvement**\n\nThe UK received political support from member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand withdrew their diplomats from Buenos Aires.\n\n**Soviet Union**\n\nThe Soviet Union described the Falklands as \"a disputed territory\", recognizing Argentina's ambitions over the islands, and called for restraint on all sides.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nIn total, 907 people were killed during the 74 days of the conflict, including 255 British military personnel and 649 Argentine military personnel.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe war had a significant impact on the Falkland Islands, the United Kingdom, and Argentina. The conflict marked the end of the Argentine military junta and the beginning of a democratic government in Argentina. The war also marked a turning point in the relationship between the United Kingdom and Argentina, with the United Kingdom maintaining its sovereignty over the Falkland Islands.\n\n**Memorials**\n\nThere are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the 1982 Liberation Memorial, unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war.\n\n**Minefields**\n\nIn 2011, there were 113 uncleared minefields plus unexploded ordnance (UXOs) covering an area of 13 km2 on the Falkland Islands.\n\n**Press and Publicity**\n\nThe Falklands War received widespread media coverage, with selected war correspondents regularly flown to Port Stanley to report on the conflict.\n\n**Cultural Impact**\n\nThe Falklands War had a significant impact on popular culture in both the UK and Argentina, from the immediate post-war period to the present. The conflict provided material for theatre, film, and TV drama and influenced the output of musicians.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Falkland Islands\n* Argentina\n* United Kingdom\n* United Nations\n* Soviet Union\n* Commonwealth of Nations\n\n**References**\n\n* Falkland Islands Government.

General Jorge Rafael Videla and General Roberto Eduardo Viola late in March 1981—Argentina had been in the midst of devastating economic stagnation and large-scale civil unrest against the National Reorganization Process, the military junta that had been governing the country since 1976 [18] [19]\n\n\nArgentine invasion\nOn 2 April 1982, Argentine forces mounted amphibious landings, known as Operation Rosario, [27] on the Falkland Islands [28] The invasion was met with a fierce but brief defence organised by the Falkland Islands' Governor Sir Rex Hunt, giving command to Major Mike Norman of the Royal Marines The garrison consisted of 68 marines and eleven naval hydrographers, [29] assisted by 23 volunteers of the Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF), who had few weapons and were used as lookouts [30] The invasion started with the landing of Lieutenant Commander Guillermo Sanchez-Sabarots' Amphibious Commandos Group, who attacked the empty Moody Brook barracks and then moved on Government House in Stanley When the 2nd Marine Infantry Battalion with Assault Amphibious Vehicles arrived, the governor ordered a ceasefire and surrendered [31] The governor, his family and the British military personnel were flown to Argentina that afternoon and later repatriated to the United Kingdom [32]\n\n\nInitial British response\nThe British had already taken action prior to the 2 April invasion In response to events on South Georgia, on 29 March, Ministers decided to send the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Fort Austin south from the Mediterranean to support HMS Endurance, and the nuclear-powered fleet submarine HMS Spartan from Gibraltar, with HMS Splendid ordered south from Scotland the following day [33]: 75  [34] Lord Carrington had wished to send a third submarine, but the decision was deferred due to concerns about the impact on operational commitments [34] Coincidentally, on 26 March, the submarine HMS Superb left Gibraltar and it was assumed in the press she was heading south There has since been speculation that the effect of those reports was to panic the Argentine junta into invading the Falklands before submarines could be deployed; [34] however, post-war research has established that the final decision to proceed was made at a junta meeting in Buenos Aires on 23 March [35]\n\n\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 502\nOn 31 March 1982, the Argentine ambassador to the UN, Eduardo Roca, began attempting to garner support against a British military build-up designed to thwart earlier UN resolutions calling for both countries to resolve the Falklands dispute through discussion [33]: 134  On 2 April, the night of the invasion, a banquet was held at Roca's official residence for the US ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and several high-ranking officials of the United States Department of State and the United States Department of Defense This led British diplomats to view Kirkpatrick, who had earlier called for closer relationships with South American dictatorships, with considerable suspicion [41]\n\n\nArgentine occupation\nThe Argentine Army unit earmarked for the occupation was the 25th Infantry Regiment, a unit of about 681 men specially trained from all the regions of Argentina; it was flown into Port Stanley Airport as soon as the runway had been cleared [47] Once it became clear that the British were sending an amphibious task force, there was a general recall of reservists and two brigades of eight infantry regiments and their supporting units were dispatched to the islands The total Argentine garrison numbered some 13,000 troops by the beginning of May The conscripts born in 1963 had only recently been called-up, so they were supplemented by the recall of the previous year's intake Brigadier General Mario Benjamín Menéndez was appointed Military Governor of the Malvinas [48]\n\n\nShuttle diplomacy\nOn 8 April, Alexander Haig, the United States Secretary of State, arrived in London on a shuttle diplomacy mission from President Ronald Reagan to broker a peace deal based on an interim authority taking control of the islands pending negotiations After hearing from Thatcher that the task force would not be withdrawn unless the Argentines evacuated their troops, Haig headed for Buenos Aires [61] There he met the junta and Nicanor Costa Méndez, the foreign minister Haig was treated coolly and told that Argentine sovereignty must be a pre-condition of any talks Returning to London on 11 April, he found the British cabinet in no mood for compromise Haig flew back to Washington before returning to Buenos Aires for a final protracted round of talks These made little progress, but just as Haig and his mission were leaving, they were told that Galtieri would meet them at the airport VIP lounge to make an important concession; however, this was cancelled at the last minute On 30 April, the Reagan administration announced that they would be publicly supporting the United Kingdom [62]\n\n\nBritish task force\nThe nuclear-powered submarine Conqueror set sail from Faslane, Scotland on 4 April The two aircraft carriers Invincible and Hermes and their escort vessels left Portsmouth, England only a day later [36] On its return to Southampton from a world cruise on 7 April, the ocean liner SS Canberra was requisitioned and set sail two days later with the 3 Commando Brigade aboard [36] The ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2 was also requisitioned, and left Southampton on 12 May, with the 5th Infantry Brigade on board [36] The whole task force eventually comprised 127 ships: 43 Royal Navy vessels, 22 Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, and 62 merchant ships [63]\n\n\nRecapture of South Georgia and the attack on Santa Fe\nThe South Georgia force, Operation Paraquet, under the command of Major Guy Sheridan RM, consisted of Marines from 42 Commando, a troop of the Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) troops who were intended to land as reconnaissance forces for an invasion by the Royal Marines, a total of 240 men All were embarked on RFA Tidespring First to arrive was the Churchill-class submarine HMS Conqueror on 19 April, and the island was over-flown by a Handley Page Victor aircraft with radar-mapping equipment on 20 April, to establish that no Argentine ships were in the vicinity [71]\n\n\nBlack Buck raids\nOn 1 May, British operations on the Falklands opened with the \"Black Buck 1\" attack (of a series of five) on the airfield at Stanley A Vulcan bomber from Ascension flew an 8,000-nautical-mile (15,000 km; 9,200 mi) round trip, dropping conventional bombs across the runway at Stanley The mission required repeated aerial refuelling using several Victor K2 tanker aircraft operating in concert, including tanker-to-tanker refuelling [77] The overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to determine The runway was cratered by only one of the twenty one bombs, but as a result, the Argentines realised that their mainland was vulnerable and fighter aircraft were redeployed from the theatre to bases further north [78]\n\n\nEscalation of the air war\nThe Falklands had only three airfields The longest and only paved runway was at the capital, Stanley, and even that was too short to support fast jets Therefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, combat air patrols, and close air support over the islands The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low, limiting the ability of fighters to protect attack aircraft, which were often compelled to attack the first target of opportunity, rather than selecting the most lucrative target [84]\n\n\nSinking of ARA General Belgrano\nOn 30 April, the British government had brought into force a 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) to replace the previous Maritime Exclusion Zone; aircraft as well as ships of any nation were liable to be attacked inside it, if they were aiding the Argentine occupation Admiral Sandy Woodward's carrier battle group of twelve warships and three supply ships entered the TEZ on 1 May, shortly before the first Black Buck raid, intending to degrade Argentine air and sea forces before the arrival of the amphibious group two weeks later [103] In anticipation, Admiral Anaya had deployed all his available warships into three task groups The first was centred around the aircraft carrier ARA Veinticinco de Mayo with two old but missile-armed destroyers, and a second comprised three modern frigates Both these groups were intended to approach the TEZ from the north A third group approaching from the south was led by the Second World War-vintage Argentine light cruiser ARA General Belgrano; [104] although old, her large guns and heavy armour made her a serious threat, and she was escorted by two modern Type 42 guided-missile destroyers, armed with Exocet missiles [105]\n\n\nSinking of HMS Sheffield\nOn 4 May, two days after the sinking of General Belgrano, the British lost the Type 42 destroyer HMS Sheffield to fire following an Exocet missile strike from the Argentine 2nd Naval Air Fighter/Attack Squadron [113]\n\n\nDiplomatic activity\nThe tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentines The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar on 18 May 1982 In it, the British abandoned their previous \"red-line\" that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentine forces, as supported by United Nations Security Council Resolution 502 [117]\n\n\nSpecial forces operations\nGiven the threat to the British fleet posed by the Étendard-Exocet combination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in SAS troops to attack the home base of the five Étendards at Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego The operation was codenamed \"Mikado\" The operation was later scrapped, after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited, and replaced with a plan to use the submarine HMS Onyx to drop SBS marines several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy Argentina's remaining Exocet stockpile - which did not exist at their objective  [120]\n\n\nAir attacks\nIn the landing zone, the limitations of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences were demonstrated in the sinking of HMS Ardent on 21 May which was hit by nine bombs, [126] and HMS Antelope on 24 May when attempts to defuze unexploded bombs failed [127] Out at sea with the carrier battle group, MV Atlantic Conveyor was struck by an air-launched Exocet on 25 May, which caused the loss of three out of four Chinook and five Wessex helicopters as well as their maintenance equipment and facilities, together with runway-building equipment and tents This was a severe blow from a logistical perspective Twelve of her crew members were killed [128]\n\n\nLand battles\nDuring the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore Michael Clapp (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare – COMAW) mounted Operation Sutton, the amphibious landing on beaches around San Carlos Water, [nb 4] on the northwestern coast of East Falkland facing onto Falkland Sound The bay, known as Bomb Alley by British forces, was the scene of repeated air attacks by low-flying Argentine jets [141] [142]\n\n\nSan Carlos – \"Bomb Alley\"\nDuring the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore Michael Clapp (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare – COMAW) mounted Operation Sutton, the amphibious landing on beaches around San Carlos Water, [nb 4] on the northwestern coast of East Falkland facing onto Falkland Sound The bay, known as Bomb Alley by British forces, was the scene of repeated air attacks by low-flying Argentine jets [141] [142]\n\n\nGoose Green\nFrom early on 27 May until 28 May, 2 Para approached and attacked Darwin and Goose Green, which was held by the Argentine 12th Infantry Regiment 2 Para’s 500 men had naval gunfire support from HMS Arrow and artillery support from 8 Commando Battery of the Royal Artillery After a tough struggle that lasted all night and into the next day, the British won the battle; in all, 18 British and 47 Argentine soldiers were killed A total of 961 Argentine troops (including 202 Argentine Air Force personnel of the Condor airfield) were taken prisoner.\n\n\nSpecial forces on Mount Kent\nMeanwhile, 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent [nb 5] Unbeknownst to senior British officers, the Argentine generals were determined to tie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area, and on 27 and 28 May they sent transport aircraft loaded with Blowpipe surface-to-air missiles and commandos (602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron) to Stanley This operation was known as Autoimpuesta (\"Self-imposed\").\n\n\nBluff Cove and Fitzroy\nBy 1 June, with the arrival of a further 5,000 British troops of the 5th Infantry Brigade, the new British divisional commander, Major General Jeremy Moore RM, had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against Stanley During this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 56 Of the dead, 32 were from the Welsh Guards on RFA Sir Galahad and RFA Sir Tristram on 8 June According to Surgeon-Commander Rick Jolly of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack, including Simon Weston [151]\n\n\nFall of Stanley\nOn the night of 11 June, after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and logistic build-up, British forces launched a brigade-sized night attack against the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding Stanley Units of 3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships, simultaneously attacked in the Battle of Mount Harriet, Battle of Two Sisters, and Battle of Mount Longdon Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy resistance and friendly fire but managed to capture their objectives The toughest battle was at Mount Longdon British forces were bogged down by rifle, mortar, machine gun, artillery and sniper fire, and ambushes Despite this, the British continued their advance [164]\n\n\nRecapture of South Sandwich Islands\nOn 20 June, the British retook the South Sandwich Islands, which involved accepting the surrender of the Southern Thule Garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base and declared hostilities over Argentina had established Corbeta Uruguay in 1976, but prior to 1982 the United Kingdom had contested the existence of the Argentine base only through diplomatic channels [173]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nThe UK received political support from member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations Australia, Canada, and New Zealand withdrew their diplomats from Buenos Aires [174]\n\n\nCommonwealth\nThe UK received political support from member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations Australia, Canada, and New Zealand withdrew their diplomats from Buenos Aires [174]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nThe New Zealand government expelled the Argentine ambassador following the invasion The Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, was in London when the war broke out [175] and in an opinion piece published in The Times he said: \"The military rulers of Argentina must not be appeased … New Zealand will back Britain all the way.\" Broadcasting on the BBC World Service, he told the Falkland Islanders: \"This is Rob Muldoon We are thinking of you and we are giving our full and total support to the British Government in its endeavours to rectify this situation and get rid of the people who have invaded your country.\" [176] On 20 May 1982, he announced that New Zealand would make HMNZS Canterbury, a Leander-class frigate, available for use where the British thought fit to release a Royal Navy vessel for the Falklands [177] In the House of Commons afterwards, Margaret Thatcher said: \"…the New Zealand Government and people have been absolutely magnificent in their support for this country  [and] the Falkland Islanders, for the rule of liberty and of law\" [176] [178]\n\n\nAustralia\nEncouraged by the generous response of New Zealand, the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, was rushed into offering to cancel the intended purchase of HMS Invincible, which was quickly accepted by the British However, this left the Royal Australian Navy without a replacement for their only aircraft carrier, HMAS Melbourne, which was in the process of decommissioning [179]\n\n\nFrance\nThe French president, François Mitterrand, declared an embargo on French arms sales and assistance to Argentina [180] In addition, France allowed UK aircraft and warships use of its port and airfield facilities at Dakar in Senegal [181] and France provided dissimilar aircraft training so that Harrier pilots could train against the French aircraft used by Argentina [182] French intelligence also cooperated with Britain to prevent Argentina from obtaining more Exocet missiles on the international market [183] In a 2002 interview, and in reference to this support, John Nott, the then British Defence Secretary, had described France as Britain's 'greatest ally' In 2012, it came to light that while this support was taking place, a French technical team, employed by Dassault and already in Argentina, remained there throughout the war despite the presidential decree The team had provided material support to the Argentines, identifying and fixing faults in Exocet missile launchers John Nott said he had known the French team was there but said its work was thought not to be of any importance An adviser to the then French government denied any knowledge at the time that the technical team was there The French DGSE did know the team was there as they had an informant in the team but decried any assistance the team gave: \"It's bordering on an act of treason, or disobedience to an embargo\" John Nott, when asked if he felt let down by the French said \"If you're asking me: 'Are the French duplicitous people?' the answer is: 'Of course they are, and they always have been\" [180] Four Exocet missiles that had been ordered by Peru were prevented by the French government from being delivered by air and, after pressure from Britain who suspected that they would be passed on to Argentina, delayed their release to a Peruvian ship until the conflict was over [184]\n\n\nUnited States\nDeclassified cables show the United States both felt that Thatcher had not considered diplomatic options and feared that a protracted conflict could draw the Soviet Union on Argentina's side [185] The US initially tried to mediate an end to the conflict through shuttle diplomacy, but when Argentina refused the American peace overtures, US Secretary of State Alexander Haig announced that the United States would prohibit arms sales to Argentina and provide material support for British operations Both houses of the US Congress passed resolutions supporting the American action siding with the United Kingdom [186]\n\n\nOther OAS members\nArgentina itself was politically backed by a number of countries in Latin America (though, notably, not Chile) Several members of the Non-Aligned Movement also backed Argentina's position; notably, Cuba and Nicaragua led a diplomatic effort to rally non-aligned countries from Africa and Asia to Argentina's position This initiative came as a surprise to Western observers, as Cuba had no diplomatic relations with Argentina's right-leaning military junta British diplomats complained that Cuba had \"cynically exploited\" the crisis to pursue its normalization of relations with Latin American countries; Argentina eventually resumed relations with Cuba in 1983; Brazil did so in 1986 [196] According to Leycester Coltman, Cuban president Fidel Castro offered to send troops to reinforce the Argentine garrison in the Falklands and to deploy the Cuban submarine fleet to attack British warships en route to the South Atlantic [197]\n\n\nCuba\nArgentina itself was politically backed by a number of countries in Latin America (though,

[196] According to Leycester Coltman, Cuban president Fidel Castro offered to send troops to reinforce the Argentine garrison in the Falklands and to deploy the Cuban submarine fleet to attack British warships en route to the South Atlantic [197]\n\n\nPeru\nPeru attempted to purchase 12 Exocet missiles from France, to be delivered to Argentina in a failed secret operation [198] [199] Peru also openly sent \"Mirages, pilots and missiles\" to Argentina during the war [200]That nation also supplied the Argentine forces with 40 Strela-2M shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile launchers and three experienced operators to help train in the use of those weapons [201]Peru had earlier transferred ten Hercules transport planes to Argentina soon after the British Task Force had set sail in April 1982 [202] Nick van der Bijl records that, after the Argentine defeat at Goose Green, Venezuela and Guatemala offered to send paratroopers to the Falklands [203]\n\n\nChile\nAt the outbreak of the war, Chile was in negotiations with Argentina for control over the Beagle Channel and feared Argentina would use similar tactics to secure the channel [204] During this conflict, Argentina had already rejected two attempts at international mediation and tried to exert military pressure on Chile with an operation to occupy the disputed territory Considering the situation, Chile refused to support the Argentine position during the war [205] and gave support to the UK in the form of intelligence about the Argentine military and early warning intelligence on Argentine air movements [206] [207] Throughout the war, Argentina was afraid of a Chilean military intervention in Patagonia and kept some of its best mountain regiments away from the Falklands near the Chilean border as a precaution [208] The Chilean government also allowed the United Kingdom to requisition the refuelling vessel RFA Tidepool, which Chile had recently purchased and which had arrived at Arica in Chile on 4 April The ship left port soon afterwards, bound for Ascension Island through the Panama Canal and stopping at Curaçao en route [209] [210] [211]\n\n\nBrazil\nAt the end of May, Brazilian authorities allowed FAA Boeing 707s to refuel at Recife International Airport carrying arms shipments from Libya When the British Embassy in Brasilia became aware of this, the British Secret Intelligence Service devised a plan to sabotage the next flight on the ground, but diplomatic pressure on the Brazilian government to observe their legal duties as a neutral country resulted in no further flights being accepted [212] On 3 June, an RAF Vulcan on returning from a Black Buck raid on the Falklands, was forced to make an emergency landing at Rio de Janeiro International Airport after damage to its refuelling probe prevented it returning to Ascension Island The Vulcan and her crew were interned and released seven days later, although an unused Shrike missile that the aircraft had been carrying was retained [213]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nThe Soviet Union described the Falklands as \"a disputed territory\", recognising Argentina's ambitions over the islands, and called for restraint on all sides Soviet media frequently criticised the UK and US during the war Significantly, however, the Soviet Union refrained from vetoing and thus made possible UN Security Council Resolution 502 demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Argentine troops from the Falklands However, the Soviet Union mounted some clandestine logistics operations to assist the Argentines [214] Days after the invasion by the Argentine forces, the Soviets launched additional intelligence satellites into low Earth orbit covering the southern Atlantic Ocean Conflicting reports exist on whether Soviet ocean surveillance data might have played a role in the sinking of HMS Sheffield and HMS Coventry [215] [216] [217]\n\n\nSpain\nSpain's position was one of ambiguity, underpinning the basic dilemma of the Spanish foreign policy regarding the articulation of relationships with Latin America and European communities [218] On 2 April 1982, the Council of Ministers issued an official note defending principles of decolonisation and against the use of force [219] Spain abstained in the vote of UN Security Council Resolution 502, a position that Spanish UN representative Jaime de Piniés justified by pointing out that the resolution did not mention the underlying problem of decolonisation [219] The Spanish stance throughout the conflict contrasted with those of the countries in its immediate vicinity (EEC members and Portugal) [220]\n\n\nPortugal\nPortugal supported its long-standing ally Britain and the facilities of the Azores were offered to the Royal Navy [222]\n\n\nEEC\nThe European Economic Community provided economic support by imposing economic sanctions on Argentina In a meeting on Good Friday, 9 April, at the Egmont Palace, the EEC Political Committee proposed a total import ban from Argentina Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg and Ireland agreed immediately; France, Germany and the Netherlands were persuaded before the meeting ended Italy, which had close cultural ties with Argentina, consented on the next day [223]\n\n\nOther countries\nIreland's position altered during the war As a rotating member of the United Nations Security Council, it supported Resolution 502 However, on 4 May, the Fianna Fáil government led by Charles Haughey decided to oppose EEC sanctions and called for a ceasefire Haughey justified this as complying with Irish neutrality Historians have suggested it was an opportunistic appeal to anti-British sentiment and reaction to Haughey's being sidelined during the 1981 republican hunger strike The strain on British–Irish relations eased when Haughey's government fell in November 1982 [224] [225] [226]\n\n\nIreland\nIreland's position altered during the war As a rotating member of the United Nations Security Council, it supported

Argentina and continued their work during the conflict The book also claims that Israel sold weapons and drop tanks to Argentina in a secret operation via Peru [227] [228]\n\n\nSierra Leone\nThe Government of Sierra Leone allowed British task force ships to refuel at Freetown [229]\n\n\nThe Gambia\nVC10 transport aircraft landed at Banjul in The Gambia while flying between the UK and Ascension Island [181]\n\n\nLibya\nThrough Libya, under Muammar Gaddafi, Argentina received 20 launchers and 60 SA-7 missiles (which Argentina later described as \"not effective\"), as well as machine guns, mortars and mines To retrieve the weapons, four trips were made using two Argentine Air Force Boeing 707s [clarification needed] which refuelled in Recife with the consent of the Brazilian government [230]\n\n\nCasualties\nIn total, 907 people were killed during the 74 days of the conflict Additionally, there were 1,188 Argentine and 777 British injured or wounded.\n\n\nArgentina\nSelected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war Back in Buenos Aires, newspapers and magazines reported on \"the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes\" [23]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nSeventeen newspaper reporters, two photographers, two radio reporters and three television reporters with five technicians sailed with the Task Force to the war The Newspaper Publishers' Association selected them from among 160 applicants, excluding foreign media The hasty selection resulted in the inclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only in Queen Elizabeth II's son Prince Andrew, who was serving in the conflict [279] The prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions, including Exocet missile decoy and casualty evacuation [280]\n\n\nCivilians\nThree civilians on the Falkland Islands were accidentally killed by British shelling during the night of 11/12 June [243] [238] [244] It was also reported that HMS Brilliant, on an anti-submarine patrol, detected and torpedoed three whales by accident [245]\n\n\nRed Cross Box\nBefore British offensive operations began, the British and Argentine governments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides could station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side This area, a circle 20 nautical miles in diameter, was referred to as the Red Cross Box (48°30′S 53°45′W﻿ / ﻿48.500°S 53.750°W﻿ / -48.500; -53.750) and located about 45 miles (72 km) north of Falkland Sound [246] Ultimately, the British stationed four ships (HMS Hydra, HMS Hecla and HMS Herald and the primary hospital ship SS Uganda) within the box, [247] while the Argentines stationed three (ARA Almirante Irízar, ARA Bahía Paraíso and Puerto Deseado).\n\n\nAftermath\nThis brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved, besides the considerable casualty rate and large materiel loss, especially of shipping and aircraft, relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing sides.\n\n\n\"Fortress Falklands\"\nIn the immediate aftermath of the conflict, the British government embarked on a long-term policy of providing the islands with a viable military garrison, known informally as \"Fortress Falklands\" Initially, an aircraft carrier was kept in the area until the runway at Stanley Airport could be improved to take conventional RAF fighters A permanent military complex with a runway designed to take long-haul airliners was constructed in the south of East Falkland, RAF Mount Pleasant, which opened in 1985; an associated deep-water port at Mare Harbour was also constructed A small military outpost was established at King Edward Point on South Georgia, but it was closed in 2001 [256]\n\n\nMilitary analysis\nMilitarily, the Falklands conflict remains one of the largest air-naval combat operations between modern forces since the end of the Second World War As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians Significant takeaways include the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for long-distance projections of power, and reconfirmation of the importance of tactical air power, including helicopters [257]\n\n\nMemorials\nThere are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the 1982 Liberation Memorial, unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war It lists the names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war and is located in front of the Secretariat Building in Stanley, overlooking Stanley Harbour The Memorial was funded entirely by the Islanders and is inscribed with the words \"In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us\" [259]\n\n\nMinefields\nIn 2011 there were 113 uncleared minefields plus unexploded ordnance (UXOs) covering an area of 13 km2 (3,200 acres) on the Falkland Islands Of this area, 5.5 km2 (1,400 acres) on the Murrell Peninsula were classified as being \"suspected minefields\"—the area had been heavily pastured for 25 years without incident It was estimated that these minefields had 20,000 anti-personnel mines and 5,000 anti-tank mines.\n\n\nPress and publicity\nSelected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war Back in Buenos Aires, newspapers and magazines reported on \"the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes\" [23]\n\n\nArgentina\nSelected

decoy and casualty evacuation [280]\n\n\nCultural impact\nThere were wide-ranging influences on popular culture in both the UK and Argentina, from the immediate postwar period to the present The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges described the war as \"a fight between two bald men over a comb.\" [295] The words yomp and Exocet entered the British vernacular as a result of the war The Falklands War also provided material for theatre, film and TV drama and influenced the output of musicians In Argentina, the military government banned the broadcasting of music in the English language, giving way to the rise of local rock musicians, like the famous \"Trova Rosarina\" movement as well as solo musicians such as Charly García, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Fito Paez and Gustavo Santaolalla [296]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She was the first woman to hold the office and the first Zanzibari to become President of Tanzania.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nSamia Suluhu was born in the Sultanate of Zanzibar on 27 January 1960 to a teacher and his wife. Four years later, Zanzibar unified with Tanganyika to form the nation of Tanzania. Suluhu completed her secondary education in 1977 and began working as an office clerk. She married agriculturalist Hafidh Ameir the following year. Together they had three sons and one daughter, Wanu Hafidh Ameir, who went on to become a member of the Zanzibar House of Representatives.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nIn 2000, Suluhu became a special seat member of the Zanzibar House of Representatives with the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party. She was appointed Zanzibar's Minister for Youth Employment, Women and Children. While in this position, she ended the prohibition on new mothers returning to school. She was the only high-ranking woman minister in the cabinet and was treated less seriously by her male colleagues because she was a woman. She was re-elected in 2005 and was appointed as Minister for Tourism and Trade Investment.\n\n**President of Tanzania**\n\nOn 17 March 2021, Suluhu announced that President John Magufuli had died after a long illness. Magufuli had not been seen in public since late February. Suluhu was sworn in on 19 March 2021 to serve the remainder of his second term. Opposition leaders had expressed concern about a possible vacuum when 18 March passed without Suluhu being sworn in. Out of public view, there was an effort by factions of the party to prevent her from becoming president, and she was the last of the senior government officials to be briefed on Magufuli's death. Immediately after being sworn in, Suluhu inspected troops at a military parade in her honour. In her first statement as president, she declared three weeks of mourning for Magufuli's death.\n\n**Ascension and Swearing in**\n\nOn 17 March 2021, Suluhu announced that Magufuli had died after a long illness.

Immediately after being sworn in, Suluhu inspected troops at a military parade in her honour. In her first statement as president, she declared three weeks of mourning for Magufuli's death.\n\n**Presidential Administration**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was ongoing when Suluhu became president. She reversed the denialist position on the COVID-19 pandemic in Tanzania held by Magufuli, and she entered Tanzania into the COVAX program to begin distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in July 2021. Mandatory 14-day quarantines for travellers entering Tanzania from countries with cases of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 were imposed. Suluhu permitted embassies and other international organisations to import vaccines into the country to vaccinate foreign nationals for their Tanzanian day-to-day work, aided by the Ministry of Health.\n\n**Style of Governance**\n\nWriters for France 24, The New York Times, and New Internationalist have all described Suluhu as \"soft-spoken\". Suluhu herself has referenced her quiet demeanour. Al-Jazeera correspondent Catherine Wambua-Soi described a collaborative nature in Suluhu's approach to government, saying that she consults her advisors instead of making unilateral decisions. BBC News cited a comparison to Magufili's predecessor, Jakaya Kikwete, who similarly engaged in diplomacy with the opposition instead of repression.

in 1987, he confided to Keppel that there were \"some murders\" that he would \"never talk about,\" because they were committed \"too close to home,\" \"too close to family\" or involved \"victims who were very young\" [397] Minutes before his execution, Hagmaier queried Bundy about unsolved homicides in New Jersey, Vermont, Illinois, Texas and Florida Bundy provided directions—later proven inaccurate—to Curtis' burial site in Utah, but denied involvement in any of the open cases [398] In 2011, Bundy's complete DNA profile, obtained from a vial of his blood found in an evidence vault, was added to the FBI's DNA database for future reference in these and other unsolved murder cases: [399]\n\n\nIdaho, Utah, Colorado\nIn August 1974, Bundy received a second acceptance from the University of Utah Law School and moved to Salt Lake City, leaving Kloepfer in Seattle While he called Kloepfer often, he dated \"at least a dozen\" other women [129] As he studied the first-year law curriculum a second time, Bundy was devastated to find out that the other students \"had something, some intellectual capacity\" that he did not He found the classes completely incomprehensible \"It was a great disappointment to me,\" he said [130] A new string of homicides began the following month, including two that would remain undiscovered until Bundy confessed to them shortly before his execution.\n\n\nArrest and first trial\nOn August 16, 1975, Bundy was arrested by Utah Highway Patrol officer Bob Hayward in Granger, another Salt Lake City suburb [172] Hayward observed Bundy cruising a residential area in his Volkswagen Beetle during the pre-dawn hours, and fleeing at high speed after seeing the patrol car [173] He noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats, and searched the car He found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an ice pick and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing, he had found the handcuffs in a dumpster and the rest were common household items [174] However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, and Bundy's name from Kloepfer's phone call a month later In a search of Bundy's apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn, [175] and a brochure that advertised the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful, where Kent had disappeared [176] Police did not have sufficient evidence to detain Bundy, so he was released on his own recognizance He later said that searchers missed a hidden collection of Polaroid photographs of his victims, which he destroyed after he was released [177]\n\n\nEscapes\nOn June 7, 1977, Bundy was transported 40 miles (64 km) from the Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs to Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for a preliminary hearing He had elected to serve as his own attorney, and as such was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles [198] During a recess, Bundy asked to visit the courthouse's law library to research his case While shielded from his guards' view behind a bookcase, he opened a window and jumped to the ground from the second story, injuring his right ankle as he landed.\n\n\nFlorida murders and rearrest\nFrom Chicago, Bundy traveled by train to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was present in a local tavern on January 2 [215] Five days later, he stole a car and drove south to Atlanta, where he boarded a bus and arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, on the morning of January 8 He stayed for one night at a hotel before renting a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus [216] Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police; [217] but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification [218] He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing money and credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts at local grocery stores [219]\n\n\nSubsequent trials, marriage\nIn May 1978, a Florida grand jury indicted Bundy on charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and burglary for the Omega Chi killings and assaults He stood trial in June 1979 in the Florida Circuit Court for Dade County, with judge Edward Cowart presiding [240] The trial was covered by 250 reporters from five continents and was the first to be televised nationally in the United States [241] Despite the presence of five court-appointed attorneys, Bundy again handled much of his own defense From the beginning, he \"sabotaged the entire defense effort out of spite, distrust, and grandiose delusion,\" Nelson later wrote \"Ted  [was] facing murder charges, with a possible death sentence, and all that mattered to him apparently was that he be in charge.\" [242]\n\n\nDeath row, confessions and execution\nShortly after the conclusion of the Leach trial and the beginning of the long appeals process that followed, Bundy initiated a series of interviews with Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth Speaking mostly in third person to avoid \"the stigma of confession,\" he began for the first time to divulge details of his crimes and thought processes [266] Bundy recounted his career as a thief, confirming Kloepfer's long-time suspicion that he had shoplifted virtually everything of substance that he owned [267] \"The big payoff for me,\" he said, \"was actually possessing whatever it was I had stolen I really enjoyed having something .. that I had wanted and gone out and taken.\" Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well [268] Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to \"totally possess\" his victims [269] At first, he killed his victims \"as a matter of expediency .. to eliminate the possibility of  [being] caught\"; but later, murder became part of the \"adventure.\" \"The ultimate possession was, in fact, the taking of the life,\" he said \"And then .. the physical possession of the remains.\" [270]\n\n\nModus operandi and victim profiles\nBundy was an unusually organized and calculating criminal who used his extensive knowledge of law enforcement methodologies to elude identification and capture for years [312] His crime scenes were distributed over large geographic areas; his victim count had risen to at least 20 before it became clear that numerous investigators in widely disparate jurisdictions were hunting the same man [313] Bundy's assault methods of choice were blunt trauma and strangulation, two relatively silent techniques that could be accomplished with common household items [314] He deliberately avoided firearms due to the noise they made and the ballistic evidence they left behind [315] He was a \"meticulous researcher\" who explored his surroundings in minute detail, looking for safe sites to seize and dispose of victims [316] He was unusually skilled at minimizing physical evidence [77] Bundy's fingerprints were never found at a crime scene, nor any other incontrovertible evidence of his guilt, a fact he repeated often during the years in which he attempted to maintain his innocence [317]\n\n\nPathology\nBundy underwent multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts' conclusions varied Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and an authority on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, [346] but later changed her impression more than once [5] [347] She also suggested the possibility of a multiple personality disorder, based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony; a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy \"seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person ..  [she] suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station He had turned into a stranger.\" [24] Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: \"He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality .. that was the day I was afraid of him.'\" [348]\n\n\nVictims\nThe night before his execution, Bundy confessed to 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage speculation [316] He told Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder \"publicized,\" there \"could be one that was not.\" [380] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, \"Add one digit to that, and you'll have it.\" [381] Years later he told Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, [316] but Keppel wrote that \" [Ted] and I both knew  [the total] was much higher.\" [76] In an interview, Keppel stated his belief that Bundy had killed \"at least 50, and maybe 75.\" [382]\n\n\nConfirmed\nThe night before his execution, Bundy confessed to 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage speculation [316] He told Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder \"publicized,\" there \"could be one that was not.\" [380] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, \"Add one digit to that, and you'll have it.\" [381] Years later he told Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, [316] but Keppel wrote that \" [Ted] and I both knew  [the total] was much higher.\" [76] In an interview, Keppel stated his belief that Bundy had killed \"at least 50, and maybe 75.\" [382]\n\n\n1974\nBundy remains a suspect in several unsolved homicides and disappearances, and is likely responsible for others that may never be identified;

He is considered one of the most notorious serial killers in American history, responsible for the deaths of numerous women during a period of several years. Bundy's crimes were characterized by their brutality and the fact that they went undetected for a long time, allowing him to continue killing with impunity. This article will provide an overview of Bundy's life, his crimes, and his eventual capture and execution.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nTed Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946, at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers in Burlington, Vermont. His biological father's identity has never been confirmed, and his original birth certificate assigns paternity to a salesman and United States Air Force veteran named Lloyd Marshall. However, a copy of the certificate lists his father as unknown. Bundy's mother, Eleanor Louise Cowell, claimed that she met a war veteran named Jack Worthington, who abandoned her soon after she became pregnant. Census records reveal that several men by the name of John Worthington and Lloyd Marshall lived near Bundy's mother when he was conceived.\n\nSome family members have expressed suspicions that Bundy was sired by Louise's own father, but in the 2020 documentary film Crazy, Not Insane, psychiatrist Dorothy Otnow Lewis claimed that she received a sample of Bundy's blood and that a DNA test had confirmed that he was not the product of incest.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nTed Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946, at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers in Burlington, Vermont.

In 1967, he became romantically involved with a UW classmate, Diane Edwards, who was identified in Bundy biographies by several pseudonyms, most commonly Stephanie Brooks. Bundy later described Edwards as \"the only woman I ever really loved.\"\n\n**First Murders**\n\nThere is no consensus as to when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. Bundy told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in Ocean City, New Jersey, in 1969, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City while visiting family in Philadelphia in 1969.\n\nBundy hinted to homicide detective Robert Keppel that he committed a murder in Seattle in 1972 and another murder in 1973 that involved a hitchhiker near Tumwater, but he refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believed that he might have started killing as a teenager. Bundy's earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974, when he was 27.\n\n**Murder Spree in the Western States**\n\nIn 1974, Bundy received a second acceptance from the University of Utah Law School and moved to Salt Lake City, leaving Kloepfer in Seattle. While he called Kloepfer often, he dated \"at least a dozen\" other women. As he studied the first-year law curriculum a second time, Bundy was devastated to find out that the other students \"had something, some intellectual capacity\" that he did not. He found the classes completely incomprehensible \"It was a great disappointment to me,\" he said.\n\nA new string of homicides began the following month, including two that would remain undiscovered until Bundy confessed to them shortly before his execution. In August 1975, Bundy was arrested by Utah Highway Patrol officer Bob Hayward in Granger, another Salt Lake City suburb.\n\n**Arrest and First Trial**\n\nOn August 16, 1975, Bundy was arrested by Utah Highway Patrol officer Bob Hayward in Granger, another Salt Lake City suburb. Hayward observed Bundy cruising a residential area in his Volkswagen Beetle during the pre-dawn hours, and fleeing at high speed after seeing the patrol car. He noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats, and searched the car.\n\nHe found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an ice pick, and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools. Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing, he had found the handcuffs in a dumpster, and the rest were common household items.\n\n**Escapes**\n\nOn June 7, 1977, Bundy was transported 40 miles from the Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs to Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for a preliminary hearing. He had elected to serve as his own attorney, and as such was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles. During a recess, Bundy asked to visit the courthouse's law library to research his case.\n\nWhile shielded from his guards' view behind a bookcase, he opened a window and jumped to the ground from the second story, injuring his right ankle as he landed.\n\n**Florida Murders and Rearrest**\n\nFrom Chicago, Bundy traveled by train to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was present in a local tavern on January 2. Five days later, he stole a car and drove south to Atlanta, where he boarded a bus and arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, on the morning of January 8.\n\nHe stayed for one night at a hotel before renting a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police.\n\nHe reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing money and credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts at local grocery stores.\n\n**Subsequent Trials, Marriage**\n\nIn May 1978, a Florida grand jury indicted Bundy on charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and burglary for the Omega Chi killings and assaults. He stood trial in June 1979 in the Florida Circuit Court for Dade County, with judge Edward Cowart presiding.\n\nThe trial was covered by 250 reporters from five continents and was the first to be televised nationally in the United States. Despite the presence of five court-appointed attorneys, Bundy again handled much of his own defense.\n\n**Death Row, Confessions, and Execution**\n\nShortly after the conclusion of the Leach trial and the beginning of the long appeals process that followed, Bundy initiated a series of interviews with Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth.

in 1987, he confided to Keppel that there were \"some murders\" that he would \"never talk about,\" because they were committed \"too close to home,\" \"too close to family\" or involved \"victims who were very young\" [397] Minutes before his execution, Hagmaier queried Bundy about unsolved homicides in New Jersey, Vermont, Illinois, Texas and Florida Bundy provided directions—later proven inaccurate—to Curtis' burial site in Utah, but denied involvement in any of the open cases [398] In 2011, Bundy's complete DNA profile, obtained from a vial of his blood found in an evidence vault, was added to the FBI's DNA database for future reference in these and other unsolved murder cases: [399]\n\n\nIdaho, Utah, Colorado\nIn August 1974, Bundy received a second acceptance from the University of Utah Law School and moved to Salt Lake City, leaving Kloepfer in Seattle While he called Kloepfer often, he dated \"at least a dozen\" other women [129] As he studied the first-year law curriculum a second time, Bundy was devastated to find out that the other students \"had something, some intellectual capacity\" that he did not He found the classes completely incomprehensible \"It was a great disappointment to me,\" he said [130] A new string of homicides began the following month, including two that would remain undiscovered until Bundy confessed to them shortly before his execution.\n\n\nArrest and first trial\nOn August 16, 1975, Bundy was arrested by Utah Highway Patrol officer Bob Hayward in Granger, another Salt Lake City suburb [172] Hayward observed Bundy cruising a residential area in his Volkswagen Beetle during the pre-dawn hours, and fleeing at high speed after seeing the patrol car [173] He noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats, and searched the car He found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an ice pick and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing, he had found the handcuffs in a dumpster and the rest were common household items [174] However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, and Bundy's name from Kloepfer's phone call a month later In a search of Bundy's apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn, [175] and a brochure that advertised the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful, where Kent had disappeared [176] Police did not have sufficient evidence to detain Bundy, so he was released on his own recognizance He later said that searchers missed a hidden collection of Polaroid photographs of his victims, which he destroyed after he was released [177]\n\n\nEscapes\nOn June 7, 1977, Bundy was transported 40 miles (64 km) from the Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs to Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for a preliminary hearing He had elected to serve as his own attorney, and as such was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles [198] During a recess, Bundy asked to visit the courthouse's law library to research his case While shielded from his guards' view behind a bookcase, he opened a window and jumped to the ground from the second story, injuring his right ankle as he landed.\n\n\nFlorida murders and rearrest\nFrom Chicago, Bundy traveled by train to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was present in a local tavern on January 2 [215] Five days later, he stole a car and drove south to Atlanta, where he boarded a bus and arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, on the morning of January 8 He stayed for one night at a hotel before renting a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus [216] Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police; [217] but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification [218] He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing money and credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts at local grocery stores [219]\n\n\nSubsequent trials, marriage\nIn May 1978, a Florida grand jury indicted Bundy on charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and burglary for the Omega Chi killings and assaults He stood trial in June 1979 in the Florida Circuit Court for Dade County, with judge Edward Cowart presiding [240] The trial was covered by 250 reporters from five continents and was the first to be televised nationally in the United States [241] Despite the presence of five court-appointed attorneys, Bundy again handled much of his own defense From the beginning, he \"sabotaged the entire defense effort out of spite, distrust, and grandiose delusion,\" Nelson later wrote \"Ted  [was] facing murder charges, with a possible death sentence, and all that mattered to him apparently was that he be in charge.\" [242]\n\n\nDeath row, confessions and execution\nShortly after the conclusion of the Leach trial and the beginning of the long appeals process that followed, Bundy initiated a series of interviews with Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth Speaking mostly in third person to avoid \"the stigma of confession,\" he began for the first time to divulge details of his crimes and thought processes [266] Bundy recounted his career as a thief, confirming Kloepfer's long-time suspicion that he had shoplifted virtually everything of substance that he owned [267] \"The big payoff for me,\" he said, \"was actually possessing whatever it was I had stolen I really enjoyed having something .. that I had wanted and gone out and taken.\" Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well [268] Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to \"totally possess\" his victims [269] At first, he killed his victims \"as a matter of expediency .. to eliminate the possibility of  [being] caught\"; but later, murder became part of the \"adventure.\" \"The ultimate possession was, in fact, the taking of the life,\" he said \"And then .. the physical possession of the remains.\" [270]\n\n\nModus operandi and victim profiles\nBundy was an unusually organized and calculating criminal who used his extensive knowledge of law enforcement methodologies to elude identification and capture for years [312] His crime scenes were distributed over large geographic areas; his victim count had risen to at least 20 before it became clear that numerous investigators in widely disparate jurisdictions were hunting the same man [313] Bundy's assault methods of choice were blunt trauma and strangulation, two relatively silent techniques that could be accomplished with common household items [314] He deliberately avoided firearms due to the noise they made and the ballistic evidence they left behind [315] He was a \"meticulous researcher\" who explored his surroundings in minute detail, looking for safe sites to seize and dispose of victims [316] He was unusually skilled at minimizing physical evidence [77] Bundy's fingerprints were never found at a crime scene, nor any other incontrovertible evidence of his guilt, a fact he repeated often during the years in which he attempted to maintain his innocence [317]\n\n\nPathology\nBundy underwent multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts' conclusions varied Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and an authority on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, [346] but later changed her impression more than once [5] [347] She also suggested the possibility of a multiple personality disorder, based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony; a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy \"seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person ..  [she] suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station He had turned into a stranger.\" [24] Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: \"He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality .. that was the day I was afraid of him.'\" [348]\n\n\nVictims\nThe night before his execution, Bundy confessed to 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage speculation [316] He told Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder \"publicized,\" there \"could be one that was not.\" [380] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, \"Add one digit to that, and you'll have it.\" [381] Years later he told Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, [316] but Keppel wrote that \" [Ted] and I both knew  [the total] was much higher.\" [76] In an interview, Keppel stated his belief that Bundy had killed \"at least 50, and maybe 75.\" [382]\n\n\nConfirmed\nThe night before his execution, Bundy confessed to 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage speculation [316] He told Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder \"publicized,\" there \"could be one that was not.\" [380] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, \"Add one digit to that, and you'll have it.\" [381] Years later he told Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, [316] but Keppel wrote that \" [Ted] and I both knew  [the total] was much higher.\" [76] In an interview, Keppel stated his belief that Bundy had killed \"at least 50, and maybe 75.\" [382]\n\n\n1974\nBundy remains a suspect in several unsolved homicides and disappearances, and is likely responsible for others that may never be identified; in 1987, he confided to Keppel that there were \"some murders\" that he would \"never talk about,\" because they were committed \"too close to home,\" \"too close to family\" or involved \"victims who were very young\" [397] Minutes before his execution, Hagmaier queried Bundy about unsolved homicides in New Jersey, Vermont, Illinois, Texas and Florida Bundy provided directions—later proven inaccurate—to Curtis' burial site in Utah, but denied involvement in any of the open cases [398] In 2011, Bundy's complete DNA profile, obtained from a vial of his blood found in an evidence vault, was added to the FBI's DNA database for future reference in these and other unsolved murder cases: [399]\n\n\nWashington, Oregon\nBundy remains a suspect in several unsolved homicides and disappearances, and is likely responsible for others that may never be identified;
