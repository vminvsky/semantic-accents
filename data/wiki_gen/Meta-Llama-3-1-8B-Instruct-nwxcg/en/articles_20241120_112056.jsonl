Her disappearance sparked a large-scale search operation by Lancashire Constabulary, which was later assisted by a private search team led by Peter Faulding. This article provides a detailed account of the events surrounding Bulley's disappearance and the subsequent investigation.\n\n**Background**\n\nNicola Bulley was born in 1977 and grew up near Chelmsford in Essex. She was educated at William de Ferrers School in South Woodham Ferrers and later attended Thurrock Technical College from 1994 to 1996. After completing her education, Bulley moved to Lancashire, where she lived with her partner and two school-age daughters. Bulley worked as a mortgage adviser and had been experiencing issues related to alcohol and her perimenopause condition. Police and health professionals had attended the family home on January 10 to respond to a \"concern for welfare.\"\n\n**Disappearance**\n\nOn January 27, 2023, Bulley drove from her home to the nearby village of St Michael's on Wyre, where she dropped off her children at school at approximately 08:40 GMT. After dropping off her children, Bulley walked along the River Wyre with her springer spaniel. At 08:53, Bulley sent an email to her employer, and at 08:57, she sent a text to a friend to arrange a meet-up for their children that week. She then joined a Microsoft Teams call at 09:01, keeping her phone's camera and microphone disengaged.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nAfter the report of Bulley's disappearance, Lancashire Constabulary immediately graded Bulley as \"high risk\" due to her specific vulnerabilities, including significant issues with alcohol and her ongoing struggles with the menopause. The classification increased the priority and resources assigned to the investigation. Lancashire Constabulary worked closely with the private search team led by Peter Faulding, which used side-scan sonar to search the River Wyre.\n\n**Private Search Team**\n\nPeter Faulding led an independent search effort by his company, Specialist Group International, that used side-scan sonar. He described Bulley's disappearance as \"strange\" and said that in his 20-year career, he had \"never seen something so unusual.\" Faulding stated that his team were unable to locate Bulley in the area of the River Wyre where detectives thought she may have entered the water, saying, \"That area is completely negative—there is no sign of Nicola in that area.\" Faulding believed it was unlikely that Bulley had been swept out to sea, adding, \"My personal view is that I think it is a long way to go in a tidal river.\"\n\n**Recovery of Body and Inquest**\n\nOn February 19, 2023, a man and woman walking their dog discovered Bulley's body adjacent to a fallen tree in the River Wyre, about one mile downstream from St Michael's on Wyre. The couple informed the police, and the body was subsequently recovered from among reeds and undergrowth. Police set up a tent beside the river and a police helicopter operated above the area. Some members of the public tried to take photos of the body by climbing over a fence and pretending to be journalists; a man was later arrested and bailed for a malicious communications offense and perverting the course of justice.\n\n**Criticism of the Media and of Lancashire Police**\n\nAfter confirming Bulley's death at a press conference, Lancashire Police read a statement from Bulley's family, in which they condemned the actions of Sky News and ITV News for making contact directly with them when they had expressly requested privacy. The family described the conduct of media outlets as \"shameful.\" On February 21, the broadcasting regulator Ofcom said it was \"extremely concerned\" to hear complaints about media conduct made by Bulley's family and wrote to both ITV and Sky News to ask them to explain their actions.\n\n**Independent Review**\n\nIn November 2023, a report of an independent review of Lancashire Police's handling of Bulley's disappearance was published. The report criticized the force for publicly revealing details of Bulley's health but also for failing to adequately brief the media, which led to public speculation. The report concluded that senior staff at the force made errors of judgment in transparency and in the failure to support lower-ranked officers. The report also stated that the involvement of the private search team undermined the police's work as well as the public's trust in the force.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of missing persons in the United Kingdom\n\n**References**\n\nThis article has been written without references to maintain a neutral and encyclopedic tone.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Disappearance_of_Nicola_Bulley\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nNicola Bulley was born in 1977 and grew up near Chelmsford in Essex [1] She was educated at William de Ferrers School in South Woodham Ferrers [2] and at Thurrock Technical College from 1994 to 1996;

It is the sequel to the 2013 game The Last of Us, which was critically acclaimed for its storytelling, characters, and gameplay. The game was released on June 19, 2020, for the PlayStation 4 and later remastered for the PlayStation 5.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective, featuring elements of the survival horror genre. The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. Control intermittently switches between Ellie and Abby, and the player also briefly controls Joel in the opening sequence. The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat. The player can break glass objects such as windows to access certain areas or obtain supplies. Some areas are navigated by horse or boat.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe game takes place four years after the events of the first game. Joel and Ellie have built a life in Jackson, Wyoming, though their relationship has become strained. While on patrol, Joel and Tommy rescue a stranger, Abby, from an Infected horde. They return to an outpost used as a temporary hideout by Abby's group, former Fireflies now part of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF), a militia group based in Seattle, Washington. The group attack Joel and Tommy; Abby seeks revenge against Joel for murdering her father, the Firefly surgeon who was to perform the operation on Ellie. Meanwhile, Ellie and her girlfriend, Dina, search for the brothers. Ellie enters the WLF outpost and witnesses Abby beat Joel to death. Abby spares Ellie and Tommy, who swear revenge.\n\n**Development**\n\nEarly story concepts for The Last of Us Part II were conceived during the development of The Last of Us in 2013. Naughty Dog began development in 2014, soon after the release of The Last of Us Remastered. By August 2017, with the release of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, the entire 350-person team at Naughty Dog had shifted to develop Part II. Neil Druckmann led development as creative director and writer, reprising his role from The Last of Us and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. Anthony Newman and Kurt Margenau were selected to be co-game directors for Part II, overseeing gameplay elements such as level design and mechanics. For the final months of development, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the team operated via remote work arrangements. In total, approximately 2,169 developers across 14 studios worked on the game. According to documents from publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment, the 70-month development peaked at 200 full-time employees and cost around US$220 million, making it one of the most expensive video games to develop.\n\n**Release and Promotion**\n\nThe Last of Us Part II was announced at the PlayStation Experience event on December 3, 2016. At E3 2018, Druckmann said that Naughty Dog was refusing to announce a release date until the game was \"very close to release\", to avoid disappointing fans. During Sony's State of Play presentation on September 24, 2019, Naughty Dog announced a release date of February 21, 2020. On October 25, Druckmann announced a delay to May 29, 2020, to \"bring the entire game up to a level of polish we would call Naughty Dog quality\". On April 2, 2020, Sony announced that the game was almost complete but had been indefinitely delayed due to logistical problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In late April, several videos leaked online, showing cutscenes, gameplay, and significant plot details. Druckmann tweeted that he was \"heartbroken\" for fans and for the team, who had devoted years to development. On April 27, Sony announced a release date of June 19, 2020.\n\n**Remaster**\n\nIn November 2023, following a PlayStation Store listing leak, Naughty Dog announced a remastered version of the game, titled The Last of Us Part II Remastered. It was released for the PlayStation 5 on January 19, 2024; existing owners can purchase the game digitally for US$10. A special edition version, including a SteelBook case, trading cards, patch, and pins, was made available in some regions. Remastered features visual improvements, faster loading times, DualSense integration, audio description, a speedrun-focused mode, and an audio commentary for cutscenes featuring Druckmann, Gross, Johnson, Baker, Bailey, and Woodward.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Last of Us Part II received \"universal acclaim\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic, and 94% of critics recommended the game, according to OpenCritic. It was praised for its improved gameplay, graphical fidelity, cast performances, characters, audio design, and music. Critics were divided on its challenging narrative and mature themes. IGN's Jonathon Dornbush called it \"a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor\", noting, atop its improved gameplay, it \"still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit\". Game Informer's Andy McNamara called it \"the best narrative game I have played\" and \"a sequel unlike any other, taking video game storytelling to new heights\". Kaity Kline of NPR wrote that it \"made me very aware of the little things in my life that I take for granted, the kinds of things you don't appreciate until they're ripped away forever\". GameSpot's Kallie Plagge called it \"beautiful and devastating\", and wrote \"the more I reflect on it, the more I appreciate the story and characters at its core\".\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nThe Last of Us Part II received \"universal acclaim\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic, and 94% of critics recommended the game, according to OpenCritic.

Video Games Chronicle's Jordan Middler called it \"the best way to play one of the best games ever made\", and Push Square's Aaron Bayne felt it was perfectly partnered with the first game's remake, The Last of Us Part I. Siliconera's Cory Dinkel wrote it \"does far more than simply justify its existence on the PS5, it elevates an already near-perfect experience\". Digital Trends's Giovanni Colantonio compared it to a Criterion Collection re-release, and The Guardian's Keith Stuart compared replaying the game to \"rereading a favourite novel\".\n\n**Audience Response**\n\nThe Last of Us Part II was the subject of review bombing on Metacritic, resulting in a user review score of 3.4/10 at its nadir. Reporters noticed the review bombing occurred shortly after the game launched—too early for users to feasibly have finished it. Some suggested that the reviews were based on the incomplete plot leaks. Many negative reviews criticized the characterization and plot. CNET's Daniel Van Boom wrote that the review bombers did not represent the majority of players. The incident led Metacritic to implement a 36-hour waiting period after release before allowing user reviews.\n\n**Developer Response**\n\nPolygon's Hernandez observed that the discourse surrounding The Last of Us Part II had become adversarial, with \"bigots\" attacking the game for its diverse cast and Naughty Dog becoming defensive. Vice's Zacny claimed that, in response to his critical review, Sony contacted him on behalf of Naughty Dog to discuss his criticisms, which they disagreed with. A different tweet from Schreier stated that \"video games are too long\", which he later clarified was criticizing longer games being made for marketing purposes.

It was named runner-up by several other publications. At the 38th Golden Joystick Awards in November 2020, it won all six awards for which it was nominated.

By August 2020, it had become the third-highest-grossing PlayStation game in the United States. By June 2022, the game had sold over ten million copies worldwide.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nCritics concurred that The Last of Us Part II was among the best games of the eighth generation of video game consoles and a great closing title before the ninth. An internal review by Sony's competitor Microsoft—published as a court document in the Epic Games v Apple lawsuit in 2021—said the game \"sets a new bar for what we should hope to be able to achieve going into a new generation of consoles\".

existing owners can purchase the game digitally for US$10 A special edition version, including a SteelBook case, trading cards, patch, and pins, was made available in some regions [74] Remastered features visual improvements, faster loading times, DualSense integration, audio description, a speedrun-focused mode, and an audio commentary for cutscenes featuring Druckmann, Gross, Johnson, Baker, Bailey, and Woodward [74] [75] Some journalists and players questioned whether the game needed a remaster within four years of its initial release, though others felt it was justified by the additions and price point [76] [77] [78]\n\n\nReception\nThe Last of Us Part II received \"universal acclaim\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic, [83] and 94% of critics recommended the game, according to OpenCritic [84] It was praised for its improved gameplay, [1] [2] [87] graphical fidelity, [2] [5] [86] cast performances, [85] [88] [89] characters, [1] [5] [7] audio design, [5] [88] [90] and music, [86] [91] [92] though critics were divided on its challenging narrative and mature themes [7] [8] [86] [90] IGN's Jonathon Dornbush called it \"a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor\", noting, atop its improved gameplay, it \"still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit\" [5] Game Informer's Andy McNamara called it \"the best narrative game I have played\" and \"a sequel unlike any other, taking video game storytelling to new heights\" [86] Kaity Kline of NPR wrote that it \"made me very aware of the little things in my life that I take for granted, the kinds of things you don't appreciate until they're ripped away forever\" [93] GameSpot's Kallie Plagge called it \"beautiful and devastating\", and wrote \"the more I reflect on it, the more I appreciate the story and characters at its core\" [1]\n\n\nCritical response\nThe Last of Us Part II received \"universal acclaim\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic, [83] and 94% of critics recommended the game, according to OpenCritic [84] It was praised for its improved gameplay, [1] [2] [87] graphical fidelity, [2] [5] [86] cast performances, [85] [88] [89] characters, [1] [5] [7] audio design, [5] [88] [90] and music, [86] [91] [92] though critics were divided on its challenging narrative and mature themes [7] [8] [86] [90] IGN's Jonathon Dornbush called it \"a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor\", noting, atop its improved gameplay, it \"still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit\" [5] Game Informer's Andy McNamara called it \"the best narrative game I have played\" and \"a sequel unlike any other, taking video game storytelling to new heights\" [86] Kaity Kline of NPR wrote that it \"made me very aware of the little things in my life that I take for granted, the kinds of things you don't appreciate until they're ripped away forever\" [93] GameSpot's Kallie Plagge called it \"beautiful and devastating\", and wrote \"the more I reflect on it, the more I appreciate the story and characters at its core\" [1]\n\n\nRemastered\nThe Last of Us Part II Remastered received \"universal acclaim\" according to Metacritic, [99] and 90% of critics recommended the game according to OpenCritic [100] Video Games Chronicle's Jordan Middler called it \"the best way to play one of the best games ever made\", [105] and Push Square's Aaron Bayne felt it was perfectly partnered with the first game's remake, The Last of Us Part I (2022) [104] Siliconera's Cory Dinkel wrote it \"does far more than simply justify its existence on the PS5, it elevates an already near-perfect experience\" [106] Digital Trends's Giovanni Colantonio compared it to a Criterion Collection re-release [107] and The Guardian's Keith Stuart compared replaying the game to \"rereading a favourite novel\" [108]\n\n\nAudience response\nThe Last of Us Part II was the subject of review bombing on Metacritic, resulting in a user review score of 3.4/10 at its nadir [116] [117] Reporters noticed the review bombing occurred shortly after the game launched—too early for users to feasibly have finished it; [118] some suggested that the reviews were based on the incomplete plot leaks [97] [117] Many negative reviews criticized the characterization and plot; [116] [118] some complained of \"social justice warrior\" politics, with vitriolic responses to LGBT characters [97] [116] CNET's Daniel Van Boom wrote that the review bombers did not represent the majority of players, [119] while Kotaku's MacLeod identified thousands of positive reviews and felt Metacritic's system, which emphasizes scores over critique, comprised only \"a bunch of meaningless numbers and a lot of rage\" [118] The incident led Metacritic to implement a 36-hour waiting period after release before allowing user reviews [120]\n\n\nDeveloper response\nPolygon's Hernandez observed that the discourse surrounding The Last of Us Part II had become adversarial, with \"bigots\" attacking the game for its diverse cast and Naughty Dog becoming defensive [140] Vice's Zacny claimed that, in response to his critical review, Sony contacted him on behalf of Naughty Dog to discuss his criticisms, which they disagreed with; Zacny said the discussion, while cordial, was unusual from a large publisher [140] On Twitter, Druckmann expressed disapproval after journalist Jason Schreier mocked a reviewer's comparison of Part II to Schindler's List (1993); Schreier felt his reporting on Naughty Dog's crunch conditions prompted Druckmann's disapproval [141] A different tweet from Schreier stated that \"video games are too long\", which he later clarified was criticizing longer games being made for marketing purposes; Baker responded to the original tweet with a quote from US president Theodore Roosevelt about critics being less valuable than creators, which Schreier felt was an overreaction [140] Hernandez concluded that critics fearing backlash from publishers and fans was \"not an environment that is conducive to encouraging honest reviews or critical discussion, which is ultimately a disservice to the game itself\" [140] USgamer's Bailey wrote that the strict review embargo prevented meaningful discussion of the narrative [142] Druckmann acknowledged the leaks prompted the embargo as he had felt reviews discussing plot details would have become more harmful and widespread than the leaks [64]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe Last of Us Part II won more than 320 Game of the Year awards, [143] which several outlets claimed broke the record set by The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015); [144] [145] [146] it was later surpassed by Elden Ring (2022) [143] [147] The game was awarded from outlets and shows such as Den of Geek, [148] Digital Trends, [149] Electronic Gaming Monthly, [150] Empire, [151] Entertainment Weekly, [152] Game Informer, [153] PlayStation Blog, [154] Push Square, [155] and the Titanium Awards [156] It was named runner-up by several other publications [157] [158] [159] [160] At the 38th Golden Joystick Awards in November 2020, it won all six awards for which it was nominated: Ultimate Game of the Year, Best Audio, Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, PlayStation Game of the Year, and Studio of the Year for Naughty Dog [161] It led the nominees for The Game Awards 2020 with eleven nominations, [162] of which it won seven, the most in the show's history: Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, Best Audio Design, Innovation in Accessibility, Best Action/Adventure, and Best Performance (for Bailey) [163]\n\n\nSales\nIn its release weekend, The Last of Us Part II sold over four million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 exclusive, beating Marvel's Spider-Man's 3.3 million and God of War's 3.1 million in the same period [175] [176] It had the biggest launch of 2020 for both physical and digital sales [177] On the PlayStation Store, it was the most-downloaded PlayStation 4 game in North America and Europe in June; [178] in July, it was fifth in North America and tenth in Europe; [179] in November, it was the eighth in North America and seventh in Europe; [180] and overall for 2020, it ranked sixth in North America and eighth in Europe [181] In the United States, it was the best-selling game of June 2020 and became the third-best-selling game of the year within two weeks, generating the highest first-month sales of the year [182] By August 2020, it had become the third-highest-grossing PlayStation game in the United States, behind Marvel's Spider-Man and God of War [183] Overall, it was the sixth-best-selling game of the year in the United States; [184] it was the third-best-selling for PlayStation consoles, and the best-selling PlayStation 4-only game [185] By June 2022, the game had sold over ten million copies worldwide [186]\n\n\nLegacy\nCritics concurred that The Last of Us Part II was among the best games of the eighth generation of video game consoles [195] and a great closing title before the ninth [91] [115] [196] [197] An internal review by Sony's competitor Microsoft—published as a court document in the Epic Games v Apple lawsuit in 2021—said the game \"sets a new bar for what we should hope to be able to achieve going into a new generation of consoles\" [198] [199] Many outlets considered it among the greatest video games ever made, [200] and some called it one of the best-written [201] [202]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side [17]\n\n\nFirst golden era and subsequent decline\nAfter being relegated to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965 [23] In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed In the first season under Mercer, Manchester City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell [24] Two seasons later, in 1967–68, City claimed the league championship for the second time, beating their close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 victory at Newcastle United [25] Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 and a year later triumphed in the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in the 1970 final This was the club's only European honour until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League [26] The Blues also won the League Cup that year, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season.\n\n\nRecovery and two takeovers\nAfter relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline [32] Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second Division play-off final against Gillingham [33] A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 First Division championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single season in the process [34] The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a derby win [35] Additionally, City qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years via UEFA fair play ranking In the close 2003–04 season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first foreign manager when appointed in 2007 [36] After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008; [37] he was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later [38]\n\n\nSecond golden era and arrival of Pep Guardiola\nContinued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality City reached the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals, [44] the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975 The Blues defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City beat out Arsenal for the third place, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage [45]\n\n\nLeague history\nManchester City's home colours are sky blue and white Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side [69]: 14–15  The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison's belief that adopting the colours of AC Milan would inspire City to glory [70] Allison's theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup final, 1970 League Cup final, and 1970 Cup Winners' Cup final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.\n\n\nClub badge and colours\nManchester City's home colours are sky blue and white Traditional away kit

Stadium, the club's average attendances have been in the top six in England, [122] [123] usually in excess of 40,000 Even in the late 1990s, when City were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then the Second Division, now the EFL League One), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average of fewer than 8,000 for the division [124] Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimated a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by

Manchester derby Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves \"supporters\" of only one This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481) The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further [133]\n\n\nOwnership and finances\nThe holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders

A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.\n\n**Early years and first trophies**\n\nManchester City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; the Blues narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the league campaign, but they still became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour. In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United.\n\n**First golden era and subsequent decline**\n\nAfter being relegated to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965. In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, Manchester City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell. Two seasons later, in 1967–68, City claimed the league championship for the second time, beating their close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 victory at Newcastle United. Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 and a year later triumphed in the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in the 1970 final. This was the club's only European honour until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League. The Blues also won the League Cup that year, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season.\n\n**Recovery and two takeovers**\n\nAfter relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline. Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second Division play-off final against Gillingham. A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 First Division championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single season in the process. The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a derby win. Additionally, City qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years via UEFA fair play ranking. In the close 2003–04 season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first foreign manager when appointed in 2007. After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008; he was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later.\n\n**Second golden era and arrival of Pep Guardiola**\n\nContinued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals, the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. The Blues defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City beat out Arsenal for the third place, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.\n\n**League history**\n\nManchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side. The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison's belief that adopting the colours of AC Milan would inspire City to glory. Allison's theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup final, 1970 League Cup final, and 1970 Cup Winners' Cup final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.\n\n**Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors**\n\nManchester City's kit suppliers have included Umbro, and in recent years, Nike. Shirt sponsors have included Hertel, Sharp, and in recent years, Etihad Airways.\n\n**Players**\n\nManchester City's current first-team squad is as follows:\n\n**EDS and Academy**\n\nThe following players have previously made appearances or have appeared on the substitutes bench for the first team.\n\n**Out on loan**\n\nThe following players are currently out on loan.\n\n**Retired numbers**\n\nSince 2003, Manchester City have not issued the squad number 23. It was retired in memory of Marc-Vivien Foé, who was on loan to the club from Lyon at the time of his death on the field of play while playing for Cameroon in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n**Club captains**\n\nThe following is a list of City's official club captains, who are currently appointed via a vote of players and staff. Other players (vice-captains) have led the team on the pitch when the club captain is not playing or not available. Some players have been made captain on a one-off basis to celebrate or commemorate an event.\n\n**Player of the Year**\n\nEach season since the end of the 1966–67 season, the members of the Manchester City Official Supporters Club have voted by ballot to choose the player on the team they feel is the most worthy of recognition for his performances during that season. The following table lists the recipients of this award since 2000.\n\n**Halls of Fame**\n\nThe following former Manchester City players and managers have been inducted into the Manchester City F.C Hall of Fame, and are listed according to the year of their induction:\n\nThe following former Manchester City players and managers have been inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame (a.k.a the National Football Museum Hall of Fame), and are listed according to the year of their induction within the various categories:\n\nThe following former Manchester City players and managers have been inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame (a.k.a the Scottish Football Museum Hall of Fame), and are listed according to the year of their induction within the various categories:\n\nThe following former Manchester City players have been inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame, and are listed according to the year of their induction.\n\n**Non-playing staff**\n\nThe following are some notable non-playing staff at Manchester City:\n\n**Ownership and finances**\n\nThe holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

Before moving to the stadium, the club spent in excess of £30 million to convert it to football use: the pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand was constructed. The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over Barcelona in a friendly match. A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season, increasing the stadium's capacity to 55,097.

became unusual and the rivalry intensified A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481) The report noted that since the compiling of data in

{"title": "Catherine_de'_Medici", "content": "\nBirth and upbringing\nCatherine de' Medici was born Caterina Maria Romula de' Medici [8] on 13 April 1519 in Florence, Republic of Florence, the only child of Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino, and his wife, Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne, the countess of Boulogne The young couple had been married the year before at Amboise as part of the alliance between King Francis I of France and Lorenzo's uncle Pope Leo X against the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I According to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine was born, her parents were \"as pleased as if it had been a boy\".\n\n\nMarriage\nOn her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described Catherine as \"small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family\" [18] Suitors, however, lined up for her hand, including James V of Scotland who sent the Duke of Albany to Clement to conclude a marriage in April and November 1530 [19] When Francis I of France proposed his second son, Henry, Duke of Orléans, in early 1533, Clement jumped at the offer Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who, despite her wealth, was of common origin.\n\n\nDauphine\n In 1536, Henry's older brother, Francis, caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever and died shortly after, leaving Henry the heir Suspicions of poison abounded, from Catherine to Emperor Charles V [25] Sebastiano de Montecuccoli confessed under torture to poisoning the Dauphin [25]\n\n\nQueen of France\nHenry allowed Catherine almost no political influence as queen [29] Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her formal powers were strictly nominal [30] Henry even gave the Château of Chenonceau, which Catherine had wanted for herself, to his mistress Diane de Poitiers instead, who took her place at the center of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favors The imperial ambassador reported that in the presence of guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts [31] Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat She even encouraged the king to spend more time with Catherine and sire more children [32]\n\n\nQueen mother\nFrancis II became king at the age of fifteen In what has been called a coup d'état, the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Duke of Guise—whose niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, had married Francis II the year before—seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved themselves into the Louvre Palace with the young couple [41] The English ambassador reported a few days later that \"the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king\" [42] For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis's government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself [43] Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: \"This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that ...\" Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the Château de Chenonceau to the crown She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane's building work there.\n\n\nReign of Francis II\nFrancis II became king at the age of fifteen In what has been called a coup d'état, the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Duke of Guise—whose niece, Mary, Queen of Scots,

and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that ...\" Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the Château de Chenonceau to the crown She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane's building work there.\n\n\nReign of Charles IX\nCharles IX was ten years old at the time of his royal consecration, during which he cried At first Catherine kept him very close to her, and even slept in his chamber She presided over his council, decided policy, and controlled state business and patronage However, she was never in a position to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown The challenges Catherine faced were complex and, in some ways, difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner [52]\n\n\nHuguenots\nOn 17 August 1563, Charles IX was declared of age at the Parlement of Rouen, but he was never able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government [5] Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the Edict of Amboise and revive loyalty to the crown To this end, she set out with Charles and the court on a progress around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565 [62] Catherine held talks with Jeanne d'Albret, the Protestant queen regnant of Navarre (and the wife of Antoine de Bourbon) at Mâcon and Nérac She also met her daughter Elisabeth at Bayonne near the Spanish border, amidst lavish court festivities Philip II excused himself from the occasion He sent the Duke of Alba to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy [63]\n\n\nSt. Bartholomew's Day massacre\nThree days later, Admiral Coligny was walking back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm [78] A smoking arquebus was discovered in a window, but the culprit had made his escape from the rear of the building on a waiting horse [79] Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon Ambroise Paré removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king [80] Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader [81]\n\n\nReign of Henry III\nTwo years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three His dying words were \"oh, my mother ...\" The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he had been elected king the year before However, three months after his coronation at Wawel Cathedral, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become King of France Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: \"I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end .. My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you.\" [86]\n\n\nCatholic League\nMany leading Roman Catholics were appalled by Catherine's attempts to appease the Huguenots After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion [99] The death of the heir to the throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the Catholic League He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle Cardinal Charles de Bourbon on the throne instead In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the treaty of Joinville with Spain, and prepared to make war on the \"heretics\" [100] By 1585, Henry III had no choice but to go to war against the League [101] As Catherine put it, \"peace is carried on a stick\" (bâton porte paix) [102] \"Take care\", she wrote to the king, \"especially about your person There is so much treachery about that I die of fear.\" [103]\n\n\nLast months and death\nHenry hired Swiss troops to help him defend himself in Paris The Parisians, however, claimed the right to defend the city themselves On 12 May 1588, they set up barricades in the streets and refused to take orders from anyone except the Duke of Guise [108] When Catherine tried to go to Mass, she found her way barred, though she was allowed through the barricades The chronicler L'Estoile reported that she cried all through her lunch that day She wrote to Bellièvre, \"Never have I seen myself in such trouble or with so little light by which to escape.\" [109] As usual, Catherine advised the king, who had fled the city in the nick of time, to compromise and live to fight another day On 15 June 1588, Henry duly signed the Act of Union, which gave in to all the League's latest demands.\n\n\nPatron of the arts\nCatherine believed in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms [119] She was inspired by the example of her father-in-law, King Francis I of France, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her Medici ancestors In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades During this time, she presided over a distinctive late French Renaissance culture in all branches of the arts [120]\n\n\nCulinary legend\nThe legend that de' Medici introduced a long list of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France is discredited by food historians [138] Barbara Ketcham Wheaton and Stephen Mennell provided the definitive arguments against these claims [139] [140] They point out that Catherine's father-in-law, King Francis I, and the flower of the French aristocracy had dined at some of Italy's most élite tables during the king's Italian campaigns (and that an earlier generation had done so during King Charles VIII's invasion of 1494); that a vast Italian entourage had visited France for the wedding of Catherine de' Medici's father to her French-born mother; and that she had little influence at court until her husband's death because he was so besotted by his mistress, Diane de Poitiers In fact, a large population of Italians—bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci—had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning Renaissance Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine [141]\n\n\nLinks to the occult\nCatherine de' Medici has been labelled by Wiccan Gerald Gardner a \"sinister Queen .. noted for her interest in the occult arts\" [143] Catherine and Henry's inability to produce an heir for the first ten years of their marriage gave rise to suspicion of witchcraft Labouvie suggested that women's power was believed to be the ability to create and sustain life, whilst witches were believed to have the opposite power; that of attacking health, life and fertility [144] An infertile woman, and in particular an infertile queen, was therefore regarded as 'unnatural' and a small step from supernatural Essentially, however, there exists no concrete proof that she took part in the occult, and it is now believed that Catherine's trouble in providing an heir was in fact due to Henry II's penile deformity [145]\n\n\nIssue\nCatherine de' Medici married Henry, Duke of Orléans, the future Henry II of France, in Marseille on 28 October 1533 She gave birth to ten children, of whom four sons and three daughters survived to marriageable age Three of her sons became kings of France, while two of her daughters married kings and one married a duke Catherine outlived all her children except Henry III, who died seven months after her, and Margaret, who inherited her robust health Victoire and Jeanne were twin daughters born in 1556; Jeanne was stillborn due to surgeons breaking her legs to save her mother's life; [b] Victoire survived, dying less than two months later According to the diplomat Simon Renard, the birth nearly killed Catherine, [153] and the royal couple were advised by the King's physician to have no further children.\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Catherine de' Medici\n\nCatherine de' Medici was a member of the powerful Medici family of Florence, Italy. She was born Caterina Maria Romula de' Medici on 13 April 1519 in Florence, Republic of Florence. Her parents were Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino, and Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne, the countess of Boulogne. The young couple had been married the year before at Amboise as part of the alliance between King Francis I of France and Lorenzo's uncle Pope Leo X against the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.\n\n## Birth and Upbringing\n\nCatherine's birth was a significant event, and her parents were reportedly \"as pleased as if it had been a boy.\" She was the only child of her parents, and her upbringing was shaped by her family's wealthy and influential status. As a member of the Medici family, Catherine was educated in the traditional manner of a noblewoman, with a focus on music, dance, and domestic skills. However, she also received a more comprehensive education, studying languages, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\n## Marriage\n\nCatherine's marriage to Henry, Duke of Orléans, was arranged by her family as part of a strategic alliance with the French monarchy. The couple married in Marseille on 28 October 1533, and Catherine became the Duchess of Orléans. Despite her youth and inexperience, Catherine was seen as a valuable prize by her husband's family, bringing with her a significant dowry and a connection to the powerful Medici family.\n\n## Dauphine\n\nCatherine's marriage to Henry was a happy one, and the couple had ten children together. However, their happiness was short-lived, as Henry's older brother, Francis, died suddenly in 1536, leaving Henry the heir to the French throne. This event marked a significant turning point in Catherine's life, as she became the Dauphine of France and was thrust into the spotlight of the French court.\n\n## Queen of France\n\nCatherine's husband, Henry, became King of France in 1547, and Catherine became Queen of France. However, her role as queen was limited, and she was largely overshadowed by her husband's mistress, Diane de Poitiers. Despite this, Catherine was a skilled politician and played a significant role behind the scenes, advising her husband and influencing policy.\n\n## Queen Mother\n\nWhen Catherine's husband, Henry, died in 1559, she became Queen Mother and regent for her son, Francis II. However, Francis's reign was short-lived, and he died in 1560, leaving Catherine to navigate the complexities of French politics once again. She played a significant role in the early years of her grandson, Charles IX's, reign, using her influence to promote the interests of the French monarchy.\n\n## Reign of Charles IX\n\nCatherine's grandson, Charles IX, became king at the age of ten, and she played a significant role in his early years as regent. However, as Charles grew older, he began to assert his independence, and Catherine's influence waned. Despite this, she remained a powerful figure at court, using her influence to promote the interests of the French monarchy.\n\n## Reign of Henry III\n\nWhen Charles IX died in 1574, Catherine's grandson, Henry III, became king, and she once again became Queen Mother and regent. However, Henry's reign was marked by conflict and turmoil, as the French monarchy struggled to maintain its power against the rising tide of Protestantism. Catherine played a significant role in Henry's early years as king, using her influence to promote the interests of the French monarchy.\n\n## Reign of Henry III (continued)\n\nAs the years passed, Catherine's influence waned, and Henry began to assert his independence. However, she remained a powerful figure at court, using her influence to promote the interests of the French monarchy. Despite her advanced age, Catherine remained a force to be reckoned with, using her cunning and intelligence to navigate the complexities of French politics.\n\n## Reign of Henry III (final years)\n\nIn the final years of Henry's reign, Catherine's influence was at its lowest ebb. However, she remained a significant figure at court, using her influence to promote the interests of the French monarchy. Despite her advanced age, Catherine remained a force to be reckoned with, using her cunning and intelligence to navigate the complexities of French politics.\n\n## Catholic League\n\nAs the French monarchy struggled to maintain its power against the rising tide of Protestantism, Catherine found herself at odds with the Catholic League, a powerful organization dedicated to defending the Catholic faith. Despite her advanced age, she remained a force to be reckoned with, using her influence to promote the interests of the French monarchy.\n\n## Last Months and Death\n\nIn the final months of her life, Catherine's health began to decline, and she became increasingly frail. Despite her advanced age, she remained a force to be reckoned with, using her influence to promote the interests of the French monarchy. Catherine de' Medici died on 5 January 1589, at the age of 69, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most powerful women of the Renaissance.\n\n## Patron of the Arts\n\nThroughout her life, Catherine was a patron of the arts, using her wealth and influence to support some of the most talented artists of her time. She was a great admirer of the Medici family's artistic patronage and sought to emulate their example in France. Catherine's patronage of the arts was extensive, and she supported a wide range of artists, including musicians, poets, and painters.\n\n## Culinary Legend\n\nCatherine de' Medici has been credited with introducing a number of Italian culinary innovations to France, including the use of forks and the creation of elaborate sauces. However, this reputation is largely a myth, and there is no evidence to suggest that she had a significant impact on French cuisine.\n\n## Links to the Occult\n\nCatherine de' Medici has been linked to the occult, with some historians suggesting that she was involved in witchcraft and the use of magical powers. However, this reputation is largely a product of speculation and rumor, and there is no concrete evidence to support these claims.\n\n## Issue\n\nCatherine de' Medici had ten children with her husband, Henry, and six of them survived to adulthood. Three of her sons became kings of France, and two of her daughters married kings. Her children included:\n\n* Francis II, King of France\n* Charles IX, King of France\n* Henry III, King of France\n* Margaret, Duchess of Savoy\n* Victoire, Princess of Orléans\n* Jeanne, Princess of Orléans\n\nCatherine's family was a significant part of her life, and she played an active role in their upbringing and education.\n\n## Ancestry\n\nCatherine de' Medici's ancestry is complex, with her family tracing its origins back to the noble families of Italy and France. Her family was one of the most powerful in Italy, and they played a significant role in the politics of the region for centuries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCatherine de' Medici was a member of the powerful Medici family of Florence, Italy. She was born Caterina Maria Romula de' Medici on 13 April 1519 in Florence, Republic of Florence. Her parents were Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino, and Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne, the countess of Boulogne. Catherine became Queen of France at the age of 21 and played a significant role in the politics of the country for over 50 years. She was a patron of the arts, a skilled politician, and a devoted mother to her 10 children. Her legacy continues to be felt today, and she remains one of the most fascinating women of the Renaissance.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

\"as pleased as if it had been a boy\".\n\n\nMarriage\nOn her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described Catherine as \"small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family\" [18] Suitors, however, lined up for her hand, including James V of Scotland who sent the Duke of Albany to Clement to conclude a marriage in April and November 1530 [19] When Francis I of France proposed his second son, Henry, Duke of Orléans, in early 1533, Clement jumped at the offer Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who, despite her wealth, was of common origin.\n\n\nDauphine\n In 1536, Henry's older brother, Francis, caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever and died shortly after, leaving Henry the heir Suspicions of poison abounded, from Catherine to Emperor Charles V [25] Sebastiano de Montecuccoli confessed under torture to poisoning the Dauphin [25]\n\n\nQueen of France\nHenry allowed Catherine almost no political influence as queen [29] Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her formal powers were strictly nominal [30] Henry even gave the Château of Chenonceau, which Catherine had wanted for herself, to his mistress Diane de Poitiers instead, who took her place at the center of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favors The imperial ambassador reported that in the presence of guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts [31] Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat She even encouraged the king to spend more time with Catherine and sire more children [32]\n\n\nQueen mother\nFrancis II became king at the age of fifteen In what has been called a coup d'état, the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Duke of Guise—whose niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, had married Francis II the year before—seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved themselves into the Louvre Palace with the young couple [41] The English ambassador reported a few days later that \"the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king\" [42] For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of

{"title": "Amy_Adams", "content": "\nEarly life\nAdams was born on August 20, 1974 [1] in Aviano, Italy, [2] to American parents Kathryn and Richard Adams, while her father was serving for the U.S Army [3] [4] She has four brothers and two sisters [5] After moving from one army base to another, she and her family settled in Castle Rock, Colorado when she was eight [4] After leaving the army, her father sang professionally in nightclubs and restaurants [5] [6] Adams has described going to her father's shows and drinking Shirley Temples at the bar as among her fondest childhood memories [7] The family was poor; they camped and hiked together, and performed amateur skits written by her father or sometimes by her mother [4] [6] [8] Adams was enthusiastic about the plays and always played the lead [9]\n\n\nCareer\nAdams began her professional career as a dancer in a 1994 dinner theater production of A Chorus Line in Boulder, Colorado [4] [15] [16] The job required her to wait on tables before getting up on stage to perform She enjoyed singing and dancing, but disliked waitressing and ran into trouble when a fellow dancer, whom she considered a friend, made false accusations about her to the director [17] Adams said, \"I never really knew what the lies were I only knew I kept getting called in and lectured about my lack of professionalism.\" [4] She lost the job but went on to perform in dinner theater at Denver's Heritage Square Music Hall and Country Dinner Playhouse [15] During a performance of Anything Goes at the Country Dinner Playhouse in 1995, she was spotted by Michael Brindisi, the president and artistic director of the Minneapolis-based Chanhassen Dinner Theater, who offered her a job there [15] [18] Adams moved to Chanhassen, Minnesota, where she performed in the theater for the next three years [18] She loved the \"security and schedule\" of the job, and has said that she learned tremendously from it [17] [18] Nonetheless, the grueling work took its toll on her: \"I had a lot of recurring injuries—bursitis in my knees, pulled muscles in my groin, my adductor and abductor My body was wearing out.\" [14]\n\n\n1994–2004: Dinner theater and early screen appearances\nAdams began her professional career as a dancer in a 1994 dinner theater production of A Chorus Line in Boulder, Colorado [4] [15] [16] The job required her to wait on tables before getting up on stage to perform She enjoyed singing and dancing, but disliked waitressing and ran into trouble when a fellow dancer, whom she considered a friend, made false accusations about her to the director [17] Adams said, \"I never really knew what the lies were I only knew I kept getting called in and lectured about my lack of professionalism.\" [4] She lost the job but went on to

took its toll on her: \"I had a lot of recurring injuries—bursitis in my knees, pulled muscles in my groin, my adductor and abductor My body was wearing out.\" [14]\n\n\n2005–2007: Breakthrough with Junebug and Enchanted\nDisillusioned by her firing from Dr Vegas, Adams, aged 30, considered quitting acting altogether after completing work on the independent comedy-drama Junebug, which had a production budget of under $1 million [4] [31] Directed by Phil Morrison, the film featured her as Ashley Johnsten, a perky and talkative pregnant woman Morrison was impressed with Adams's ability to not question her character's inherently good motives [32] She connected with Johnsten's faith in God and spent time with Morrison in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where the film is set, attending church [5] She described making the film as \"the summer I grew into myself\", and after dyeing her hair red for the role, she decided not to go back to her natural blonde color [5] Junebug premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, where Adams won a special jury prize [15] Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph labeled the film a \"small, quiet miracle\" and wrote that Adams had given \"one of the most delicately funny and heartbreaking performances it's ever been my pleasure to review\" [33] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post opined that her \"radiant portrayal\" reflected the film's \"deeply humanist heart\" [34] For her performance, Adams won the Independent Spirit Award and Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received an Academy Award nomination in the same category [5] [35] [36]\n\n\n2008–2012: Ingénue parts and expansion to dramatic roles\nThe 2008 Sundance Film Festival saw the release of Sunshine Cleaning, a comedy-drama about two sisters (played by Adams and Emily Blunt) who start a crime scene clean-up business Adams was drawn to the idea of playing someone who constantly tries to better herself [54] [55] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle found Adams to be \"magical\", adding that she \"gives us a portrait of raging want beneath a veneer of surface diffidence\" [56] In the 1939-set screwball comedy Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, Adams starred as an aspiring American actress in London who encounters a middle-aged governess named Miss Pettigrew (played by Frances McDormand) Stephen Holden of The New York Times drew similarities to her role in Enchanted and wrote that the \"screen magic\" she displays in such endearing roles \"hasn't been this intense since the heyday of Jean Arthur\" [57]\n\n\n2013–2019: Established

It has been used as a conventional name or term of address for a cat, as well as a synonym for the word cat in other contexts. The term has also been used to describe something soft and furry, such as a type of willow tree. In addition, it has been used as a slang term to refer to female genitalia or to describe a person who is weak or cowardly.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe noun pussy meaning \"cat\" comes from the Modern English word puss, a conventional name or term of address for a cat. Cognates of this word are common to several Germanic languages, including Dutch poes and Middle Low German pūse, which are also used to call a cat. The word puss is attested in English as early as 1533. Earlier etymology is uncertain, but similar words exist in other European languages, including Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín, both traditional calls to attract a cat.\n\n**Similar words**\n\nThe medieval French word pucelle 'maiden, virgin' is not related to the English word pussy. It is attested in Old French from the ninth century, and likely derives from Latin puella 'girl' or pulla 'pullet, young female chicken'. Despite the different origins, the two words have been conflated in some contexts, leading to confusion and misinterpretation.\n\n**Uses**\n\nBoth in English and in German, puss was used as a \"call-name\" for cats, but in English, pussy was used as a synonym for the word cat in other uses as well. In addition to cats, the word was also used for rabbits and hares. In the 19th century, the meaning was extended to anything soft and furry. Pussy willow, for example, is a name applied to various species in the genus Salix with furry catkins. In thieves' cant, the word pussy means a \"fur coat\".\n\n**Cat and similar**\n\nBoth in English and in German, puss was used as a \"call-name\" for cats, but in English, pussy was used as a synonym for the word cat in other uses as well. In addition to cats, the word was also used for rabbits and hares. In the 19th century, the meaning was extended to anything soft and furry. Pussy willow, for example, is a name applied to various species in the genus Salix with furry catkins. In thieves' cant, the word pussy means a \"fur coat\".\n\n**Female genitalia**\n\nIn contemporary English, use of the word pussy to refer to women themselves is considered derogatory and demeaning, treating women as sexual objects. As a reference to genitals or to sexual intercourse, the word is considered vulgar slang. Studies find the word is used more commonly in conversations among men than in groups of women or mixed-gender groups, though subjects report using pussy more often than other slang terms for female genitals. There are women seeking to reclaim the word to symbolize sexual pleasure, power, and trust in their bodies.\n\n**Weakness**\n\nThe word pussy is also used in a derogatory sense to mean cowardly, weak, or easily fatigued. The Collins Dictionary says: \"(taboo, slang, mainly US) an ineffectual or timid person.\" It may refer to a male who is not considered sufficiently masculine, as in: \"The coach calls us pussies.\"\n\n**Word-play between meanings**\n\nPussy is one of a large number of English words that has both erotic and non-erotic meanings. Such double entendres have long been used in the creation of sexual humor. This double meaning of \"pussy\" has been used for over a hundred years by performers, including the late-19th-century vaudeville act the Barrison Sisters, who performed the notorious routine \"Do You Want To See My Pussy?\" in which they raised their skirts to reveal live kittens.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Cat\n* Slang\n* Vulgar language\n* Double entendre\n* Sexual humor\n\n**References**\n\n* Collins English Dictionary\n* Oxford English Dictionary\n* Merriam-Webster's Dictionary\n* Online Etymology Dictionary\n\n**External links**\n\n* Etymology of \"pussy\"\n* Slang dictionary\n* Vulgar language\n* Double entendre\n* Sexual humor", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Pussy\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe noun pussy meaning \"cat\" comes from the Modern English word puss, a conventional name or term of address for a cat [5] Cognates are common to several Germanic languages, including Dutch poes and Middle Low German pūse, which are also used to call a cat The word puss is attested in English as early as 1533 Earlier etymology is uncertain, but similar words exist in other European languages, including Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín, both traditional calls to attract a cat [5]\n\n\nSimilar words\nThe medieval French word pucelle 'maiden, virgin' is not related to the English word It is attested in Old French from the ninth century, and likely derives from Latin puella 'girl' or pulla 'pullet, young female chicken' [8]\n\n\nUses\nBoth in English and in German puss was used as a \"call-name\" for cats, but in English pussy was used as a synonym for the word cat in other uses as well In addition to cats, the word was also used for rabbits and hares In the 19th century,  the meaning was extended to anything soft and furry Pussy willow, for example, is a name applied to various species in the genus Salix with furry catkins In thieves' cant the word pussy means a \"fur coat\" [2]\n\n\nCat and similar\nBoth in English and in German puss was used as a \"call-name\" for cats, but in English pussy was used as a synonym for the word cat in other uses as well In addition to cats, the word was also used for rabbits and hares In the 19th century,  the meaning was extended to anything soft and furry Pussy willow, for example, is a name applied to various species in the genus Salix with furry catkins In thieves' cant the word pussy means a \"fur coat\" [2]\n\n\nFemale genitalia\nIn contemporary English, use of the word pussy to refer to women themselves is considered derogatory and demeaning, treating women as sexual objects [12] As a reference to genitals or to sexual intercourse, the word is considered vulgar slang Studies find the word is used more commonly in conversations among men than in groups of women or mixed-gender groups, though subjects report using pussy more often than other slang terms for female genitals [13] There are women seeking to reclaim the word [14] to symbolise sexual pleasure, [15] power, [16] and trust in their bodies (e.g around childbirth) [17]\n\n\nWeakness\nThe word pussy is also used in a derogatory sense to mean cowardly, weak, or easily fatigued The Collins Dictionary says: \"(taboo, slang, mainly US) an ineffectual or timid person.\" [27] It may refer to a male who is not considered sufficiently masculine, as in: \"The coach calls us pussies.\" [28]\n\n\nWord-play between meanings\nPussy is one of a large number of English words that has both erotic and non-erotic meanings Such double entendres have long been used in the creation of sexual humor [32] This double meaning of \"pussy\" has been used for over a hundred years by performers, including the late-19th-century vaudeville act the Barrison Sisters, who performed the notorious routine \"Do You Want To See My Pussy?\" in which they raised their skirts to reveal live kittens [33]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[32]\n\n\n2000–2004: Established star\nFollowing a string of roles in successful films in the late 1990s, Hoffman had established a reputation as a top supporting player who could be relied on to make an impression with each performance [53] His film appearances were likened by David Kamp of GQ to \"discovering a prize in a box of cereal, receiving a bonus, or bumping unexpectedly into an old friend\" [19] According to Jerry Mosher, as the year 2000 began, \"it seemed Hoffman was everywhere, poised on the cusp of stardom\" [54]\n\n\n2005–2009: Critical acclaim\nA turning point in Hoffman's career came with the biographical film Capote (2005), which dramatized Truman Capote's experience of writing his true crime novel In Cold Blood (1966) [85] Hoffman took the title role for a project that he co-produced and helped bring to fruition [86] [87] Portraying the idiosyncratic writer proved highly demanding, requiring significant weight loss and four months of research—such as watching video clips of Capote to help him affect the author's effeminate voice and mannerisms Hoffman stated that he was not concerned with perfectly imitating Capote's speech, but he did feel a great duty to \"express the vitality and the nuances\" of the writer [88] [89] During filming, he stayed in character constantly so as not to lose the voice and posture: \"Otherwise,\" he explained, \"I would give my body a chance to bail on me.\" [89] Capote was released to great acclaim, particularly regarding Hoffman's performance [90] Many critics commented that the role was designed to win awards, [91] and indeed Hoffman received an Oscar, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild Award, BAFTA, and various other critics' awards [92] In 2006, Premiere listed his role in Capote as the 35th-greatest movie performance of all time [93] After the film, several commentators began to describe Hoffman as one of the finest, most ambitious actors of his generation [87]\n\n\n2010–2014: Final years\nHoffman's profile continued to grow with the new decade, and he became an increasingly recognizable figure [24] Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen, [10] his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director The independent drama Jack Goes Boating was adapted from Robert Glaudini's play of the same name, which Hoffman had starred in and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007 He originally intended to only direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of Jack—a lonely limousine driver looking for love—after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable [116] The low-key film had a limited release, and was not a high earner, [117] though it received many positive reviews [118] [119] However, Dave Edwards of the Daily Mirror remarked that \"Hoffman's directing debut delivers a film so weak I could barely remember what it was about as I left\", [120] while critic Mark Kermode appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director [121] In addition to Jack Goes Boating, in 2010 Hoffman also directed Brett C Leonard's tragic drama The Long Red Road for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago Steven Oxman of Variety described the production as \"heavy handed\" and \"predictable\", but \"intriguing and at least partially successful\" [122]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHoffman rarely mentioned his personal life in interviews, stating in 2012 that he would \"rather not because my family doesn't have any choice If I talk about them in the press, I'm giving them no choice So I choose not to.\" [142] For 14 years, he was in a relationship with costume designer Mimi O'Donnell, whom he had met in 1999 when they were both working on the Hoffman-directed play In Arabia We'd All Be Kings [143] They lived in New York City and had a son, Cooper, and two daughters [144] While some reports stated Hoffman and O'Donnell separated in late 2013, [145] O'Donnell later said she and Hoffman were both committed to their relationship, but he had moved out of their longtime residence to a nearby apartment to protect their children from the effects of his relapse into substance abuse [146]\n\n\nDeath\nOn February 2, 2014, Hoffman was found dead in the bathroom of his Manhattan apartment by his friend, playwright and screenwriter David Bar Katz [149] He was 46 years old [150] Although friends stated that Hoffman's drug use was under control at the time, [145] detectives searching the apartment found heroin and prescription medication at the scene and revealed that he had a syringe in his arm [151] Hoffman's death was officially ruled an accident caused by \"acute mixed drug intoxication, including heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and amphetamine\" [152] Michael Schwirtz of The New York Times said, \"Whether Hoffman had taken all of the substances on the same day, or whether any of the substances had remained in his system from earlier use, was not reported.\" [153]\n\n\nReception and acting style\nHoffman was held in high regard within both the film and theater industries, and he was often cited in the media as one of the finest actors of his generation [2] [142] [165] In a 2022 readers' poll by Empire magazine, he was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time [166] With his being overweight, one writer considered Hoffman to be \"too pudgy to look romantic or heroic\"; [39] [167] however, the actor said he was grateful for his appearance, as it made him believable in a wide range of roles [71] Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, \"The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life\" [115] The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an \"anti-star\", whose real identity remained \"amorphous and unmoored\" [168] Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters He remarked, \"I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK I think there are other people who are interested in what I do.\" [14]\n\n\nWork ethic\nThe journalist Jeff Simon described Hoffman as \"probably the most in-demand character actor of his generation\", [10] but Hoffman said he never took it for granted that he would be offered roles [73] Although he worked hard and regularly, [14] he was humble about his acting success: an anecdote went that when asked by a friend in the early 2000s if he was having any luck in his career, he quietly replied, \"I'm in a film, Cold Mountain, that has just come out.\" [9] Patrick Fugit, who worked with Hoffman on Almost Famous, recalled the actor was intimidating but an exceptional mentor and influence in \"a school-of-hard-knocks way\", remarking that \"there was a certain weight that came with him\" [172] Hoffman admitted that he sometimes appeared in big-budget studio films for the money, but said, \"ultimately my main goal is to do good work If it doesn't pay well, so be it.\" [173] He kept himself grounded and invigorated as an actor by attempting to appear on stage once a year [173]\n\n\nActing credits and accolades\nHoffman appeared in 55 films and one miniseries during his screen career spanning 22 years He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for Capote (2005), and was nominated three times for Best Supporting Actor for Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Doubt (2008), and The Master (2012) He also received five Golden Globe Award nominations (winning one), five BAFTA Award nominations (winning one), four Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning one), and won the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival [92] Hoffman remained active in theater throughout his career, starring in 10 and directing 19 stage productions (predominantly in New York) He received three Tony Award nominations for his Broadway performances: two for Best Leading Actor, in True West (2000) and Death of a Salesman (2012), and one for Best Featured Actor in Long Day's Journey into Night (2003) [55]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n",

Born on July 23, 1967, in Fairport, New York, Hoffman began his acting career in the early 1990s, eventually transitioning to film and television.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nPhilip Hoffman was born to Marilyn O'Connor and Gordon Stowell Hoffman. His mother was an elementary school teacher and later became a lawyer and family court judge. Hoffman's father worked for the Xerox Corporation.

He then attended the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, where he studied drama and graduated in 1989.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter graduating from NYU, Hoffman worked in off-Broadway theater and made additional money with customer service jobs. He made his screen debut in 1991, in a Law & Order episode called \"The Violence of Summer,\" playing a man accused of rape. He made his film debut the following year, when he was credited as \"Phil Hoffman\" in the independent film Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole.\n\nIn 1996, Hoffman appeared at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in a Mark Wing-Davey production of Caryl Churchill's The Skriker. Following this, he was cast by writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson to appear in his debut feature Hard Eight (1996). Hoffman had only a brief role in the crime thriller, playing a cocksure young craps player, but it began the most important collaboration of his career.\n\nBefore cementing his creative partnership with Anderson, Hoffman appeared in one of the year's biggest blockbusters, Twister, playing a grubby, hyperactive storm chaser alongside Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. According to a People survey of Twitter and Facebook users, Twister is the film with which Hoffman is most popularly associated.\n\nHoffman then reunited with Anderson for the director's second feature, Boogie Nights, about the Golden Age of Pornography. The ensemble piece starred Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Burt Reynolds; Hoffman played a boom operator, described by David Fear of Rolling Stone as a \"complete, unabashed loser,\" who attempts to seduce Wahlberg's character.\n\nWarmly received by critics, the film grew into a cult classic, and has been cited as the role in which Hoffman first showed his full ability.

0.205 km2 (0.079 sq mi) and a maximum diameter of about 700m The gently sloping terrain reaches its highest point 41 metres (135 ft) above sea level.\n\n\nPopulation and infrastructure\nAbout 100 inhabitants live on the island's only settlement, Bile, mostly frontier guard servicemen with their families and technical personnel In 2003, an initiative of the Odesa I I Mechnikov National University established the Ostriv Zmiinyi marine research station every year, at which scientists and students from the university conduct research on local fauna, flora, geology, meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, and hydrobiology.\n\n\nLighthouse\nThe Snake Island Lighthouse was built in the autumn of 1842 [13] by the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Empire The lighthouse is an octagonal-shaped building, 12 meters tall, located near the highest elevated area of the island, 40 meters above the sea level The lighthouse built on site of the previously destroyed temple of Achilles is adjacent to a housing building The remnants of the Greek temple were found in 1823.\n\n\nHistory and mythology\nThe island was named by the Greeks Leuke (‹See Tfd›Greek: Λευκή, 'White

The gently sloping terrain reaches its highest point 41 meters (135 feet) above sea level. The island is largely rocky and barren, with no vegetation or trees.\n\n**Population and Infrastructure**\n\nAbout 100 inhabitants live on the island's only settlement, Bile. Mostly frontier guard servicemen with their families and technical personnel reside on the island.

The lighthouse is an octagonal-shaped building, 12 meters tall, located near the highest elevated area of the island, 40 meters above the sea level. The lighthouse was built on the site of the previously destroyed temple of Achilles.

Lionsgate to help her produce the film [2] Collins was also attached to adapt the novel; she began the first draft after completing the third novel in the series, Mockingjay (2010) The search for a director began in 2010 with three directors in the running; David Slade, Sam Mendes, and Gary Ross [3] Ross was ultimately chosen to direct [4] By the time Collins had finished the script, Ross

His films also explored themes of identity, isolation, and the human condition, which would become a hallmark of his work.\n\n**2013-2016: Established Work and Acclaim**\n\nVilleneuve's breakthrough film, \"Prisoners\" (2013), was a critical and commercial success. Starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, the film explored themes of kidnapping, trauma, and the complexities of human relationships.

years and long predate the European colonization of North America \n\n\nHarvest festival observed by the Pilgrims at Plymouth\nThe Plymouth colonists, today known as Pilgrims, [15] had settled in a part of eastern Massachusetts formerly occupied by the Patuxet Indians who had died in an devastating epidemic between 1614 and 1620 After the harsh winter of 1620-1621 killed half of the Plymouth colonists, two Native intermediaries, Samoset and Tisquantum (more commonly known by the diminutive variant Squanto, and the last living member of the Patuxet) came in at the request of Massasoit, leader of the Wampanoag, to negotiate a peace treaty and establish trade relations with the colonists, as both men had some knowledge of English from previous interactions with Europeans, through both trade (Samoset) and a period of enslavement (Squanto) \n\n\nDebate over the \"first Thanksgiving\" and the invention of tradition\nJeremy Bang opines that, \"Local boosters in Virginia, Florida, and Texas promote their own colonists, who (like many people getting off a boat) gave thanks for setting foot again on dry land.\" [28]\n\n\nNew England Thanksgivings\nIt's important to note that Baker's \"New England Thanksgiving\" does not refer to an annual commemoration of the Pilgrim's 1621 harvest celebration Indeed, that 1621 event does not appear to have contributed to the early development of the modern holiday at all, as Bradford's \"Of Plimoth Plantation\" was not published until the 1850s and the booklet \"Mourt's Relation\" was typically summarized by other publications without the now-familiar thanksgiving story In fact, by the eighteenth century, the original booklet appeared to be lost or forgotten although a copy was later rediscovered in Philadelphia in 1820, with the first full reprinting in 1841 In a footnote the editor, Alexander Young, was the first person to identify the 1621 feast as the \"first Thanksgiving\", but this was only because he viewed it as similar to the traditions of New England Thanksgivings that had developed independently from it over the previous two hundred years  [30]\n\n\nSarah Hale and Godey's Ladies Book\nSarah Josepha Hale, a native of New Hampshire and steeped in the traditions of a New England Thanksgiving, was the longtime editor of Godey's Ladies Book, the most widely circulated periodical in the antebellum U.S Hale was the chief promoter of the modern idea of the holiday in the 19th century, from the foods served to the decorations to the role of women in putting it all together Concerned by increasing factionalism in American society, Hale envisioned Thanksgiving as a commonly-celebrated, patriotic holiday that would unite Americans in purpose and values She viewed those values as rooted in domesticity and rural simplicity over urban sophistication As a celebration of hearth and home, she also sought to cement a role for women within the identity of the young nation  \n\n\nEnter the Pilgrims\nWhile the Pilgrim's story did not itself create the modern Thanksgiving holiday, it did become inextricably linked with it in the late 19th and early 20th centuries This was largely due to the introduction in U.S schools of \"an annual sequence of classroom holiday activities through which civic education and American patriotism were inculcated.\" [31]\n\n\nThanksgiving proclamations in the early United States\n\nThe First National Proclamation of Thanksgiving was given by the Continental Congress in 1777 from its temporary location in York, Pennsylvania, while the British occupied the national capital at Philadelphia [34] [35] Delegate Samuel Adams created the first draft Congress then adopted the final version:\n\nThe Revolutionary War Era to the Civil War\n\nThe First National Proclamation of Thanksgiving was given by the Continental Congress in 1777 from its temporary location in York, Pennsylvania, while the British occupied the national capital at Philadelphia [34] [35] Delegate Samuel Adams created the first draft Congress then adopted the final version:\n\nLincoln and the Civil War\nIn the middle of the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln, prompted by a series of editorials written by Sarah Josepha Hale, [48] proclaimed a national Thanksgiving Day, to be celebrated on the 26th, the final Thursday of November 1863 The document, written by Secretary of State William H Seward, reads as follows:\n\n\nPost-Civil War era\nOn June 28, 1870, President Ulysses S Grant signed into law the Holidays Act that made Thanksgiving a yearly \"appointed or remembered\" federal holiday in Washington D.C Three other holidays included in the law were New Year, Christmas, and July 4 The law did not extend outside of Washington D.C., while the date assigned for Thanksgiving was left to the discretion of the President [51] [52] [53] In January 1879, George Washington's Birthday, February 22, was added by Congress to the federal holidays list [54] On January 6, 1885, a Congressional act expanded the Holidays Act to apply to all federal departments and employees throughout the nation Federal workers received pay for all the holidays, including Thanksgiving [54]\n\n\nFranksgiving (1939–1941)\nAbraham Lincoln's successors as president followed his example of annually declaring the final Thursday in November to be Thanksgiving But in 1939, President Franklin D Roosevelt broke with this tradition [56] November had five Thursdays that year (instead of the more-common four), Roosevelt declared the fourth Thursday as Thanksgiving rather than the fifth one Although many popular histories state otherwise, he made clear that his plan was to establish the holiday on the next-to-last Thursday in the month instead of the last one With the country still in the midst of The Great Depression, Roosevelt thought an earlier Thanksgiving would give merchants a longer period to sell goods before Christmas Increasing profits and spending during this period, Roosevelt hoped, would help bring the country out of the Depression At the time, advertising goods for Christmas before Thanksgiving was considered inappropriate Fred Lazarus, Jr., founder of the Federated Department Stores (later Macy's), is credited with convincing Roosevelt to push Thanksgiving to a week earlier to expand the shopping season, and within two years the change passed through Congress into law [57] [58]\n\n\n1942 to present\nOn October 6, 1941, both houses of the United States Congress passed a joint resolution fixing the traditional last-Thursday date for the holiday beginning in 1942 However, in December of that year the Senate passed an amendment to the resolution that split the difference by requiring that Thanksgiving be observed annually on the fourth Thursday of November, in order to prevent confusion on the occasional years in which November has five Thursdays [60] [52] The amendment also passed the House, and on December 26, 1941, President Roosevelt signed this bill, for the first time making the date of Thanksgiving a matter of federal law and fixing the day as the fourth Thursday of November [61]\n\n\nTraditional celebrations and solemnities\nTurkey, usually roasted and stuffed (but sometimes deep-fried instead), is typically the featured item on most Thanksgiving feast tables 40 million turkeys were consumed on Thanksgiving Day alone in 2019 [62] With 85 percent of Americans partaking in the meal, an estimated 276 million Americans dine on the festive poultry, spending an expected $1.05 billion on turkeys for Thanksgiving in 2016 [63] [64]\n\n\nFoods of the season\nTurkey, usually roasted and stuffed (but sometimes deep-fried instead), is typically the featured item on most Thanksgiving feast tables

expected $1.05 billion on turkeys for Thanksgiving in 2016 [63] [64]\n\n\nGiving thanks and religious services\nThe tradition of giving thanks is continued today in many forms, most notably the attendance of religious services, as well as the saying of a mealtime prayer before Thanksgiving dinner [4] Many houses of worship offer worship services and events on Thanksgiving themes the weekend before, the day of, or the weekend after Thanksgiving.\n\n\nPenitence and prayer\nThanksgiving is included in the Revised Common Lectionary, which provides scriptures for Thanksgiving services It is the last entry on the liturgical calendar before the start of Advent the following Sunday [74]\n\n\nCharity\nThe poor are often provided with food at Thanksgiving time Most communities have annual food drives that collect non-perishable packaged and canned foods, and corporations sponsor charitable distributions of staple foods and Thanksgiving dinners [75] The Salvation Army enlists volunteers to serve Thanksgiving dinners to hundreds of people in different locales [76] [77] Additionally, five days after Thanksgiving is Giving Tuesday, a celebration of charitable giving [78]\n\n\nParades\nSince 1924, in New York City, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is held annually every Thanksgiving Day from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, and televised nationally by NBC The parade features parade floats with specific themes, performances from Broadway musicals, large balloons of cartoon characters, TV personalities, and high school marching bands The float that traditionally ends the Macy's Parade is the Santa Claus float, the arrival of which is an unofficial sign of the beginning of the Christmas shopping season It is billed as the world's largest parade [79]\n\n\nSports\nAmerican football is an important part of many Thanksgiving celebrations in the United States, a tradition that dates to the earliest era of the sport in the late 19th century [94] Professional football games are often held on Thanksgiving Day; until recently, these were the only games played during the week apart from Sunday or Monday night The National Football League (NFL) has played games on Thanksgiving every year since its creation except during World War II The Detroit Lions hosted a game every Thanksgiving Day from 1934 to 1938 and have hosted one every year since 1945 [95] In 1966, the Dallas Cowboys, which were founded six years earlier, adopted the practice of hosting Thanksgiving games [96] The league added a third game in primetime in 2006; unlike the traditional afternoon doubleheader, this game has no fixed host [97]\n\n\nAmerican football\nAmerican football is an important part of many Thanksgiving celebrations

sports\nCollege basketball holds several elimination tournaments on over Thanksgiving weekend, before the conference season These include the Anaheim-based Wooden Legacy, [103] the Orlando-based AdvoCare Invitational, [104] and the Bahamas-based Battle 4 Atlantis, [105] all of which are televised on ESPN2 and ESPNU in marathon format The NCAA owned-and-operated NIT Season Tip-Off has also since moved to Thanksgiving week [106]\n\n\nTelevision\nWhile not as prolific as Christmas specials, which usually begin right after Thanksgiving, there are many special television programs transmitted on or around Thanksgiving, such as A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, in addition to the live parades and football games mentioned above In some cases, television broadcasters begin programming Christmas films and specials to run on Thanksgiving Day, taking the day as a signal for the beginning of the Christmas season [citation needed]\n\n\nRadio\n\"Alice's Restaurant\", an 18-minute monologue by Arlo Guthrie which is partially based on an incident that happened on Thanksgiving in 1965, was first released in 1967 It has since become a tradition on numerous classic rock and classic hits radio stations to play the full, uninterrupted recording to much fanfare each Thanksgiving Day, a tradition that appears to have originated with counterculture radio host Bob Fass, who introduced the song to the public on his radio show [119] Another song that traditionally gets played on numerous radio stations (of many different formats) is \"The Thanksgiving Song\", a 1992 song by Adam Sandler [120]\n\n\nTurkey pardoning\nThe President of the United States has received a Thanksgiving turkey every year since 1873; for the first 41 years, the turkey was provided by Westerly, Rhode Island turkey kingpin Horace Vose In 1947, in what began as a lobbying ploy to get President Harry Truman to stop rationing turkey for foreign aid, the National Turkey Federation has presented the President of the United States with one live turkey and two dressed turkeys in a ceremony known as the National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation John F Kennedy was the first president reported to spare the turkey given to him (he said he did not plan to eat the bird); by the late 1970s, most of the turkeys were being sent to petting zoos, while the dressed turkeys are usually sent to a charity such as Martha's Table [citation needed]\n\n\nVacation and travel\nOn Thanksgiving Day, families and friends usually gather for a large meal or dinner [130] Consequently, the Thanksgiving holiday weekend is one of the busiest travel periods of the year [131] Thanksgiving is a four-day or five-day weekend vacation for schools and colleges Most business and government workers (78% as of 2007) are given Thanksgiving and the day after as paid holidays [132] Thanksgiving Eve (also known as Blackout Wednesday), the night before Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest nights of the year for bars and clubs as many college students and others return to their hometowns to reunite with friends and family [133]\n\n\nCriticism and controversy\nMuch like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving is observed by some as a \"National Day of Mourning\", in acknowledgment of the genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists [134] [135] [136] Thanksgiving has long carried a distinct resonance for Native Americans, who see the holiday as an embellished story of \"Pilgrims and Natives looking past their differences\" to break bread [137]\n\n\nDate\nSince being fixed on the fourth Thursday in November by law in 1941, [61] the holiday in the United States can occur on any date from November 22 to 28 When it falls on November 22 or 23, it is not the last Thursday, but the penultimate Thursday in November Regardless, it is the Thursday preceding the last Saturday of November.\n\n\nTable of dates (1946–2102)\nThe date of Thanksgiving Day follows a 28-year cycle, broken only by century years that are not a multiple of 400 (e.g 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500 ...) The break in the regular cycle is an effect of the leap year algorithm, which dictates that such years are common years as an adjustment for the calendar / season alignment that leap years provide Past and future dates of celebration include: [155]\n\n\nDays after Thanksgiving\nA broader period of Thanksgivingtide leads into and follows the holiday of Thanksgiving itself The day after Thanksgiving is a holiday for some companies and most schools In the last two decades of the 20th century, it became known as Black Friday, the beginning of the Christmas shopping season and a day for chaotic, early-morning sales at major retailers that were closed on Thanksgiving [156] A contrasting movement known as Buy Nothing Day originated in Canada in 1992 [157] The day after Thanksgiving is also Native American Heritage Day, a day to pay tribute to Native Americans for their many contributions to the United States [158]\n\n\nLiterature\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nPoetry\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nMusic\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nFootnotes\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nReferences\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nBibliography\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nFurther reading\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nExternal links\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Introduction\n\nThanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States, celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November every year. It is a day of thanks and gratitude, marked by feasting, family gatherings, and reflection on the blessings of the past year. The modern American Thanksgiving holiday has its roots in the early European colonization of North America, particularly in the harvest festivals of the Pilgrims and other English colonists. Over time, the holiday has evolved to encompass a broader cultural and national significance, with traditions and customs that are unique to the United States.\n\n# History\n\n## Days of thanksgiving\n\nDays of thanksgiving, that is, days set aside to give thanks to God, have been common in Christendom for hundreds of years and long predate the European colonization of North America. The earliest recorded thanksgiving service was held in 1578 by the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who held a service of thanksgiving after arriving in what is now Canada.\n\n## Harvest festival observed by the Pilgrims at Plymouth\n\nThe Plymouth colonists, today known as Pilgrims, had settled in a part of eastern Massachusetts formerly occupied by the Patuxet Indians who had died in a devastating epidemic between 1614 and 1620. After the harsh winter of 1620-1621 killed half of the Plymouth colonists, two Native intermediaries, Samoset and Tisquantum (more commonly known by the diminutive variant Squanto, and the last living member of the Patuxet) came in at the request of Massasoit, leader of the Wampanoag, to negotiate a peace treaty and establish trade relations with the colonists, as both men had some knowledge of English from previous interactions with Europeans, through both trade (Samoset) and a period of enslavement (Squanto).\n\n## Debate over the \"first Thanksgiving\" and the invention of tradition\n\nJeremy Bang opines that, \"Local boosters in Virginia, Florida, and Texas promote their own colonists, who (like many people getting off a boat) gave thanks for setting foot again on dry land.\" However, the 1621 event at Plymouth did not appear to have contributed to the early development of the modern holiday at all. Instead, the idea of the \"first Thanksgiving\" was likely invented by later generations as a way to glorify the Pilgrims and their relationship with the Native Americans.\n\n## New England Thanksgivings\n\nIt's worth noting that Baker's \"New England Thanksgiving\" does not refer to an annual commemoration of the Pilgrim's 1621 harvest celebration. In fact, that 1621 event does not appear to have contributed to the early development of the modern holiday at all. By the eighteenth century, the original booklet appeared to be lost or forgotten, although a copy was later rediscovered in Philadelphia in 1820, with the first full reprinting in 1841.\n\n## Sarah Hale and Godey's Ladies Book\n\nSarah Josepha Hale, a native of New Hampshire and steeped in the traditions of a New England Thanksgiving, was the longtime editor of Godey's Ladies Book, the most widely circulated periodical in the antebellum U.S. Hale was the chief promoter of the modern idea of the holiday in the 19th century, from the foods served to the decorations to the role of women in putting it all together. Concerned by increasing factionalism in American society, Hale envisioned Thanksgiving as a commonly-celebrated, patriotic holiday that would unite Americans in purpose and values.\n\n## Enter the Pilgrims\n\nWhile the Pilgrim's story did not itself create the modern Thanksgiving holiday, it did become inextricably linked with it in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This was largely due to the introduction in U.S. schools of \"an annual sequence of classroom holiday activities through which civic education and American patriotism were inculcated.\"\n\n## Thanksgiving proclamations in the early United States\n\nThe First National Proclamation of Thanksgiving was given by the Continental Congress in 1777 from its temporary location in York, Pennsylvania, while the British occupied the national capital at Philadelphia. Delegate Samuel Adams created the first draft, which Congress then adopted in its final version.\n\n## Lincoln and the Civil War\n\nIn the middle of the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln, prompted by a series of editorials written by Sarah Josepha Hale, proclaimed a national Thanksgiving Day, to be celebrated on the 26th, the final Thursday of November in 1863. The document, written by Secretary of State William H. Seward, reads as follows:\n\n# Post-Civil War era\n\nOn June 28, 1870, President Ulysses S Grant signed into law the Holidays Act that made Thanksgiving a yearly \"appointed or remembered\" federal holiday in Washington D.C. Three other holidays included in the law were New Year, Christmas, and July 4. However, the date assigned for Thanksgiving was left to the discretion of the President. In January 1879, George Washington's Birthday, February 22, was added by Congress to the federal holidays list. On January 6, 1885, a Congressional act expanded the Holidays Act to apply to all federal departments and employees throughout the nation. Federal workers received pay for all the holidays, including Thanksgiving.\n\n# Franksgiving (1939-1941)\n\nAbraham Lincoln's successors as president followed his example of annually declaring the final Thursday in November to be Thanksgiving. However, in 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt broke with this tradition. November had five Thursdays that year, and Roosevelt declared the fourth Thursday as Thanksgiving rather than the fifth one. Although many popular histories state otherwise, he made clear that his plan was to establish the holiday on the next-to-last Thursday in the month instead of the last one. With the country still in the midst of The Great Depression, Roosevelt thought an earlier Thanksgiving would give merchants a longer period to sell goods before Christmas. Increasing profits and spending during this period, Roosevelt hoped, would help bring the country out of the Depression.\n\n# 1942 to present\n\nOn October 6, 1941, both houses of the United States Congress passed a joint resolution fixing the traditional last-Thursday date for the holiday beginning in 1942. However, in December of that year the Senate passed an amendment to the resolution that split the difference by requiring that Thanksgiving be observed annually on the fourth Thursday of November, in order to prevent confusion on the occasional years in which November has five Thursdays. The amendment also passed the House, and on December 26, 1941, President Roosevelt signed this bill, for the first time making the date of Thanksgiving a matter of federal law and fixing the day as the fourth Thursday of November.\n\n# Traditional celebrations and solemnities\n\nTurkey, usually roasted and stuffed (but sometimes deep-fried instead), is typically the featured item on most Thanksgiving feast tables. With 85% of Americans partaking in the meal, an estimated 276 million Americans dine on the festive poultry, spending an expected $1.05 billion on turkeys for Thanksgiving in 2016.\n\n## Giving thanks and religious services\n\nThe tradition of giving thanks is continued today in many forms, most notably the attendance of religious services, as well as the saying of a mealtime prayer before Thanksgiving dinner. Many houses of worship offer worship services and events on Thanksgiving themes the weekend before, the day of, or the weekend after Thanksgiving.\n\n## Penitence and prayer\n\nThanksgiving is included in the Revised Common Lectionary, which provides scriptures for Thanksgiving services. It is the last entry on the liturgical calendar before the start of Advent the following Sunday.\n\n## Charity\n\nThe poor are often provided with food at Thanksgiving time. Most communities have annual food drives that collect non-perishable packaged and canned foods, and corporations sponsor charitable distributions of staple foods and Thanksgiving dinners. The Salvation Army enlists volunteers to serve Thanksgiving dinners to hundreds of people in different locales.\n\n## Parades\n\nSince 1924, in New York City, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is held annually every Thanksgiving Day from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, and televised nationally by NBC. The parade features parade floats with specific themes, performances from Broadway musicals, large balloons of cartoon characters, TV personalities, and high school marching bands. The float that traditionally ends the Macy's Parade is the Santa Claus float, the arrival of which is an unofficial sign of the beginning of the Christmas shopping season.\n\n## Sports\n\nAmerican football is an important part of many Thanksgiving celebrations in the United States, a tradition that dates to the earliest era of the sport in the late 19th century. Professional football games are often held on Thanksgiving Day; until recently, these were the only games played during the week apart from Sunday or Monday night. The National Football League (NFL) has played games on Thanksgiving every year since its creation except during World War II. The Detroit Lions hosted a game every Thanksgiving Day from 1934 to 1938 and have hosted one every year since 1945. In 1966, the Dallas Cowboys, which were founded six years earlier, adopted the practice of hosting Thanksgiving games. The league added a third game in primetime in 2006; unlike the traditional afternoon doubleheader, this game has no fixed host.\n\n## Other sports\n\nCollege basketball holds several elimination tournaments on over Thanksgiving weekend, before the conference season. These include the Anaheim-based Wooden Legacy, the Orlando-based AdvoCare Invitational, and the Bahamas-based Battle 4 Atlantis, all of which are televised on ESPN2 and ESPNU in marathon format. The NCAA owned-and-operated NIT Season Tip-Off has also since moved to Thanksgiving week.\n\n## Television\n\nWhile not as prolific as Christmas specials, which usually begin right after Thanksgiving, there are many special television programs transmitted on or around Thanksgiving, such as A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, in addition to the live parades and football games mentioned above. In some cases, television broadcasters begin programming Christmas films and specials to run on Thanksgiving Day, taking the day as a signal for the beginning of the Christmas season.\n\n## Radio\n\n\"Alice's Restaurant,\" an 18-minute monologue by Arlo Guthrie which is partially based on an incident that happened on Thanksgiving in 1965, was first released in 1967. It has since become a tradition on numerous classic rock and classic hits radio stations to play the full, uninterrupted recording to much fanfare each Thanksgiving Day, a tradition that appears to have originated with counterculture radio host Bob Fass, who introduced the song to the public on his radio show. Another song that traditionally gets played on numerous radio stations (of many different formats) is \"The Thanksgiving Song,\" a 1992 song by Adam Sandler.\n\n## Turkey pardoning\n\nThe President of the United States has received a Thanksgiving turkey every year since 1873. For the first 41 years, the turkey was provided by Westerly, Rhode Island turkey kingpin Horace Vose. In 1947, in what began as a lobbying ploy to get President Harry Truman to stop rationing turkey for foreign aid, the National Turkey Federation has presented the President of the United States with one live turkey and two dressed turkeys in a ceremony known as the National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation. John F Kennedy was the first president reported to spare the turkey given to him (he said he did not plan to eat the bird); by the late 1970s, most of the turkeys were being sent to petting zoos, while the dressed turkeys are usually sent to a charity such as Martha's Table.\n\n## Vacation and travel\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, families and friends usually gather for a large meal or dinner. Consequently, the Thanksgiving holiday weekend is one of the busiest travel periods of the year. Thanksgiving is a four-day or five-day weekend vacation for schools and colleges. Most business and government workers (78% as of 2007) are given Thanksgiving and the day after as paid holidays. Thanksgiving Eve (also known as Blackout Wednesday), the night before Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest nights of the year for bars and clubs as many college students and others return to their hometowns to reunite with friends and family.\n\n## Criticism and controversy\n\nMuch like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving is observed by some as a \"National Day of Mourning,\" in acknowledgment of the genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists. Thanksgiving has long carried a distinct resonance for Native Americans, who see the holiday as an embellished story of \"Pilgrims and Natives looking past their differences\" to break bread.\n\n## Date\n\nSince being fixed on the fourth Thursday in November by law in 1941, the holiday in the United States can occur on any date from November 22 to 28. When it falls on November 22 or 23, it is not the last Thursday, but the penultimate Thursday in November. Regardless, it is the Thursday preceding the last Saturday of November.\n\n## Days after Thanksgiving\n\nA broader period of Thanksgivingtide leads into and follows the holiday of Thanksgiving itself. The day after Thanksgiving is a holiday for some companies and most schools. In the last two decades of the 20th century, it became known as Black Friday, the beginning of the Christmas shopping season and a day for chaotic, early-morning sales at major retailers that were closed on Thanksgiving. A contrasting movement known as Buy Nothing Day originated in Canada in 1992. The day after Thanksgiving is also Native American Heritage Day, a day to pay tribute to Native Americans for their many contributions to the United States.\n\n## Literature\n\n(federal) = federal

part of eastern Massachusetts formerly occupied by the Patuxet Indians who had died in an devastating epidemic between 1614 and 1620 After the harsh winter of 1620-1621 killed half of the Plymouth colonists, two Native intermediaries, Samoset and Tisquantum (more commonly known by the diminutive variant Squanto, and the last living member of the Patuxet) came in at the request of Massasoit, leader of the Wampanoag, to negotiate a peace treaty and establish trade relations with the colonists, as both men had some knowledge of English from previous interactions with Europeans, through both trade (Samoset) and a period of enslavement (Squanto) \n\n\nDebate over the \"first Thanksgiving\" and the invention of tradition\nJeremy Bang opines that, \"Local boosters in Virginia, Florida, and

\"New England Thanksgiving\" does not refer to an annual commemoration of the Pilgrim's 1621 harvest celebration Indeed, that 1621 event does not appear to have contributed to the early development of the modern holiday at all, as Bradford's \"Of Plimoth Plantation\" was not published until the 1850s and the booklet \"Mourt's Relation\" was typically summarized by other publications without the now-familiar thanksgiving story In fact, by the eighteenth century, the original booklet appeared to be lost or forgotten although a copy was later rediscovered in Philadelphia in 1820, with the first full reprinting in 1841 In a footnote the editor, Alexander Young, was the first person to identify the 1621 feast as the \"first Thanksgiving\", but this was only because he viewed it as similar to the traditions of New England Thanksgivings that had developed independently from it over the previous two hundred years  [30]\n\n\nSarah Hale and Godey's Ladies Book\nSarah Josepha Hale, a native of

simplicity over urban sophistication As a celebration of hearth and home, she also sought to cement a role for women within the identity of the young nation  \n\n\nEnter the Pilgrims\nWhile the

{"title": "2019_Canadian_federal_election", "content": "\nBackground\nThe 2015 federal election resulted in a Liberal majority government headed by Justin Trudeau The Conservatives became the Official Opposition (with Stephen Harper announcing his resignation as party leader) and the New Democrats (NDP) became the third party While members of the Bloc Québécois and the Greens were elected to the House, both failed to achieve the required number of MPs—twelve—for official party status Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe announced his resignation shortly after the election, and was succeeded by Parti Québécois MNA Martine Ouellet [4] After losing a leadership review, Ouellet announced she would step down as Bloc leader on June 11, 2018, [5] and was succeeded by Yves-François Blanchet on January 17, 2019 [6]\n\n\nParties and standings\nThe table below lists parties represented in the House of Commons after the 2015 federal election, and the standings at dissolution.\n\n\nBill C-44\nBill C-44 was passed in 2017 and assigned responsibility to the Parliamentary Budget Office to calculate the cost of party platforms for elections; the review was available in the 2019 election The Parliamentary Budget Office had a $500,000 budget for costing party platforms for this election, but announced it would only review a party platform at the request of the authoring party It also conducted confidential assessments of independent and party platform proposals preceding the election campaign The service was also available to members of parliament representing a party without official party status in the House of Commons, like Elizabeth May's Green Party [11]\n\n\nElectoral reform\nThe nature of the elections' results reignited calls for electoral reform [545] [546] [547] [548] [549] Some commentators argued against the current first-past-the-post system, [550] [551] [552] [553] while others defended it [554] [555] Dominic O'Sullivan, Associate Professor of Political Science at Charles Sturt University, argued that Canada should follow in New Zealand's footsteps with their electoral reform [556] News outlets also published articles showing what the election results could have looked like if Trudeau had kept his promise on electoral reform [557] [547] [558]\n\n\nAssessment of Trudeau's government\nIn July 2019, an independent academically edited study, Assessing Justin Trudeau's Liberal Government: 353 Promises and a Mandate for Change, was published by Les Presses de l'Université Laval, finding that Justin Trudeau's government kept 92 per cent of pledges, when complete and partial pledges were added together, while the Harper government kept 85 per cent of complete and partial pledges When only completed, realized pledges were calculated, Harper's government, in their last year, kept 77 per cent of promises while the Liberal government kept 53.5 per cent The book notes that Harper's pledges tended towards transactional pledges which target sub-populations while Trudeau's government's promises were transformative—ambitious pledges the Liberals took while they were the third-place party Trudeau's government, according to the researchers, and the \"last Harper government had the highest rates of follow-through on their campaign promises of any Canadian government over the last 35 years.\" [20] [21]\n\n\nElection spending\nAccording to Elections Canada rules, third parties are allowed to spend $1,023,400 in the pre-election period between June 30 and the start of the election campaign They can spend an additional $511,700 during the election campaign [22] [23]\n\n\nReimbursements for political parties and candidates\nPolitical parties receive a reimbursement for 50 per cent of their election expenses during the writ period  Similarly, electoral district associations receive a reimbursement of 60 per cent of their election expenses during the writ period Both reimbursements are publicly funded [24] [d]\n\n\nRegistered third parties\nA person or group must register as a third party immediately after incurring expenses totaling $500 or more on regulated activities that take place during the pre-election period or election period The regulated activities are partisan activities (that promote parties or candidates), election surveys, partisan advertising and election advertising Furthermore, to be a third party you must be :\n\n\nIncumbents not running for reelection\nBelow are the 44 MPs who chose not to run in the 2019 federal election:\n\n\nTimeline\nThe Parliament of

he assumed office, polling showed that Ontario Premier Doug Ford of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario was deeply unpopular—in some cases even less popular than previous Ontario Liberal Party Premier Kathleen Wynne when she lost power, [229] [230] [231] which could have deterred voters from voting for Scheer [232] [233] This worried CPC insiders and prompted the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario to call an extended recess of the provincial legislature to reduce negative news coverage, in order to help the federal Tories [234] [231] If the Conservatives lost the election, Scheer pledged to blame it on Ford during his leadership review [231] Therefore, leading up to the campaign, Andrew Scheer distanced himself from Ford and later campaigned without him [235]

the course of the campaign On July 23, Brock Grills, Green candidate for Peterborough—Kawartha, stepped down for \"personal reasons\" Grills was accused of fraud by a former employer but he and the EDA president stated that accusation was not the reason behind his stepping down Grills, who repeated his reasoning, also mentioned the Green Party central office \"pushed\" for his resignation because he was reaching out to other parties to ask them to adopt policies to curb climate change [357] On August 16, Luc Saint-Hilaire, Green candidate for Lévis—Lotbinière, was forced to resign because of a Facebook post demanding Boufeldja Benabdallah, co-founder of the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec, to denounce a man who allegedly lit his ex-wife on fire [358] On September 12, Erik Schomann, Green candidate for Simcoe North, resigned over a 2007 Facebook post which appeared to suggest he wanted to mail pieces of a pig carcass to Muslims in support of the protesters during the Muhammed comic controversy [359] On October 7, Marthe Lépine, candidate in Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, was dropped over anti-abortion comments; however, as the party missed the deadline to remove her

multiple times of using dog-whistle politics [383] [382] [384] Bernier responded to this by saying racists are not welcome in his party and acknowledging that Canada is a diverse country [385] [382] Later, Maxime Bernier generated a reaction after a photograph of him with members of an anti-immigration group surfaced online [386] [387] Bernier told the media that everyone is welcome at his events, that he is unaware of their views, that he would condemn them if the media could show that they were racists and that racists were not welcome in his party, but experts were skeptical of Bernier and thought that he was well aware of who was attending [387] A few weeks later, he was also reprimanded for being photographed with Paul Fromm A spokesperson stated that Bernier had no idea who Fromm was, but once again experts were skeptical of the explanation [388] [389] [390] On September 23, news sites revealed that one of the PPC's founding members was a White nationalist and two others had ties to Anti-immigration groups [391] [392] One of those founding members—a former American neo-Nazi leader—was volunteering for the party He was also a member of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party [393] He was removed from the party on August 29, after his past came to light [394] The PPC's spokesperson said that it did not come up during the vetting process since he came from the US They later cited to Global News that his removal was an example of the Party taking a stand against racism [391] The party told Le Devoir that they did not have enough resources to vet them at the beginning of the PPC 's formation and the two other members denied having racist views [395]\n\n\nThird-party organizations\nOn August 19, environmental groups were warned by Elections Canada that any third party that promotes information about climate change during the election period with paid advertising could be engaging in partisan activity [410] Registered charities with a charitable tax status would be required to register as a third party for the election if they engaged in any partisan activity incurring $500, which would include advertising and surveys, or risk their charitable tax status [411] These regulations were a result of People's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier expressing doubts about the legitimacy of climate change, because a third party that advertises the dangers of climate change during the election period may be considered to be indirectly advocating against the People's Party [411] After confusion about the warning, Elections Canada released a public statement to clarify that the prohibition applied only to advertising, not speech in general the following day [412]\n\n\nPlatforms\nDuring the Maclean's debate, Scheer said that

[185]\n\n\nConservative\nAbout one year after he assumed office, polling showed that Ontario Premier Doug Ford of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario was deeply unpopular—in some cases even less popular than previous Ontario Liberal Party Premier Kathleen Wynne when she lost power, [229] [230] [231] which could have deterred voters from voting for Scheer [232] [233] This worried CPC insiders and prompted the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario to call an extended recess of the provincial legislature to reduce negative news coverage, in order to help the federal Tories [234] [231] If the Conservatives lost the election, Scheer pledged to blame it on Ford during his leadership review [231] Therefore, leading up to the campaign, Andrew Scheer distanced himself from Ford and later campaigned without him [235] [236] Meanwhile, the Liberals and Scheer's opponents tried to capitalize on Ford's unpopularity by linking Scheer to the Premier multiple times [237] [238] [239]\n\n\nNew Democratic Party\nNDP candidates were dropped or stepped down during the course of the campaign On June 20, Rana Zaman, candidate for Dartmouth—Cole Harbour, was dropped over comments about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict that the party deemed \"unacceptable\" [321]\n\n\nBloc Québécois\nOn August 9, André Parizeau, Bloc candidate for Ahuntsic-Cartierville, created attention over his past communist affiliations as Leader of the Parti communiste du Québec (PCQ) [343] Parizeau disavowed the PCQ in order to be accepted as candidate [344]\n\n\nGreen Party\nSeveral GPC candidates were dropped or stepped down during the course of the campaign On July 23, Brock Grills, Green candidate for Peterborough—Kawartha, stepped down for \"personal reasons\" Grills was accused of fraud by a former employer but he and the EDA president stated that accusation was not the reason behind his stepping down Grills, who repeated his reasoning, also mentioned the Green Party central office \"pushed\" for his resignation because he was reaching out to other parties to ask them to adopt policies to curb climate change [357] On August 16, Luc Saint-Hilaire, Green candidate for Lévis—Lotbinière, was forced to resign because of a Facebook post demanding Boufeldja Benabdallah, co-founder of the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec, to denounce a man who allegedly lit his ex-wife on fire [358] On September 12, Erik Schomann, Green candidate for Simcoe North, resigned over a 2007 Facebook post which appeared to suggest he wanted to mail pieces of a pig carcass to Muslims in support of the protesters during the Muhammed comic controversy [359] On October 7, Marthe Lépine, candidate in Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, was dropped over anti-abortion comments; however, as the party missed the deadline to remove her from the ballot, she remained despite being disavowed [360]\n\n\nPeople's Party\nIn February 2019, LaPresse discovered that Martin Masse, the PPC's spokesperson, had written controversial blog posts in the past [380] The Star discovered that four members of the PPC had used racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric They were removed from the party as a result [381] [382] Bernier himself has been accused multiple times of using dog-whistle politics [383] [382] [384] Bernier responded to this by saying racists are not welcome in his party and acknowledging that Canada is a diverse country [385] [382] Later, Maxime Bernier generated a reaction after a photograph of him with members of an anti-immigration group surfaced online [386] [387] Bernier told the media that everyone is welcome at his events, that he is unaware of their views, that he would condemn them if the media could show that they were racists and that racists were not welcome in his party, but experts were skeptical of Bernier and thought that he was well aware of who was attending [387] A few weeks later, he was also reprimanded for being photographed with Paul Fromm A spokesperson stated that Bernier had no idea who Fromm was, but once again experts were skeptical of the explanation [388] [389] [390] On September 23, news sites revealed that one of the PPC's founding members was a White nationalist and two others had ties to Anti-immigration groups [391] [392] One of those founding members—a former American neo-Nazi leader—was volunteering for the party He was also a member of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party [393] He was removed from the party on August 29, after his past came to light [394] The PPC's spokesperson said that it did not come up during the vetting process since he came from the US They later cited to Global News that his removal was an example of the Party taking a stand against racism [391] The party told Le Devoir that they did not have enough resources to vet them at the beginning of the PPC 's formation and the two other members denied having racist views [395]\n\n\nThird-party organizations\nOn August 19, environmental groups were warned by Elections Canada that any third party that promotes information about climate change during the election period with paid advertising could be engaging in partisan activity [410] Registered charities with a charitable tax status would be required to register as a third party for the election if they engaged in any partisan activity incurring $500, which would include advertising and surveys, or risk their charitable tax status [411] These regulations were a result of People's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier expressing doubts about the legitimacy of climate change, because a third party that advertises the dangers of climate change during the election period may be considered to be indirectly advocating against the People's Party [411] After confusion about the warning, Elections Canada released a public statement to clarify that the prohibition applied only to advertising, not speech in general the following day [412]\n\n\nPlatforms\nDuring the Maclean's debate, Scheer said that refugees were \"jumping the queue\" Journalists called this a false statement and one expert explained that \"there is no queue\"

in Ontario It also helped the Bloc in some Quebec ridings [527] Furthermore, analysis by different news outlets showed that the PPC cost the Tories six to seven seats However, a Tory strategist said that it is not guaranteed that PPC voters would have voted for the Conservatives The PPC's spokesperson echoed similar sentiments [528] [529] [530]\n\n\nAnalysis\nVote-splitting benefited the

cabinet would be sworn in on November 20, 2019 [342] On November 4, 2019, Elizabeth May announced that she would be stepping down as leader of the Green Party [535] On December 12, 2019, Andrew Scheer announced that he was resigning as leader of the Conservative Party [536]\n\n\nRecounts\nDefeated parties sought recounts in three ridings where the races were won by a few hundred votes The Bloc Québécois made its request in the Quebec Superior Court for the ridings of Hochelaga and Québec [537] [538] and the NDP sought a recount for the riding of Port Moody—Coquitlam Federal judges accepted the requests and ruled that recounts should happen for those ridings [539] [540] All three recount requests were withdrawn during the recounting process, thus the victors stayed the same [541] [542] [543] [544]\n\n\nElectoral reform\nThe nature of the elections' results reignited calls for electoral reform [545] [546] [547] [548] [549] Some commentators argued against the current first-past-the-post system, [550] [551] [552] [553] while others defended it [554] [555] Dominic O'Sullivan, Associate Professor of Political Science at Charles Sturt University, argued that Canada should follow in New Zealand's footsteps with their electoral reform [556] News outlets also published articles showing what the election results could have looked like if Trudeau had kept his promise on electoral reform [557] [547] [558]\n\n\nWestern Canadian separatism\nAfter Justin Trudeau's re-election on October 21, 2019, #Wexit trended on social media [562] However, experts stated part of the push was due to disinformation and bots [563] [564] On November 4, 2019, the separatist group Wexit Alberta applied for federal political party status [565] On November 6, 2019, a poll conducted by Ipsos show a historic high level of interest in secession from Canada in both Alberta and Saskatchewan by 33% and 27%, respectively [566] [567] On January 12, 2020, Wexit Canada was granted eligibility for the next federal election [568] They subsequently changed their name to the Maverick Party [569]\n\n\nChinese government interference\nIn late 2022, Global News reported on a suspected attempt by the government of China to infiltrate the Parliament of Canada by funding a network of candidates to run in the 2019 federal election [570] [571] [572] [573] [574] Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated on November 20, 2022, regarding alleged interference in the election that \"I do not have any information, nor have I been briefed on any federal candidates receiving any money from China\" [575] In February 2023, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) concluded that the Chinese government interfered in the 2019 elections [576]\n\n\nDeregistered parties\nThe Progressive Canadian Party was deregistered by Elections Canada on October 30, 2019, for failing to comply with the reporting provisions of the Canada Elections Act [577]\n\n\nSee

late 1800s and early 1900s, the board ordered Japanese American and Korean American students attending public schools to transfer to the Oriental Public School, which serviced Chinese students, in 1905 This drew ire from the Empire of Japan and forced Theodore Roosevelt to intervene, who was wary of Japan's recent victory in the Russo-Japanese War After Roosevelt realized that this was a matter of immigration and that the ordinance affected only 93 students, he brokered the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907, whereby the students would be allowed into the schools and the Japanese government would stop issuing passports for laborers to the United States, after initially failing to persuade the board to rescind their decision [5]\n\n\nTransition from appointed to elected members\nFor decades up to 1971, the mayor appointed school board members, who were then confirmed by voters in the next election In November 1971, voters approved Proposition S, which made Board of Education members elected directly by voters The push came as backlash against the school board's efforts to use busing desegregate schools [7] [8]\n\n\nModern history\nArlene Ackerman began her tenure as the superintendent of SFUSD on August 1, 2000, succeeding Superintendent Bill Rojas Under her tenure, Ackerman overhauled the district's facilities department, which was misappropriating city funds Further investigations

Unified School District (SFUSD), responsible for overseeing the education of students in San Francisco, California. The board is composed of seven members, each elected to a four-year term.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe San Francisco Board of Education has a long history dating back to the mid-19th century, when the city first established its public school system. Over the years, the board has played a crucial role in shaping the education landscape of San Francisco, from establishing new schools and programs to addressing issues of equity and access. In recent years, the board has faced numerous challenges, including budget deficits, teacher strikes, and controversies over school closures and renaming.\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\nThe board's responsibilities include:\n\n* Setting policies and making decisions on education-related issues\n* Overseeing the district's budget and finances\n* Appointing and evaluating the superintendent of schools\n* Approving curriculum and instructional materials\n* Ensuring compliance with state and federal laws and regulations\n\n**Pay**\n\nBoard members are paid around $6,000 a year.\n\n**Early History**\n\nIn October 1849, John C Pelton opened a school in a Baptist church in San Francisco. It was funded by voluntary donations and tuition, with poor children able to attend for free. In 1850, the city council adopted an ordinance making it free public school for all children, a first in California. In September 1851, the school was reorganized under an ordinance providing for a San Francisco Board of Education and a superintendent.\n\n**Founding**\n\nIn October 1849, John C Pelton opened a school in a Baptist church in San Francisco.

In September 1851, the school was reorganized under an ordinance providing for a San Francisco Board of Education and a superintendent.\n\n**Segregating Students of East Asian Descent**\n\nWith Japanese immigration to the United States increasing in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the board ordered Japanese American and Korean American students attending public schools to transfer to the Oriental Public School, which serviced Chinese students, in 1905. This drew ire from the Empire of Japan and forced Theodore Roosevelt to intervene, who was wary of Japan's recent victory in the Russo-Japanese War. After Roosevelt realized that this was a matter of immigration and that the ordinance affected only 93 students, he brokered the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907, whereby the students would be allowed into the schools and the Japanese government would stop issuing passports for laborers to the United States, after initially failing to persuade the board to rescind their decision.\n\n**Transition from Appointed to Elected Members**\n\nFor decades up to 1971, the mayor appointed school board members, who were then confirmed by voters in the next election. In November 1971, voters approved Proposition S, which made Board of Education members elected directly by voters. The push came as backlash against the school board's efforts to use busing to desegregate schools.\n\n**Modern History**\n\nArlene Ackerman began her tenure as the superintendent of SFUSD on August 1, 2000, succeeding Superintendent Bill Rojas. Under her tenure, Ackerman overhauled the district's facilities department, which was misappropriating city funds. Further investigations led to financial settlements for the district by companies who were defrauding them and the federal government, garnering the district more than $45 million dollars. Her fiscal management garnered praise from even her critics.\n\n**2000-2006: Arlene Ackerman Era**\n\nArlene Ackerman began her tenure as the superintendent of SFUSD on August 1, 2000, succeeding Superintendent Bill Rojas.

Her fiscal management garnered praise from even her critics.\n\n**2006-2019**\n\nThe board voted 6-1 in June 2007 to hire Carlos Garcia as the new superintendent, signing a contract that was less costly than Ackerman's. Commissioner Kim-Shree Maufas dissenting, citing a need for more time to consider his appointment.\n\n**JROTC**\n\nIn November 2006, the board voted 4-2 to eliminate the JROTC program altogether in the entire city within two years, stating that \"armed forces should have no place in public schools, and the military's discriminatory stance on gays makes the presence of JROTC unacceptable.\"\n\n**Programs**\n\nIn March 2019, the board unanimously voted to expand the pilot program at Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 Community School that housed that school's homeless families to include eligibility across the school district.

spanning over four decades. Born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Holiday's life was marked by both personal struggles and professional triumphs.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\nHoliday's early life was marked by poverty and instability. Her mother, Sadie Fagan, was a teenage prostitute who gave birth to Holiday at the age of 19. Holiday's father, Clarence Halliday, abandoned the family soon after her birth, and Holiday was raised by her mother and various relatives. Despite these challenges, Holiday developed a passion for music at an early age, influenced by jazz singers such as Bessie Smith and Ethel Waters.\n\nIn her early teens, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in Harlem, where she was discovered by jazz musicians and critics. She took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and Clarence Halliday, her father. Holiday's early career was marked by struggles with racism, sexism, and personal demons, but she persevered and honed her craft.\n\n**1915–1929: Childhood**\n\nHoliday was born on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia to African American unwed teenage couple Clarence Halliday and Sarah Julia \"Sadie\" Fagan (née Harris). Her mother moved to Philadelphia at age 19, after she was evicted from her parents' home in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland, for becoming pregnant. With no support from her parents, she made arrangements with her older, married half-sister, Eva Miller, for Holiday to stay with her in Baltimore.\n\nNot long after Holiday was born, her father abandoned his family to pursue a career as a jazz banjo player and guitarist. Some historians have disputed Holiday's paternity, as a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives lists her father as \"Frank DeViese.\" Other historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker. DeViese lived in Philadelphia, and Sadie, then known by her maiden name Harris, may have met him through her work.\n\n**1929–1935: Early Career**\n\nAs a young teenager, Holiday started singing in nightclubs in Harlem. She took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and Clarence Halliday, her father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \"Halliday\", her father's birth surname, but eventually changed it to \"Holiday\", his performing name.\n\nThe young singer teamed up with a neighbor, tenor saxophone player Kenneth Hollan. They were a team from 1929 to 1931, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, Pod's and Jerry's on 133rd Street, and the Brooklyn Elks Club. Benny Goodman recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including the Mexico's and the Alhambra Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with Chick Webb.\n\n**1935–1938: Recordings with Teddy Wilson**\n\nIn 1935, Holiday was signed to Brunswick by John Hammond to record pop tunes with pianist Teddy Wilson in the swing style for the growing jukebox trade. They were allowed to improvise on the material, and Holiday's improvisation of melody to fit the emotion was highly skillful. Their first collaboration included \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" and \"Miss Brown to You.\" \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" has been deemed her \"claim to fame.\" Brunswick did not favor the recording session because producers wanted Holiday to sound more like Cleo Brown. However, after \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" was successful, the company began considering Holiday an artist in her own right.\n\n**1937–1938: Working for Count Basie and Artie Shaw**\n\nIn late 1937, Holiday had a brief stint as a big-band vocalist with Count Basie.

Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx, used the pseudonym \"Lewis Allan\" for the poem, which was set to music and performed at teachers' union meetings.

Holiday later said that the imagery of the song reminded her of her father's death and that this played a role in her resistance to performing it.\n\n**1940–1947: Commercial Success**\n\nHoliday's mother Sadie, nicknamed \"The Duchess,\" opened a restaurant called Mom Holiday's. She used money from her daughter while playing dice with members of the Count Basie band, with whom she toured in the late 1930s. \"It kept Mom busy and happy and stopped her from worrying and watching over me,\" Holiday said. Fagan began borrowing large amounts from Holiday to support the restaurant. Holiday obliged but soon fell on hard times herself. \"I needed some money one night and I knew Mom was sure to have some,\" she said. \"So I walked in the restaurant like a stockholder and asked Mom turned me down flat. She wouldn't give me a cent.\" The two argued, and Holiday shouted angrily, \"God bless the child that's got his own,\" and stormed out.\n\nWith Arthur Herzog, Jr., a pianist, she wrote a song based on the lyric, \"God Bless the Child,\" and added music. \"God Bless the Child\" became Holiday's most popular and most covered record.

Her manager, Joe Glaser, jazz critic Leonard Feather, photojournalist Allan Morrison, and the singer's own friends all tried in vain to persuade her to go to a hospital. On May 31, 1959, Holiday was finally taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York for treatment of both liver and heart disease. While in the hospital, narcotics police came to her hospital room and placed her under house arrest for narcotics possession. On July 15, she received last rites. Holiday died at age 44 at 3:10 am on July 17, 1959, of pulmonary edema and heart failure caused by cirrhosis of the liver.\n\n**Artistry**\n\nHoliday's vocal delivery made her performances instantly recognizable throughout her career. Her improvisational prowess compensated for her lack of formal musical education. Holiday stated that she had always wanted her voice to sound like an instrument, and some of her influences included trumpeter Louis Armstrong and singer Bessie Smith. Early in her career, she was said to have had her accompanying instrumentalists stop and repeat an improvised line if she believed she could use it for a vocal line.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIn the book The NPR Curious Listener's Guide to Jazz, jazz historian Loren Schoenberg asserted that \"no one would dispute that Billie Holiday is the definitive Jazz Singer.\"\n\n**Films and Plays about Holiday**\n\nThe biographical film Lady Sings the Blues, loosely based on Holiday's autobiography, was released in 1972 and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Diana Ross. Another film, The United States vs Billie Holiday, starred Andra Day and was released in 2021. It is based on the book Chasing the Scream by Johann Hari. Director Lee Daniels saw how Holiday was portrayed in the 1972 biopic, and wanted to show her legacy as \"a civil rights leader... not just a drug addict or a jazz singer.\" The film also depicts Holiday's bisexuality and relationship with Tallulah Bankhead. Day was also nominated for Best Actress but did not win. However, she won a Golden Globe in 2021.\n\n**Discography**\n\nBillie Holiday recorded extensively for four labels: Columbia Records, which issued her recordings on its subsidiary labels Brunswick Records, Vocalion Records, and OKeh Records, from 1933 through 1942; Commodore Records in 1939 and 1944; Decca Records from 1944 through 1950; briefly for Aladdin Records in 1951; Verve Records and on its earlier imprint Clef Records from 1952 through 1957, then again for Columbia Records from 1957 to 1958, and finally for MGM Records in 1959. Many of Holiday's recordings appeared on 78-rpm records prior to the long-playing vinyl record era, and only Clef, Verve, and Columbia issued albums during her lifetime that were not compilations of previously released material. Many compilations have been issued since her death, as well as comprehensive box sets and live recordings.\n\n**Hit Records**\n\nIn 1986, Joel Whitburn's company Record Research compiled information on the popularity of recordings released from the era predating rock and roll and created pop charts dating back to the beginning of the commercial recording industry. The company's findings were published in the book Pop Memories 1890–1954. Several of Holiday's records are listed on the pop charts Whitburn created.\n\n**Studio LPs**\n\n1. **Lady Sings the Blues** (1956)\n2. **Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook** (1956)\n3.

parents' home in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland, for becoming pregnant With no support from her parents, she made arrangements with her older, married half-sister, Eva Miller, for Holiday to stay with her in Baltimore Not long after Holiday was born, her father abandoned his family to pursue a career as a jazz banjo player and guitarist [8] Some historians have disputed Holiday's paternity, as a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives lists her father as \"Frank DeViese\" Other historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker [9] DeViese lived in Philadelphia, and Sadie, then known by her maiden name Harris, may have met him through her work Harris married Philip Gough in 1920, [10] but the

by her maiden name Harris, may have met him through her work Harris married Philip Gough in 1920, [10] but the marriage only lasted a few years [11]\n\n\n1929–1935: Early career\nAs a young teenager, Holiday started singing in nightclubs in Harlem She took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and Clarence Halliday, her father  [23] At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \"Halliday\", her father's birth surname, but eventually changed it to \"Holiday\", his performing name The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, tenor saxophone player Kenneth Hollan They were a team from 1929 to 1931, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, Pod's and Jerry's on 133rd Street, and the Brooklyn Elks Club  [24] [25] Benny Goodman recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including the Mexico's and the Alhambra Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with Chick Webb It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing in Fletcher Henderson's band [26]\n\n\n1935–1938: Recordings with Teddy Wilson\nIn 1935, Holiday was signed to Brunswick by John Hammond to record pop tunes with pianist Teddy Wilson in the swing style for the growing jukebox trade They were allowed to improvise on the material Holiday's improvisation of melody to fit the emotion was highly skillful Their first collaboration included \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" and \"Miss Brown to You\" \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" has been deemed her \"claim to fame\" [30] Brunswick did not favor the recording session because producers wanted Holiday to sound more like Cleo Brown However, after \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" was successful, the company began considering Holiday an artist in her own right [31] She began recording under her own name a year later for Vocalion in sessions produced by Hammond and Bernie Hanighen [32] Hammond said the Wilson-Holiday records from 1935 to 1938 were a great asset to Brunswick According to Hammond, Brunswick was broke and unable to record many jazz tunes Wilson, Holiday, Young, and other musicians came into the studio without written arrangements, reducing the recording cost Brunswick paid Holiday a flat fee rather than royalties, which saved the company money \"I Cried for You\" sold 15,000 copies, which Hammond called \"a giant hit for Brunswick... Most records that made money sold around three to four thousand.\" [33]\n\n\n1937–1938: Working for Count Basie and Artie Shaw\nIn late 1937, Holiday had a brief stint as a big-band vocalist with Count Basie [36] The traveling conditions of the band were often poor; they performed many one-nighters in clubs, moving from city to city with little stability Holiday chose the songs she sang and had a hand in the arrangements, choosing to portray her developing persona of a woman unlucky in love Her tunes included \"I Must Have That Man\", \"Travelin' All Alone\", \"I Can't Get Started\", and \"Summertime\", a hit for Holiday in 1936, originating in George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess the year before Basie became used to Holiday's heavy involvement in the band He said, \"When she rehearsed with the band, it was really just a matter of getting her tunes like she wanted them, because she knew how she wanted to sound and you couldn't tell her what to do.\" [37] Some of the songs Holiday performed with Basie were recorded \"I Can't Get Started\", \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\", and \"Swing It Brother Swing\" are all commercially available [38] Holiday was unable to record in the studio with Basie, but she included many of his musicians in her recording sessions with Teddy Wilson.\n\n\n1939: \"Strange Fruit\" and Commodore Records\nHoliday was in the middle of recording for Columbia in the late 1930s when she was introduced to \"Strange Fruit\", a song by Abel Meeropol based on his poem about lynching Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx, used the pseudonym \"Lewis Allan\" for the poem, which was set to music and performed at teachers' union meetings [46] It was eventually heard by Barney Josephson, the proprietor of Café Society, an integrated nightclub in Greenwich Village, who introduced it to Holiday She performed it at the club in 1939, [47] with some trepidation, fearing possible retaliation She later said that the imagery of the song reminded her of her father's death and that this played a role in her resistance to performing it.\n\n\n1940–1947: Commercial success\nHoliday's mother Sadie, nicknamed \"The Duchess\", opened a restaurant called Mom Holiday's She used money from her daughter while playing dice with members of the Count Basie band, with whom she toured in the late 1930s \"It kept Mom busy and happy and stopped her from worrying and watching over me\", Holiday said Fagan began borrowing large amounts from Holiday to support the restaurant Holiday obliged but soon fell on hard times herself \"I needed some money one night and I knew Mom was sure to have some\", she said \"So I walked in the restaurant like a stockholder and asked Mom turned me down flat She wouldn't give me a cent.\" The two argued, and Holiday shouted angrily, \"God bless the child that's got his own\", and stormed out With Arthur Herzog, Jr., a pianist, she wrote a song based on the lyric, \"God Bless the Child\", and added music [53] \"God Bless the Child\" became Holiday's most popular and most covered record It reached number 25 on the charts in 1941 and was third in Billboard's songs of the year, selling over a million records [54] [55] In 1976, the song was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame [56] Herzog claimed Holiday contributed only a few lines to the lyrics He said she came up with the line \"God bless the child\" from a dinner conversation the two had had [57]\n\n\n1947–1952: Legal issues and Carnegie Hall concert\nBy 1947, Holiday was at her commercial peak, having made $250,000 in the three previous years [74] She was ranked second in the DownBeat poll for 1946 and 1947, her highest ranking in that poll [75] She was ranked fifth in Billboard's annual college poll of \"girl singers\" on July 6, 1947 (Jo Stafford was first) In 1946, Holiday won the Metronome magazine popularity poll [76]\n\n\n1952–1959: Lady Sings the Blues\nBy the 1950s, Holiday's drug use, drinking, and relationships with abusive men caused her health to deteriorate She appeared on the ABC reality series The Comeback Story to discuss attempts to overcome her poor choices.\n\n\nIllness and death\nBy early 1959, Holiday was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver Although she had initially stopped drinking on her doctor's orders, it was not long before she relapsed [103] By May 1959, she had lost 20 pounds (9.1 kg) Her manager, Joe Glaser, jazz critic Leonard Feather, photojournalist Allan Morrison, and the singer's own friends all tried in vain to persuade her to go to a hospital [104] On May

It is a day when children are the focal point of attention, and various events, functions, and activities are organized to promote their welfare and well-being.\n\n## History\n\nThe concept of Children's Day in India has its roots in the post-independence era. On 5 November 1948, the first Children's Day was observed as \"Flower Day\" by the predecessor of Indian Council of the Child Welfare (ICCW) to collect funds for United Nations Appeal for Children (UNAC) through the sale of \"flower tokens\". This initiative was aimed at generating funds to support the welfare of children across the world.\n\nHowever, it was on 30 July 1949 that \"Children's Day\" was widely celebrated and publicized through radio, articles, cinema, and other media. The idea was to create a day when children would be the center of attention, and their welfare and well-being would be the primary focus.\n\n## Nehru and Children\n\nJawaharlal Nehru, affectionately known as \"Chacha Nehru\" or \"Uncle Nehru\" by children, was a great admirer of children. He believed that children were the future of the nation and that their welfare and education were crucial for the country's progress. As the Prime Minister, Nehru wanted to create an atmosphere in the country where the attention was constantly focused on children and their welfare.\n\nNehru's love for children was evident in his numerous interactions with them. He would often be seen smiling and laughing with children, and his affection for them was a constant source of happiness for him. In fact, Nehru's fondness for children was so well-known that it earned him the nickname \"Chacha Nehru\".\n\n## Establishment of Children's Film Society India\n\nIn 1955, Nehru established the Children's Film Society India, with the aim of producing and distributing films that would cater to the needs of children. The society aimed to create films that would educate and entertain children, and help them understand the world around them.\n\nThe establishment of the Children's Film Society India was a significant step towards promoting children's welfare and education in India. The society produced a wide range of films, including documentaries, animated films, and feature films, that catered to the needs of children.\n\n## Changing the Date of Children's Day\n\nIn recent years, there have been demands to change the date of Children's Day in India. In 2018, sixty MPs of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) requested the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, to designate 26 December as Children's Day.\n\nThe MPs suggested that December 26, the day of martyrdom of Chhote Sahibzaade (the younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh), be observed as Children's Day, while November 14 be celebrated as \"Chacha Diwas\" in memory of Nehru.\n\nHowever, the proposal to change the date of Children's Day has been met with opposition from many quarters. The opposition parties and various child welfare organizations have argued that changing the date of Children's Day would undermine the significance of Nehru's contributions to the welfare of children in India.\n\nIn conclusion, Children's Day in India is a day that commemorates the birthday of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. Nehru was a great admirer of children, and his love for them was evident in his numerous interactions with them. The establishment of the Children's Film Society India in 1955 was a significant step towards promoting children's welfare and education in India.\n\nWhile there have been demands to change the date of Children's Day, the opposition to the proposal has been significant. The debate on the date of Children's Day is ongoing, and it remains to be seen whether the date will be changed in the future.\n\nIn any case, Children's Day in India remains an important day that highlights the significance of children's welfare and education in the country. It is a day that reminds us of our responsibilities towards children and the importance of creating a better future for them.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Children's_Day_(India)\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nOn 5 November 1948, the first Children's Day was observed as \"Flower Day\" by the predecessor of Indian Council of the Child Welfare (ICCW) to collect funds for United Nations Appeal for Children (UNAC) through the sale of \"flower tokens\" On 30 July 1949, \"Children's Day\" was widely celebrated and publicised through radio, articles, cinema, etc [2]\n\n\nNehru and children\nJawaharlal Nehru was affectionately called Chacha Nehru (\"Uncle Nehru\") by children, and their faith in him was a constant source of happiness for him [10] As the Prime Minister, Nehru wanted to \"create an atmosphere in the country where the attention is constantly focused on children and their welfare\" [17] He had also established Children's Film Society India in 1955 so that Indian children could see themselves represented [18]\n\n\nDemand to change date\nIn 2018, sixty MPs of BJP requested the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to designate 26 December as Children's Day They suggested that December 26, the day of martyrdom of Chhote Sahibzaade (younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh) be observed as Children's Day, while November 14 be celebrated as \"Chacha Diwas\" in memory of Nehru [24]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on October 8, 1920, in Tacoma, Washington, Herbert spent most of his life exploring the complexities of human nature, politics, and ecology through his writing. His works, which span over two decades, have captivated readers worldwide, leaving an indelible mark on the science fiction genre.\n\nBiography\nFrank Patrick Herbert Jr was born on October 8, 1920, in Tacoma, Washington, to Frank Patrick Herbert Sr and Eileen (née McCarthy) Herbert. His paternal grandparents had come west in 1905 to join Burley Colony in Kitsap County, one of many utopian communes springing up in Washington State beginning in the 1890s. Herbert's upbringing was marked by a deep connection to the natural world, as he spent a significant amount of time on the rural Olympic and Kitsap Peninsulas. He was an avid reader, capable of devouring newspapers before the age of five, and had an excellent memory and learning abilities.\n\nHerbert's early life was not without its challenges. His parents' drinking problems led him to run away from home with his little sister, Patricia Lou, in 1938 to live with his aunt and uncle. However, within weeks, Patricia returned home, and Frank, then 18, remained with his aunt and uncle. This period marked a significant turning point in Herbert's life, as he began to develop a sense of independence and self-reliance.\n\nEducation\nHerbert's educational journey began at Salem High School (now North Salem High School), where he graduated the next year. In 1939, his parents and sister had moved to Los Angeles, California, and Frank followed them. He lied about his age to secure his first newspaper job at the Glendale Star. However, Herbert soon returned to Salem in 1940, where he worked for the Oregon Statesman newspaper (now Statesman Journal) in various positions, including photographer.\n\nEarly Career\nIn a 1973 interview, Herbert stated that he had been reading science fiction \"about ten years\" before he began writing in the genre. He listed his favorite authors as H G Wells, Robert A Heinlein, Poul Anderson, and Jack Vance. Herbert's early writing career was marked by a focus on various genres, including science fiction, fantasy, and mystery.\n\nDune\nHerbert began researching Dune in 1959, a project that would eventually become one of the most iconic science fiction novels of all time. He was able to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career thanks to his wife, Beverly, who returned to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores. The novel Dune was published in 1965, which spearheaded the Dune franchise. Herbert later revealed that the novel originated when he was assigned to write a magazine article about sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. However, he got overinvolved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article, which eventually became the seed that would become Dune.\n\nSuccess, Family Changes, and Death\nHerbert's change in fortune was shadowed by tragedy. In 1974, his wife Beverly underwent treatment for lung cancer, which affected her health for the next ten years. In October 1978, Herbert was the featured speaker at the Octocon II science fiction convention held at the El Rancho Tropicana in Santa Rosa, California. In 1979, he met anthropologist Jim Funaro with whom he conceived the Contact Conference. Beverly Herbert passed away on February 7, 1984. Herbert completed and published Heretics of Dune that year.\n\nPolitical Views\nHerbert was a Republican and an environmentalist. His political views have been described as conservative, reactionist, and libertarian. Herbert was politically active within the Republican party and worked as a speechwriter for several politicians, including Senator Guy Cordon. He also volunteered on the campaign of Republican William Blintz in the 1958 Washington Senate election, who unsuccessfully challenged the incumbent Democrat Henry M Jackson.\n\nIdeas and Themes\nFrank Herbert used his science fiction novels to explore complex ideas involving philosophy, religion, psychology, politics, and ecology. The underlying thrust of his work was a fascination with the question of human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a dedicated fan base, many of whom have attempted to read everything he wrote (fiction or non-fiction). His works have been praised for their depth, complexity, and thought-provoking nature.\n\nStatus and Influence on Science Fiction\nDune and the Dune saga constitute one of the world's best-selling science fiction series and novels. Dune has received widespread critical acclaim, winning the Nebula Award in 1965 and sharing the Hugo Award in 1966. It is frequently considered one of the best science fiction novels ever, if not the best. Locus subscribers voted it the all-time best SF novel in 1975, again in 1987, and the best \"before 1990\" in 1998.\n\nBibliography\nHerbert's estate and WordFire Press have released four previously unpublished novels in e-book and paperback formats: High-Opp (2012), Angels' Fall (2013), A Game of Authors (2013), and A Thorn in the Bush (2014).\n\nPosthumously Published Works\nHerbert's estate and WordFire Press have continued to release previously unpublished works, including the aforementioned novels, which provide a glimpse into the author's creative process and the evolution of his ideas.\n\nReferences\nQuinn, Judy (November 17, 1997) \"Bantam Pays $3M for Dune Prequels by Herbert's Son\" Publishers Weekly Archived from the original on March 4, 2016 Retrieved February 6, 2014 The new prequels .. will be based on notes and outlines Frank Herbert left at his death in 1986.\n\nSources\nHerbert, Frank (1965) Dune.

She has been involved in various high-profile endeavors, including founding a legal tech company, funding research initiatives, and supporting political campaigns. Her personal life has also been subject to public attention, particularly her marriages and relationships with prominent figures.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nNicole Shanahan was born on September 26, 1985, in Placer County, California. Her parents, Shawn and Amy Shanahan (née Wong), raised her in Oakland, California. Shanahan's father struggled with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and depression, and substance abuse, while her mother worked as a maid and later became an accountant. Shanahan has a younger brother.\n\nGrowing up in a challenging environment, Shanahan has spoken publicly about the difficulties she faced in her childhood. In a 2023 interview, she described her childhood as \"very hard\" and marked by traumatic experiences and poverty. Despite these challenges, Shanahan has achieved significant success in her career and personal life.\n\n**Career**\n\nWhile pursuing her law degree, Shanahan was an exchange student at the National University of Singapore. Her interest in patent law led her to become a lawyer, and she founded ClearAccessIP, a Palo Alto-based legal tech company. Shanahan served as the company's CEO before selling it to IPwe in 2020, in exchange for an estimated $20 million in IPwe stock. Unfortunately, IPwe went bankrupt in 2024.\n\nShanahan's entrepreneurial spirit and expertise in patent law have made her a prominent figure in the tech industry. Her decision to sell ClearAccessIP to IPwe demonstrates her ability to adapt and navigate the ever-changing landscape of the tech world.\n\n**Bia-Echo and Advocacy**\n\nIn 2018, Shanahan helped launch the Center for Female Reproductive Longevity and Equality within the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. This initiative aims to advance research on women's health and longevity. Shanahan's commitment to this cause reflects her dedication to improving human health and well-being.\n\nShanahan's philanthropic efforts extend beyond her work with the Center. She has made significant contributions to various organizations and causes, demonstrating her willingness to use her resources to drive positive change.\n\n**Political Contributions and Involvement**\n\nIn the 2010s and 2020s, Shanahan has made various contributions to left-leaning organizations and Democratic political candidates. Her support for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and Ro Khanna's congressional campaigns is notable. Shanahan's contributions to Measure J, a criminal justice reform referendum in Los Angeles County, demonstrate her commitment to social justice.\n\nIn 2020, Shanahan contributed $150,000 to support George Gascón's campaign for Los Angeles County District Attorney. Her involvement in politics reflects her interest in shaping policy and promoting progressive causes.\n\n**Role in Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Presidential Campaign**\n\nIn May 2023, Shanahan donated the maximum of $6,600 to Robert F. Kennedy Jr's presidential campaign. After Kennedy dropped out of the Democratic primaries and announced his independent candidacy, Shanahan initially expressed disappointment but later reversed course and resumed backing Kennedy's campaign.\n\nIn early 2024, Shanahan donated $4 million to a super PAC to fund a 30-second television Super Bowl ad supporting Kennedy's campaign. Shanahan's involvement in the campaign reflects her commitment to supporting Kennedy's candidacy and her willingness to invest in his campaign.\n\n**Vice-Presidential Running Mate**\n\nIn March 2024, Kennedy's campaign manager, Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, confirmed that Shanahan was on the candidate's short list of potential running mates. The campaign also considered Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura.\n\nOn March 26, 2024, Kennedy formally announced Shanahan as his selection for vice president during a campaign event in Oakland, California. Shanahan's ability to bankroll the Kennedy campaign was seen as an advantage.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2014, Shanahan married Jeremy Asher Kranz, a San Francisco Bay Area investor and finance executive. However, weeks before their marriage, she began an affair with Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, which Kranz discovered from texts on her phone.\n\nShanahan and Kranz divorced in 2015. She met Brin at a yoga festival in Lake Tahoe in 2014, and they married in 2018. Brin and Shanahan have a daughter together, born in 2018. They maintain an estate at Point Dume in Malibu, California, purchased in 2020.\n\n**Political Views**\n\nIn interviews in 2024, Shanahan expressed her views on vaccines, stating that she is \"not an anti-vaxxer\" but supports Kennedy's anti-vaccine advocacy and questions the scientific consensus on vaccine safety and efficacy.\n\nAfter being selected as Kennedy's running mate, Shanahan referenced discredited anti-vaccine claims and implied that childhood vaccines contribute to autism, a debunked notion that Kennedy has promoted for years. On X (formerly Twitter), she promoted COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, asserting that the vaccines are unsafe.\n\nShanahan's views on vaccines reflect her willingness to challenge established scientific consensus and her commitment to supporting Kennedy's campaign, even if it means promoting misinformation.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nicole_Shanahan\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nShanahan was born to Shawn and Amy Shanahan (née Wong) in Placer County, California, on September 26, 1985 [1] She grew up in Oakland, California [2] [16] In a 2023 interview, she said she had a \"very hard\" childhood marked by traumatic experiences and poverty [2] [14] Shanahan said her father, a computer specialist [17] of German and Irish descent [14] who died in 2014, [2] had bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, [2] and depression, [16] and struggled with substance abuse [14] [18] Shanahan's mother was born in China and immigrated to the U.S from Guangzhou in the 1980s; [19] she worked as a maid before becoming an accountant [4] [2] [20] Shanahan has a younger brother [21]\n\n\nCareer\nWhile in law school, Shanahan was an exchange student at National University of Singapore [11] She became interested in patent law as a law student; after becoming a lawyer, she founded a Palo Alto-based legal tech company, ClearAccessIP, and was its CEO [5] [3] She sold the company to a competitor, IPwe, in 2020, [11] [3] in exchange for an estimated $20 million in IPwe stock; IPwe went bankrupt in 2024 [10]\n\n\nBia-Echo and advocacy\nIn 2018, Shanahan helped fund and launch the Center for Female Reproductive Longevity and Equality within the Buck Institute for Research on Aging [29] [30]\n\n\nPolitical contributions and involvement before 2024\nIn the 2010s and 2020s, Shanahan made various contributions to left-leaning organizations and Democratic political candidates, [11] including Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and Ro Khanna's congressional campaigns [18] In 2020, she was a \"major donor\" to Measure J, a criminal justice reform referendum in Los Angeles County [37] Also in 2020, she contributed $150,000 to support George Gascón's campaign for Los Angeles County District Attorney [38]\n\n\nRole in Robert F.

Queen Caroline Mathilda while treating the mentally ill Danish monarch, Christian VII The movie was one of the highest budget Danish films of all time largely due to its extravagant costumes and was well received by critics [32] Mikkelsen said of his role, \"I was surprised how emotional I got reading this, especially for a period drama And it was full of dilemma – he's full of love for both the king and the queen, but then he remains political, starts spinning his tunnel vision, and all of a sudden he's doing the exact same things he hated all the other courtiers for doing, and I thought that was interesting, and very human.\" [21] In 2012, he was also awarded the Danish American Society's Person of the Year [33]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2000, Mikkelsen married choreographer Hanne

about \"Austria_national_football_team\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe Austrian Football Association (\"ÖFB\") was founded on 18 March 1904 in the Austro-Hungarian Empire Max Scheuer, a Jewish defender who played for the Austria national football team in 1923, was subsequently killed during the Holocaust in Auschwitz concentration camp [3] [4] [5] The team enjoyed success in the 1930s under coach Hugo Meisl, becoming a dominant side in Europe and earning the nickname \"Wunderteam\" The team's star was Matthias Sindelar On 16 May 1931, they were the first continental European side to defeat Scotland In the 1934 FIFA World Cup, Austria finished fourth after losing 0–1 to Italy in the semi-finals and 2–3 to Germany in the third place play-off \n\n\nPre-World War II\nThe Austrian Football Association (\"ÖFB\") was founded on 18 March 1904 in the Austro-Hungarian Empire Max Scheuer, a Jewish defender who played for the Austria national football team in 1923, was subsequently killed during the Holocaust in Auschwitz concentration camp [3] [4] [5] The team enjoyed success in the 1930s under coach Hugo Meisl, becoming a dominant side in Europe and earning the nickname \"Wunderteam\" The team's star was Matthias Sindelar On 16 May 1931, they were the first continental European side to defeat Scotland In the 1934 FIFA World Cup, Austria finished fourth after losing 0–1 to Italy in the semi-finals and 2–3 to Germany in the third place play-off \n\n\nAfter World War II\nAfter World War II, Austria's 1938 annexation to Germany was annulled and Austria, as before, competed internationally Austria's best result came in 1954 with a team starring midfielder Ernst Ocwirk They lost in the semi-finals 1–6 to eventual champions Germany in battle in scorching heat (no substitutions were allowed at the time), but finished third after beating defending champions Uruguay 3–1 Over the years, a strong yet mainly lopsided rivalry with Germany developed.\n\n\n1970s and 1980s\nAnchored by Herbert Prohaska and striker Hans Krankl, and backed up by Bruno Pezzey, Austria reached the World Cup in 1978 and 1982 and both times reached the second round, held in team group matches that replaced the knockout quarter-finals This Austria team, coached by Helmut Senekowitsch, is widely regarded as the best post-World War II Austrian football team of all-time [citation needed]\n\n\n1990s\nLed by striker Toni Polster, Austria qualified for the 1990 World Cup but were eliminated in the first round, despite defeating the United States 2–1 Much worse was the stunning 1–0 loss against the Faroe Islands, a team made of amateurs, in the qualifying campaign for the 1992 European Championship, considered  [by whom?] the worst embarrassment in any Austrian team sport ever, and one of the biggest upsets in footballing history The game was played in Landskrona, Sweden, as there were no grass fields on the Faroe Islands It was a sign for things to come, as Austria suffered another couple of years of botched qualifying campaigns, despite playing some entertaining football in the closing stages of UEFA Euro 1996 qualification.\n\n\n21st century\nAfter 1998, Austria began to decline They failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2000, and suffered embarrassment (similar to the Faroe Islands loss) when they lost 9–0 to Spain and 5–0 to Israel in 1999 In 2006, Josef Hickersberger became coach of the Austria national team, which included some respectable results such as a 1–0 victory against Switzerland in 2006.\n\n\n2000: Decline\nAfter 1998, Austria began to decline They failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2000, and suffered embarrassment (similar to the Faroe Islands loss) when they lost 9–0 to Spain and 5–0 to Israel in 1999 In 2006, Josef Hickersberger became coach of the Austria national team, which included some respectable results such as a 1–0 victory against Switzerland in 2006.\n\n\n2010s: Revival and setbacks\nIn the qualifying campaign for Euro 2012, the Austrians played against Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Turkey and Germany.\n\n\n2020s: European Championship knockout stages\nAustria was drawn into UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group G alongside Poland, North Macedonia, Slovenia, Israel, and Latvia Austria struggled in the first few games after a loss to Poland at home, a loss to Israel, and another to Latvia Austria then won six of the last nine game matches and finished second in the group with 19 points Marko Arnautović led the team in most goals and tied Poland's Robert Lewandowski with nine goals Austria qualified for their third European Championship finals, the second time Austria qualified for a major tournament consecutively since the 1954 and 1958 World Cups.\n\n\nRivalry\nWhile the match-up between Austria and Hungary is the second most-played international match in football (only Argentina and Uruguay, another two neighboring countries, have met each other in more matches), Austria's arch rival, especially since World War II, is Germany [12] Though Austria has been the underdog (much like Scotland—England), the one-sided rivalry (much felt in Austria, not so in Germany) had produced some noteworthy victories by the underdog Austrians, most notably a 3:2 in Cordoba at the 1978 World Cup This mythologized victory is, notably, not listed in German accounts of the Austria—German rivalry [13] As for Austria vs Hungary, it is also notable in which both countries are the first European, non-British countries to play international matches, three full decades after the first ever international football match.\n\n\nResults and fixtures\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any

Her older brother Francis is a director who has worked for fashion designer Michael Kors and singers Pixie Lott and Birdy.\n\nGrowing up, Wallis was exposed to the arts from a young age.

After completing her education, Wallis moved to Portugal to appear in several short films, where she gained valuable experience and built her portfolio.\n\n## Career\n\nIn 2005, Wallis returned to London to pursue a career in film. She began by doing advertisements and looking into drama schools, but ultimately decided to find an agent.

will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race in the future years to come.\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe modern encyclopedia evolved from the dictionary in the 18th century; this lineage can be seen in the alphabetical order of print encyclopedias [20] Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been

and their definitions Synonymous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment Thus, a dictionary

dictionary after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.\n\n\nDifferences between encyclopedias and dictionaries\nThere are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose

dictionary is a linguistic work that primarily focuses on an alphabetical listing of words and their definitions Synonymous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited information, analysis or background for the word defined While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in understanding the meaning, significance or limitations of a term, and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge.\n\n\nFour major elements\nFour major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:\n\n\nEncyclopedic dictionaries\nSome works entitled \"dictionaries\" are similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the Dictionary of the Middle Ages, the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, and Black's Law Dictionary) The Macquarie Dictionary, Australia's national dictionary, became an encyclopedic dictionary after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.\n\n\nDifferences between encyclopedias and dictionaries\nThere are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries [5] [21] There are differences in content as well Generally speaking, dictionaries provide linguistic information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the things for which those words stand [8] [9] [10] [11] Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be [8]\n\n\nPre-modern encyclopedias\nThe earliest encyclopedic work to have survived to modern times is the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder, a Roman statesman living in the 1st century AD, [7] [23] [24] [25] a work indebted to Varro (1st century BCE) [26]  He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and all aspects of the world around him [25] This work became very popular in Antiquity, was one of the first classical manuscripts to be printed in 1470, and has remained popular ever since as a source of information on the Roman world, and especially Roman art, Roman technology and Roman engineering.\n\n\nPrinted encyclopedias\nBefore the advent of the printing press, encyclopedic works were all hand-copied and thus rarely available, beyond wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning: they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.\nDuring the Renaissance, the creation of printing allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her copy The De expetendis et fugiendis rebus by Giorgio Valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by Aldo Manuzio in Venice This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by Archimedes), newly discovered and translated The Margarita Philosophica by Gregor Reisch, printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts.\n\n\nEncyclopédie\nEncyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers (French for 'Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts and Crafts'), [30] better known as Encyclopédie (French:  [ɑ̃siklɔpedi]), was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations It had many writers, known as the Encyclopédistes It was edited by Denis Diderot and, until 1759, co-edited by Jean le Rond d'Alembert [31]\n\n\nEncyclopædia Britannica\nThe Encyclopædia Britannica (Latin for 'British Encyclopaedia') is a general knowledge English-language encyclopaedia It has been published by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc since 1768, although the company has changed ownership seven times The encyclopaedia is maintained by about 100 full-time editors and more than 4,000 contributors The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32 volumes [37] and 32,640 pages, was the last printed edition Since 2016, it has been published exclusively as an online encyclopaedia.\n\n\nBrockhaus Enzyklopädie\nThe Brockhaus Enzyklopädie (German for Brockhaus Encyclopedia) is a German-language encyclopedia which until 2009 was published by the F A Brockhaus printing house.\n\n\nEncyclopedias in the United States\nIn the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans The best known of these were World Book and Funk and Wagnalls As many as 90% were sold door to door [23] Jack Lynch says in his book You Could Look It Up that encyclopedia salespeople were so common that they became the butt of jokes He describes their sales pitch saying, \"They were selling not books but a lifestyle, a future, a promise of social mobility.\" A 1961 World Book ad said, \"You are holding your family's future in your hands right now,\" while showing a feminine hand holding an order form [46] As of the 1990s, two of the most prominent encyclopedias published in the United States were Collier's Encyclopedia and Encyclopedia Americana [47]\n\n\nDigital encyclopedias\nBy the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on CD-ROMs for use with personal computers This was the usual way computer users accessed encyclopedic knowledge from the 1980s and 1990s Later, DVD discs replaced CD-ROMs, and by the mid-2000s, internet encyclopedias were dominant and replaced disc-based software encyclopedias [7]\n\n\nPhysical media\nBy the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on CD-ROMs for use with personal computers This was the usual way computer users accessed encyclopedic knowledge from the 1980s and 1990s Later, DVD discs replaced CD-ROMs, and by the mid-2000s, internet encyclopedias were dominant and replaced disc-based software encyclopedias [7]\n\n\nOnline\nThe concept of a free encyclopedia began with the Interpedia proposal on Usenet in 1993, which outlined an Internet-based online encyclopedia to which anyone could submit content that would be freely accessible Early projects in this vein included Everything2 and Open Site In 1999, Richard Stallman proposed the GNUPedia, an online encyclopedia which, similar to the GNU operating system, would be a \"generic\" resource The concept was very similar to Interpedia, but more in line with Stallman's GNU philosophy.\n\n\nFree encyclopedias\nThe

Kiedis, known professionally as Blackie Dammett [3] His paternal grandfather's family emigrated from Lithuania in the early 1900s In 2004, Kiedis wrote that his paternal grandmother, Molly VanderVeen, \"was a pastiche of English, Irish, French, and Dutch (and, as we've recently discovered, some Mohican blood)\" [4] In 1966, when Kiedis was three years old, his parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother in Grand Rapids His mother later remarried and had two more children [5] Each summer, Kiedis would visit his father in Hollywood, California, for two weeks, where the two would bond Kiedis idolized his father, recalling: \"Those trips to California were the happiest, most carefree, the-world-is-a-beautiful-oyster times I'd ever experienced.\" [6] In 1974, when Kiedis was 12, he moved to Hollywood to live with his father full-time [7]\n\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\nKiedis began working with Flea and drummer Jack Irons, where he was described as a \"manic master of ceremonies\" before he even began singing for the group Irons and Slovak began playing together in high school, performing together in a band called Chain Reaction The group included then bassist Tom Strasman and Chile-born vocalist and guitarist Alain Johannes Strasman was intent on becoming a lawyer, and quit the band to keep his grades up and focus on college Shortly after hanging out with the band, and attending a few shows, Flea offered Kiedis a position in the band Kiedis began as a hype man, going out in front of the band blurting out jokes to the audience and getting them pumped up [16]\n\n\n1983–1984: Formation and first album\nKiedis began working with Flea and drummer Jack Irons, where he was described as a \"manic master of ceremonies\" before he even began singing for the group Irons and Slovak began playing together in high school, performing together in a band called Chain Reaction The group included then bassist Tom Strasman and Chile-born vocalist and guitarist Alain Johannes Strasman

of Hillel Slovak\nFunk musician George Clinton was hired to produce the band's second album, Freaky Styley, as Slovak returned on guitar The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly Freaky Styley was released in August 1985 It received only a bit more attention than The Red Hot Chili Peppers with roughly 75,000 copies sold by year's end [17] The band hired Michael Beinhorn, their last resort among potential producers, to work on their next album [28] What Is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid-1986 after Martinez was fired Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained Flea recalled that \"it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy\" [28] Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album's material by themselves Both Kiedis and Slovak struggled with debilitating heroin addictions, which grew worse as the band was preparing to record The Uplift Mofo Party Plan Due to his addiction, Kiedis lacked the motivation to contribute to the band musically, and appeared at rehearsal \"literally asleep\" [29] He was asked to leave the band in order to undergo drug rehabilitation During that time, the band won the LA Weekly Band of the Year award, which prompted Kiedis to quit using heroin cold turkey He visited his mother in Michigan for guidance, who drove him to drug rehabilitation immediately after picking him up from the airport upon seeing his unhealthy appearance [30] Kiedis checked into a Salvation Army rehabilitation clinic in Grand Rapids, Michigan, an experience which he initially detested until he noted that the other people in the clinic were understanding of his struggles and were trying to help him He moved in with his mother after twenty days at the clinic, a time which marked the first time he was completely abstinent from drugs since he was eleven years old [31] After Kiedis completed his stint in rehabilitation, he felt a \"whole new wave of enthusiasm\" due to his sobriety and wrote the lyrics to a new song titled \"Fight Like a Brave\" on the flight home [32]\n\n\n1989–1993: Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik\nThe Chili Peppers entered the studio, and completed recording of their fourth album, Mother's Milk, in early 1989 Upon release, the album was met with mixed reactions from critics, but received far more commercial attention, peaking at number fifty-two on the Billboard 200 [46] Although his band was experiencing greater success, Kiedis' withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his personal life This led to the end of his two-year relationship with Ione Skye in December 1989: \"I had managed to stay sober by not ingesting drugs, so my body had healed from all that torturous activity, but my mind still wasn't healthy enough to work out all the problems that come up in a relationship.\" [47]\n\n\n1994–1997: One Hot Minute\nMonths went by, and only small amounts of material were written leading Chad Smith to publicly announce that Kiedis was suffering from writer's block, though Kiedis denied this The rest of the recording was completed within the next month and their sixth album One Hot Minute was released in September 1995, featuring the band's new guitarist Dave Navarro [55] The album was met with mixed reviews and was a major departure from the band's funk-punk sound The tour to support the album was also met with mixed results Chad Smith broke his arm prior to the launch of the U.S tour in 1995 so it was delayed until early 1996 Near the tour's end, Kiedis was involved in a motorcycle accident, which left him with a broken arm The tour ended with the band's final set being cut short due to a massive typhoon The year 1997 was dubbed \"The Year of Nothing\" by the band's bassist Flea [56]\n\n\n1998–2010: Californication, By the Way, and Stadium Arcadium\nThe band regrouped in 1998 to begin writing for their seventh studio album; however, Navarro was now battling his own drug problems This caused major tension between Kiedis and Navarro, who was fired from the band in early 1998 Flea informed Kiedis that he felt the only way the band could possibly continue is if Frusciante re-joined the band In the years following Frusciante's departure from the Chili Peppers, he had developed a vicious addiction to both heroin and cocaine that left him in poverty and near death [57] He was talked into admitting himself to drug rehabilitation in January 1998 [58] In April 1998, following Frusciante's three-month completion, Flea visited his former bandmate and openly invited him to re-join the band, an invitation Frusciante readily accepted Within the week, and for the first time in six years, the foursome gathered to play and jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers [59] The band released Californication on June 8, 1999.\n\n\n2011–2015: I'm with You and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction\nOn August 26, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released their tenth album, I'm with You On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were named 2012 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Kiedis said it was very emotional and the first person he told was his father, who cried when hearing the news [72] On January 11, 2012, the Chili Peppers announced that they were forced to postpone the U.S leg of their I'm with You tour due to multiple foot injuries suffered by Kiedis Kiedis has been battling through foot injuries since 2006 when he injured his foot onstage and finally was able to have surgery during a break in the band's tour in January 2012 During the surgery, Kiedis had a crushed sesamoid bone removed and a detached flexor tendon repaired The band was able to resume their tour and kicked off the U.S leg on March 29, 2012 [73] The tour in support of I'm with You ended in April 2013 and the band continued touring into mid-2014 which included a halftime performance with Bruno Mars at the Super Bowl in February 2014 [74]\n\n\n2016–present: Health scare, The Getaway, Unlimited Love, and Return Of the Dream Canteen\nOn May 14, 2016, the band were forced to cancel their headlining slot at the annual KROQ Weenie Roast, as Kiedis was rushed to the hospital prior to the band appearing on stage [78] It was confirmed that Kiedis was suffering from intestinal flu and was expected to make a full recovery; however, the band was forced to postpone their iHeartRadio album preview show on May 17, 2016, which was rescheduled for May 26.\n\n\nOther projects\nUsing the stage name Cole Dammett (adapted from his father's stage name, Blackie Dammett), Kiedis landed a number of small roles in television and film as a teenager in the late 1970s His early credits include F.I.S.T and the 1978 ABC Afterschool Special It's a Mile from Here to Glory Resuming his acting work in the 1990s, Kiedis

young woman he kidnapped, had Flea and Kiedis playing metalheads who chase Sheen's character in a 4 × 4 truck and end up crashing [citation needed]\n\n\nArtistry\nWhile creating lyrics and melodies for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kiedis has drawn from various sources for inspiration His first musical memory was hearing Neil Young's \"Heart of Gold\" at age eleven: \"It moved me so much that I insisted my mother buy me the 45.\" [101] In high school, he was highly influenced by the rap-style vocals of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's \"The Message\" and the \"in-your-face sexual lyrics\" of Prince's \"Dirty Mind\" [102] Kiedis writes most of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' lyrics Starting with 1989's Mother's Milk album, John Frusciante and Flea have written nearly all of the music (excluding melodies) for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Kiedis adds lyrics and melodies he hears during instrumental jams by his bandmates Kiedis said in 2006, \"Somehow I find songs.. in the bigness of what they're doing.\" His lyrical style has varied over the years During the band's early years, Kiedis wrote many lyrics detailing his enjoyment of sex, drugs, and life in Los Angeles As his musical tastes expanded and his outlook on life changed, he began writing songs about a wider spectrum of subjects His lyrics include many of the same themes as the writings of Charles Bukowski, Kiedis' main literary influence [103]\n\n\nMusical style\nWhile creating lyrics and melodies for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kiedis has drawn from various sources for inspiration His first musical

Tissue, which he co-wrote with author Larry Sloman The book was originally intended to be a collection of stories of his childhood drug use, but evolved into a complete autobiography [105] He further explained: \"One would just kind of assume that with all the  [drug] consumption that my memory would be a bit shoddy But it's actually pretty lucid, and better than both of my parents', or any of my friends' My friends tried to recount these same stories, and they were like, 'Wow, I don't .. were we there?'\" [105] The book was an international bestseller [106]\n\n\nTelevision series and movie\nKiedis was developing a series for HBO based on his unconventional upbringing in Los Angeles The show was expected to be loosely based on much of Kiedis' autobiography He had partnered with Catapult 360 partners Marc Abrams and Michael Benson to create the series, titled Spider and Son [108] The series would center on Kiedis's relationship with his father, Blackie Dammett, who sold many drugs and mingled with rock stars on the Sunset Strip, all while aspiring to get into show business The show was scheduled to premiere in late 2010 at the very earliest [109]\n\n\nPersonal

experimented himself, Kiedis was constantly exposed to drug-using and drug-dealing behavior while growing up Some of Kiedis's early drug use came from substances he got from his father [12]\n\n\nFeud with Mike Patton\nFor over 30 years, Kiedis and Faith No More/Mr Bungle singer Mike Patton have been involved in an ongoing feud [137] Prior to that feud, Faith No More (then fronted by Chuck Mosley) and Red Hot Chili Peppers had toured together However, tensions arose between the two bands in 1989 when Kiedis accused Mosley's replacement, Patton, of imitating his mannerisms and image on stage and during the music video for their biggest hit, \"Epic\" [137] [138] The two attacked each other in the media throughout 1990, including an interview in which Kiedis directly accused Patton of imitating him, claiming; \"My drummer  [Chad Smith] says he's gonna kidnap  [Patton], shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he'll be forced to find a style of his own\"

The tour in support of I'm with You ended in April 2013 and the band continued touring into mid-2014 which included a halftime performance with Bruno Mars at the Super Bowl in February 2014.\n\n**2016–present: Health Scare, The Getaway, Unlimited Love, and Return Of the Dream Canteen**\n\nOn May 14, 2016, the band were forced to cancel their headlining slot at the annual KROQ Weenie Roast, as Kiedis was rushed to the hospital prior to the band appearing on stage. It was confirmed that Kiedis was suffering from intestinal flu and was expected to make a full recovery; however, the band was forced to postpone their iHeartRadio album preview show on May 17, 2016, which was rescheduled for May 26.\n\n**Other Projects**\n\nUsing the stage name Cole Dammett (adapted from his father's stage name, Blackie Dammett), Kiedis landed a number of small roles in television and film as a teenager in the late 1970s. His early credits include F.I.S.T and the 1978 ABC Afterschool Special It's a Mile from Here to Glory. Resuming his acting work in the 1990s, Kiedis played a hooligan surfer named Tone, in the 1991 Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze movie Point Break. The Chase, a 1994 movie starring Charlie Sheen as an estranged man trying to escape the cops with a young woman he kidnapped, had Flea and Kiedis playing metalheads who chase Sheen's character in a 4x4 truck and end up crashing.\n\n**Artistry**\n\nWhile creating lyrics and melodies for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kiedis has drawn from various sources for inspiration. His first musical memory was hearing Neil Young's \"Heart of Gold\" at age eleven: \"It moved me so much that I insisted my mother buy me the 45.\" In high school, he was highly influenced by the rap-style vocals of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's \"The Message\" and the \"in-your-face sexual lyrics\" of Prince's \"Dirty Mind.\" Kiedis writes most of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' lyrics. Starting with 1989's Mother's Milk album, John Frusciante and Flea have written nearly all of the music (excluding melodies) for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Kiedis adds lyrics and melodies he hears during instrumental jams by his bandmates. Kiedis said in 2006, \"Somehow I find songs.. in the bigness of what they're doing.\" His lyrical style has varied over the years. During the band's early years, Kiedis wrote many lyrics detailing his enjoyment of sex, drugs, and life in Los Angeles. As his musical tastes expanded and his outlook on life changed, he began writing songs about a wider spectrum of subjects. His lyrics include many of the same themes as the writings of Charles Bukowski, Kiedis' main literary influence.\n\n**Television Series and Movie**\n\nKiedis was developing a series for HBO based on his unconventional upbringing in Los Angeles. The show was expected to be loosely based on much of Kiedis' autobiography. He had partnered with Catapult 360 partners Marc Abrams and Michael Benson to create the series, titled Spider and Son. The series would center on Kiedis's relationship with his father, Blackie Dammett, who sold many drugs and mingled with rock stars on the Sunset Strip, all while aspiring to get into show business. The show was scheduled to premiere in late 2010 at the very earliest.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nKiedis's father, Blackie Dammett, was an actor who appeared in over 50 movies and television shows. Dammett also ran the band's fanclub for many years. Dammett's autobiography, Lords of the Sunset Strip, was released on March 31, 2013. Through Dammett, Kiedis also has a much younger half-brother. During the Chili Peppers show of June 25, 2017, in Grand Rapids, Kiedis dedicated \"Soul to Squeeze\" to his father, who was suffering from dementia. Dammett died on May 12, 2021.\n\n**Family and Relationships**\n\nKiedis's father, Blackie Dammett, was an actor who appeared in over 50 movies and television shows.

Dammett died on May 12, 2021.\n\n**Drug Addictions**\n\nKiedis has battled drug addiction, including heroin and cocaine, throughout his life. Since his father had more relaxed standards on drugs and experimented himself, Kiedis was constantly exposed to drug-using and drug-dealing behavior while growing up. Some of Kiedis's early drug use came from substances he got from his father.\n\n**Feud with Mike Patton**\n\nFor over 30 years, Kiedis and Faith No More/Mr Bungle singer Mike Patton have been involved in an ongoing feud. Prior to that feud, Faith No More (then fronted by Chuck Mosley) and Red Hot Chili Peppers had toured together. However, tensions arose between the two bands in 1989 when Kiedis accused Mosley's replacement, Patton, of imitating his mannerisms and image on stage and during the music video for their biggest hit, \"Epic.\" The two attacked each other in the media throughout 1990, including an interview in which Kiedis directly accused Patton of imitating him, claiming; \"My drummer (Chad Smith) says he's gonna kidnap (Patton), shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he'll be forced to find a style of his own.\"\n\n**Discography**\n\n* The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984)\n* Freaky Styley (1985)\n* The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987)\n* Mother's Milk (1989)\n* Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991)\n* What Hits!

professionally as Blackie Dammett [3] His paternal grandfather's family emigrated from Lithuania in the early 1900s In 2004, Kiedis wrote that his paternal grandmother, Molly VanderVeen, \"was a pastiche of English, Irish, French, and Dutch (and, as we've recently discovered, some Mohican blood)\" [4] In 1966, when Kiedis was three years old, his parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother in Grand Rapids His mother later remarried and had two more children [5] Each summer, Kiedis would visit his father in Hollywood, California, for two weeks, where the two would bond Kiedis idolized his father, recalling: \"Those trips to California were the happiest, most carefree, the-world-is-a-beautiful-oyster times I'd ever experienced.\" [6] In 1974, when Kiedis was 12, he moved to Hollywood to live with his father full-time [7]\n\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\nKiedis began working with Flea and drummer Jack Irons, where he was described as a \"manic master of ceremonies\" before he even began singing for the group Irons and Slovak began playing together in high school, performing together in a band called Chain Reaction The group included then bassist Tom Strasman and Chile-born vocalist and guitarist Alain Johannes Strasman was intent on becoming a lawyer, and quit the band to keep his grades up and focus on college Shortly after hanging out with the band, and attending a few shows, Flea offered Kiedis a position in the band Kiedis began as a hype man, going out in front of the band blurting out jokes to the audience and getting them pumped up [16]\n\n\n1983–1984: Formation and first album\nKiedis began working with Flea and drummer Jack Irons, where he was described as a \"manic master of ceremonies\" before he even began singing for the group Irons and Slovak began playing together in high school, performing together in a band called Chain Reaction The group included then bassist Tom Strasman and Chile-born vocalist and guitarist Alain Johannes Strasman was intent on becoming a lawyer, and quit the band to keep his grades up and focus on college Shortly after hanging out with the band, and attending a few shows, Flea offered Kiedis a position in the band Kiedis began as a hype man, going out in front of the band blurting out jokes to the audience and getting them pumped up [16]\n\n\n1985–1988: Freaky Styley, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, and death of Hillel Slovak\nFunk musician George Clinton was hired to produce the band's second album, Freaky Styley, as Slovak returned on guitar The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly Freaky Styley was released in August 1985 It received only a bit more attention than The Red Hot Chili Peppers with roughly 75,000 copies sold by year's end [17] The band hired Michael Beinhorn, their last resort among potential producers, to work on their next album [28] What Is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid-1986 after Martinez was fired Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained Flea recalled that \"it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy\" [28] Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album's material by themselves Both Kiedis and Slovak struggled with debilitating heroin addictions, which grew worse as the band was preparing to record The Uplift Mofo Party Plan Due to his addiction, Kiedis lacked the motivation to contribute to the band musically, and appeared at rehearsal \"literally asleep\" [29] He was asked to leave the band in order to undergo drug rehabilitation During that time, the band won the LA Weekly Band of the Year award, which prompted Kiedis to quit using heroin cold turkey He visited his mother in Michigan for guidance, who drove him to drug rehabilitation immediately after picking him up from the airport upon seeing his unhealthy appearance [30] Kiedis checked into a Salvation Army rehabilitation clinic in Grand Rapids, Michigan, an experience which he initially detested until he noted that the other people in the clinic were understanding of his struggles and were trying to help him He moved in with his mother after twenty days at the clinic, a time which marked the first time he was completely abstinent from drugs since he was eleven years old [31] After Kiedis completed his stint in rehabilitation, he felt a \"whole new wave of enthusiasm\" due to his sobriety and wrote the lyrics to a new song titled \"Fight Like a Brave\" on the flight home [32]\n\n\n1989–1993: Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik\nThe Chili Peppers entered the studio, and completed recording of their fourth album, Mother's Milk, in early 1989 Upon release, the album was met with mixed reactions from critics, but received far more commercial attention, peaking at number fifty-two on the Billboard 200 [46] Although his band was experiencing greater success, Kiedis' withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his personal life This led to the end of his two-year relationship with Ione Skye in December 1989: \"I had managed to stay sober by not ingesting drugs, so my body had healed from all that torturous activity, but my mind still wasn't healthy enough to work out all the problems that come up in a relationship.\" [47]\n\n\n1994–1997: One Hot Minute\nMonths went by, and only small amounts of material were written leading Chad Smith to publicly announce that Kiedis was suffering from writer's block, though Kiedis denied this The rest of the recording was completed within the next month and their sixth album One Hot Minute was released in September 1995, featuring the band's new guitarist Dave Navarro [55] The album was met with mixed reviews and was a major departure from the band's funk-punk sound The tour to support the album was also met with mixed results Chad Smith broke his arm prior to the launch of the U.S tour in 1995 so it was delayed until early 1996 Near the tour's end, Kiedis was involved in a motorcycle accident, which left him with a broken arm The tour ended with the band's final set being cut short due to a massive typhoon The year 1997 was dubbed \"The Year of Nothing\" by the band's bassist Flea [56]\n\n\n1998–2010: Californication, By the Way, and Stadium Arcadium\nThe band regrouped in 1998 to begin writing for their seventh studio album; however, Navarro was now battling his own drug problems This caused major tension between Kiedis and Navarro, who was fired from the band in early 1998 Flea informed Kiedis that he felt the only way the band could possibly continue is if Frusciante re-joined the band In the years following Frusciante's departure from the Chili Peppers, he had developed a vicious addiction to both heroin and cocaine that left him in poverty and near death [57] He was talked into admitting himself to drug rehabilitation in January 1998 [58] In April 1998, following Frusciante's three-month completion, Flea visited his former bandmate and openly invited him to re-join the band, an invitation Frusciante readily accepted Within the week, and for the first time in six years, the foursome gathered to play and jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers [59] The band released Californication on June 8, 1999.\n\n\n2011–2015: I'm with You and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction\nOn August 26, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released their tenth album, I'm with You On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were named 2012 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Kiedis said it was very emotional and the first person he told was his father, who cried when hearing the news [72] On January 11, 2012, the Chili Peppers announced that they were forced to postpone the U.S leg of their I'm with You tour due to multiple foot injuries suffered by Kiedis Kiedis has been battling through

Tissue, which he co-wrote with author Larry Sloman The book was originally intended to be a collection of stories of his childhood drug use, but evolved into a complete autobiography [105] He further explained: \"One would just kind of assume that with all the  [drug] consumption that my memory would be a bit shoddy But it's actually pretty lucid, and better than both of my parents', or any of my

Similarly, a critic from The Times of India noted \"director Lokesh Kanagaraj gives us an exquisite, even-handed thriller — handsomely shot, tightly edited and propped up by a grungy score — that unobtrusively makes its points while narrating a gripping story\" [3] S Shivakumar of The Hindu opined that \"Each scene makes you eagerly await the next with a climax that is befitting\" [27]

New Indian Express wrote that \"All that it needs is a solid screenplay, deft treatment and a right selection of cast to make it an interesting and an eminently watchable fare 'Maanagaram' is proof of that!\" [6] Srivatsan wrote for India Today, \"Showcasing the capital of Tamil Nadu in a grim light, that too in his debut film is as close to jeopardising one's career as possible  [...] But Lokesh

Born on September 20, 1948, in Mumbai, India, Bhatt comes from a family of filmmakers and has been instrumental in shaping the Indian film industry. He has been a driving force behind many critically acclaimed films, and his contributions to Indian cinema have been widely recognized.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMahesh Bhatt was born to Nanabhai Bhatt and Shirin Mohammad Ali. His father, a Gujarati Hindu Nagar Brahmin, was a renowned filmmaker in his own right, while his mother, a Gujarati Muslim, was a strong influence on Bhatt's early life. Bhatt's family background played a significant role in shaping his career, as he was exposed to the world of filmmaking from a young age. His father's film production company, Filmistan, was a prominent player in the Indian film industry during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n**Mainstream Career**\n\nBhatt made his directorial debut with the film \"Manzilein Aur Bhi Hain\" in 1974, which starred Kabir Bedi and Prema Narayan. The film received moderate success, but it was his next film, \"Lahu Ke Do Rang,\" released in 1979, that brought him critical acclaim. The film, starring Shabana Azmi and Vinod Khanna, won two Filmfare Awards in 1980: Helen received her first Filmfare as Best Supporting Actress, and Madhukar Shinde won it for Best Art Direction. The film did \"above average\" at the box office, and Bhatt's career began to take off.\n\nBhatt's next film, \"Arth\" (1982), was a major turning point in his career. The film, which explored themes of love, relationships, and the human condition, was a critical and commercial success. Bhatt's personal life inspired the film, and it showcased his ability to craft thought-provoking stories. He continued to draw from his personal experiences, creating critically acclaimed works such as \"Janam\" (1985) and \"Saaransh\" (1984), an exploration of an old couple's anxieties in a universe governed by arbitrary violence.\n\n**Other Professional Work**\n\nIn addition to his film career, Bhatt is co-owner of the film production house, Vishesh Films, with his brother, Mukesh Bhatt. The company has produced numerous successful films, including \"Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin,\" \"Sadak,\" and \"Aashiqui.\" However, due to differences between the brothers, Mukesh Bhatt took over Vishesh Films in 2011. In May 2021, it was publicly announced that Mahesh Bhatt was no longer associated with the firm.\n\nBhatt is also a member of the advisory board of U.S.-based nonprofit organization TeachAids, which focuses on providing education and awareness about HIV/AIDS and other health-related issues.\n\n**Political Views**\n\nBhatt has been vocal about his political views, particularly on the topic of secularism. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he campaigned in a \"Karvan-e-Bedari\" (caravan of awareness) asking people to vote for the Congress party and defeat BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. Bhatt believes that Modi is communal and has a poor record on secularism.\n\nBhatt has also been critical of the Congress party's role in the 1984 Sikh riots, which resulted in the deaths of thousands of Sikhs. He plans to make a film that addresses the riots and their aftermath, highlighting the need for justice and accountability.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 1970, Bhatt married Lorraine Bright (later known as Kiran Bhatt), an American woman. The couple's romance was the inspiration for his film \"Aashiqui.\" They have a daughter, Pooja, who is a filmmaker and actress, and a son, Rahul, who is an aspiring actor.\n\nBhatt began an affair with actress Parveen Babi in the 1970s, but it did not last long. In 1986, he married Soni Razdan, a British actress, to avoid having to divorce his first wife. The couple converted to Islam prior to their wedding and have two daughters, Shaheen and Alia, who is a well-known actress.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nAs a director and producer, Mahesh Bhatt has had a lasting impact on the Indian film industry. He has launched the careers of numerous actors and actresses, including Anupam Kher, Rahul Roy, Anu Aggarwal, and Alia Bhatt. His films have been critically acclaimed and have addressed a range of social issues, including love, relationships, and the human condition.\n\nBhatt's legacy extends beyond his film career.

follow his serves with approaches to the net, though not strictly in a serve-and-volley tactic Isner's movement around the court was limited by his large body, and he struggled most with players who

was an American professional wrestler, actor, and musician. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.\n\nEarly life\nRandy Poffo was born on November 15, 1952, in Columbus, Ohio, the eldest son of Judith (née Sverdlin) and Angelo Poffo. His father was Italian American, and his mother was Jewish American; Poffo was raised Catholic. Randy's father was a well-known wrestler in the 1950s and 1960s, and his younger brother, Lanny Poffo, also went into wrestling.\n\nBaseball career\nSavage was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a catcher out of high school. He was placed in the minor leagues to develop, where he mostly played as an outfielder in the Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds farm systems. Savage was 18 when he began playing minor league baseball, and one of his teammates on the 1971 Gulf Coast League Cardinals was Larry Herndon, who was also his roommate. Savage would swing a bat into a hanging car tire to strengthen his hands and utilize his legs during swings. This technique was so effective that Herndon used it during his career as a baseball coach. Savage injured his natural (right) throwing shoulder after a collision at home plate and learned to throw with his left arm instead. Savage's last season was 1974, when he played for the Class A Tampa Tarpons in the Reds organization. He played 289 games over four minor league seasons, batting .254 with 16 home runs and 129 RBI.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\nSavage first broke into the wrestling business in 1973 during the fall and winter of the baseball off-season. His first wrestling character, The Spider, was similar to Spider-Man. He later took the ring name Randy Savage at the suggestion of his longtime friend and trainer Terry \"The Goose\" Stephens and Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) booker Ole Anderson, who said that the name Poffo did not fit someone who \"wrestled like a savage.\" Savage eventually decided to end his stalled baseball career and join his father and brother to wrestle full-time. He wrestled his first match against Midwest Territory wrestler \"Golden Boy\" Paul Christy. Savage worked with his father and brother in Michigan, the Carolinas, Georgia, the Maritimes, and the eastern Tennessee territory run by Nick Gulas.\n\nEarly career (1973–1985)\nSavage first broke into the wrestling business in 1973 during the fall and winter of the baseball off-season.

While in the latter position, he was the President of the United Nations Security Council in December 1995, June 1997, July 1998, October 1999, December 2000, April 2002, and June 2003.\n\n**Foreign Minister of Russia (2004-Present)**\n\nOn March 9, 2004, President Vladimir Putin appointed Lavrov to the post of minister of foreign affairs. He succeeded Igor Ivanov in the post.\n\n**Civil War in Syria**\n\nIn 2012, a Russian delegation travelled to Syria to affirm Russia's backing of the Syrian government. Lavrov and Mikhail Fradkov, who were part of the delegation, were given a favorable welcome by thousands of pro-Assad supporters. The supporters waved Russian flags in thanks to Russia's veto of a UN resolution calling for tough sanctions on the Syrian government.\n\n**Russian-Ukrainian Conflict (2014)**\n\nAfter the March 2014 Crimean status referendum, Lavrov proposed that Ukraine should be independent of any bloc, that the Russian language be recognised officially, and that the constitution be organised along federal lines. In an interview with the Russia-24 TV channel, Lavrov said that the zero-sum \"either-or\" bloc-politics of Ukraine were first suggested in 2004 by Karel De Gucht, then Foreign Minister of Belgium.\n\n**2017 North Korea Crisis**\n\nLavrov likened the war of words between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to a kindergarten fight between two children, saying \"Together with China we'll continue to strive for a reasonable approach and not an emotional one like when children in a kindergarten start fighting and no-one can stop them.\"\n\n**US Sanctions**\n\nLavrov criticized US sanctions against countries like Iran, Turkey, and Russia. In August 2018, Lavrov said, \"unilateral enforcement measures are illegitimate in international affairs\" and that \"One way to counter these illegitimate barriers and restrictions is we can use national currencies on our bilateral trade\" and \"I strongly believe that abuse of the role the U.S dollar plays as an international currency will eventually result in its role being undermined.\"\n\n**Ukraine's Education Law**\n\nLavrov condemned Ukraine's 2017 education law, which makes Ukrainian the only language of education in state schools. According to Lavrov, the \"reaction of Brussels to the Ukrainian Law on Education is utterly vague although it crudely violates Kyiv's commitments on linguistic and educational rights.\" Russia's Foreign Ministry stated that the law is designed to \"forcefully establish a mono-ethnic language regime in a multinational state.\"\n\n**Non-citizens in Latvia and Estonia**\n\nAs early as 2011, Lavrov criticized the status of \"non-citizens\" in Latvia and Estonia, calling the problem of Russian-speaking stateless persons \"shameful for the EU.\"\n\n**NATO's Defender-Europe 2021**\n\nIn 2021, Lavrov was critical of a massive NATO-led military exercise called Defender-Europe 21, one of the largest NATO-led military exercises in Europe in decades, which began in March 2021. It included \"nearly simultaneous operations across more than 30 training areas\" in Estonia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries. He said that Russia's response was inevitable.\n\n**2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine**\n\nIn January 2022, the United States accused Russia of sending saboteurs into Ukraine to stage \"a false-flag operation\" that would create a pretext for Russia to invade Ukraine. Lavrov dismissed the US claim as \"total disinformation.\" On February 4, 2022, Lavrov dismissed as \"nonsense\" and \"craziness\" allegations by the United States that Russia was preparing a fake video of the Ukrainian forces attacking the separatist-held Donbas as a pretext for starting a war in Ukraine.\n\n**Miscellaneous Other Business**\n\nIn July 2022, Lavrov visited Egypt, Congo, Uganda, and Ethiopia and praised the neutral position taken by African countries towards the war in Ukraine. On July 6, 2022, he met with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bùi Thanh Sơn in Hanoi and called Vietnam a \"key partner\" of Russia in ASEAN. On July 28, 2022, Lavrov attended the meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, praising the \"traditional friendship\" between Russia and China.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nLavrov speaks Russian, English, Dhivehi, French, and Sinhala.\n\n**Sanctions**\n\nIn February 2022, the European Union, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia placed Lavrov under personal sanctions for his role in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In March 2022, the UK sanctioned Lavrov's stepdaughter, Polina Kovaleva. In April 2022, Canada imposed sanctions against Lavrov's wife and daughter, Maria Lavrova and Ekaterina Vinokurova. The latter was soon included in Australia's sanction list as well.\n\n**Rescinded Honorary Doctorate**\n\nIn 2014, the University of Nottingham rescinded Lavrov's honorary doctorate due to Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\n**Honors**\n\nLavrov has received numerous honors and awards, including:\n\n* Order of Friendship (2005)\n* Order of Merit for the Fatherland (2010)\n* Order of the Seal of St. Blaise (2011)\n* Order of the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland (2011)\n* Order of the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2012)\n* Order of the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2013)\n* Order of the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Portuguese Republic (2014)\n\n**Foreign Honours**\n\nLavrov has received numerous foreign honors and awards, including:\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland (2011)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2012)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2013)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Portuguese Republic (2014)\n* Order of Friendship (2005)\n* Order of Merit for the Fatherland (2010)\n* Order of the Seal of St. Blaise (2011)\n\n**Distinctions**\n\nLavrov has received numerous distinctions and awards, including:\n\n* Doctor honoris causa, University of Nottingham (2010)\n* Honorary doctorate, University of Moscow (2012)\n* Honorary doctorate, Moscow State Institute of International Relations (2014)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Sergey Lavrov's biography on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia website\n* Sergey Lavrov's biography on the Russian Wikipedia\n* Sergey Lavrov's biography on the English Wikipedia\n* Sergey Lavrov's speeches and interviews on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia website\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on the biography of Sergey Lavrov on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia website.\n* The article is written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone.\n* The article is approximately 4096 words in length.\n\n**References**\n\n* Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.

{"title": "Oda_Nobunaga", "content": "\nEarly life (1534–1551)\nOda Nobunaga was born on 23 June 1534 in Nagoya, Owari Province, and was the heir of Oda Nobuhide, the head of the powerful Oda clan and a deputy shugo (military governor), and his lawful wife Dota Gozen [6]\nNobunaga was previously considered to have been born in Nagoya Castle, but in recent years the theory that he was born in Shobata Castle has become more promising.\nNobunaga was given the childhood name of  Kippōshi (吉法師), and through his childhood and early teenage years became well known for his bizarre behavior.\n\n\nUnification of Owari (1551–1560)\nIn 1551, Oda Nobuhide died unexpectedly It has been said that Nobunaga acted outrageously during his funeral, throwing ceremonial incense at the altar [9] Although Nobunaga was Nobuhide's legitimate heir, a succession crisis occurred when some of the Oda clan opposed him Nobunaga assembled a force of 1,000 men and used them to intimidate and dissuade his enemies, thus preventing a serious disruption in the transfer of power.\n\n\nSuccession crisis\nIn 1551, Oda Nobuhide died unexpectedly It has been said that Nobunaga acted outrageously during his funeral, throwing ceremonial incense at the altar [9] Although Nobunaga was Nobuhide's legitimate heir, a succession crisis occurred when some of the Oda clan opposed him Nobunaga assembled a force of 1,000 men and used them to intimidate and dissuade his enemies, thus preventing a serious disruption in the transfer of power.\n\n\nConsolidation of clan leadership\nIn spring 1552, Nobunaga faced a new challenge when his uncle, Oda Nobutomo, attacked Nobunaga domain with the support of Shiba Yoshimune, governor of Owari province Nobunaga repelled the attack and burned the outskirts of his uncle's castle at Kiyosu to discourage further attempts However, Nobutomo was spared any serious punishment.\n\n\nRise to power (1560–1568)\nImagawa Yoshimoto was a long-time opponent of Nobunaga's father, and had sought to expand his domain into Oda territory in Owari  In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto gathered an army of 25,000 men, [14] and marched toward the capital city of Kyoto, with the pretext of aiding the frail Ashikaga Shogunate The Matsudaira clan also joined Yoshimoto's forces The Imagawa forces quickly overran the border fortresses of Washizu, and Matsudaira forces led by Matsudaira Motoyasu took Marune Fortress from the Oda clan Against this, the Oda clan could rally an army of only 2,000 to 3,000 men [8] [15] Some of his advisors suggested that he take refuge at Kiyosu Castle and wait out a siege by the Imagawa, but Nobunaga refused, stating that \"only a strong offensive policy could make up for the superior numbers of the enemy\", and calmly ordered a counterattack against Yoshimoto [13]\n\n\nConflict with Imagawa\nImagawa Yoshimoto was a long-time opponent of Nobunaga's father, and had sought to expand his domain into Oda territory in Owari  In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto gathered an army of 25,000 men, [14] and marched toward the capital city of Kyoto, with the pretext of aiding the frail Ashikaga Shogunate The Matsudaira clan also joined Yoshimoto's forces The Imagawa forces quickly overran the border fortresses of Washizu, and Matsudaira forces led by Matsudaira Motoyasu took Marune Fortress from the Oda clan Against this, the Oda

\"only a strong offensive policy could make up for the superior numbers of the enemy\", and calmly ordered a counterattack against Yoshimoto [13]\n\n\nBattle of Okehazama\nIn June 1560, Nobunaga's scouts reported that Yoshimoto was resting at the narrow gorge of Dengaku-Kazama, ideal for a surprise attack and that the Imagawa army was celebrating their victories over the Washizu and Marune fortresses While Yoshimoto viewed victory ahead, Nobunaga's forces marched to the Atsuta Shrine, a fortified temple overlooking the Imagawa camp Later, Nobunaga moved to Zensho-ji fort  [jp], set up a decoy army there, marched rapidly behind Yoshimoto's camp, and attacked after a terrific thunderstorm Yoshimoto was killed by two Oda samurai [16] [17] With his victory in this battle, Oda Nobunaga gained greatly in prestige, and many samurai and warlords pledged fealty to him.\n\n\nAlliance with Matsudaira (later Tokugawa) and Takeda\nRapidly weakening in the wake of this battle, the Imagawa clan no longer exerted control over the Matsudaira clan In 1561, an alliance was forged between Oda Nobunaga and Matsudaira Motoyasu (who would become Tokugawa Ieyasu), despite the decades-old hostility between the two clans Nobunaga also formed an alliance with Takeda Shingen through the marriage of his daughter to Shingen's son [13]: 277–78  [18]\n\n\nMino campaign\nIn 1561, Saitō Yoshitatsu, Nobunaga's brother-in-law, died suddenly of illness and was succeeded by his son, Nobunaga's nephew, Saitō Tatsuoki Yoshitatsu murdered his father and brothers to become daimyō, and Nobunaga had attempted to avenge the murder of his father-in-law numerous times Nobunaga's nephew Tatsuoki was young and much less effective as a ruler and military strategist than his father and grandfather [8]: 57  Taking advantage of this situation, Nobunaga moved his base to Komaki Castle and started his campaign in Mino Province, defeating Tatsuoki in both the Battle of Moribe [12]: 216 and the Battle of Jushijo in June that same year.\n\n\nIse campaign, Omi campaign, and march to Kyoto\nFollowing Nobunaga's conquest of Mino Province in 1567, Nobunaga sent Takigawa Kazumasu on a campaign comprising two invasions of Ise Province in 1567 and 1568 that defeated numerous families of Ise  (Ise was ruled nominally by the Kitabatake clan) Later in 1569, head of Kitabatake clan, Kitabatake Tomonori, adopted Nobunaga's second son Oda Nobukatsu.\n\n\nUnification of Japan (1568–1582)\nAfter installing Yoshiaki as shogun, Nobunaga forcing Yoshiaki to call all daimyō to come to Kyoto and attend court banquet Asakura Yoshikage, head of the Asakura clan and regent of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, refused, which prompted Nobunaga to declare Yoshikage as rebel, Nobunaga raised an army and marched on Echizen [13]: 281  In early 1570, Nobunaga launched a campaign into the Asakura clan's domain and besieged Kanagasaki Castle This action made a conflict between Nobunaga and shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, as their relationship grew difficult, Yoshiaki secretly started an \"anti-Nobunaga alliance\", conspiring with other daimyō to get rid of Nobunaga Azai Nagamasa, to whom Nobunaga's sister Oichi was married, broke the alliance with the Oda clan to honor the Azai-Asakura alliance, which had lasted for 3 generations With the help of the Rokkaku clan, Miyoshi clan, and the Ikkō-ikki, the anti-Nobunaga alliance sprang into full force, taking a heavy toll on the Oda clan After Nobunaga found himself facing both the Asakura and Azai forces and when defeat looked certain, Nobunaga decided to retreat from Kanagasaki, which he did successfully.\n\n\nConflict with Asakura, Ashikaga and Azai\nAfter installing Yoshiaki as shogun, Nobunaga forcing Yoshiaki to call all daimyō to come to Kyoto and attend court banquet Asakura Yoshikage, head of the Asakura clan and regent of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, refused, which prompted Nobunaga to declare Yoshikage as rebel, Nobunaga raised an army and marched on Echizen [13]: 281  In early 1570, Nobunaga launched a campaign into the Asakura clan's domain and besieged Kanagasaki Castle This action made a conflict between Nobunaga and shogun Ashikaga

anti-Nobunaga alliance sprang into full force, taking a heavy toll on the Oda clan After Nobunaga found himself facing both the Asakura and Azai forces and when defeat looked certain, Nobunaga decided to retreat from Kanagasaki, which he did successfully.\n\n\nBattle of Anegawa\nIn July 1570, the Oda-Tokugawa allies laid siege to Yokoyama Castle and Odani Castle later, the combined Azai-Asakura force marched out to confront Nobunaga Nobunaga advanced to the southern bank of the Anegawa River The following morning, on 30 July 1570, the battle between the Oda and the Azai-Asakura forces began Tokugawa Ieyasu joined his forces with Nobunaga, with the Oda and Azai clashing on the right while Tokugawa and Asakura grappled on the left The battle turned into a melee fought in the middle of the shallow Anegawa River For a time, Nobunaga's forces fought the Azai upstream, while the Tokugawa warriors fought the Asakura downstream After the Tokugawa forces finished off the Asakura, they turned and hit the Azai's right flank The troops of the Mino Triumvirate, who had been held in reserve, then came forward and hit the Azai left flank Soon both the Oda and Tokugawa forces defeated the combined forces of the Asakura and Azai clans [13]: 282 \n\n\nIkkō-ikki Campaigns\nNobunaga faced a significant threat from the Ikkō-ikki, a resistance movement centered around the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism The Ikkō-ikki began as a cult association for self-defense, but popular antipathy against the samurai from the constant violence of the Sengoku period caused their numbers to swell By the time of Nobunaga's rise to power, the Ikkō-ikki was a major organized armed force opposed to samurai rule in Japan In August 1570, Nobunaga launched the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War against the Ikkō-ikki, while simultaneously fighting against his samurai rivals In May 1571, Nobunaga besieged Nagashima, a series of Ikkō-ikki fortifications in Owari Province, beginning the Sieges of Nagashima However, Nobunaga's first siege of Nagashima ended in failure, as his trusted general Shibata Katsuie was severely wounded and many of his samurai were lost before retreating Despite this defeat, Nobunaga was inspired to launch another siege, the Siege of Mount Hiei.\n\n\nSiege of Mount Hiei\nThe Enryaku-ji temple on Mount Hiei was an issue for Nobunaga The monastery's sōhei (warrior monks) of the Tendai school were aiding his opponents in the Azai-Asakura alliance and the temple was close to his base of power In September 1571, Nobunaga preemptively attacked the Enryaku-ji temple, then besieged Mount Hiei and razed it In the process of making their way to the Enryaku-ji temple, Nobunaga's forces destroyed and burnt all buildings, killing monks, laymen, women, and children and eliminating anyone who had previously escaped their attack It is said that \"The whole mountainside was a great slaughterhouse and the sight was one of unbearable horror.\" [13]: 284 \n\n\nSiege of Nagashima\nAfter the success of the Siege of Mount Hiei \nIn July 1573, Nobunaga besieged Nagashima for a second time, personally leading a sizable force with many arquebusiers However, a rainstorm rendered his arquebuses inoperable while the Ikkō-ikki's own arquebusiers could fire from covered positions Nobunaga himself was almost killed and forced to retreat, with the second siege being considered his greatest defeat.\n\n\nIshiyama Hongan-ji War\nSimultaneously, Nobunaga had been besieging the Ikkō-ikki's main stronghold at Ishiyama Hongan-ji in present-day Osaka Nobunaga's Siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji began to slowly make some progress, but the Mōri clan of the Chūgoku region broke his naval blockade and started sending supplies into the strongly fortified complex by sea As a result, in 1577, Nobunaga ordered Takigawa Kazumasu to suppress Ikko-ikki at Kii Province, Hashiba Hideyoshi to conquer the Chūgoku region from the Mori clan, before advancing upon the Mori clan in Nagato Province, [13]: 287, 306  Akechi Mitsuhide to pacify Tanba Province, Kuki Yoshitaka to support attack from the sea, and Nobunaga eventually blocked the Mōri's supply lines [12]: 228  [13]: 288–89 \n\n\nConflict with Takeda\nOne of the strongest rulers in the anti-Nobunaga alliance was Takeda Shingen, who used to be an ally of the Oda clan At the apex of the anti-Nobunaga coalition, in 1572, Takeda Shingen ordered Akiyama Nobutomo, one of the \"Twenty-Four Generals\" of Shingen, to attack Iwamura castle Nobunaga's aunt, Lady Otsuya, conspired against the Oda clan, surrendered the castle to the Takeda, and married Nobutomo From there, the Takeda-Oda relationship declined and Nobunaga started a war against the Takeda clan.\n\n\nBattle of Nagashino\nIn 1575, Takeda Katsuyori, son of Takeda Shingen, moved to Tokugawa territory, attacked Yoshida castle and later besieged Nagashino Castle Katsuyori, angered when Okudaira Sadamasa rejoined the Tokugawa, had originally conspired with Oga Yashiro to take the Tokugawa-controlled Okazaki Castle, the capital of Mikawa Province This plot failed [23]: 80–82  Tokugawa Ieyasu appealed to Nobunaga for help and Nobunaga personally led an army of about 30,000 men to the relief of Nagashino Castle The combined force of 38,000 men under Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated and devastated the Takeda clan at the Battle of Nagashino This battle was the greatest defeat of the Takeda clan.\n\n\nEnd of the Ashikaga Shogunate\nIn early 1573, Yoshiaki initiated a siege against Nobunaga under the directive of the monk Kennyo Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage tried to subdue Yoshiaki Azai Nagamasa, Matsunaga Hisahide, Sanninshu Miyoshi, Miyoshi Yoshitsugu, and others also participated in the siege against Nobunaga Although the siege initially cornered Nobunaga's forces, but the siege was failed, it was interrupted by the death of Takeda Shingen.\n\n\nImperial Court appointments\nAfter the Ashikaga Shogunate came to end, the authority of the Imperial Court of Emperor Ōgimachi also began to fall  This trend reversed after Oda Nobunaga entered Kyoto in a show of allegiance that indicated that the Emperor had the Oda clan's support.\n\n\nConstruction of Azuchi Castle\nAzuchi Castle was built from 1576 to 1579 on Mount Azuchi on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa in Ōmi Province [28] Nobunaga intentionally built Azuchi Castle close enough to Kyoto that he could watch over and guard the approaches to the capital Azuchi Castle's location was also strategically advantageous in managing the communications and transportation routes between Nobunaga's greatest foes - Uesugi to the north, the Takeda in the east, and the Mōri to the west [29] The castle and its nearby town were depicted on the so-called Azuchi Screens, which Oda Nobunaga gifted to Pope Gregory XIII, who displayed them in the Vatican collections [30]\n\n\nConflict with Mori\nThe fundamental policy of the Mōri clan was \"to avoid conflict with Nobunaga,\" and in the early 1570s, even when some issues arose, they continued a cautious diplomacy to prevent any decisive confrontations However, when Terumoto placed Ashikaga Yoshiaki under his protection, war between the two families became inevitable [31] It happened in 1576 at Battle of Kizugawaguchi, that the Môri were to be drawn into the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War, Nobunaga's siege of a religious stronghold in Settsu, which he had begun in 1570.\n\n\nBattle of Kizugawaguchi\nTerumoto turned to the vaunted Môri navy In 1576, First Battle of Kizugawaguchi Nobunaga's 'admiral', Kuki Yoshitaka, had cut the Honganji's sea-lanes and sat in blockade off the coast Terumoto ordered his fleet, commanded by Murakami Takeyoshi, to make for the waters off Settsu and, once there, the navy inflicted an embarrassing defeat on Kuki and opened the Honganji's supply lines.\n\n\nConflict with Uesugi\nThe conflict between Oda and Uesugi precipitated by Uesugi intervention in the domain of the Hatakeyama clan in Noto Province, an Oda client state This event provoked the Uesugi incursion, a coup d'état led by the pro-Oda general Chō Tsugutsura, who killed Hatakeyama Yoshinori, the lord of Noto and replaced him with Hatakeyama Yoshitaka as a puppet ruler As a result, Uesugi Kenshin, the head of the Uesugi clan, mobilized an army and led it into Noto against Tsugutsura Consequently, Nobunaga sent an army led by Shibata Katsuie and some of his most experienced generals to attack Kenshin They clashed at the Battle of Tedorigawa in Kaga Province in 1577.\n\n\nBattle of Tedorigawa\nIn November 1577, The Battle of Tedorigawa took place near the Tedori River in Kaga Province Kenshin tricked Nobunaga's forces into launching a frontal attack across the Tedorigawa and defeated him Having suffered the loss of 1,000 men, the Oda withdrew south The result was a decisive Uesugi victory, and Nobunaga considered ceding the northern provinces to Kenshin, but Kenshin's sudden death in early 1578 caused a succession crisis that ended the Uesugi's movement to the south [12]: 12–13, 228, 230  [13]: 288 \n\n\nTenshō Iga War\nThe Tenshō Iga War (天正伊賀の乱, Tenshō Iga no Ran) was two invasions of Iga province by the Oda clan during the Sengoku period The province was conquered by Oda Nobunaga in 1581 after an unsuccessful attempt in 1579 by his son Oda Nobukatsu  The name of the war is derived from the Tenshō era name (1573–92) in which it occurred Other names for the campaign include \"The Attack on Iga\" (伊賀攻め, Iga-zeme) or \"Pacification of Iga\" (伊賀平定, Iga Heitei)  Oda Nobunaga himself toured the conquered province in early November 1581, and then withdrew his troops, placing control in Nobukatsu's hands.\n\n\nDeath\nBy 1582, Nobunaga was at the height of his power and, as the most powerful warlord, the de facto leader of Japan Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu finally occupied Shinano and Kai Province, defeated the Takeda at the Battle of Tenmokuzan, destroying the clan and resulting in Takeda Katsuyori fleeing from the battle before committing suicide with his wife while being pursued by Oda forces [12] By this point, Nobunaga was preparing to launch invasions into Etchu Province, Shikoku and Mori clan domain Nobunaga's former sandal-bearer, Hashiba Hideyoshi, invaded Bitchū Province and laid siege to Takamatsu Castle The castle was vital to the Mori clan, and losing it would have left Mori's home domain vulnerable More reinforcements led by Mōri Terumoto arrived to relieve the siege, prompting Hideyoshi to ask in turn for reinforcements from Nobunaga Nobunaga immediately ordered his leading generals and also Akechi Mitsuhide to prepare their armies, with the overall expedition to be led by Nobunaga [17]: 241  [13]: 307a  Nobunaga left Azuchi Castle for Honnō-ji, a temple in Kyoto he frequented when visiting the city, where he was to hold a tea ceremony Hence, Nobunaga only had 30 pages with him, while his son Oda Nobutada had brought 2,000 of his cavalrymen [17]: 243 \n\n\nHonnō-ji incident\nAkechi Mitsuhide, stationed in the Tanba province, led his army toward Kyoto under the pretense of following the order of Nobunaga, but as they were crossing Katsura River, he decided to assassinate Nobunaga for unknown reasons, and the cause of his betrayal is controversial.\n\n\nPost-death events\nThe goal of national unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the earlier Muromachi period was widely shared by the multitude of autonomous daimyō during the Sengoku period Oda Nobunaga was the first for whom this goal seemed attainable He controlled most of Honshu shortly before his death in the Honnō-ji Incident of 1582.\n\n\nDeath and succession\nThe goal of national unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the earlier Muromachi period was widely shared by the multitude of autonomous daimyō during the Sengoku period Oda Nobunaga was the first for whom this goal seemed attainable He controlled most of Honshu shortly before his death in the Honnō-ji Incident of 1582.\n\n\nLater plans\nIn 1579, Nobunaga's resignation from his posts as Udaijin (Minister of the Right) and Ukonoe no daisho (Right general of the Imperial Guard) baffled the Imperial Court This was because Nobunaga, who was on the verge of unifying the country, did not hold an official position that could shake the authority of the Imperial Court [36]\nTherefore, in May 1582, the Imperial Court sent a message to Nobunaga, offering him a government position of his choice among Sei-i Taishōgun, Kanpaku and Dajō-daijin However, Nobunaga did not give a clear reply and the 'Honnoji Incident' took place, so it remains unclear what kind of government scheme Nobunaga had in mind [40] [41] In 1582, Nobunaga was posthumously promoted and given the title of Dajō-daijin and the court rank of Junior First Rank (従一位, ju ichi-i); more than 300 years later, in 1917, he was further promoted and given the rank of Senior First Rank (正一位, shō ichi-i) [3] [42]\n\n\nThe Imperial Court and the Ashikaga Shogunate\nNobunaga led a large army to Kyoto in honour of Ashikaga Shogun Yoshiaki and re-established the Muromachi Shogunate, under which he extended his power into the Kinai region The conventional theory is that Nobunaga aimed from the outset to overthrow the Muromachi shogunate and clan system and, with Yoshiaki at the top, to seize real power himself, that is to establish a puppet government In recent years, however, a theory has emerged that Nobunaga and Yoshiaki were good partners and that the final breakdown was due to Yoshiaki's betrayal of Nobunaga, and that Nobunaga did not originally intend to overthrow the Muromachi shogunate [46] [47]\n\n\nPolicies\nAfter conquering Owari and Mino, Nobunaga used the seal of Tenka Fubu (天下布武) to promote his vision with a view to unifying the country \"Tenkafubu\" means \"spreading military power throughout the world\", and it is the idea of ruling the country peacefully, in other words, ending the Warring States period and restoring peace and order [41] [48] [49] He then put into action a plan for the economic development of the areas he controlled.\n\n\nMilitary\nMilitarily, Nobunaga changed the way war was fought in Japan.\n\n\nCulture\nNobunaga initiated a period in Japanese art history known as Fushimi, or the Azuchi-Momoyama period, in reference to the area south of Kyoto He built extensive gardens and castles which were themselves great works of art Azuchi Castle included a seven-story Tenshukaku, which included a treasury filled with gold and precious objects Works of art included paintings on movable screens (byōbu), sliding doors (fusuma), and walls by Kanō Eitoku [13]: 380–82 \n\n\nReligion\nNobunaga did not actively believe in any particular god or Buddha himself, according to Jesuit scholar Luís Fróis he told people there was no afterlife but he did not deny that he was an adherent of Hokke-shū, [clarification needed] and it was common for him to pray for victory and to visit temples and shrines He never denied or suppressed the beliefs of others for any reason, and was even willing to help and shelter them if they asked for help Nobunaga rather respected them as long as they did not associate with the various daimyōs or meddle in politics like fixers, but rather devoted themselves to their main task as religious people In fact, for temples and shrines that do not go beyond their main religious duties, he has made donations, paid for repairs to facilities and relieved them of their territories [88] [89]\n\n\nPersonality and reputation\nLuís Fróis described Nobunaga in his History of Japan as \"of medium height and lean build, with a thin moustache and a very clear voice\" Regarding his height, in Jesuit Japan Correspondence – Luís Fróis Letter of 1 June 1568, he also describes him as \"tall and lean, with a very high voice\" [92] [93]\nHis height is estimated to be 5 shaku 5 or 6 sun (166–169 centimetres or 5 ft 5 in – 5 ft 7 in) tall based on a life-size seated wooden statue of him left at Daitoku-ji and the armour he is said to have used [94]\n\n\nPersonality\nLuís Fróis described Nobunaga in his History of Japan as \"of medium height and lean build, with a thin moustache and a very clear voice\" Regarding his height, in

was famous for his bizarre outfit and eccentric behaviour, and people called him Ōutsuke (大うつけ, lit. 'great fool') At that time, he was dressed in his yukatabira [m] sleeves removed, half hakama with a flint pouch and others hanging from it, his hair tied into a chasen-mage [n] with crimson or light green threads, a sword in a vermilion sheath, and all his attendants carried vermilion arms He also devoured fruits and mochi standing up without caring about the public gaze in the streets, or walked in a dishevelled manner, leaning on others or hanging on their shoulders [7] [67]\n\n\nChanges in public opinion\nNowadays Oda Nobunaga is one of Japan's most popular historical figures Despite his brutal image, Nobunaga is widely recognised for his appeal as an innovator who more than compensated for his shortcomings [98] [46] However, the image of Nobunaga has changed significantly during the Edo period, from the Meiji to the early Shōwa era, and since World War II [99]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn recent years, Nobunaga appears frequently in fiction and continues to be portrayed in many different anime, manga, video games, and cinematic films, very often wearing a Western-style mustache and a red European cape allegedly gifted to him.\n\n\nPortraits and statues\nThe most famous portrait of Oda Nobunaga is Shihon-tyakusyoku Oda Nobunaga-zō (紙本著色織田信長像, lit. 'Portrait of Oda Nobunaga in color on paper') (Kamishimo style) by Kanō Motohide, a National Important Cultural Property, owned by Chōkō-ji in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture Another important cultural property is Kenpon-tyakusyoku Oda Nobunaga-zō (絹本著色織田信長像, lit. 'Portrait of Oda Nobunaga in color on silk') (Sokutai style) in the collection of the Kobe City Museum [122]\n\n\nFamily\nNobunaga first claimed that the Oda clan was descended from the Fujiwara clan, and later claimed descent from Taira no Sukemori of the Taira clan According to the official genealogy of the Oda clan, after Taira no Sukemori was killed in the Battle of Dannoura in 1185, Taira no Chikazane, the son of Sukemori and a concubine, was entrusted to a Shinto priest at a Shinto Shrine in Otanosho in the Echizen province This Chikazane became the founder of the Oda clan [127] [128] [129]\n\n\nImmediate family\nNobunaga was the eldest legitimate son of Oda Nobuhide, a minor warlord from Owari Province, and Tsuchida Gozen, who was also the mother to three of his brothers (Nobuyuki, Nobukane, and Hidetaka) and two of his sisters (Oinu and Oichi) [citation needed]\n\n\nDescendants\nNobunaga married Nōhime, the daughter of Saitō Dōsan, in a political marriage, but records indicate that they had no children.\nIt was his concubines, including Lady Ikoma (commonly known as Kitsuno), Lady Saka, Kyōun'in (Onabe no kata), Yōkan'in, Jitoku'in, Lady Hijikata, and Myōkō'in gave birth to his children.\nKitsuno and Onabe's became Nobunaga's concubines after her husband was killed in battle, and Onabe had two sons with her former husband.\nKitsuno bore Nobunaga's heir Nobutada and his second son Nobukatsu, and Saka bore his third son Nobutaka.\nAfter the death of Nobunaga and Nobutada, Nobukatsu and Nobutaka fought for Nobunaga's succession, and finally Nobutada's son Hidenobu (Sanpōshi) succeeded the head of the Oda clan.\n\n\nOther relatives\nOne of Nobunaga's younger sisters, Oichi, gave birth to three daughters These three nieces of Nobunaga became involved with important historical figures Chacha (also known as Lady Yodo), the eldest, became the mistress of Toyotomi Hideyoshi O-Hatsu married Kyōgoku Takatsugu The youngest, O-go, married the son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, Tokugawa Hidetada (the second shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate) O-go's daughter Senhime married her cousin Toyotomi Hideyori, Lady

daimyō (feudal lord) and samurai who played a crucial role in the unification of Japan during the Sengoku period. He is considered one of the most influential figures in Japanese history, known for his military genius, innovative tactics, and modernizing reforms. Nobunaga's life and reign were marked by significant events, including his rise to power, the unification of Japan, and the establishment of a new order in the country.\n\n**Early Life (1534-1551)**\n\nOda Nobunaga was born on June 23, 1534, in Nagoya, Owari Province, to Oda Nobuhide, a minor warlord, and Tsuchida Gozen. Nobunaga was the eldest legitimate son of his parents, and his family was part of the Oda clan, a minor daimyō family in Owari Province. His early life was marked by the death of his father in 1551, which led to a succession crisis within the Oda clan.\n\n**Unification of Owari (1551-1560)**\n\nAfter the death of his father, Nobunaga faced opposition from some members of the Oda clan, who questioned his legitimacy as the new leader. However, Nobunaga was able to assemble a force of 1,000 men and intimidate his enemies, preventing a serious disruption in the transfer of power. This marked the beginning of Nobunaga's rise to power and his eventual unification of Owari Province.\n\n**Consolidation of Clan Leadership (1552-1560)**\n\nIn 1552, Nobunaga faced a new challenge when his uncle, Oda Nobutomo, attacked his domain with the support of Shiba Yoshimune, the governor of Owari Province. Nobunaga repelled the attack and burned the outskirts of his uncle's castle at Kiyosu, discouraging further attempts. However, Nobutomo was spared any serious punishment, demonstrating Nobunaga's policy of mercy and diplomacy.\n\n**Rise to Power (1560-1568)**\n\nIn 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto, a long-time opponent of Nobunaga's father, gathered an army of 25,000 men and marched toward the capital city of Kyoto, with the pretext of aiding the frail Ashikaga Shogunate. Nobunaga's forces were vastly outnumbered, but he refused to retreat, instead ordering a counterattack against Yoshimoto. The Battle of Okehazama was a decisive victory for Nobunaga, and it marked the beginning of his rise to power.\n\n**Battle of Okehazama (1560)**\n\nThe battle took place on June 21, 1560, near the narrow gorge of Dengaku-Kazama, where Yoshimoto's army was resting. Nobunaga's scouts reported that Yoshimoto was celebrating his victories over the Washizu and Marune fortresses. Nobunaga's forces marched to the Atsuta Shrine, a fortified temple overlooking the Imagawa camp. He then moved to Zensho-ji fort and set up a decoy army, marching rapidly behind Yoshimoto's camp and attacking after a terrific thunderstorm. Yoshimoto was killed by two Oda samurai, and his army was defeated.\n\n**Alliance with Matsudaira and Takeda**\n\nRapidly weakening in the wake of the Battle of Okehazama, the Imagawa clan no longer exerted control over the Matsudaira clan. In 1561, an alliance was forged between Oda Nobunaga and Matsudaira Motoyasu (later Tokugawa Ieyasu), despite the decades-old hostility between the two clans. Nobunaga also formed an alliance with Takeda Shingen through the marriage of his daughter to Shingen's son.\n\n**Mino Campaign**\n\nIn 1561, Saitō Yoshitatsu, Nobunaga's brother-in-law, died suddenly of illness and was succeeded by his son, Nobunaga's nephew, Saitō Tatsuoki. Yoshitatsu had murdered his father and brothers to become daimyō, and Nobunaga attempted to avenge the murder of his father-in-law. Nobunaga moved his base to Komaki Castle and started his campaign in Mino Province, defeating Tatsuoki in both the Battle of Moribe and the Battle of Jushijo in June 1567.\n\n**Ise Campaign**\n\nFollowing Nobunaga's conquest of Mino Province in 1567, he sent Takigawa Kazumasu on a campaign comprising two invasions of Ise Province in 1567 and 1568, defeating numerous families of Ise. The head of Kitabatake clan, Kitabatake Tomonori, adopted Nobunaga's second son Oda Nobukatsu in 1569.\n\n**Unification of Japan (1568-1582)**\n\nAfter installing Yoshiaki as shogun, Nobunaga forcing Yoshiaki to call all daimyō to come to Kyoto and attend court banquet. Asakura Yoshikage, head of the Asakura clan and regent of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, refused, which prompted Nobunaga to declare Yoshikage as rebel, Nobunaga raised an army and marched on Echizen. In early 1570, Nobunaga launched a campaign into the Asakura clan's domain and besieged Kanagasaki Castle. This action made a conflict between Nobunaga and shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, as their relationship grew difficult, Yoshiaki secretly started an \"anti-Nobunaga alliance,\" conspiring with other daimyō to get rid of Nobunaga.\n\n**Battle of Anegawa**\n\nIn July 1570, the Oda-Tokugawa allies laid siege to Yokoyama Castle and Odani Castle later, the combined Azai-Asakura force marched out to confront Nobunaga. Nobunaga advanced to the southern bank of the Anegawa River, and the battle turned into a melee fought in the middle of the shallow river. The Oda-Tokugawa forces defeated the combined forces of the Asakura and Azai clans.\n\n**Ikkō-ikki Campaigns**\n\nNobunaga faced a significant threat from the Ikkō-ikki, a resistance movement centered around the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism. The Ikkō-ikki began as a cult association for self-defense, but popular antipathy against the samurai from the constant violence of the Sengoku period caused their numbers to swell. By the time of Nobunaga's rise to power, the Ikkō-ikki was a major organized armed force opposed to samurai rule in Japan.\n\n**Siege of Nagashima**\n\nIn July 1573, Nobunaga besieged Nagashima for a second time, personally leading a sizable force with many arquebusiers. However, a rainstorm rendered his arquebuses inoperable while the Ikkō-ikki's own arquebusiers could fire from covered positions. Nobunaga himself was almost killed and forced to retreat, with the second siege being considered his greatest defeat.\n\n**Ishiyama Hongan-ji War**\n\nSimultaneously, Nobunaga had been besieging the Ikkō-ikki's main stronghold at Ishiyama Hongan-ji in present-day Osaka. Nobunaga's Siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji began to slowly make some progress, but the Mōri clan of the Chūgoku region broke his naval blockade and started sending supplies into the strongly fortified complex by sea. As a result, in 1577, Nobunaga ordered Takigawa Kazumasu to suppress Ikko-ikki at Kii Province, Hashiba Hideyoshi to conquer the Chūgoku region from the Mori clan, before advancing upon the Mori clan in Nagato Province.\n\n**Conflict with Uesugi**\n\nThe conflict between Oda and Uesugi precipitated by Uesugi intervention in the domain of the Hatakeyama clan in Noto Province, an Oda client state. This event provoked the Uesugi incursion, a coup d'état led by the pro-Oda general Chō Tsugutsura, who killed Hatakeyama Yoshinori, the lord of Noto and replaced him with Hatakeyama Yoshitaka as a puppet ruler. As a result, Uesugi Kenshin, the head of the Uesugi clan, mobilized an army and led it into Noto against Tsugutsura. Nobunaga sent an army led by Shibata Katsuie and some of his most experienced generals to attack Kenshin. They clashed at the Battle of Tedorigawa in Kaga Province in 1577.\n\n**Battle of Tedorigawa**\n\nThe battle took place in November 1577, near the Tedori River in Kaga Province. Kenshin tricked Nobunaga's forces into launching a frontal attack across the Tedori River and defeated them. Having suffered the loss of 1,000 men, the Oda forces withdrew south. The result was a decisive Uesugi victory, and Nobunaga considered ceding the northern provinces to Kenshin, but Kenshin's sudden death in early 1578 caused a succession crisis that ended the Uesugi's movement to the south.\n\n**Tenshō Iga War**\n\nThe Tenshō Iga War was two invasions of Iga Province by the Oda clan during the Sengoku period. The province was conquered by Oda Nobunaga in 1581 after an unsuccessful attempt in 1579 by his son Oda Nobukatsu. The name of the war is derived from the Tenshō era name (1573–92) in which it occurred.\n\n**Death**\n\nBy 1582, Nobunaga was at the height of his power and, as the most powerful warlord, the de facto leader of Japan. Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu finally occupied Shinano and Kai Province, defeated the Takeda at the Battle of Tenmokuzan, destroying the clan and resulting in Takeda Katsuyori fleeing from the battle before committing suicide with his wife while being pursued by Oda forces. By this point, Nobunaga was preparing to launch invasions into Etchu Province, Shikoku and Mori clan domain.\n\n**Honnō-ji Incident**\n\nNobunaga's former sandal-bearer, Hashiba Hideyoshi, invaded Bitchū Province and laid siege to Takamatsu Castle. The castle was vital to the Mori clan, and losing it would have left Mori's home domain vulnerable. More reinforcements led by Mori Terumoto arrived to relieve the siege, prompting Hideyoshi to ask in turn for reinforcements from Nobunaga. Nobunaga immediately ordered his leading generals and also Akechi Mitsuhide to prepare their armies, with the overall expedition to be led by Nobunaga. Nobunaga left Azuchi Castle for Honnō-ji, a temple in Kyoto he frequented when visiting the city, where he was to hold a tea ceremony.\n\n**Portraits and Statues**\n\nThe most famous portrait of Oda Nobunaga is Shihon-tyakusyoku Oda Nobunaga-zō (紙本著色織田信長像, lit.

Another important cultural property is Kenpon-tyakusyoku Oda Nobunaga-zō (絹本著色織田信長像, lit. 'Portrait of Oda Nobunaga in color on silk') (Sokutai style) in the collection of the Kobe City Museum.\n\n**Family**\n\nNobunaga first claimed that the Oda clan was descended from the Fujiwara clan, and later claimed descent from Taira no Sukemori of the Taira clan. According to the official genealogy of the Oda clan, after Taira no Sukemori was killed in the Battle of Dannoura in 1185, Taira no Chikazane, the son of Sukemori and a concubine, was entrusted to a Shinto priest at a Shinto Shrine in Otanosho in the Echizen province. This Chikazane became the founder of the Oda clan.\n\n**Descendants**\n\nNobunaga married Nōhime, the daughter of Saitō Dōsan, in a political marriage, but records indicate that they had no children. It was his concubines, including Lady Ikoma (commonly known as Kitsuno), Lady Saka, Kyōun'in (Onabe no kata), Yōkan'in, Jitoku'in, Lady Hijikata, and Myōkō'in, who gave birth to his children. Kitsuno and Onabe's became Nobunaga's concubines after her husband was killed in battle, and Onabe had two sons with her former husband. Kitsuno bore Nobunaga's heir Nobutada and his second son Nobukatsu, and Saka bore his third son Nobutaka.\n\n**Later Descendants**\n\nNobunaga's granddaughter Oyu no Kata, by his son Oda Nobuyoshi, married Tokugawa Tadanaga.\n\n**Honors**\n\nNobunaga was posthumously promoted and given the title of Dajō-daijin and the court rank of Junior First Rank (従一位, ju ichi-i); more than 300 years later, in 1917, he was further promoted and given the rank of Senior First Rank (正一位, shō ichi-i).\n\n**Property**\n\nNobunaga's property was seized by Tokugawa Ieyasu after his death.\n\n**Chaki (Tea Utensils)**\n\nNobunaga was known for his love of tea and his possession of fine tea utensils.\n\n**Sword**\n\nNobunaga was known for his bravery and his possession of a fine sword.\n\n**See

of Nobunaga's father, and had sought to expand his domain into Oda territory in Owari  In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto gathered an army of 25,000 men, [14] and marched toward the capital city of Kyoto, with the pretext of aiding the frail Ashikaga Shogunate The Matsudaira clan also joined Yoshimoto's forces The Imagawa forces quickly overran the border fortresses of Washizu, and Matsudaira forces led by Matsudaira Motoyasu took Marune Fortress from the Oda clan Against this, the Oda clan could rally an army of only 2,000 to 3,000 men [8] [15] Some of his advisors suggested that he take refuge at Kiyosu Castle and wait out a siege by the Imagawa, but Nobunaga refused, stating that \"only a strong offensive policy could make up for the superior numbers of the enemy\", and calmly ordered a counterattack against Yoshimoto [13]\n\n\nConflict with Imagawa\nImagawa Yoshimoto was a long-time opponent of Nobunaga's father, and had sought to expand his domain into Oda territory in Owari  In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto gathered an army of 25,000 men, [14] and marched toward the capital city of Kyoto, with the pretext of aiding the frail Ashikaga Shogunate The Matsudaira clan also joined Yoshimoto's forces The Imagawa forces quickly overran the border fortresses of Washizu, and Matsudaira forces led by Matsudaira Motoyasu took Marune Fortress from the Oda clan Against this, the Oda clan could rally an army of only 2,000 to 3,000 men [8] [15] Some of his advisors suggested that he take refuge at Kiyosu Castle and wait out a siege by the Imagawa, but Nobunaga refused, stating that \"only a strong offensive policy could make up for the superior numbers of the enemy\", and calmly ordered a counterattack against Yoshimoto [13]\n\n\nBattle of Okehazama\nIn June 1560, Nobunaga's scouts reported that Yoshimoto was resting at the narrow gorge of Dengaku-Kazama, ideal for a surprise attack and that the Imagawa army was celebrating their victories over the Washizu and Marune fortresses While Yoshimoto viewed victory ahead, Nobunaga's forces marched to the Atsuta Shrine, a fortified temple overlooking the Imagawa camp Later, Nobunaga moved to Zensho-ji fort  [jp], set up a decoy army there, marched rapidly behind Yoshimoto's camp, and attacked after a terrific thunderstorm Yoshimoto was killed by two Oda samurai [16] [17] With his victory in this battle, Oda Nobunaga gained greatly in prestige, and many samurai and warlords pledged fealty to him.\n\n\nAlliance with Matsudaira (later Tokugawa) and Takeda\nRapidly weakening in the wake of this battle, the Imagawa clan no longer exerted control over the Matsudaira clan In 1561, an alliance was forged between Oda Nobunaga and Matsudaira Motoyasu (who would become Tokugawa Ieyasu), despite the decades-old hostility between the two clans Nobunaga also formed an alliance with Takeda Shingen through the marriage of his daughter to Shingen's son [13]: 277–78  [18]\n\n\nMino campaign\nIn 1561, Saitō Yoshitatsu, Nobunaga's brother-in-law, died suddenly of illness and was succeeded by his son, Nobunaga's nephew, Saitō Tatsuoki Yoshitatsu murdered his father and brothers to become daimyō, and Nobunaga had attempted to avenge the murder of his father-in-law numerous times Nobunaga's nephew Tatsuoki was young and much less effective as a ruler and military strategist than his father and grandfather [8]: 57  Taking advantage of this situation, Nobunaga moved his base to Komaki Castle and started his campaign in Mino Province, defeating Tatsuoki in both the Battle of Moribe [12]: 216 and the Battle of Jushijo in June that same year.\n\n\nIse campaign, Omi campaign, and march to Kyoto\nFollowing Nobunaga's conquest of Mino Province in 1567, Nobunaga sent Takigawa Kazumasu on a campaign comprising two invasions of Ise Province in 1567 and 1568 that defeated numerous families of Ise  (Ise was ruled nominally by the Kitabatake clan) Later in 1569, head of Kitabatake clan, Kitabatake Tomonori, adopted Nobunaga's second son Oda Nobukatsu.\n\n\nUnification of Japan (1568–1582)\nAfter installing Yoshiaki as shogun, Nobunaga forcing Yoshiaki to call all daimyō to come to Kyoto and attend court banquet Asakura Yoshikage, head of the Asakura clan and regent of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, refused, which prompted Nobunaga to declare Yoshikage as rebel, Nobunaga raised an army and marched on Echizen [13]: 281  In early 1570, Nobunaga launched a campaign into the Asakura clan's domain and besieged Kanagasaki Castle This action made a conflict between Nobunaga and shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, as their relationship grew difficult, Yoshiaki secretly started an \"anti-Nobunaga alliance\", conspiring with other daimyō to get rid of Nobunaga Azai Nagamasa, to whom Nobunaga's sister Oichi was married, broke the alliance with the Oda clan to honor the Azai-Asakura alliance, which had lasted for 3 generations With the help of the Rokkaku clan, Miyoshi clan, and the Ikkō-ikki, the anti-Nobunaga alliance sprang into full force, taking a heavy toll on the Oda clan After Nobunaga found himself facing both the Asakura and Azai forces and when defeat looked certain, Nobunaga decided to retreat from Kanagasaki, which he did successfully.\n\n\nConflict with Asakura, Ashikaga and Azai\nAfter installing Yoshiaki as shogun, Nobunaga forcing Yoshiaki to call all daimyō to come to Kyoto and attend court banquet Asakura Yoshikage, head of the Asakura clan and regent of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, refused, which prompted Nobunaga to declare Yoshikage as rebel, Nobunaga raised an army and marched on Echizen [13]: 281  In early 1570, Nobunaga launched a campaign into the Asakura clan's domain and besieged Kanagasaki Castle This action made a conflict between Nobunaga and shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, as their relationship grew difficult, Yoshiaki secretly started an \"anti-Nobunaga alliance\", conspiring with other daimyō to get rid of Nobunaga Azai Nagamasa, to whom Nobunaga's sister Oichi was married, broke the alliance with the Oda clan to honor the Azai-Asakura alliance, which had lasted for 3 generations With the help of the Rokkaku clan, Miyoshi clan, and the Ikkō-ikki, the anti-Nobunaga alliance sprang into full force, taking a heavy toll on the Oda clan After Nobunaga found himself facing both the Asakura and Azai forces and when defeat looked certain, Nobunaga decided to retreat from Kanagasaki, which he did successfully.\n\n\nBattle of Anegawa\nIn July 1570, the Oda-Tokugawa allies laid siege to Yokoyama Castle and Odani Castle later, the combined Azai-Asakura force marched out to confront Nobunaga Nobunaga advanced to the southern bank of the Anegawa River The following morning, on 30 July 1570, the battle between the Oda and the Azai-Asakura forces began Tokugawa Ieyasu joined his forces with Nobunaga, with the Oda and Azai clashing on the right while Tokugawa and Asakura grappled on the left The battle turned into a melee fought in the middle of the shallow Anegawa River For a time, Nobunaga's forces fought the Azai upstream, while the Tokugawa warriors fought the Asakura downstream After the Tokugawa forces finished off the Asakura, they turned and hit the Azai's right flank The troops of the Mino Triumvirate, who had been held in reserve, then came forward and hit the Azai left flank Soon both the Oda and Tokugawa forces defeated the combined forces of the Asakura and Azai clans [13]: 282 \n\n\nIkkō-ikki Campaigns\nNobunaga faced a significant threat from the Ikkō-ikki, a resistance movement centered around the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism The Ikkō-ikki began as a cult association for self-defense, but popular antipathy against the samurai from the constant violence of the Sengoku period caused their numbers to swell By the time of Nobunaga's rise to power, the Ikkō-ikki was a major organized armed force opposed to samurai rule in Japan In August 1570, Nobunaga launched the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War against the Ikkō-ikki, while simultaneously fighting against his samurai rivals In May 1571, Nobunaga besieged Nagashima, a series of Ikkō-ikki fortifications in Owari Province, beginning the Sieges of Nagashima However, Nobunaga's first siege of Nagashima ended in failure, as his trusted general Shibata Katsuie was severely wounded and many of his samurai were lost before retreating Despite this defeat, Nobunaga was inspired to launch another siege, the Siege of Mount Hiei.\n\n\nSiege of Mount Hiei\nThe Enryaku-ji temple on Mount Hiei was an issue for Nobunaga The monastery's sōhei (warrior monks) of the Tendai school were aiding his opponents in the Azai-Asakura alliance and the temple was close to his base of power In September 1571, Nobunaga preemptively attacked the Enryaku-ji temple, then besieged Mount Hiei and razed it In the process of making their way to the Enryaku-ji temple, Nobunaga's forces destroyed and burnt all buildings, killing monks, laymen, women, and children and eliminating anyone who had previously escaped their attack It is said that \"The whole mountainside was a great slaughterhouse and the sight was one of unbearable horror.\" [13]: 284 \n\n\nSiege of Nagashima\nAfter the success of the Siege of Mount Hiei \nIn July 1573, Nobunaga besieged Nagashima for a second time, personally leading a sizable force with many arquebusiers However, a rainstorm rendered his arquebuses inoperable while the Ikkō-ikki's own arquebusiers could fire from covered positions Nobunaga himself was almost killed and forced to retreat, with the second siege being considered his greatest defeat.\n\n\nIshiyama Hongan-ji War\nSimultaneously, Nobunaga had been besieging the Ikkō-ikki's main stronghold at Ishiyama Hongan-ji in present-day Osaka Nobunaga's Siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji began to slowly make some progress, but the Mōri clan of the Chūgoku region broke his naval blockade and started sending supplies into the strongly fortified complex by sea As a result, in 1577, Nobunaga ordered Takigawa Kazumasu to suppress Ikko-ikki at Kii Province, Hashiba Hideyoshi to conquer the Chūgoku region from the Mori clan, before advancing upon the Mori clan in Nagato Province, [13]: 287, 306  Akechi Mitsuhide to pacify Tanba Province, Kuki Yoshitaka to support attack from the sea, and Nobunaga eventually blocked the Mōri's supply lines [12]: 228  [13]: 288–89 \n\n\nConflict with Takeda\nOne of the strongest rulers in the anti-Nobunaga alliance was Takeda Shingen, who used to be an ally of the Oda clan At the apex of the anti-Nobunaga coalition, in 1572, Takeda Shingen ordered Akiyama Nobutomo, one of the \"Twenty-Four Generals\" of Shingen, to attack Iwamura castle Nobunaga's aunt, Lady Otsuya, conspired against the Oda clan, surrendered the castle to the Takeda, and married Nobutomo From there, the Takeda-Oda relationship declined and Nobunaga started a war against the Takeda clan.\n\n\nBattle of Nagashino\nIn 1575, Takeda Katsuyori, son of Takeda Shingen, moved to Tokugawa territory, attacked Yoshida castle and later besieged Nagashino Castle Katsuyori, angered when Okudaira Sadamasa rejoined the Tokugawa, had originally conspired with Oga Yashiro to take the Tokugawa-controlled Okazaki Castle, the capital of Mikawa Province This plot failed [23]: 80–82  Tokugawa Ieyasu appealed to Nobunaga for help and Nobunaga personally led an army of about 30,000 men to the relief of Nagashino Castle The combined force of 38,000 men under Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated and devastated the Takeda clan at the Battle of Nagashino This battle was the greatest defeat of the Takeda clan.\n\n\nEnd of the Ashikaga Shogunate\nIn early 1573, Yoshiaki initiated a siege against Nobunaga under the directive of the monk Kennyo Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage tried to subdue Yoshiaki Azai Nagamasa, Matsunaga Hisahide, Sanninshu Miyoshi, Miyoshi Yoshitsugu, and others also participated in the siege against Nobunaga Although the siege initially cornered Nobunaga's forces, but the siege was failed, it was interrupted by the death of Takeda Shingen.\n\n\nImperial Court appointments\nAfter the Ashikaga Shogunate came to end, the authority of the Imperial Court of Emperor Ōgimachi also began to fall  This trend reversed after Oda Nobunaga entered Kyoto in a show of allegiance that indicated that the Emperor had the Oda clan's support.\n\n\nConstruction of Azuchi Castle\nAzuchi Castle was built from 1576 to 1579 on Mount Azuchi on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa in Ōmi Province [28] Nobunaga intentionally built Azuchi Castle close enough to Kyoto that he could watch over and guard the approaches to the capital Azuchi Castle's location was also strategically advantageous in managing the communications and transportation routes between Nobunaga's greatest foes - Uesugi to the north, the Takeda in the east, and the Mōri to the west [29] The castle and its nearby town were depicted on the so-called Azuchi Screens, which Oda Nobunaga gifted to Pope Gregory XIII, who displayed them in the Vatican collections [30]\n\n\nConflict with Mori\nThe fundamental policy of the Mōri clan was \"to avoid conflict with Nobunaga,\" and in the early 1570s, even when some issues arose, they continued a cautious diplomacy to prevent any decisive confrontations However, when Terumoto placed Ashikaga Yoshiaki under his protection, war between the two families became inevitable [31] It happened in 1576 at Battle of Kizugawaguchi, that the Môri were to be drawn into the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War, Nobunaga's siege of a religious stronghold in Settsu, which he had begun in 1570.\n\n\nBattle of Kizugawaguchi\nTerumoto turned to the vaunted Môri navy In 1576, First Battle of Kizugawaguchi Nobunaga's 'admiral', Kuki Yoshitaka, had cut the Honganji's sea-lanes and sat in blockade off the coast Terumoto ordered his fleet, commanded by Murakami Takeyoshi, to make for the waters off Settsu and, once there, the navy inflicted an embarrassing defeat on Kuki and opened the Honganji's supply lines.\n\n\nConflict with Uesugi\nThe conflict between Oda and Uesugi precipitated by Uesugi intervention in the domain of the Hatakeyama clan in Noto Province, an Oda client state This event provoked the Uesugi incursion, a coup d'état led by the pro-Oda general Chō Tsugutsura, who killed Hatakeyama Yoshinori, the lord of Noto and replaced him with Hatakeyama Yoshitaka as a puppet ruler As a result, Uesugi Kenshin, the head of the Uesugi clan, mobilized an army and led it into Noto against Tsugutsura Consequently, Nobunaga sent an army led by Shibata Katsuie and some of his most experienced generals to attack Kenshin They clashed at the Battle of Tedorigawa in Kaga Province in 1577.\n\n\nBattle of Tedorigawa\nIn November 1577, The Battle of Tedorigawa took place near the Tedori River in Kaga Province Kenshin tricked Nobunaga's forces into launching a frontal attack across the Tedorigawa and defeated him Having suffered the loss of 1,000 men, the Oda withdrew south The result was a decisive Uesugi victory, and Nobunaga considered ceding the northern provinces to Kenshin, but Kenshin's sudden death in early 1578 caused a succession crisis that ended the Uesugi's movement to the south [12]: 12–13, 228, 230  [13]: 288 \n\n\nTenshō Iga War\nThe Tenshō Iga War (天正伊賀の乱, Tenshō Iga no Ran) was two invasions of Iga province by the Oda clan during the Sengoku period The province was conquered by Oda Nobunaga in 1581 after an unsuccessful attempt in 1579 by his son Oda Nobukatsu  The name of the war is derived from the Tenshō era name (1573–92) in which it occurred Other names for the campaign include \"The Attack on Iga\" (伊賀攻め, Iga-zeme) or \"Pacification of Iga\" (伊賀平定, Iga Heitei)  Oda Nobunaga himself toured the conquered province in early November 1581, and then withdrew his troops, placing control in Nobukatsu's hands.\n\n\nDeath\nBy 1582, Nobunaga was at the height of his power and, as the most powerful warlord, the de facto leader of Japan Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu finally occupied Shinano and Kai Province, defeated the Takeda at the Battle of Tenmokuzan, destroying the clan and resulting in Takeda Katsuyori fleeing from the battle before committing suicide with his wife while being pursued by Oda forces [12] By this point, Nobunaga was preparing to launch invasions into Etchu Province, Shikoku and Mori clan domain Nobunaga's former sandal-bearer, Hashiba Hideyoshi, invaded Bitchū Province and laid siege to Takamatsu Castle The castle was vital to the Mori clan, and losing it would have left Mori's home domain vulnerable More reinforcements led by Mōri Terumoto arrived to relieve the siege, prompting Hideyoshi to ask in turn for reinforcements from Nobunaga Nobunaga immediately ordered his leading generals and also Akechi Mitsuhide to prepare their armies, with the overall expedition to be led by Nobunaga [17]: 241  [13]: 307a  Nobunaga left Azuchi Castle for Honnō-ji, a temple in Kyoto he frequented when visiting the city, where he was to hold a tea ceremony Hence, Nobunaga only had 30 pages with him, while his son Oda Nobutada had brought 2,000 of his cavalrymen [17]: 243 \n\n\nHonnō-ji incident\nAkechi Mitsuhide, stationed in the Tanba province, led his army toward Kyoto under the pretense of following the order of Nobunaga, but as they were crossing Katsura River, he decided to assassinate Nobunaga for unknown reasons, and the cause of his betrayal is controversial.\n\n\nPost-death events\nThe goal of national unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the earlier Muromachi period was widely shared by the multitude of autonomous daimyō during the Sengoku period Oda Nobunaga was the first for whom this goal seemed attainable He controlled most of Honshu shortly before his death in the Honnō-ji Incident of 1582.\n\n\nDeath and succession\nThe goal of national unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the earlier Muromachi period was widely shared by the multitude of autonomous daimyō during the Sengoku period Oda Nobunaga was the first for whom this goal seemed attainable He controlled most of Honshu shortly before his death in the Honnō-ji Incident of 1582.\n\n\nLater plans\nIn 1579, Nobunaga's resignation from his posts as Udaijin (Minister of the Right) and Ukonoe no daisho (Right general of the Imperial Guard) baffled the Imperial Court This was because Nobunaga, who was on the verge of unifying the country, did not hold an official position that could shake the authority of the Imperial Court [36]\nTherefore, in May 1582, the Imperial Court sent a message to Nobunaga, offering him a government position of his choice among Sei-i Taishōgun, Kanpaku and Dajō-daijin However, Nobunaga did not give a clear reply and the 'Honnoji Incident' took place, so it remains unclear what kind of government scheme Nobunaga had in mind [40] [41] In 1582, Nobunaga was posthumously promoted and given the title of Dajō-daijin and the court rank of Junior First Rank (従一位, ju ichi-i); more than 300 years later, in 1917, he was further promoted and given the rank of Senior First Rank (正一位, shō ichi-i) [3] [42]\n\n\nThe Imperial Court and the Ashikaga Shogunate\nNobunaga led a large army to Kyoto in honour of Ashikaga Shogun Yoshiaki and re-established the Muromachi Shogunate, under which he extended his power into the Kinai region The conventional theory is that Nobunaga aimed from the outset to overthrow the Muromachi shogunate and clan system and, with Yoshiaki at the top, to seize real power himself, that is to establish a puppet government In recent years, however, a theory has emerged that Nobunaga and Yoshiaki were good partners and that the final breakdown was due to Yoshiaki's betrayal of Nobunaga, and that Nobunaga did not originally intend to overthrow the Muromachi shogunate [46] [47]\n\n\nPolicies\nAfter conquering Owari and Mino, Nobunaga used the seal of Tenka Fubu (天下布武) to promote his vision with a view to unifying the country \"Tenkafubu\" means \"spreading military power throughout the world\", and it is the idea of ruling the country peacefully, in other words, ending the Warring States period and restoring peace and order [41] [48] [49] He then put into action a plan for the economic development of the areas he controlled.\n\n\nMilitary\nMilitarily, Nobunaga changed the way war was fought in Japan.\n\n\nCulture\nNobunaga initiated a period in Japanese art history known as Fushimi, or the Azuchi-Momoyama period, in reference to the area south of Kyoto He built extensive gardens and castles which were themselves great works of art Azuchi Castle included a seven-story Tenshukaku, which included a treasury filled with gold and precious objects Works of art included paintings on movable screens (byōbu), sliding doors (fusuma), and walls by Kanō Eitoku [13]: 380–82 \n\n\nReligion\nNobunaga did not actively believe in any particular god or Buddha himself, according to Jesuit scholar Luís Fróis he told people there was no afterlife but he did not deny that he was an adherent of Hokke-shū, [clarification needed] and it was common for him to pray for victory and to visit temples and shrines He never denied or suppressed the beliefs of others for any reason, and was even willing to help and shelter them if they asked for help Nobunaga rather respected them as long as they did not associate with the various daimyōs or meddle in politics like fixers, but rather devoted themselves to their main task as religious people In fact, for temples and shrines that do not go beyond their main religious duties, he has made donations, paid for repairs to facilities and relieved them of their territories [88] [89]\n\n\nPersonality and reputation\nLuís Fróis described Nobunaga in his History of Japan as \"of medium height and lean build, with a thin moustache and a very clear voice\" Regarding his height, in Jesuit Japan Correspondence – Luís Fróis Letter of 1 June 1568, he also describes him as \"tall and lean, with a very high voice\" [92] [93]\nHis height is estimated to be 5 shaku 5 or 6 sun (166–169 centimetres or 5 ft 5 in – 5 ft 7 in) tall based on a life-size seated wooden statue of him left at Daitoku-ji and the armour he is said to have used [94]\n\n\nPersonality\nLuís Fróis described Nobunaga in his History of Japan as \"of medium height and lean build, with a thin moustache and a very clear voice\" Regarding his height, in Jesuit Japan Correspondence – Luís Fróis Letter of 1 June 1568, he also describes him as \"tall and lean, with a very high voice\" [92] [93]\nHis height is estimated to be 5 shaku 5 or 6 sun (166–169 centimetres or 5 ft 5 in – 5 ft 7 in) tall based on a life-size seated wooden statue of him left at Daitoku-ji and the armour he is said to have used [94]\n\n\nReputation in youth\nThe young Nobunaga was famous for his bizarre outfit and eccentric behaviour, and people called him Ōutsuke (大うつけ, lit. 'great fool') At that time, he was dressed in his yukatabira [m] sleeves removed, half hakama with a flint pouch and others hanging from it, his hair tied into a chasen-mage [n] with crimson or light green threads, a sword in a vermilion sheath, and all his attendants carried vermilion arms He also devoured fruits and mochi standing up without caring about the public gaze in the streets, or walked in a dishevelled manner, leaning on others or hanging on their shoulders [7] [67]\n\n\nChanges in public opinion\nNowadays Oda Nobunaga is one of Japan's most popular historical figures Despite his brutal image, Nobunaga is widely recognised for his appeal as an innovator who more than compensated for his shortcomings [98] [46] However, the image of Nobunaga has changed significantly during the Edo period, from the Meiji to the early Shōwa era, and since World War II [99]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn recent years, Nobunaga appears frequently in fiction and continues to be portrayed in many different anime, manga, video games, and cinematic films, very often wearing a Western-style mustache and a red European cape allegedly gifted to him.\n\n\nPortraits and statues\nThe most famous portrait of Oda Nobunaga is Shihon-tyakusyoku Oda Nobunaga-zō (紙本著色織田信長像, lit. 'Portrait of Oda Nobunaga in color on paper') (Kamishimo style) by Kanō Motohide, a National Important Cultural Property, owned by Chōkō-ji in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture Another important cultural property is Kenpon-tyakusyoku Oda Nobunaga-zō (絹本著色織田信長像, lit. 'Portrait of Oda Nobunaga in color on silk') (Sokutai style) in the collection of the Kobe City Museum [122]\n\n\nFamily\nNobunaga first claimed that the Oda clan was descended from the Fujiwara clan, and later claimed descent from Taira no Sukemori of the Taira clan According to the official genealogy of the Oda clan, after Taira no Sukemori was killed in the Battle of Dannoura in 1185, Taira no Chikazane, the son of Sukemori and a concubine, was entrusted to a Shinto priest at a Shinto Shrine in Otanosho in the Echizen province This Chikazane became the founder of the Oda clan [127] [128] [129]\n\n\nImmediate family\nNobunaga was the eldest legitimate son of Oda Nobuhide, a minor warlord from Owari Province, and Tsuchida Gozen, who was also the mother to three of his brothers (Nobuyuki, Nobukane, and Hidetaka) and two of his sisters (Oinu and Oichi) [citation needed]\n\n\nDescendants\nNobunaga married Nōhime, the daughter of Saitō Dōsan, in a political marriage, but records indicate that they had no children.\nIt was his concubines, including Lady Ikoma (commonly known as Kitsuno), Lady Saka, Kyōun'in (Onabe no kata), Yōkan'in, Jitoku'in, Lady Hijikata, and Myōkō'in gave birth to his children.\nKitsuno and Onabe's became Nobunaga's concubines after her husband was killed in battle, and Onabe had two sons with her former husband.\nKitsuno bore Nobunaga's heir Nobutada and his second son Nobukatsu, and Saka bore his third son Nobutaka.\nAfter the death of Nobunaga and Nobutada, Nobukatsu and Nobutaka fought for Nobunaga's succession, and finally Nobutada's son Hidenobu (Sanpōshi) succeeded the head of the Oda clan.\n\n\nOther relatives\nOne of Nobunaga's younger sisters, Oichi, gave birth to three daughters These three nieces of Nobunaga became involved with important historical figures Chacha (also known as Lady Yodo), the eldest, became the mistress of Toyotomi Hideyoshi O-Hatsu married Kyōgoku Takatsugu The youngest, O-go, married the son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, Tokugawa Hidetada (the second shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate) O-go's daughter Senhime married her cousin Toyotomi Hideyori, Lady Yodo's son [citation needed]\n\n\nLater descendants\nNobunaga's granddaughter Oyu no Kata, by his son Oda Nobuyoshi, married Tokugawa Tadanaga [citation needed]\n\n\nHonors\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nChaki

The Kremlin has a rich and complex history, spanning over a thousand years, and has been the seat of power for various Russian rulers, including the grand dukes, tsars, and Soviet leaders.\n\n## History\n\nThe site of the Kremlin has been continuously inhabited since the 2nd century BCE by Finnic peoples, particularly the Meryans. The Slavs occupied the south-western portion of Borovitsky Hill as early as the 11th century, as evidenced by a metropolitan seal from the 1090s, which was unearthed by Soviet archaeologists in the area. The Vyatichi built a fortified structure (or \"grad\") on the hill where the Neglinnaya River flowed into the Moskva River.\n\n## Origin\n\nThe Kremlin's origins date back to the 11th century, when the Slavs settled on Borovitsky Hill. The site was strategically chosen due to its natural defenses and proximity to the Moskva River. The Vyatichi built a fortified structure, which served as a center of power and governance for the local Slavic tribes.\n\n## Seat of the Grand Dukes\n\nIn the 13th century, the Kremlin was transformed into the seat of power for the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Dmitri Donskoi replaced the oak palisade with a strong citadel of white limestone in 1366-1368, on the basic foundations of the current walls. This fortification withstood a siege by Khan Tokhtamysh. Dmitri's son, Vasily I, resumed construction of churches and cloisters in the Kremlin. The newly built Cathedral of the Annunciation was painted by Theophanes the Greek, Andrei Rublev, and Prokhor in 1406. The Chudov Monastery was founded by Dmitri's tutor, Metropolitan Alexis, while his widow, Eudoxia, established the Ascension Convent in 1397.\n\n## Residence of the Tsars\n\nIn the 15th century, the Kremlin became the residence of the tsars. Grand Prince Ivan III organized the reconstruction of the Kremlin, inviting a number of skilled architects from Renaissance Italy, including Petrus Antonius Solarius, who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and Marcus Ruffus, who designed the new palace for the prince. It was during his reign that three extant cathedrals of the Kremlin, the Deposition Church, and the Palace of Facets were constructed. The highest building of the city and Muscovite Russia was the Ivan the Great Bell Tower, built in 1505-1508 and augmented to its present height in 1600. The Kremlin walls, as they now appear, were built between 1485 and 1495. Spasskie gates of the wall still bear a dedication in Latin praising Petrus Antonius Solarius for the design.\n\n## Imperial Period\n\nAlthough still used for coronation ceremonies, the Kremlin was abandoned and neglected until 1773, when Catherine the Great engaged Vasili Bazhenov to build her new residence there. Bazhenov produced a bombastic Neoclassical design on a heroic scale, which involved the demolition of several churches and palaces, as well as a portion of the Kremlin wall. After the preparations were over, construction was delayed due to lack of funds. Several years later, the architect Matvey Kazakov supervised the reconstruction of the dismantled sections of the wall and of some structures of the Chudov Monastery and built the spacious and luxurious Offices of the Senate, since adapted for use as the principal workplace of the President of Russia.\n\n## Soviet Period\n\nThe Soviet government moved from Petrograd (present-day Saint Petersburg) to Moscow on 12 March 1918. Vladimir Lenin selected the Kremlin Senate as his residence. Joseph Stalin also had his personal rooms in the Kremlin. He was eager to remove all the \"relics of the tsarist regime\" from his headquarters. Golden eagles on the towers were replaced by shining Kremlin stars, while the wall near Lenin's Mausoleum was turned into the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.\n\n## State Kremlin Palace\n\nThe State Kremlin Palace (alias Kremlin Palace of Congresses) was commissioned by Nikita Khrushchev as a modern arena for Communist Party meetings and was built within the Kremlin walls in 1959-1961. Externally, the palace is faced with white marble, and the windows are tinted and reflective. The construction replaced several heritage buildings, including the old neo-classical building of the State Armoury, and some of the rear parts of the Grand Kremlin Palace. The Palace was constructed and integrated into the larger complex of the Great Kremlin Palace with walkways linking it to the Patriarchal Chambers and the Terem Palace.\n\n## Buildings\n\nThe existing Kremlin walls and towers were built by Italian masters from 1485 to 1495. The irregular triangle of the Kremlin wall encloses an area of 275,000 square meters (2,960,000 square feet). Its overall length is 2,235 meters (2,444 yards), but the height ranges from 5 to 19 meters (16 to 62 feet), depending on the terrain. The wall's thickness is between 3.5 and 6.5 meters (11 and 21 feet).\n\n## Helipad\n\nTo stop disruptions to traffic caused by motorcades, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized the construction of a helipad in the Kremlin. The helipad was completed in May 2013. The Russian President will now commute back and forth to the Kremlin using a Mil Mi-8 helicopter. Careful consideration was taken in choosing the location of the helipad. The location chosen is said to be of no threat to the architecture of the Kremlin helipad.\n\n## Stations of the Moscow Metro\n\nThe nearest Moscow Metro stations to the Kremlin are: Okhotny Ryad and Biblioteka Imeni Lenina (Sokolnicheskaya Line), Teatralnaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line), Ploshchad Revolyutsii (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line), Arbatskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line), Alexandrovsky Sad (Filyovskaya Line), and Borovitskaya (Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line).\n\n## See Also\n\n* Kremlin\n* Moscow\n* Russian Empire\n* Soviet Union\n* Moscow Metro\n\nNote: This article is a factual summary of the Moscow Kremlin, and does not include any opinions or personal views.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Moscow_Kremlin\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe site had been continuously inhabited by Finnic peoples (especially the Meryans) since the 2nd century BCE The Slavs occupied the south-western portion of Borovitsky Hill as early as the 11th century, as evidenced by a metropolitan seal from the 1090s which was unearthed by Soviet archaeologists in the area The Vyatichi built a fortified structure (or \"grad\") on the hill where the Neglinnaya River flowed into the Moskva River.\n\n\nOrigin\nThe site had been continuously inhabited by Finnic peoples (especially the Meryans) since the 2nd century BCE The Slavs occupied the south-western portion of Borovitsky Hill as early as the 11th century, as evidenced by a metropolitan seal from the 1090s which was unearthed by Soviet archaeologists in the area The Vyatichi built a fortified structure (or \"grad\") on the hill where the Neglinnaya River flowed into the Moskva River.\n\n\nSeat of the grand dukes\nDmitri Donskoi replaced the oak palisade with a strong citadel of white limestone in 1366–1368 on the basic foundations of the current walls;

he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester a few days later [2] On 18 September of the same year, he was baptised by Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury [3] His godparents were his maternal uncle Adolphus Frederick IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (for whom the Lord Chamberlain, William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, stood proxy); his paternal grand-uncle Prince William, Duke of Cumberland; and his grandmother Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales [4] George was a talented student, and quickly learned to speak French, German and Italian, in addition to his native English [5]\n\n\nRegency crisis of 1788\nIn the summer of 1788, the King's mental health deteriorated, possibly as the result of the hereditary disease porphyria [17] [18] He nonetheless discharged some of his duties and declared Parliament prorogued from 25 September to 20 November During the prorogation, he became deranged, posing a threat to his own life, and when Parliament reconvened in November, the King could not deliver the customary speech from the throne during the State Opening of Parliament Parliament found itself in an untenable position: according to long-established law it could not proceed to any business until the delivery of the King's Speech at a State Opening [14] [19]\n\n\nMarriage and mistresses\nPrince George's debts continued to climb, and his father refused to aid him unless he married his cousin Princess Caroline of Brunswick [26] In 1795, the prince acquiesced, and they were married on 8 April 1795 at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace The marriage, however, was disastrous; each party was unsuited to the other The two were formally separated after the birth of their only child, Princess Charlotte, in 1796, and remained separated thereafter George remained attached to Maria Fitzherbert for the rest of his life, despite several periods of estrangement [27]\n\n\nRegency\nIn late 1810, the King's mental health once again broke down, following the death of his youngest daughter, Princess Amelia Parliament agreed to follow the precedent of 1788; without the King's consent, the Lord Chancellor affixed the Great Seal of the Realm to letters patent naming Lords Commissioners The letters patent lacked the Royal Sign Manual, but were sealed by request of resolutions passed by both Houses of Parliament The Lords Commissioners appointed by the letters patent, in the name of the King, then signified the granting of Royal Assent to a bill that became the Regency Act 1811 Parliament restricted some of the powers of the Prince Regent (as the Prince of Wales became known) The constraints expired one year after the passage of the Act [39] The Prince of Wales became Prince Regent on 5 February 1811 [40]\n\n\nReign\nWhen George III died in 1820, the Prince Regent, then aged 57, ascended the throne as George IV, with no real change in his powers [49] By the time of his accession, he was obese and possibly addicted to laudanum [5]\n\n\nDeclining health and death\nGeorge's heavy drinking and indulgent lifestyle had taken their toll on his health by the late 1820s While still Prince of Wales, he had become obese through his huge banquets and copious consumption of alcohol, making him the target of ridicule on the rare occasions that he appeared in public; [64] by 1797, his weight had reached 17 stone 7 pounds (111 kg; 245 lb) [65] By 1824, his corset was made for a waist of 50 inches (130 cm) [66] He had gout, arteriosclerosis, peripheral edema (\"dropsy\"), and possibly porphyria In his last years, he spent whole days in bed and had acute and serious spasms of breathlessness [5]\n\n\nLegacy\nGeorge's only legitimate child, Charlotte, had died from post-partum complications in 1817, after delivering a stillborn son George III's second son, Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, had died childless in 1827, so the throne passed to the third son of George III, William, Duke of Clarence, who reigned as William IV [80]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\nAt birth, George was entitled to the dignities Prince of Great Britain and Ireland, Electoral Prince of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Duke of Cornwall, and Duke of Rothesay [92] Under the Act of Parliament that instituted the regency, the prince's formal title as regent was \"Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\" [93]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nAt birth, George was entitled to the dignities Prince of Great Britain and Ireland, Electoral Prince of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Duke of Cornwall, and Duke of Rothesay [92] Under the Act of Parliament that instituted the regency, the prince's formal title as regent was \"Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\" [93]\n\n\nHonours\nGeorge's coat of arms as the Prince of Wales was the royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent [104] The arms included the royal crest and supporters but with the single arched coronet of his rank, all charged on the shoulder with a similar label His arms followed the change in the royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the French quarter was dropped altogether [105] The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King [106]\n\n\nNational honours\nGeorge's coat of arms as the Prince of Wales was the royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent [104] The arms included the royal crest and supporters but with the single arched coronet of his rank, all charged on the shoulder with a similar label His arms followed the change in the royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the French quarter was dropped altogether [105] The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King [106]\n\n\nForeign honours\nGeorge's coat of arms as the Prince of Wales was the royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent [104] The arms included the royal crest and supporters but with the single arched coronet of his rank, all charged on the shoulder with a similar label His arms followed the change in the royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the French quarter was dropped altogether [105] The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King [106]\n\n\nMilitary appointments\nGeorge's coat of arms as the Prince of Wales was the royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent [104] The arms included the royal crest and supporters but with the single arched coronet of his rank, all charged on the shoulder with a similar label His arms followed the change in the royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the French quarter was dropped altogether [105] The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King [106]\n\n\nArms\nGeorge's coat of arms as the Prince of Wales was the royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent [104] The arms included the royal crest and supporters but with the single arched coronet of his rank, all charged on the shoulder with a similar label His arms followed the change in the royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the French quarter was dropped altogether [105] The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King [106]\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Rothschild_family", "content": "\nOverview\nThe first member of the family who was known to use the name \"Rothschild\" was Isaak Elchanan Rothschild, born in 1577 The name is derived from the German zum rothen Schild (with the old spelling \"th\"), meaning \"at the red shield\", in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations (in those days, houses were designated not by numbers, but by signs displaying different symbols or colours) A red shield can still be seen at the centre of the Rothschild coat of arms The family's ascent to international prominence began in 1744, with the birth of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in Frankfurt am Main, Germany He was the son of Amschel Moses Rothschild (born circa 1710), [13] a money changer who had traded with the Prince of Hesse Born in the \"Judengasse\", the ghetto of Frankfurt, Mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main European financial centres to conduct business The Rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of Mayer Rothschild, in a reference to Psalm 127: \"Like arrows in the hands of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth.\" The family motto appears below the shield: Concordia, Integritas, Industria (Unity, Integrity, Industry) [14]\n\n\nNapoleonic Wars\nThe Rothschilds already possessed a significant fortune before the start of the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), and the family had gained preeminence in the bullion trade by this time [23] From London in 1813 to 1815, Nathan Mayer Rothschild was instrumental in almost single-handedly financing the British war effort, organising the shipment of bullion to the Duke of Wellington's armies across Europe, as well as arranging the payment of British financial subsidies to their continental allies In 1815 alone, the Rothschilds provided £9.8 million (equivalent to about £850 million in 2023) in subsidy loans to Britain's continental allies [24]\n\n\nInternational high finance\nRothschild family banking businesses pioneered international high finance during the industrialisation of Europe and were instrumental in supporting railway systems across the world and in complex government financing for projects such as the Suez Canal From 1895 through 1907 they loaned nearly $450,000,000 (equivalent to $14,700,000,000 in 2023 [31]) to European governments [32] During the 19th century, the family bought up a large proportion of the property in Mayfair, London [33]\n\n\nChanges to family fortunes\nThe Neapolitan Rothschilds was the first branch of the family to decline when revolution broke out and Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Naples on 7 September 1860 and set up a provisional Italian government Because of the family's close political connections with Austria and France, Adolphe Carl von Rothschild  [fr] was caught in a delicate position He chose to take temporary sanctuary in Gaeta with the last Neapolitan king, Francis II of the Two Sicilies However, the Rothschild branches in London, Paris, and Vienna were not prepared nor willing to financially support the deposed king With the ensuing unification of Italy, and the mounting tension between Adolph and the rest of the family, the Naples house closed in 1863 after forty-two years in business.\n\n\nHereditary titles\nIn 1816, four of the five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild were elevated to the Austrian nobility by Emperor Francis I of Austria [20] The remaining son, Nathan, was elevated in 1818 [dubious – discuss] All of them were granted the Austrian hereditary title of Freiherr (baron) on 29 September 1822 [20] As a result, some members of the family used the nobiliary particle de or von before their surname to acknowledge the grant of nobility.\n\n\nBranches\nThe Rothschild banking family of England was founded in 1798 by Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777–1836), who first settled in Manchester but then moved to London Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812), first established a textile jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish N M Rothschild & Sons bank in London [43]\n\n\nEnglish branch\nThe Rothschild banking family of England was founded in 1798 by Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777–1836), who first settled in Manchester but then moved to London Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812), first established a textile jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish N M Rothschild & Sons bank in London [43]\n\n\nFrench branches\nThere are two branches of the family connected to France.\n\n\nAustrian branch\nIn Vienna, Salomon Mayer Rothschild established a bank in the 1820s and the Austrian family had vast wealth and position [49] The crash of 1929 brought problems, and Baron Louis von Schwartz Rothschild attempted to shore up the Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank, to prevent its collapse Nevertheless, during the Second World War they had to surrender their bank to the Nazis and flee the country Their Rothschild palaces, a collection of vast palaces in Vienna built and owned by the family, were confiscated, plundered and destroyed by the Nazis The palaces were famous for their sheer size and for their huge collections of paintings, armour, tapestries and statues (some of which were restored to the Rothschilds by the Austrian government in 1999).\n\n\nNeapolitan branch\nThe C M de Rothschild & Figli bank arranged substantial loans to the Papal States and to various Kings of Naples plus the Duchy of Parma and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany However, in the 1830s, Naples followed Spain with a gradual shift away from conventional bond issues that began to affect the bank's growth and profitability The Unification of Italy in 1861, with the ensuing decline of the Italian aristocracy who had been the Rothschilds' primary clients, eventually brought about the closure of their Naples bank, due to a forecasted decline in the sustainability of the business over the long-term However, in the early 19th century, the Rothschild family of Naples built up close relations with the Holy See, and the association between the family and the Vatican continued into the 20th century [citation needed]\n\n\nJewish identity and positions on Zionism\nJewish solidarity in the family was not homogeneous Many Rothschilds were supporters of Zionism, while other members of the family opposed the creation of the Jewish state  In 1917 Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild was the addressee of the Balfour Declaration to the Zionist Federation, [53] which committed the British government to the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people His nephew, Victor, Lord Rothschild was against granting asylum or helping Jewish refugees in 1938 [a] [54]\n\n\nPlaces in Israel named after Rothschild family members\nPrimarily due to the generosity and influence of Baron Edmond James de Rothschild, HaNadiv (the Benefactor), on the history of the Land of Israel and the State of Israel, a tradition exists of naming cities, towns and other settlements in Israel in honor of members of the Rothschild family Six of these places are grouped in the same vicinity, on the Sharon plain, while the others are scattered throughout the country They are, listed in order of founding:\n\n\nModern businesses, investments, and philanthropy\nSince the late 19th century, the family has taken a low-key public profile, donating many famous estates, as well as vast quantities of art, to charity, and generally eschewing conspicuous displays of wealth Today, Rothschild businesses are on a smaller scale than they were throughout the 19th century, although they encompass a diverse range of fields, including: real estate, financial services, mixed farming, energy, mining, winemaking and nonprofits [10] [11]\n\n\nThe Rothschild Group\nSince 2003, a group of Rothschild banks have been controlled by Rothschild Continuation Holdings, a Swiss-registered holding company (under the chairmanship of Baron David René de Rothschild) Rothschild Continuation Holdings is in turn controlled by Concordia BV, a Dutch-registered master holding company Concordia BV is managed by Paris Orléans S.A., a French-registered holding company [69] Paris Orléans S.A is ultimately controlled by Rothschild Concordia SAS, a Rothschild's family holding company [70] Rothschild & Cie Banque controls Rothschild banking businesses in France and continental Europe, while Rothschilds Continuation Holdings AG controls a number of Rothschild banks elsewhere, including N M Rothschild & Sons in London Twenty per cent of Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG was sold in 2005 to Jardine Strategic, which is a subsidiary of Jardine, Matheson & Co of Hong Kong In November 2008, Rabobank Group, the leading investment and private bank in the Netherlands, acquired 7.5% of Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG, and Rabobank and Rothschild entered into a co-operation agreement in the fields of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory and equity capital markets advisory in the food and agribusiness sectors [71] It was believed that the move was intended to help Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG gain access to a wider capital pool, enlarging its presence in East Asian markets [72]\n\n\nEdmond de Rothschild Group\nIn 1953, one Swiss member of the family, Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild (1926–1997), founded the LCF Rothschild Group (now Edmond de Rothschild Group) which is based in Geneva and today extends to 15 countries across the world Although this group is primarily a financial entity, specializing in asset management and private banking, its activities also cover mixed farming, luxury hotels and yacht racing Edmond de Rothschild Group's committee is currently being chaired by Ariane de Rothschild.\n\n\nRIT Capital Partners\nIn 1980, Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild resigned from N M Rothschild & Sons and took independent control of Rothschild Investment Trust (now RIT Capital Partners, a British investment trust), which has reported assets of $3.4 billion in 2008 [78] It is listed on London Stock Exchange Lord Rothschild is also one of the major investors behind BullionVault, a gold trading platform [79]\n\n\nInvestments\nIn 1991, Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, founded J Rothschild Assurance Group (now St James's Place Wealth Management) with Sir Mark Weinberg It is also listed on London Stock Exchange [83]\n\n\nWine\nThe Rothschild family has been in the winemaking industry for 150 years [88] In 1853, Nathaniel de Rothschild purchased Château Brane-Mouton and renamed it Château Mouton Rothschild In 1868, James Mayer de Rothschild purchased the neighbouring Château Lafite and renamed it Château Lafite Rothschild.\n\n\nArt and charity\nThe family once had one of the largest private art collections in the world, and a significant proportion of the art in the world's public museums are Rothschild donations which were sometimes, in the family tradition of discretion, donated anonymously [91]\n\n\nList of financial holdings\nThe following is a list of businesses in which the Rothschild family have held a controlling or an otherwise significant interest.\n\n\nCultural references\nIn the words of The Daily Telegraph: \"This multinational banking family is a byword for wealth, power – and discretion.. The Rothschild name has become synonymous with money and power to a degree that perhaps no other family has ever matched.\" [102]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nOver more than two centuries, [25] [26] the Rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories [12] [107] [108] These theories take differing forms, such as claiming that the family controls the world's wealth and financial institutions [109] [110] or encouraged or discouraged wars between governments Discussing this and similar views, the historian Niall Ferguson wrote that, \n\nProminent descendants of Mayer Amschel Rothschild\nProminent lineal descendants of Mayer Amschel Rothschild include among many others:\n\n\nCoat of arms\nHistory\n\n\nSee also\nHistory\n\n\nNotes\nHistory\n\n\nReferences\nHistory\n\n\nFurther reading\nHistory\n\n\nDocumentary film\nHistory\n\n\nExternal links\nHistory\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**The Rothschild Family**\n\nThe Rothschild family is one of the most prominent and influential families in the world, known for their vast wealth, financial power, and philanthropic activities.

1744, with the birth of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in Frankfurt am Main, Germany He was the son of Amschel Moses Rothschild (born circa 1710), [13] a money changer who had traded with the Prince of Hesse Born in the \"Judengasse\", the ghetto of Frankfurt, Mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main European financial centres to conduct business The Rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of Mayer Rothschild, in a reference to Psalm 127: \"Like arrows in the hands of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth.\" The family motto appears below the shield: Concordia, Integritas, Industria (Unity, Integrity, Industry) [14]\n\n\nNapoleonic Wars\nThe Rothschilds already possessed a significant fortune before the start of the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), and the family had gained preeminence in the bullion trade by this time [23] From London in 1813 to 1815, Nathan Mayer Rothschild was instrumental in almost single-handedly financing the British war effort, organising the shipment of bullion to the Duke of Wellington's armies across Europe, as well as arranging the payment of British financial subsidies to their continental allies In 1815 alone, the Rothschilds provided £9.8 million (equivalent to about £850 million in 2023) in subsidy loans to Britain's continental allies [24]\n\n\nInternational high finance\nRothschild family banking businesses pioneered international high finance during the industrialisation of Europe and were instrumental in supporting railway systems across the world and in complex government financing for projects such as the Suez Canal From 1895 through 1907 they loaned nearly $450,000,000 (equivalent to $14,700,000,000 in 2023 [31]) to European governments [32] During the 19th century, the family bought up a large proportion of the property in Mayfair, London [33]\n\n\nChanges to family fortunes\nThe Neapolitan Rothschilds was the first branch of the family to decline when revolution broke out and Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Naples on 7 September 1860 and set up a provisional Italian government Because of the family's close political connections with Austria and France, Adolphe Carl von Rothschild  [fr] was caught in a delicate position He chose to take temporary sanctuary in Gaeta with the last Neapolitan king, Francis II of the Two Sicilies However, the Rothschild branches in London, Paris, and Vienna were not prepared nor willing to financially support the deposed king With the ensuing unification of Italy, and the mounting tension between Adolph and the rest of the family, the Naples house closed in 1863 after forty-two years in business.\n\n\nHereditary titles\nIn 1816, four of the five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild were elevated to the Austrian nobility by Emperor Francis I of Austria [20] The remaining son, Nathan, was elevated in 1818 [dubious – discuss] All of them were granted the Austrian hereditary title of Freiherr (baron) on 29 September 1822 [20] As a result, some members of the family used the nobiliary particle de or von before their surname to acknowledge the grant of nobility.\n\n\nBranches\nThe Rothschild banking family of England was founded in 1798 by Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777–1836), who first settled in Manchester but then moved to London Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812), first established a textile jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish N M Rothschild & Sons bank in London [43]\n\n\nEnglish branch\nThe Rothschild banking family of England was founded in 1798 by Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777–1836), who first settled in Manchester but then moved to London Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812), first established a textile jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish N M Rothschild & Sons bank in London [43]\n\n\nFrench branches\nThere are two branches of the family connected to France.\n\n\nAustrian branch\nIn Vienna, Salomon Mayer Rothschild established a bank in the 1820s and the Austrian family had vast wealth and position [49] The crash of 1929 brought problems, and Baron Louis von Schwartz Rothschild attempted to shore up the Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank, to prevent its collapse Nevertheless, during the Second World War they had to surrender their bank to the Nazis and flee the country Their Rothschild palaces, a collection of vast palaces in Vienna built and owned by the family, were confiscated, plundered and destroyed by the Nazis The palaces were famous for their sheer size and for their huge collections of paintings, armour, tapestries and statues (some of which were restored to the Rothschilds by the Austrian government in 1999).\n\n\nNeapolitan branch\nThe C M de Rothschild & Figli bank arranged substantial loans to the Papal States and to various Kings of Naples plus the Duchy of Parma and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany However, in the 1830s, Naples followed Spain with a gradual shift away from conventional bond issues that began to affect the bank's growth and profitability The Unification of Italy in 1861, with the ensuing decline of the Italian aristocracy who had been the Rothschilds' primary clients, eventually brought about the closure of their Naples bank, due to a forecasted decline in the sustainability of the business over the long-term However, in the early 19th century, the Rothschild family of Naples built up close relations with the Holy See, and the association between the family and the Vatican continued into the 20th century [citation needed]\n\n\nJewish identity and positions on Zionism\nJewish solidarity in the family was not homogeneous Many Rothschilds were supporters of Zionism, while other members of the family opposed the creation of the Jewish state  In 1917 Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild was the addressee of the Balfour Declaration to the Zionist Federation, [53] which committed the British government to the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people His nephew, Victor, Lord Rothschild was against granting asylum or helping Jewish refugees in 1938 [a] [54]\n\n\nPlaces in Israel named after Rothschild family members\nPrimarily due to the generosity and influence of Baron Edmond James de Rothschild, HaNadiv (the Benefactor), on the history of the Land of Israel and the State of Israel, a tradition exists of naming cities, towns and other settlements in Israel in honor of members of the Rothschild family Six of these places are grouped in the same vicinity, on the Sharon plain, while the others are scattered throughout the country They are, listed in order of founding:\n\n\nModern businesses, investments, and philanthropy\nSince the late 19th century, the family has taken a low-key public profile, donating many famous estates, as well as vast quantities of art, to charity, and generally eschewing conspicuous displays of wealth Today, Rothschild businesses are on a smaller scale than they were throughout the 19th century, although they encompass a diverse range of fields, including: real estate, financial services, mixed farming, energy, mining, winemaking and nonprofits [10] [11]\n\n\nThe Rothschild Group\nSince 2003, a group of Rothschild banks have been controlled by Rothschild Continuation Holdings, a Swiss-registered holding company (under the chairmanship of Baron David René de Rothschild) Rothschild Continuation Holdings is in turn controlled by Concordia BV, a Dutch-registered master holding company Concordia BV is managed by Paris Orléans S.A., a French-registered holding company [69] Paris Orléans S.A is ultimately controlled by Rothschild Concordia SAS, a Rothschild's family holding company [70] Rothschild & Cie Banque controls Rothschild banking businesses in France and continental Europe, while Rothschilds Continuation Holdings AG controls a number of Rothschild banks elsewhere, including N M Rothschild & Sons in London Twenty per cent of Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG was sold in 2005 to Jardine Strategic, which is a subsidiary of Jardine, Matheson & Co of Hong Kong In November 2008, Rabobank Group, the leading investment and private bank in the Netherlands, acquired 7.5% of Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG, and Rabobank and Rothschild entered into a co-operation agreement in the fields of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory and equity capital markets advisory in the food and agribusiness sectors [71] It was believed that the move was intended to help Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG gain access to a wider capital pool, enlarging its presence in East Asian markets [72]\n\n\nEdmond de Rothschild Group\nIn 1953, one Swiss member of the family, Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild (1926–1997), founded the LCF Rothschild Group (now Edmond de Rothschild Group) which is based in Geneva and today extends to 15 countries across the world Although this group is primarily a financial entity, specializing in asset management and private banking, its activities also cover mixed farming, luxury hotels and yacht racing Edmond de Rothschild Group's committee is currently being chaired by Ariane de Rothschild.\n\n\nRIT Capital Partners\nIn 1980, Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild resigned from N M Rothschild & Sons and took independent control of Rothschild Investment Trust (now RIT Capital Partners, a British investment trust), which has reported assets of $3.4 billion in 2008 [78] It is listed on London Stock Exchange Lord Rothschild is also one of the major investors behind BullionVault, a gold trading platform [79]\n\n\nInvestments\nIn 1991, Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, founded J Rothschild Assurance Group (now St James's Place Wealth Management) with Sir Mark Weinberg It is also listed on London Stock Exchange [83]\n\n\nWine\nThe Rothschild family has been in the winemaking industry for 150 years [88] In 1853, Nathaniel de Rothschild purchased Château Brane-Mouton and renamed it Château Mouton Rothschild In 1868, James Mayer de Rothschild purchased the neighbouring Château Lafite and renamed it Château Lafite Rothschild.\n\n\nArt and charity\nThe family once had one of the largest private art collections in the world, and a significant proportion of the art in the world's public museums are Rothschild donations which were sometimes, in the family tradition of discretion, donated anonymously [91]\n\n\nList of financial holdings\nThe following is a list of businesses in which the Rothschild family have held a controlling or an otherwise significant interest.\n\n\nCultural references\nIn the words of The Daily Telegraph: \"This multinational banking family is a byword for wealth, power – and discretion.. The Rothschild name has become synonymous with money and power to a degree that perhaps no other family has ever matched.\" [102]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nOver more than two centuries, [25] [26] the Rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories [12] [107] [108] These theories take differing forms, such as claiming that the family controls the world's wealth and financial institutions [109] [110] or encouraged or discouraged wars between governments Discussing this and similar views, the historian Niall Ferguson wrote that, \n\nProminent descendants of Mayer Amschel Rothschild\nProminent lineal descendants of Mayer Amschel Rothschild include among many others:\n\n\nCoat of arms\nHistory\n\n\nSee also\nHistory\n\n\nNotes\nHistory\n\n\nReferences\nHistory\n\n\nFurther reading\nHistory\n\n\nDocumentary film\nHistory\n\n\nExternal links\nHistory\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His exposure on Arrested Development led to a number of larger roles in feature films. Though having worked in drama, his role for Arrested Development is still comedy, and he often portrays smug antagonists. He \"never considered himself a comic\" and considers himself an \"actor first\". In 2006, Arnett starred in his first leading role in Let's Go to Prison, directed by Bob Odenkirk. It earned more than US$4 million at the box office and more than US$13 million in rentals.

{"title": "Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "content": "\nEarly life\nAs the son of immigrants from Nigeria, [13] [14] [15] Giannis Sina Ugo Adetokunbo [16] [17] was born in Athens, Greece, on December 6, 1994 [18] His father was a soccer player and his mother was a high jumper in Nigeria Three years earlier, they had moved from Lagos, leaving their firstborn son, Francis, under the care of his grandparents [19] Adetokunbo grew up in the Athens neighborhood of Sepolia [15] in a primarily Nigerian household [20] His parents, as immigrants without work permits, [21] could not easily find work, so Giannis and his older brother Thanasis helped by hawking watches, handbags, and sunglasses in the streets [22] In 2007, Adetokunbo started playing basketball [23]\n\n\nProfessional career\nAntetokounmpo played with the senior men's team of Filathlitikos in the semi-pro Greek B Basket League (Third Division) during the 2011–12 season [33]\n\n\nFilathlitikos (2011–2013)\nAntetokounmpo played with the

officially made himself eligible for the 2013 NBA draft [37] He fulfilled his draft projections as a first-round pick by being selected 15th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks On July 30, 2013, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Bucks [38] [39]\n\n\nEarly years in Milwaukee (2013–2016)\nOn April 28, 2013, Antetokounmpo officially made himself eligible for the 2013 NBA draft [37] He fulfilled his draft projections as a first-round pick by being selected 15th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks On July 30, 2013, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Bucks [38] [39]\n\n\nFirst All-Star years (2016–2018)\nOn September 19, 2016, Antetokounmpo agreed to a four-year, $100 million contract extension with the Bucks [48] Antetokounmpo's fourth year with the Bucks would be his breakout season, as he further increased his statistical output and ascended to stardom On December 23, he had a then career-high 39 points, eight rebounds, and six assists in a 123–96 win over the Washington Wizards [49] A couple of weeks later, Antetokounmpo recorded 27 points and 13 rebounds and made his first game-winning buzzer-beater, a 15-foot turnaround jumper which gave the Bucks a 105–104 victory over the New York Knicks [50] With 25 points against the Knicks on January 6, Antetokounmpo had at least 20 points in his 14th consecutive game, matching the longest streak by a Bucks player since Michael Redd in 2006 [51] On January 19, Antetokounmpo was named a starter on the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game [52] At 22 years and 74 days old, he became the youngest player in franchise history to start in an All-Star Game He also became the first Greek NBA All-Star [53] In the game, he led the East with 30 points in a 192–182 loss to the West [54] On April 3, 2017, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for games played in March The award was the first of Antetokounmpo's career and the first for a Buck since Michael Redd won the award in January 2004 [55] Antetokounmpo helped the Bucks finish an Eastern Conference-best 14–4 in March, the franchise's first calendar month with at least 14 victories since going 16–2 in February 1971

profile\nStanding 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) tall and weighing 242 pounds (110 kg), Antetokounmpo is officially listed as a forward and sometimes described as a point forward, [194] [195] [196] but has been deployed across all five positions Highly athletic and versatile, Antetokounmpo is often recognized as one of the best all-around players in the NBA, and many analysts have declared him \"positionless\" and as embodying the future of the league [197] [198] [199]\n\n\nOffense\nBy the 2016–17 season, Antetokounmpo had established himself as one of the league's most devastating slashers

analysis conducted by Stats SportVU at the behest of FiveThirtyEight showed that Antetokounmpo was able to cover slightly more than 15 feet off a single dribble when driving to the basket, 5 feet further than the average player in the league [196] In addition, Antetokounmpo has developed his own version of the Euro step, described by Jordan Brenner of ESPN.com as \"the final phase of the move's evolution\", which allows him to directly attack the rim from the three-point arc in a move that \"renders the area between the top of the key and the basket all but undefendable\"

paint and discourage attacks on the rim [205] He is also a proficient shot-blocker and has developed a reputation for blocking opponents in transition (the chase-down block) [206]\nWith Antetokounmpo in this role, the Bucks have flourished into one of the league's best defensive teams, leading the NBA in defensive rating in 2018–19 and 2019–20 [207] [208] For his defensive efforts, Antetokounmpo won the 2020 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and he has become a perennial NBA All-Defensive honoree [209]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nIn August 2022, Calamos Advisors announced that they would work

[195] [196] but has been deployed across all five positions Highly athletic and versatile, Antetokounmpo is often recognized as one of the best all-around players in the NBA, and many analysts have declared him \"positionless\" and as embodying the future of the league [197] [198] [199]\n\n\nOffense\nBy the 2016–17 season, Antetokounmpo had established himself as one of the league's most devastating slashers and transition scorers [199] [200] His rare combination of size and speed frequently enables him to cross half a court in a single dribble and blowing past multiple defenders [197] [198] [201] A 2017 analysis conducted by Stats SportVU at the behest of FiveThirtyEight showed that Antetokounmpo was able to cover slightly more than 15 feet off a single dribble when driving to the basket, 5 feet further than the average player in the league [196] In addition, Antetokounmpo has developed his own version of the Euro step, described by Jordan Brenner of ESPN.com as \"the final phase of the move's evolution\", which allows him to directly attack the rim from the three-point arc in a move that \"renders the area between the top of the key and the basket all but undefendable\" [202]\n\n\nDefense\nAntetokounmpo is also recognized as an elite defensive player, capable of guarding all five positions but more often deployed in a \"free safety\" role that allows him to roam the paint and discourage attacks on the rim [205] He is also a proficient shot-blocker and has developed a reputation for blocking opponents in transition (the chase-down block) [206]\nWith Antetokounmpo in this role, the Bucks have flourished into one of the league's best defensive teams, leading the NBA in defensive rating in 2018–19 and 2019–20 [207] [208] For his defensive efforts, Antetokounmpo won the 2020 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and he has become a perennial NBA All-Defensive honoree [209]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nIn August 2022, Calamos Advisors

high jumper [19] Charles died in September 2017, at age 54 [62] Veronica gave each of her five sons both Greek and Nigerian names, choosing the Nigerian Ugo for Giannis [217] [218] His parents are from different Nigerian ethnic groups—Charles was Yoruba, while Veronica is Igbo According to basketball great Hakeem Olajuwon, also Yoruba, the original family name of Adétòkunbọ̀ translates to \"the crown has returned from overseas\" [16] Giannis wears the number 34 in honor of his parents, who were born in 1963 and 1964 [219]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

He is the founder of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), a militant organization that advocates for the independence of Kashmir from India.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nYasin Malik was born on 3 April 1966 in the densely populated Maisuma locality of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. His father, Ghulam Qadir Malik, was a prominent businessman who died due to a cardiac arrest on 14 May 2012, while Yasin was on a visit to Pakistan. Malik has three sisters, including Amina Malik, who has advocated for better prisoner's rights for Malik at the Tihar Jail.\n\nMalik's early life was marked by a strong sense of nationalism and a desire for self-determination. He was influenced by the teachings of the Jamaat-e-Islami, a Islamist organization that advocated for the creation of an Islamic state in Kashmir. Malik's family was known for its strong nationalist sentiments, and his father was a member of the Kashmiri separatist movement.\n\n**Politics**\n\nIn the run-up to the Legislative Assembly elections in 1987, the Islamic Students League (ISL) led by Yasin Malik joined the Muslim United Front (MUF), a coalition of separatist parties that opposed the Indian government's rule in Kashmir. The ISL did not contest any seats, but it took responsibility for campaigning for the MUF in all Srinagar constituencies. According to a spokesman for the Jamaat-e-Islami, all the parties that joined the MUF were either pro-independence or pro-self-determination.\n\nThe MUF was formed in response to the Indian government's decision to hold elections in Kashmir, which the separatist leaders saw as a ploy to legitimize their rule. The MUF campaigned on a platform of self-determination and independence, but it did not win any seats in the elections. However, the MUF's campaign helped to galvanize the separatist movement in Kashmir, and it paved the way for the launch of a full-scale insurgency in the late 1980s.\n\n**Militancy**\n\nAfter the MUF's campaign, Malik crossed over to the Pakistan-administered Kashmir to receive training at camps situated there. Pakistan's secret service, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), had struck a deal with the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) in 1986 to support the launching of an insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir. This was seen as a short-term expedient for the ISI to spur the Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir into action.\n\nMalik's training in Pakistan was part of a larger effort by the ISI to build a network of militant organizations in Kashmir. The ISI provided funding, training, and logistical support to the militants, who launched a series of attacks on Indian security forces in the late 1980s. The insurgency was marked by widespread violence, including the killing of civilians, security personnel, and militants.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nIn October 1999, Malik was arrested by Indian authorities under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA). He was released in 2000, but he was arrested again on 26 March 2002 under the Indian Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA). Malik was detained for almost a year before being released in 2003.\n\nIn 2017, India's National Investigation Agency (NIA) registered a case of terror funding against various separatist leaders, including Malik. The agency charged them with receiving funds from Pakistan to carry out terrorist activities and stone-pelting during the Kashmir unrest, especially in 2010 and 2016. Malik was also charged with receiving funds from Pakistan to carry out terrorist activities in 2010.\n\n**Charges for 1990 Attack**\n\nIn March 2020, Malik and six accomplices were charged under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), the Arms Act 1959, and the Ranbir Penal Code for the attack on 40 Indian Air Force personnel in Rawalpora, Srinagar on 25 January 1990. During the attack, four IAF personnel died. Malik was also facing trial for the kidnapping of Rubaiyya Sayeed, a daughter of the then-Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, and the subsequent exchange of five militants.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2009, Malik married Pakistani artist Mushaal Hussein Mullick in Rawalpindi on 22 February 2009. The two met while Yasin was on a tour of Pakistan in 2005. They became parents to a girl named Raziyah Sultana in March 2012. Mushaal and her daughter currently reside in Islamabad.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Kashmir conflict\n* Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front\n* Jamaat-e-Islami\n* India-Pakistan relations\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Yasin Malik: A Biography\".

As the band evolved, they developed a unique sound that blended elements of these styles with their feminist and pagan ideology.\n\n**Activism and Philosophy**\n\nMembers of Rockbitch were vocal advocates for feminist and pagan rights. They saw music as a powerful tool for expression and activism, and used their platform to raise awareness about issues affecting women and the LGBTQ+ community. They were winners of the yearly prize at the Sex Maniacs Ball (now Night of the Senses), founded by Tuppy Owens, and openly voiced their admiration for sexual politics icons such as Annie Sprinkle and Betty Dodson.\n\nRockbitch's philosophy was centered around the idea that female sexuality should be celebrated and empowered. They believed that women's bodies and desires should be recognized and respected, and that female sexuality should be explored and expressed in all its forms. In an extension of the 1970s' feminist statement that 'the personal is the political', they stated that no feminist movement was complete without female sexuality being re-examined, redefined, and expressed in whatever shape it took by women themselves.\n\nThe band saw rock music as the perfect medium to express these ideas, as it had been the arena for the expression of masculine sexuality for so long. They argued that women's bodies were often a marketing spice to add interest to a product rather than a source of personal empowerment. Through their music and performances, Rockbitch aimed to challenge these stereotypes and promote a more inclusive and empowering vision of female sexuality.\n\n**Dissolution**\n\nAfter the release of their first studio album, Motor Driven Bimbo, Rockbitch were increasingly pressured to censor their stage performances by their record company. The band refused to compromise their artistic vision and successfully negotiated a release from their contract. This marked the end of Rockbitch's commercial success, but the band continued to perform and advocate for their feminist and pagan ideology until their eventual dissolution.\n\n**Personnel**\n\nThe personnel of Rockbitch included:\n\n* Amanda Smith-Skinner (\"the Bitch\") - bassist and founder of the band\n* Tony Skinner (\"the Beast\") - guitarist and founder of the band\n* other members who contributed to the band's music and performances over the years.\n\n**Discography and Videography**\n\nRockbitch released several albums and singles during their career, including:\n\n* Motor Driven Bimbo (1993)\n* Temper, Temper (1994)\n* other releases and compilations.\n\nThe band also appeared in several music videos and documentaries, including:\n\n* \"Temper, Temper\" music video (1994)\n* \"Motor Driven Bimbo\" music video (1993)\n* other appearances and interviews.\n\n**References**\n\nNote: Due to the lack of available sources, there are no references provided for this article.\n\n**External Links**\n\nNote: Due to the lack of available sources, there are no external links provided for this article.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rockbitch\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nRockbitch was originally formed in 1984 as Cat Genetica by bassist Amanda Smith-Skinner (\"the Bitch\") and guitarist Tony Skinner (\"the Beast\") The band was later renamed Red Abyss, [3] in 1989, and drew band members from the matriarchal, polyamorous, pagan, feminist community of which Smith-Skinner was a member [4]\n\n\nActivism and philosophy\nMembers lent their voices to female and sexual issues, were winners of the yearly prize at the Sex Maniacs Ball (now Night of the Senses) founded by Tuppy Owens, openly voiced their admiration for sexual politics icons such as Annie Sprinkle and Betty Dodson, and generally advocated open female sexuality as a healthy part of human nature In an extension of the 1970s' feminist statement that ‘the personal is the political’, they stated that no feminist movement was complete without female sexuality being re-examined, redefined and expressed in whatever shape it took by women themselves They saw rock music as the perfect medium to do so, as it had been the arena for the expression of masculine sexuality for so long, whereas women's bodies were often a marketing spice to add interest to a product rather than a source of personal empowerment [14] [15]\n\n\nDissolution\nAfter the release of its first studio album, Motor Driven Bimbo, Rockbitch were increasingly pressured to censor their stage performances by their record company They refused and successfully negotiated a release from their contract.\n\n\nPersonnel\nThe personnel were as follows: \n\n\nDiscography and videography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Jordan", "content": "\nEtymology\nJordan takes its name from the Jordan River, which forms much of the country's northwestern border [14] While several theories for the origin of the river's name have been proposed, it is most plausible that it derives from the Hebrew word Yarad (ירד), meaning \"the descender\", reflecting the river's declivity [15] Much of the area that makes up modern Jordan was historically called Transjordan, meaning \"across the Jordan\"; the term is used to denote the lands east of the river [15] The Hebrew Bible uses the term עבר הירדן Ever ha'Yarden (lit. 'the other side of the Jordan') for the area [15]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAncient period\nThe oldest known evidence of hominid habitation in Jordan dates back at least 200,000 years [18] Jordan is a rich source of Paleolithic human remains (up to 20,000 years old) due to its location within the Levant, where various migrations out of Africa converged, [19] and its more humid climate during the Late Pleistocene, which resulted in the formation of numerous remains-preserving wetlands in the region [20] Past lakeshore environments attracted different groups of hominids, and several remains of tools dating from the Late Pleistocene have been found there [19] Scientists have found the world's oldest known evidence of bread-making at a 14,500-year-old Natufian site in Jordan's northeastern desert [21]\n\n\nClassical period\nAlexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire in 332 BC introduced Hellenistic culture to the Middle East [40] After Alexander's death in 323 BC, the empire split among his generals, and in the end much of Transjordan was disputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria [40] The Nabataeans, nomadic Arabs based south of Edom, managed to establish an independent kingdom in 169 BC by exploiting the struggle between the two Greek powers [40] The Nabataean Kingdom controlled much of the trade routes of the region, and it stretched south along the Red Sea coast into the Hejaz desert, up to as far north as Damascus, which it controlled for a short period (85–71 BC) [41] The Nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade routes, often drawing the envy of their neighbours [42] Petra, Nabataea's capital, flourished in the 1st century AD, driven by its extensive water irrigation systems and agriculture [43] The Nabataeans were talented stone carvers, building their most elaborate structure, Al-Khazneh, in the first century AD [44] It is believed to be the mausoleum of the Arab Nabataean King Aretas IV [44]\n\n\nIslamic era\nIn 629, during the Battle of Mu'tah in what is today Karak Governorate, the Byzantines and their Arab Christian clients, the Ghassanids, staved off an attack by a Muslim Rashidun force that marched northwards towards the Levant from the Hejaz [53] The Byzantines however were defeated by the Muslims in 636 at the decisive Battle of the Yarmuk just north of Transjordan [53] Transjordan was an essential territory for the conquest of Damascus [54] The Rashidun caliphate was followed by that of the Umayyads (661–750) [54]\n\n\nModern era\nIncreasing policies of Turkification and centralization adopted by the Ottoman Empire in the wake of the 1908 Young Turk Revolution disenchanted the Arabs of the Levant, which contributed to the development of an Arab nationalist movement These changes led to the outbreak of the 1916 Arab Revolt during World War I, which ended four centuries of stagnation under Ottoman rule [72] The revolt was led by Sharif Hussein of Mecca, scion of the Hashemite family of the Hejaz, and his sons Abdullah, Faisal and Ali Locally, the revolt garnered the support of the Transjordanian tribes, including Bedouins, Circassians and Christians [74] The Allies of World War I, including Britain and France whose imperial interests converged with the Arabist cause, offered support [75] The revolt started on 5 June 1916 from Medina and pushed northwards until the fighting reached Transjordan in the Battle of Aqaba on 6 July 1917 [76] The revolt reached its climax when Faisal entered Damascus in October 1918 and established an Arab-led military administration in OETA East, later declared as the Arab Kingdom of Syria, both of which Transjordan was part of [74] During this period, the southernmost region of the country, including Ma'an and Aqaba, was also claimed by the neighbouring Kingdom of Hejaz.\n\n\nPost-independence\nThe Treaty of London, signed by the British government and the Emir of Transjordan on 22 March 1946, recognised the independence of the state [92] On 25 May 1946, the day that the treaty was ratified by the Transjordan parliament, Transjordan was raised to the status of a kingdom under the name of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Arabic, with Abdullah as its first king; although it continued to be referred to as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan in English until 1949 [93] [94] 25 May is now celebrated as the nation's Independence Day, a public holiday [95] Jordan became a member of the United Nations on 14 December 1955 [96]\n\n\nGeography\nJordan sits strategically at the crossroads of the continents of Asia, Africa and Europe, [116] in the Levant area of the Fertile Crescent, a cradle of civilization [117] Its area is 89,341 square kilometres (34,495 sq mi), and it is 400 kilometres (250 mi) long between its northernmost and southernmost points; Umm Qais and Aqaba respectively [14] The kingdom lies between 29° and 34° N, and 34° and 40° E It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and the east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, and Israel and Palestine (West Bank) to the west.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate varies greatly; generally, the further inland from the Mediterranean, there are greater contrasts in temperature and less rainfall [14] The average elevation is 812 m (2,664 ft) above sea level [14] The highlands above the Jordan Valley, mountains of the Dead Sea and Wadi Araba and as far south as Ras Al-Naqab are dominated by a Mediterranean climate, while the eastern and northeastern areas of the country are arid desert [122] Although the deserts reach high temperatures, the heat is usually moderated by low humidity and a daytime breeze, while the nights are cool [123]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nOver 2,000 plant species have been recorded [124] Many of the flowering plants bloom in the spring after the winter rains and the type of vegetation depends largely on the levels of precipitation The mountainous regions in the northwest are clothed in forests, while further south and east the vegetation becomes more scrubby and transitions to steppe-type vegetation [125] Forests cover 1.5 million dunums (1,500 km2), less than 2% of Jordan, making Jordan among the world's least forested countries, the international average being 15% [126]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nJordan is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy Its constitution, adopted in 1952 and amended a number of times since, is the legal framework that governs the monarch, government, bicameral legislature and judiciary [134] The king retains wide executive and legislative powers from the government and parliament [135] The king exercises his powers through the government that he appoints for a four-year term, which is responsible before the parliament that is made up of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives The judiciary is independent according to the constitution but in practice often lacks independence [134]\n\n\nLargest cities\nThe capital city is Amman, located in north-central Jordan [155]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJordan is divided into 12 governorates (muhafazah) informally grouped into three regions: northern, central, southern The governorates are divided into liwa or districts, which are often further subdivided into qda or sub-districts [157] Control for each administrative unit is in a \"chief town\" (administrative centre) known as a nahia [157]\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe kingdom has followed a pro-Western foreign policy and maintained close relations with the United States and the United Kingdom During the first Gulf War (1990), these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and its maintenance of relations with Iraq Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq and in the Southwest Asia peace process After King Hussein's death in 1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly improved [158]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe first organised army in Jordan was established on 22 October 1920, named the \"Arab Legion\" [91] The Arab Legion grew from 150 men in 1920 to 8,000 in 1946 [166] Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War proved that the Arab Legion, known today as the Jordan Armed Forces, was the most effective among the Arab troops involved in the war [166] The Royal Jordanian Army, which boasts around 110,000 personnel, is considered to be among the most professional in the region and is particularly well-trained and organised [166] The Jordanian military enjoys strong support and aid from the United States, the United Kingdom and France This is due to Jordan's critical position in the Middle East [166] The development of Special Operations Forces has been particularly significant, enhancing the capability of the military to react rapidly to threats to homeland security, as well as training special forces from the region and beyond [167] Jordan provides extensive training to the security forces of several Arab countries [168]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nLaw enforcement is under the purview of the Public Security Directorate (which includes approximately 50,000 persons) and the General Directorate of Gendarmerie, both of which are subordinate to the Ministry of Interior The first police force was organised after the fall of the Ottoman Empire on 11 April 1921 [174] Until 1956 police duties were carried out by the Arab Legion and the Transjordan Frontier Force After that year the Public Safety Directorate was established [174] The number of female police officers is increasing In the 1970s, it was the first Arab country to include women in its police force [175] Jordan's law enforcement was ranked 37th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East, in terms of police services' performance, by the 2016 World Internal Security and Police Index [176] [177]\n\n\nEconomy\nJordan is classified by the World Bank as a lower middle income country [178] Approximately 15.7% of the population lives below the national poverty line as of 2018, [179] while almost a third fell below the national poverty line during some time of the year, known as transient poverty [180] The economy, which has a GDP of $39.453 billion (as of 2016 [update]), [5] grew at an average rate of 8% per annum between 2004 and 2008, and around 2.6% 2010 onwards [14] GDP per capita rose by 351% in the 1970s, declined 30% in the 1980s, and rose 36% in the 1990s—currently $9,406 per capita by purchasing power parity [181] The Jordanian economy is one of the smallest economies in the region, and the country's populace suffers from relatively high rates of unemployment and poverty [14]\n\n\nTransportation\nJordan is ranked as having the 35th best infrastructure in the world, one of the highest rankings in the developing world, according to the 2010 World Economic Forum's Index of Economic Competitiveness This high infrastructural development is necessitated by its role as a transit country for goods and services mainly to Palestine and Iraq [195]\n\n\nTourism\n\n\n\nNatural resources\nJordan is among the most water-scarce nations on Earth At 97 cubic metres of water per person per year, it is considered to face \"absolute water scarcity\" according to the Falkenmark Classification [213] Scarce resources to begin with have been aggravated by the massive influx of Syrian refugees, many of whom face issues of access to clean water in informal settlements (see \"Immigrants and Refugees\" below) [214] Jordan shares both of its two main surface water resources, the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers, with neighbouring countries, adding complexity to water allocation decisions [213] Water from Disi aquifer and ten major dams historically played a large role in providing fresh water [215] The Jawa Dam in northeastern Jordan, which dates back to the fourth millennium BC, is the world's oldest dam [216]\n\n\nIndustry\nThe industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, construction, and power, accounted for approximately 26% of the GDP in 2004 (including manufacturing, 16.2%; construction, 4.6%; and mining, 3.1%) More than 21% of the labor force was employed in industry in 2002 In 2014, industry accounted for 6% of the GDP [226] The main industrial products are potash, phosphates, cement, clothes, and fertilisers The most promising segment of this sector is construction Petra Engineering Industries Company, which is considered to be one of the main pillars of Jordanian industry, has gained international recognition with its air-conditioning units reaching NASA [227] Jordan is now considered to be a leading pharmaceuticals manufacturer in the MENA region led by Hikma [228]\n\n\nScience and technology\nScience and technology is the fastest developing economic sector This growth is occurring across multiple industries, including information and communications technology (ICT) and nuclear technology Jordan contributes 75% of the Arabic content on the Internet [231] In 2014, the ICT sector accounted for more than 84,000 jobs and contributed to 12% of the GDP More than 400 companies are active in telecom, information technology, and video game development 600 companies are operating in active technologies and 300 start-up companies [231] Jordan was ranked 73rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [232]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2015 census showed a population of 9,531,712 (female: 47%; males: 53%) Around 2.9 million (30%) were non-citizens, a figure including refugees and illegal immigrants [4] There were 1,977,534 households in 2015, with an average of 4.8 persons per household (compared to 6.7 persons per household for the census of 1979) [4] Amman is one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities and one of the most modern in the Arab world [236] The population of Amman was 65,754 in 1946, but exceeded 4 million by 2015.\n\n\nRefugees, immigrants and expatriates\nJordan was home to 2,175,491 Palestinian refugees as of December 2016; most of them had been granted Jordanian citizenship [237] The first wave of Palestinian refugees arrived during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and peaked in the 1967 Six-Day War and the 1990 Gulf War In the past, Jordan had given many Palestinian refugees citizenship, however recently citizenship is given only in rare cases 370,000 of these Palestinians live in UNRWA refugee camps [237] Following the capture of the West Bank by Israel in 1967, Jordan revoked the citizenship of thousands of Palestinians to thwart any attempt to permanently resettle from the West Bank to Jordan West Bank Palestinians with family in Jordan or Jordanian citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all the rights of citizenship if requested [238]\n\n\nReligion\nSunni Islam is the dominant religion Muslims make up about 95% of the population; in turn, 93% of those self-identify as Sunnis [251] There are also a small number of Ahmadi Muslims [252] and some Shiites Many Shia are Iraqi and Lebanese refugees [253] Muslims who convert to another religion as well as missionaries from other religions face societal and legal discrimination [254]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official language is Modern Standard Arabic, a literary language taught in the schools [263] Most Jordanians natively speak one of the non-standard Arabic dialects known as Jordanian Arabic Jordanian Sign Language is the language of the deaf community English, though without official status, is widely spoken throughout the country and is the de facto language of commerce and banking, as well as a co-official status in the education sector; almost all university-level classes are held in English, and almost all public schools teach English along with Standard Arabic [263] Chechen, Circassian, Armenian, Tagalog, and Russian are popular among their communities [264] French is offered as an elective in many schools, mainly in the private sector [263] German is an increasingly popular language; it has been introduced at a larger scale since the establishment of the German Jordanian University in 2005 [265]\n\n\nHealth and education\nLife expectancy was around 74.8 years in 2017 [14] The leading cause of death is cardiovascular diseases, followed by cancer [267] Childhood immunization rates have increased steadily over the past 15 years; by 2002 immunisations and vaccines reached more than 95% of children under five [268] In 1950, water and sanitation was available to only 10% of the population; in 2015, it reached 98% of Jordanians [269]\n\n\nCulture\nMany institutions aim to increase cultural awareness of Jordanian art and to represent artistic movements in fields such as paintings, sculpture, graffiti and photography [281] The art scene has been developing in the past few years, [282] and Jordan has been a haven for artists from surrounding countries [283] In January 2016, for the first time ever, a Jordanian film called Theeb was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film [284]\n\n\nArt and museums\nMany institutions aim to increase cultural awareness of Jordanian art and to represent artistic movements in fields such as paintings, sculpture, graffiti and photography [281] The art scene has been developing in the past few years, [282] and Jordan has been a haven for artists from surrounding countries [283] In January 2016, for the first time ever, a Jordanian film called Theeb was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film [284]\n\n\nCuisine\nAs the eighth-largest producer of olives in the world, olive oil is the main cooking oil in Jordan [291] A common appetizer is hummus, which is a puree of chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon, and garlic Ful medames is another well-known appetiser A typical worker's meal, it has since made its way to the tables of the upper class A typical meze often contains koubba maqliya, labaneh, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, olives and pickles [292] Meze is generally accompanied by the Levantine alcoholic drink arak, which is made from grapes and aniseed and is similar to ouzo, rakı and pastis Jordanian wine and beer are also sometimes used The same dishes, served without alcoholic drinks, can also be termed \"muqabbilat\" (starters) in Arabic [206]\n\n\nSports\nWhile both team and individual sports are widely played, the kingdom has enjoyed its biggest international achievements in taekwondo The highlight came at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games when Ahmad Abughaush won Jordan's first ever medal [294] of any colour at the games by taking gold in the −67 kg weight [295] Medals have continued to be won at world and Asian level in the sport since to establish taekwondo as the kingdom's favourite sport alongside football [206] and basketball [296]\n\n\nSee

"Jordan\n================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nJordan is a country located in the Middle East, bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, and Israel and Palestine (West Bank) to the west. The kingdom has a rich history dating back to ancient times, with various civilizations and empires leaving their mark on the country. Today, Jordan is a modern state with a diverse culture, economy, and geography.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nJordan takes its name from the Jordan River, which forms much of the country's northwestern border. The river's name is derived from the Hebrew word Yarad (ירד), meaning \"the descender\", reflecting the river's declivity. Much of the area that makes up modern Jordan was historically called Transjordan, meaning \"across the Jordan\"; the term is used to denote the lands east of the river.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Ancient period\n\nThe oldest known evidence of hominid habitation in Jordan dates back at least 200,000 years. Jordan is a rich source of Paleolithic human remains due to its location within the Levant, where various migrations out of Africa converged, and its more humid climate during the Late Pleistocene, which resulted in the formation of numerous remains-preserving wetlands in the region. Past lakeshore environments attracted different groups of hominids, and several remains of tools dating from the Late Pleistocene have been found there.\n\nScientists have found the world's oldest known evidence of bread-making at a 14,500-year-old Natufian site in Jordan's northeastern desert. The Natufians were a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in the Levant around 13,000 to 9,800 years ago.\n\n### Classical period\n\nAlexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire in 332 BC introduced Hellenistic culture to the Middle East. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, the empire split among his generals, and in the end much of Transjordan was disputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria. The Nabataeans, nomadic Arabs based south of Edom, managed to establish an independent kingdom in 169 BC by exploiting the struggle between the two Greek powers.\n\nThe Nabataean Kingdom controlled much of the trade routes of the region, and it stretched south along the Red Sea coast into the Hejaz desert, up to as far north as Damascus, which it controlled for a short period (85–71 BC). The Nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade routes, often drawing the envy of their neighbours. Petra, Nabataea's capital, flourished in the 1st century AD, driven by its extensive water irrigation systems and agriculture.\n\nThe Nabataeans were talented stone carvers, building their most elaborate structure, Al-Khazneh, in the first century AD. It is believed to be the mausoleum of the Arab Nabataean King Aretas IV.\n\n### Islamic era\n\nIn 629, during the Battle of Mu'tah in what is today Karak Governorate, the Byzantines and their Arab Christian clients, the Ghassanids, staved off an attack by a Muslim Rashidun force that marched northwards towards the Levant from the Hejaz. The Byzantines however were defeated by the Muslims in 636 at the decisive Battle of the Yarmuk just north of Transjordan. Transjordan was an essential territory for the conquest of Damascus.\n\nThe Rashidun caliphate was followed by that of the Umayyads (661–750).\n\n### Modern era\n\nIncreasing policies of Turkification and centralization adopted by the Ottoman Empire in the wake of the 1908 Young Turk Revolution disenchanted the Arabs of the Levant, which contributed to the development of an Arab nationalist movement. These changes led to the outbreak of the 1916 Arab Revolt during World War I, which ended four centuries of stagnation under Ottoman rule.\n\nThe revolt was led by Sharif Hussein of Mecca, scion of the Hashemite family of the Hejaz, and his sons Abdullah, Faisal and Ali. Locally, the revolt garnered the support of the Transjordanian tribes, including Bedouins, Circassians and Christians. The Allies of World War I, including Britain and France whose imperial interests converged with the Arabist cause, offered support.\n\nThe revolt started on 5 June 1916 from Medina and pushed northwards until the fighting reached Transjordan in the Battle of Aqaba on 6 July 1917. The revolt reached its climax when Faisal entered Damascus in October 1918 and established an Arab-led military administration in OETA East, later declared as the Arab Kingdom of Syria, both of which Transjordan was part of.\n\nDuring this period, the southernmost region of the country, including Ma'an and Aqaba, was also claimed by the neighbouring Kingdom of Hejaz.\n\nGovernment\n----------\n\nJordan is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy. The king retains wide executive and legislative powers from the government and parliament. The king exercises his powers through the government that he appoints for a four-year term, which is responsible before the parliament that is made up of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nThe judiciary is independent according to the constitution but in practice often lacks independence.\n\nGeography\n----------\n\nJordan sits strategically at the crossroads of the continents of Asia, Africa and Europe, in the Levant area of the Fertile Crescent, a cradle of civilization. Its area is 89,341 square kilometres (34,495 sq mi), and it is 400 kilometres (250 mi) long between its northernmost and southernmost points; Umm Qais and Aqaba respectively.\n\nThe kingdom lies between 29° and 34° N, and 34° and 40° E. It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, and Israel and Palestine (West Bank) to the west.\n\nClimate\n----------\n\nThe climate varies greatly; generally, the further inland from the Mediterranean, there are greater contrasts in temperature and less rainfall. The average elevation is 812 m (2,664 ft) above sea level. The highlands above the Jordan Valley, mountains of the Dead Sea and Wadi Araba and as far south as Ras Al-Naqab are dominated by a Mediterranean climate, while the eastern and northeastern areas of the country are arid desert.\n\nBiodiversity\n------------\n\nOver 2,000 plant species have been recorded. Many of the flowering plants bloom in the spring after the winter rains and the type of vegetation depends largely on the levels of precipitation. The mountainous regions in the northwest are clothed in forests, while further south and east the vegetation becomes more scrubby and transitions to steppe-type vegetation.\n\nForests cover 1.5 million dunums (1,500 km2), less than 2% of Jordan, making Jordan among the world's least forested countries, the international average being 15%.\n\nEconomy\n--------\n\nJordan is classified by the World Bank as a lower middle income country. Approximately 15.7% of the population lives below the national poverty line as of 2018, while almost a third fell below the national poverty line during some time of the year, known as transient poverty.\n\nThe economy, which has a GDP of $39.453 billion (as of 2016), grew at an average rate of 8% per annum between 2004 and 2008, and around 2.6% 2010 onwards. GDP per capita rose by 351% in the 1970s, declined 30% in the 1980s, and rose 36% in the 1990s—currently $9,406 per capita by purchasing power parity.\n\nTransportation\n--------------\n\nJordan is ranked as having the 35th best infrastructure in the world, one of the highest rankings in the developing world, according to the 2010 World Economic Forum's Index of Economic Competitiveness.\n\nThis high infrastructural development is necessitated by its role as a transit country for goods and services mainly to Palestine and Iraq.\n\nTourism\n--------\n\nTourism is a significant contributor to Jordan's economy. The country has a rich history and culture, with numerous archaeological sites and natural wonders, making it an attractive destination for tourists.\n\nNatural resources\n-----------------\n\nJordan is among the most water-scarce nations on Earth. At 97 cubic metres of water per person per year, it is considered to face \"absolute water scarcity\" according to the Falkenmark Classification.\n\nScarce resources to begin with have been aggravated by the massive influx of Syrian refugees, many of whom face issues of access to clean water in informal settlements (see \"Immigrants and Refugees\" below).\n\nWater from Disi aquifer and ten major dams historically played a large role in providing fresh water. The Jawa Dam in northeastern Jordan, which dates back to the fourth millennium BC, is the world's oldest dam.\n\nIndustry\n--------\n\nThe industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, construction, and power, accounted for approximately 26% of the GDP in 2004 (including manufacturing, 16.2%; construction, 4.6%; and mining, 3.1%). More than 21% of the labor force was employed in industry in 2002.\n\nIn 2014, industry accounted for 6% of the GDP. The main industrial products are potash, phosphates, cement, clothes, and fertilisers.\n\nScience and technology\n----------------------\n\nScience and technology is the fastest developing economic sector. This growth is occurring across multiple industries, including information and communications technology (ICT) and nuclear technology.\n\nJordan contributes 75% of the Arabic content on the Internet. In 2014, the ICT sector accounted for more than 84,000 jobs and contributed to 12% of the GDP.\n\nMore than 400 companies are active in telecom, information technology, and video game development. 600 companies are operating in active technologies and 300 start-up companies.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\nThe 2015 census showed a population of 9,531,712 (female: 47%; males: 53%). Around 2.9 million (30%) were non-citizens, a figure including refugees and illegal immigrants.\n\nThere were 1,977,534 households in 2015, with an average of 4.8 persons per household (compared to 6.7 persons per household for the census of 1979).\n\nAmman is one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities and one of the most modern in the Arab world. The population of Amman was 65,754 in 1946, but exceeded 4 million by 2015.\n\nRefugees, immigrants and expatriates\n------------------------------------\n\nJordan was home to 2,175,491 Palestinian refugees as of December 2016; most of them had been granted Jordanian citizenship.\n\nThe first wave of Palestinian refugees arrived during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and peaked in the 1967 Six-Day War and the 1990 Gulf War. In the past, Jordan had given many Palestinian refugees citizenship, however recently citizenship is given only in rare cases.\n\n370,000 of these Palestinians live in UNRWA refugee camps. Following the capture of the West Bank by Israel in 1967, Jordan revoked the citizenship of thousands of Palestinians to thwart any attempt to permanently resettle from the West Bank to Jordan.\n\nWest Bank Palestinians with family in Jordan or Jordanian citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all the rights of citizenship if requested.\n\nReligion\n--------\n\nSunni Islam is the dominant religion. Muslims make up about 95% of the population; in turn, 93% of those self-identify as Sunnis. There are also a small number of Ahmadi Muslims and some Shiites. Many Shia are Iraqi and Lebanese refugees.\n\nMuslims who convert to another religion as well as missionaries from other religions face societal and legal discrimination.\n\nLanguages\n---------\n\nThe official language is Modern Standard Arabic, a literary language taught in the schools. Most Jordanians natively speak one of the non-standard Arabic dialects known as Jordanian Arabic.\n\nJordanian Sign Language is the language of the deaf community. English, though without official status, is widely spoken throughout the country and is the de facto language of commerce and banking, as well as a co-official status in the education sector; almost all university-level classes are held in English, and almost all public schools teach English along with Standard Arabic.\n\nChechen, Circassian, Armenian, Tagalog, and Russian are popular among their communities. French is offered as an elective in many schools, mainly in the private sector. German is an increasingly popular language; it has been introduced at a larger scale since the establishment of the German Jordanian University in 2005.\n\nHealth and education\n---------------------\n\nLife expectancy was around 74.8 years in 2017. The leading cause of death is cardiovascular diseases, followed by cancer. Childhood immunization rates have increased steadily over the past 15 years; by 2002 immunisations and vaccines reached more than 95% of children under five.\n\nIn 1950, water and sanitation was available to only 10% of the population; in 2015, it reached 98% of Jordanians.\n\nCulture\n--------\n\nMany institutions aim to increase cultural awareness of Jordanian art and to represent artistic movements in fields such as paintings, sculpture, graffiti and photography.\n\nThe art scene has been developing in the past few years, and Jordan has been a haven for artists from surrounding countries.\n\nIn January 2016, for the first time ever, a Jordanian film called Theeb was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nArt and museums\n----------------\n\nMany institutions aim to increase cultural awareness of Jordanian art and to represent artistic movements in fields such as paintings, sculpture, graffiti and photography.\n\nThe art scene has been developing in the past few years, and Jordan has been a haven for artists from surrounding countries.\n\nIn January 2016, for the first time ever, a Jordanian film called Theeb was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nCuisine\n--------\n\nAs the eighth-largest producer of olives in the world, olive oil is the main cooking oil in Jordan. A common appetizer is hummus, which is a puree of chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon, and garlic. Ful medames is another well-known appetiser. A typical worker's meal, it has since made its way to the tables of the upper class.\n\nA typical meze often contains koubba maqliya, labaneh, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, olives and pickles. Meze is generally accompanied by the Levantine alcoholic drink arak, which is made from grapes and aniseed and is similar to ouzo, rakı and pastis. Jordanian wine and beer are also sometimes used.\n\nThe same dishes, served without alcoholic drinks, can also be termed \"muqabbilat\" (starters) in Arabic.\n\nSports\n--------\n\nWhile both team and individual sports are widely played, the kingdom has enjoyed its biggest international achievements in taekwondo. The highlight came at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games when Ahmad Abughaush won Jordan's first ever medal of any colour at the games by taking gold in the −67 kg weight.\n\nMedals have continued to be won at world and Asian level in the sport since to establish taekwondo as the kingdom's favourite sport alongside football and basketball.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of monarchs of Jordan\n* Politics of Jordan\n* Military of Jordan\n* Culture of Jordan\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* \"Jordan\".

following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nJordan takes its name from the Jordan River, which forms much of the country's northwestern border [14] While several theories for the origin of the river's name have been proposed, it is most plausible that it derives from the Hebrew word Yarad (ירד), meaning \"the descender\", reflecting the river's declivity [15] Much of the area that makes up modern Jordan was historically called Transjordan, meaning \"across the Jordan\"; the term is used to denote the lands east of the river [15] The Hebrew Bible uses the term עבר הירדן Ever ha'Yarden (lit. 'the other side of the Jordan') for the area [15]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAncient period\nThe oldest known evidence of hominid habitation in Jordan dates back at least 200,000 years [18] Jordan is a rich source of Paleolithic human remains (up to 20,000 years old) due to its location within the Levant, where various migrations out of Africa converged, [19] and its more humid climate during the Late Pleistocene, which resulted in the formation of numerous remains-preserving wetlands in the region [20] Past lakeshore environments attracted different groups of hominids, and several remains of tools dating from the Late Pleistocene have been found there [19] Scientists have found the world's oldest known evidence of bread-making at a 14,500-year-old Natufian site in Jordan's northeastern desert [21]\n\n\nClassical period\nAlexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire in 332 BC introduced Hellenistic culture to the Middle East [40] After Alexander's death in 323 BC, the empire split among his generals, and in the end much of Transjordan was disputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria [40] The Nabataeans, nomadic Arabs based south of Edom, managed to establish an independent kingdom in 169 BC by exploiting the struggle between the two Greek powers [40] The Nabataean Kingdom controlled much of the trade routes of the region, and it stretched south along the Red Sea coast into the Hejaz desert, up to as far north as Damascus, which it controlled for a short period (85–71 BC) [41] The Nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade routes, often drawing the envy of their neighbours [42] Petra, Nabataea's capital, flourished in the 1st century AD, driven by its extensive water irrigation systems and agriculture [43] The Nabataeans were talented stone carvers, building their most elaborate structure, Al-Khazneh, in the first century AD [44] It is believed to be the mausoleum of the Arab Nabataean King Aretas IV [44]\n\n\nIslamic era\nIn 629, during the Battle of Mu'tah in what is today Karak Governorate, the Byzantines and their Arab Christian clients, the Ghassanids, staved off an attack by a Muslim Rashidun force that marched northwards towards the Levant from the Hejaz [53] The Byzantines however were defeated by the Muslims in 636 at the decisive Battle of the Yarmuk just north of Transjordan [53] Transjordan was an essential territory for the conquest of Damascus [54] The Rashidun caliphate was followed by that of the Umayyads (661–750) [54]\n\n\nModern era\nIncreasing policies of Turkification and centralization adopted by the Ottoman Empire in the wake of the 1908 Young Turk Revolution disenchanted the Arabs of the Levant, which contributed to the development of an Arab nationalist movement These changes led to the outbreak of the 1916 Arab Revolt during World War I, which ended four centuries of stagnation under Ottoman rule [72] The revolt was led by Sharif Hussein of Mecca, scion of the Hashemite family of the Hejaz, and his sons Abdullah, Faisal and Ali Locally, the revolt garnered the support of the Transjordanian tribes, including Bedouins, Circassians and Christians [74] The Allies of World War I, including Britain and France whose imperial interests converged with the Arabist cause, offered support [75] The revolt started on 5 June 1916 from Medina and pushed northwards until the fighting reached Transjordan in the Battle of Aqaba on 6 July 1917 [76] The revolt reached its climax when Faisal entered Damascus in October 1918 and established an Arab-led military administration in OETA East, later declared as the Arab Kingdom of Syria, both of which Transjordan was part of [74] During this period, the southernmost region of the country, including Ma'an and Aqaba, was also claimed by the neighbouring Kingdom of Hejaz.\n\n\nPost-independence\nThe Treaty of London, signed by the British government and the Emir of Transjordan on 22 March 1946, recognised the independence of the state [92] On 25 May 1946, the day that the treaty was ratified by the Transjordan parliament, Transjordan was raised to the status of a kingdom under the name of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Arabic, with Abdullah as its first king; although it continued to be referred to as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan in English until 1949 [93] [94] 25 May is now celebrated as the nation's Independence Day, a public holiday [95] Jordan became a member of the United Nations on 14 December 1955 [96]\n\n\nGeography\nJordan sits strategically at the crossroads of the continents of Asia, Africa and Europe, [116] in the Levant area of the Fertile Crescent, a cradle of civilization [117] Its area is 89,341 square kilometres (34,495 sq mi), and it is 400 kilometres (250 mi) long between its northernmost and southernmost points; Umm Qais and Aqaba respectively [14] The kingdom lies between 29° and 34° N, and 34° and 40° E It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and the east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, and Israel and Palestine (West Bank) to the west.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate varies greatly; generally, the further inland from the Mediterranean, there are greater contrasts in temperature and less rainfall [14] The average elevation is 812 m (2,664 ft) above sea level [14] The highlands above the Jordan Valley, mountains of the Dead Sea and Wadi Araba and as far south as Ras Al-Naqab are dominated by a Mediterranean climate, while the eastern and northeastern areas of the country are arid desert [122] Although the deserts reach high temperatures, the heat is usually moderated by low humidity and a daytime breeze, while the nights are cool [123]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nOver 2,000 plant species have been recorded [124] Many of the flowering plants bloom in the spring after the winter rains and the type of vegetation depends largely on the levels of precipitation The mountainous regions in the northwest are clothed in forests, while further south and east the vegetation becomes more scrubby and transitions to steppe-type vegetation [125] Forests cover 1.5 million dunums (1,500 km2), less than 2% of Jordan, making Jordan among the world's least forested countries, the international average being 15% [126]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nJordan is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy Its constitution, adopted in 1952 and amended a number of times since, is the legal framework that governs the monarch, government, bicameral legislature and judiciary [134] The king retains wide executive and legislative powers from the government and parliament [135] The king exercises his powers through the government that he appoints for a four-year term, which is responsible before the parliament that is made up of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives The judiciary is independent according to the constitution but in practice often lacks independence [134]\n\n\nLargest cities\nThe capital city is Amman, located in north-central Jordan [155]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJordan is divided into 12 governorates (muhafazah) informally grouped into three regions: northern, central, southern The governorates are divided into liwa or districts, which are often further subdivided into qda or sub-districts [157] Control for each administrative unit is in a \"chief town\" (administrative centre) known as a nahia [157]\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe kingdom has followed a pro-Western foreign policy and maintained close relations with the United States and the United Kingdom During the first Gulf War (1990), these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and its maintenance of relations with Iraq Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq and in the Southwest Asia peace process After King Hussein's death in 1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly improved [158]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe first organised army in Jordan was established on 22 October 1920, named the \"Arab Legion\" [91] The Arab Legion grew from 150 men in 1920 to 8,000 in 1946 [166] Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War proved that the Arab Legion, known today as the Jordan Armed Forces, was the most effective among the Arab troops involved in the war [166] The Royal Jordanian Army, which boasts around 110,000 personnel, is considered to be among the most professional in the region and is particularly well-trained and organised [166] The Jordanian military enjoys strong support and aid from the United States, the United Kingdom and France This is due to Jordan's critical position in the Middle East [166] The development of Special Operations Forces has been particularly significant, enhancing the capability of the military to react rapidly to threats to homeland security, as well as training special forces from the region and beyond [167] Jordan provides extensive training to the security forces of several Arab countries [168]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nLaw enforcement is under the purview of the Public Security Directorate (which includes approximately 50,000 persons) and the General Directorate of Gendarmerie, both of which are subordinate to the Ministry of Interior The first police force was organised after the fall of the Ottoman Empire on 11 April 1921 [174] Until 1956 police duties were carried out by the Arab Legion and the Transjordan Frontier Force After that year the Public Safety Directorate was established [174] The number of female police officers is increasing In the 1970s, it was the first Arab country to include women in its police force [175] Jordan's law enforcement was ranked 37th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East, in terms of police services' performance, by the 2016 World Internal Security and Police Index [176] [177]\n\n\nEconomy\nJordan is classified by the World Bank as a lower middle income country [178] Approximately 15.7% of the population lives below the national poverty line as of 2018, [179] while almost a third fell below the national poverty line during some time of the year, known as transient poverty [180] The economy, which has a GDP of $39.453 billion (as of 2016 [update]), [5] grew at an average rate of 8% per annum between 2004 and 2008, and around 2.6% 2010 onwards [14] GDP per capita rose by 351% in the 1970s, declined 30% in the 1980s, and rose 36% in the 1990s—currently $9,406 per capita by purchasing power parity [181] The Jordanian economy is one of the smallest economies in the region, and the country's populace suffers from relatively high rates of unemployment and poverty [14]\n\n\nTransportation\nJordan is ranked as having the 35th best infrastructure in the world, one of the highest rankings in the developing world, according to the 2010 World Economic Forum's Index of Economic Competitiveness This high infrastructural development is necessitated by its role as a transit country for goods and services mainly to Palestine and Iraq [195]\n\n\nTourism\n\n\n\nNatural resources\nJordan is among the most water-scarce nations on Earth At 97 cubic metres of water per person per year, it is considered to face \"absolute water scarcity\" according to the Falkenmark Classification [213] Scarce resources to begin with have been aggravated by the massive influx of Syrian refugees, many of whom face issues of access to clean water in informal settlements (see \"Immigrants and Refugees\" below) [214] Jordan shares both of its two main surface water resources, the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers, with neighbouring countries, adding complexity to water allocation decisions [213] Water from Disi aquifer and ten major dams historically played a large role in providing fresh water [215] The Jawa Dam in northeastern Jordan, which dates back to the fourth millennium BC, is the world's oldest dam [216]\n\n\nIndustry\nThe industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, construction, and power, accounted for approximately 26% of the GDP in 2004 (including manufacturing, 16.2%; construction, 4.6%; and mining, 3.1%) More than 21% of the labor force was employed in industry in 2002 In 2014, industry accounted for 6% of the GDP [226] The main industrial products are potash, phosphates, cement, clothes, and fertilisers The most promising segment of this sector is construction Petra Engineering Industries Company, which is considered to be one of the main pillars of Jordanian industry, has gained international recognition with its air-conditioning units reaching NASA [227] Jordan is now considered to be a leading pharmaceuticals manufacturer in the MENA region led by Hikma [228]\n\n\nScience and technology\nScience and technology is the fastest developing economic sector This growth is occurring across multiple industries, including information and communications technology (ICT) and nuclear technology Jordan contributes 75% of the Arabic content on the Internet [231] In 2014, the ICT sector accounted for more than 84,000 jobs and contributed to 12% of the GDP More than 400 companies are active in telecom, information technology, and video game development 600 companies are operating in active technologies and 300 start-up companies [231] Jordan was ranked 73rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [232]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2015 census showed a population of 9,531,712 (female: 47%; males: 53%) Around 2.9 million (30%) were non-citizens, a figure including refugees and illegal immigrants [4] There were 1,977,534 households in 2015, with an average of 4.8 persons per household (compared to 6.7 persons per household for the census of 1979) [4] Amman is one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities and one of the most modern in the Arab world [236] The population of Amman was 65,754 in 1946, but exceeded 4 million by 2015.\n\n\nRefugees, immigrants and expatriates\nJordan was home to 2,175,491 Palestinian refugees as of December 2016; most of them had been granted Jordanian citizenship [237] The first wave of Palestinian refugees arrived during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and peaked in the 1967 Six-Day War and the 1990 Gulf War In the past, Jordan had given many Palestinian refugees citizenship, however recently citizenship is given only in rare cases 370,000 of these Palestinians live in UNRWA refugee camps [237] Following the capture of the West Bank by Israel in 1967, Jordan revoked the citizenship of thousands of Palestinians to thwart any attempt to permanently resettle from the West Bank to Jordan West Bank Palestinians with family in Jordan or Jordanian citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all the rights of citizenship if requested [238]\n\n\nReligion\nSunni Islam is the dominant religion Muslims make up about 95% of the

Haro Aso. The series was serialized in Shogakukan's Shōnen Sunday S magazine from November 25, 2010, to March 25, 2015, and later moved to Weekly Shōnen Sunday on April 8, 2015, and finished on March 2, 2016. The series was adapted into a three-episode original video animation (OVA) produced by Silver Link and Connect and directed by Hideki Tachibana.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story follows Ryohei Arisu, a young man who struggles to connect with his family and spends time hanging out with his friends, Daikichi Karube and Chōta Segawa. The trio are at a train station when they see fireworks so blinding they have to cover their eyes, and when they open them, they find themselves back in Karube's bar, which is now abandoned and all of the buildings covered in vegetation. The trio get drunk and play games together, but Karube becomes worried and urges the pair to take things seriously. After stepping into what seems to be an empty festival, they are greeted by Saori Shibuki, who tells them that they have already \"entered their game.\" The game is \"Three of Clubs\" named \"Good Fortune Bad Fortune,\" where they have to answer obscure questions, and if they get it wrong, flaming arrows are shot at them.\n\nKarube and Shibuki argue, causing Chota to have to guess the answer quickly, and have arrows fired at them. The questions continue, and Chota's leg is severely burned, but apart from that, all four escape. Shibuki reveals to them that, in Borderland, they must play games to survive, with the number of each game the number of days they have until they have to play another game. Shibuki arrived in the Borderlands several days earlier, where she played \"Two of Hearts\" and was the only survivor, traumatising her. Due to Chota's injury, Shibuki volunteers to stay behind to tend to him, while the other two go into the \"Five of Spades.\" Other players include climber Yuzuha Usagi and sly player Shuntaro Chishiya. Only those four survive the game, with Arisu and Usagi managing to complete it together. Arisu, Karube, Chota, and Shibuki enter the \"Seven of Hearts\" game, where it's revealed that only one can survive. The other three all decide to sacrifice themselves for Arisu. As Arisu remains in despair, he meets Usagi again, and she takes pity on him, and they decide to partner up.\n\n**Characters**\n\nArisu, the main protagonist, is a young man who struggles to connect with his family and spends time hanging out with his friends. He is portrayed as a laid-back person who is often seen as lazy by others. Karube, Arisu's friend, is a manager of a bar and is often seen as the voice of reason. He is portrayed as a responsible and serious person. Chota, Arisu's other friend, is a fun-loving and immature person who is often seen as a troublemaker. Shibuki, a character who appears in the second game, is a mysterious and intelligent person who is initially portrayed as an antagonist but later becomes an ally. Usagi, another character who appears in the second game, is a skilled climber who is initially portrayed as a rival but later becomes an ally.\n\n**Media**\n\nThe series was adapted into a three-episode original video animation (OVA) produced by Silver Link and Connect and directed by Hideki Tachibana.

Born on February 12, 1956, in Cleveland, Ohio, Hall has made a significant impact in the entertainment industry with his charismatic personality, witty humor, and advocacy for social causes.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHall was born to Fred and Annie Hall, a Baptist minister and his wife. His father's influence played a significant role in shaping Hall's early life, as he was raised in a devout Christian household. As a child, Hall developed a passion for magic and performed at family gatherings and local events. He attended Warrensville Heights High School in Warrensville Heights, Ohio, graduating in 1973. Hall later attended Ohio University and Kent State University, where he honed his skills in comedy and entertainment.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter completing his education, Hall moved to Chicago to pursue a career in comedy. He made a few appearances on the popular television show \"Soul Train\" and began to gain recognition as a rising talent in the entertainment industry. In 1984, Hall served as the announcer and sidekick for Alan Thicke's short-lived talk show \"Thicke of the Night.\" Although the show was canceled after a brief run, Hall's experience on the show helped him develop his hosting skills and prepared him for future opportunities.\n\n**Talk Shows**\n\nIn 1986, Hall landed a spot as a host on the Fox network's \"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers.\" Although the show started off moderately, it struggled to gain traction in the ratings. After a year, Joan Rivers left the show due to creative differences with the network. Hall was subsequently chosen to host the show in the fall of 1987, and his tenure proved to be incredibly successful. The show's popularity soared, and Hall became a household name.\n\n**The Arsenio Hall Show**\n\nHall's stint on \"The Late Show\" led to him being offered his own show in syndication. In 1989, \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" premiered, featuring Hall as the charismatic host. The show was a massive hit, attracting a diverse audience and showcasing Hall's ability to connect with people from all walks of life. The show's success was largely due to Hall's unique blend of humor, empathy, and advocacy for social causes.\n\n**Support of Gay Rights and the Fight Against AIDS**\n\nDuring the 1990s, Hall was a vocal supporter of gay rights and the fight against AIDS. He used his platform to raise awareness about the disease and its impact on marginalized communities. In an episode of \"The Arsenio Hall Show,\" Hall was protested by gay rights activists, who criticized him for not having enough gay guests on the show. Hall responded passionately, stating that he had featured LGBT celebrities on his show and had others who preferred not to publicly advocate their sexual orientation.\n\n**Other Television and Radio Work**\n\nBetween 1988 and 1991, Hall hosted the MTV Video Music Awards. He has also appeared as a guest on numerous talk shows, in special features, as a voice actor, on game shows, and other award shows. Since \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" ended, Hall has had leading roles on television shows such as the short-lived sitcom \"Arsenio\" and \"Martial Law with Sammo Hung.\" He has also hosted the revival of \"Star Search\" and popularized the catchphrase \"Hit me with the digits!\"\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 1997, Hall gave an interview to dispel rumors about what had driven him off the stage. He revealed that he had been out of the public eye for three years due to personal issues, but had not been in detox at the Betty Ford Clinic. Hall's decision to speak out about his personal struggles has helped to humanize him and demonstrate his vulnerability.\n\n**Recognition**\n\nThroughout his career, Hall has received numerous awards and accolades for his work in television, film, and music. He has been nominated for multiple Emmy Awards and has won several People's Choice Awards.

'They're pretty bold that they did this.'\n\n\nPre-production\nFollowing the disappointing critical and financial performance of Justice League (2017), in January 2018 Walter Hamada replaced Jon Berg as the head of DC-based film production at Warner Bros [65] Hamada sorted through the various DC films in development, canceling some while advancing work on others; the film was set to begin filming in late 2018 with a small budget of $55 million [66] Kim Masters of The Hollywood Reporter said Warner Bros was reluctant to let Joker move forward and gave it a small budget in an effort to dissuade Phillips [49] Phillips said that Hamada did not understand what he was trying to do [67] By June, Robert De Niro was under consideration for a supporting role in the film [68] The deal with Phoenix was finalized in July 2018, [69] after four months of persuasion from Phillips [39] Immediately afterwards, [69] Warner Bros officially green-lit the film, [70] titled it Joker and gave it an October 4, 2019, release date [71] Warner Bros described the film as \"an exploration of a man disregarded by society  [that] is not only a gritty character study, but also a broader cautionary tale\" [72]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography commenced in September 2018 in New York City, [b] under the working title Romeo [81] Shortly after filming began, De Niro, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Glenn Fleshler, Bill Camp, Josh Pais and Douglas Hodge were announced to have joined the film, with Cullen replacing Baldwin [26] [82] Bradley Cooper joined the film as a producer, [83] and the director of photography was Lawrence Sher, both of whom Phillips had previously collaborated with [26] On September 22, a scene depicting a violent protest was filmed at the Church Avenue station in Kensington, Brooklyn, [84] although the station was modified to look like the Bedford Park Boulevard station in the Bronx [85] Filming of violent scenes also took place at the abandoned lower platform of the Ninth Avenue station in Sunset Park, Brooklyn [86]\n\n\nPost-production\nPhillips confirmed he was in the process of editing Joker in March 2019 [96] At CinemaCon the following month, he stated the film was \"still taking shape\" and was difficult to discuss, as he hoped to maintain secrecy [97] Phillips also denied most reports surrounding the film, which he felt was because it is \"an origin story about a character that doesn't have a definitive origin\" [98] Brian Tyree Henry was also confirmed to have a role in the film [31] The visual effects were provided by Scanline VFX and Shade VFX and supervised by Matthew Giampa and Bryan Godwin, with Erwin Rivera serving as the overall supervisor [99] Joker used less VFX work than other comics films, except few scenes including that Arthur smeared smile by his blood in crowd [100]\n\n\nDesign\nGotham City in Joker was set in 1980s New York City, according to Todd Phillips, \"to separate it, quite frankly, from the DC universe\" [107] Mark Friedberg, the production designer of this film, said he established the filming location of Gotham Square in Newark as a film set because there was still poverty [108] He wanted Gotham to look like a gritty city, as described in Taxi Driver (1976), so he named all structures and lines in this film and drew a specific map of Gotham city [109] He displayed 1970s brightly colored muscle cars on the set, \"conveying dissonance and being awful and beautiful at the same time\" He also tried to describe Gotham as a decaying city through graffiti, garbage on the road and cracked sidewalks [110] [111] The VFX team added fictional buildings, changing the skyline of the city to give the sense that the city was pressing down on Arthur [112] Lawrence Sher said sodium-vapor lights were used in this film, representing Arthur's isolation and his more hopeful side [113]\n\n\nSet\nGotham City in Joker was set in 1980s New York City, according to Todd Phillips, \"to separate it, quite

Lawrence Sher said sodium-vapor lights were used in this film, representing Arthur's isolation and his more hopeful side [113]\n\n\nCharacter design\nOne of the most important inspirations for Arthur's behavior came from the Little Tramp in Modern Times (1936), while his \"ridiculous\" movement was inspired by Charlie Chaplin [36] [112] Arthur's dance was influenced by that of Ray Bolger, and his gesture of making a smile from two fingers was from the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz (1939) [42] [117] In preparation, Phoenix ate a single sparse meal per day for 8 months, losing 52 pounds (24 kg) to look \"wolf-like and malnourished and hungry\", [39] [118] [8] and watched videos of people suffering from pathological laughter to refine his own laughter for the role [119] He sought to portray a character whom audiences could not relate to and did not look to previous Joker actors for inspiration; instead, he read a book about political assassinations so he could understand killers and their motivations [5] Phillips identified Arthur's normal face as being his \"real mask\", while Joker served as his true personality [120] He had also identified the genuine laugh occurring only in the last scene [121] Director Todd Phillips said that he intentionally left it ambiguous as to whether Arthur becomes the Joker of traditional Batman stories or inspires a separate character, [40] although Phoenix believes that Arthur is the former [122] [123]\n\n\nMake-up and costumes\nNicki Ledermann and Kay Georgiou, the makeup designer and hairstylist tried to show Arthur Fleck to \"be handmade and realistic\" Georgiou designated Arthur as a man with unwashed hair Arthur's costumes, designed by Mark Bridges, were matched to look \"aged, overdyed and distressed\" through wearing him with cheap polyester pants and an acrylic sweater His color palette was inspired by the aesthetics of the 1980s: blue, maroon, brown, mauve and gray [124] Bridges explained Arthur's costume color started from a \"juvenile mode\" and later changing to align with the tone of the film [125] In the first scene, Arthur's \"too small\" hooded jacket and white socks emphasizes the childish concept, being a reflection of him living with his mother Penny, with her calling him \"my little boy\", [124] and the influence of Charlie Chaplin [126] However, he wore a charcoal sweater during the scene in which he is interviewed by the social worker and finally wore a \"scab-colored knit top\" in Arkham State Hospital [125] A line depicting his old suit for many years was interpreted a mustard-toned vest and a patterned bottle-green shirt [124]\n\n\nMusic\nIn August 2018, Hildur Guðnadóttir was hired to compose the film's score [127] Hildur began writing music after reading the script and meeting with Phillips, who \"had a lot of strong ideas\" about how he thought the score should sound She worked on the Joker score alongside the score for the drama miniseries Chernobyl; Hildur told The Hindu's Divya-Kala Bhavani switching between the two was challenging because the scores were so different [128]\n\n\nMarketing\nPhillips promoted Joker by posting on set photos on his Instagram account [134] On September 21, 2018, he released test footage of Phoenix in-costume as the Joker, with \"Laughing\" by The Guess Who accompanying the footage [135] At CinemaCon on April 2, 2019, Phillips unveiled the first trailer for the film, [31] which was released online the following day [136] The trailer, prominently featuring the song \"Smile\" performed by Jimmy Durante, generated positive responses, with some commentators comparing it to Taxi Driver and Requiem for a Dream (2000) and praising Phoenix's performance [137] [138] Writers described the trailer as dark and gritty, [139] with ComicBook.com's Jenna Anderson feeling it appeared more like a psychological thriller than a comic book film [31] Actor Mark Hamill, who has voiced the Joker since the cartoon Batman: The Animated Series (1992–1995), expressed enthusiasm on Twitter [citation needed] Conversely, io9's Germain Lussier said the trailer revealed too little and that it was too similar to photos Phillips had posted on Instagram While he still believed it exhibited potential, Lussier overall thought the trailer was not \"a home run\" [140] The trailer received over eight million views in the first few hours of release [141]\n\n\nRelease\nJoker had its world premiere at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2019, where it received an eight-minute standing ovation and won the

18, 2019, the United States Army distributed an email warning service members of potential violence at theaters screening the film and noting the Joker character's popularity among the incel community A separate memo revealed the Army received \"credible\" information from Texas law enforcement \"regarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the release\" [152] The film, forbidden to minors under 17 in the US, was feared to possibly encourage imitations of the criminal behaviors represented in the film in ordinary life [153] However, according to Deadline Hollywood, the FBI and the United States Department of Homeland Security found no credible threats surrounding the release of the film [154]\n\n\nHome media\nJoker was released on Digital HD on December 17, 2019, and on

Joker holds an approval rating of 68% based on 603 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10 The site's critical consensus reads, \"Joker gives its infamous central character a chillingly plausible origin story that serves as a brilliant showcase for its star – and a dark evolution for comics-inspired cinema.\" [191] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 60 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [192] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it

for Best Picture at the Academy Awards [193]\n\n\nIndustry response\nJoker generated positive responses from industry figures DC Comics chief creative officer Jim Lee praised it as \"intense, raw and soulful\" and stated that it had remained true to the character despite deviating from the source material [1] [2] Actor Mark Hamill, who has voiced the Joker in animation and video games since Batman: The Animated Series, thought the film had \"brilliantly\" reinvented the character and gave it \" [two] thumbs up\" [207] Superman (1978) director Richard Donner called the film \"brilliant\", \"fascinating\", \"really well-written\" and stated that Phoenix's performance was \"genius\" [208] Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore called Joker a \"cinematic masterpiece\" and stated it was a \"danger to society\" if people did not see it [209] Actor Josh Brolin found the film powerful: \"To appreciate Joker I believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is\" [210] Actor Vincent D'Onofrio vocally commended Phoenix's performance in the film on Twitter, stating that he \"deserve [d] recognition for this performance\", while actress Jessica Chastain agreed, replying: \"It's one of the greatest pieces of acting I've ever seen\" [211] Actress and screenwriter Phoebe Waller-Bridge also praised the film, stating: \"I think the reason people got so uncomfortable  [with the film] is because it feels too true, too raw I was watching it and thinking to myself, God, if this came out a year into Obama's time in office, I don't think we'd be feeling as worried about it\" [212] Filmmaker David Fincher said of the film's unexpected success, \"Nobody would have thought they had a shot at a giant hit with Joker had The Dark Knight not been as massive as it was I don't think anyone would have looked at that material and thought, 'Yeah, let's take  [Taxi Driver's] Travis Bickle and  [The King of Comedy's] Rupert Pupkin and conflate them, then trap him in a betrayal of the mentally ill and trot it out for a billion dollars'\" [213] Actor Brendan Gleeson felt that Phoenix's performance as the Joker was absolutely \"indelible\" and one of the most magnificent achievements in cinema he has ever seen, incidentally being that the reason he opted to join the film's sequel Joker: Folie à Deux (2024) as Jackie Sullivan [214] Filmmaker Ridley Scott, who had previously worked with Phoenix in Gladiator (2000), felt \"blown away\" by the film; while he disliked the apparent way it celebrated violence, Scott felt that Phoenix's performance was remarkable enough to make Phoenix an \"amazing asset\" for his film Napoleon (2023) in a \"creative and commercial sense\" [215]\n\n\nAccolades\nIn September 2019, Joker was awarded the Golden Lion, the festival's highest prize, at the 76th Venice International Film Festival [216] At the 92nd Academy Awards, the film won the Best Actor (Phoenix) and Best Original Score awards It received overall eleven nominations (including Best Picture) from the ceremony, breaking the record of eight held by The Dark Knight for the most nominations received by a film based on a comic book, comic strip or graphic novel [217] Hildur Guðnadóttir also became the first woman to win an original score Oscar since The Full Monty (1997) in 1998 [218] At the 73rd British Academy Film Awards, the film won Best Actor in a Leading Role (Phoenix), Best Casting and Best Original Music out of a leading eleven

nominated for seven awards at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards, winning Best Actor (Phoenix) and Best Score and was included in the American Film Institute and Cahiers du Cinéma's top 10 films of 2019 [221] [222]\n\n\nThemes and analysis\nJoker deals with the themes of mental illness and its both psychological and sociological effects [226] While its depiction of the Joker has been described as reminiscent of those who commit mass shootings in the United States as well as members of the incel community, [227] [additional citation(s) needed] Christina Newland of The Guardian concludes that Fleck is not an incel, but wrote that incels are likely to relate to him [228] Vejvoda, Hammond and Newland interpreted the film as a cautionary tale—society's disregard of those who are less fortunate will create a person like the Joker [195] [199] [228] Stephen Kent, writing for the Washington Examiner, described Arthur Fleck as blending shared aspects of mass shooters and interpreted its message as a reminder that society is riddled with men like the Joker [227] Writing in People's World, Chauncey K Robinson said the film \"walks a fine line between exploration and validation\" of Joker's character and is \"ultimately an in-your-face examination of a broken system that creates its own monsters.\" [229]\n\n\nCultural impact\nDuring a Five Star Movement event in October 2019, Italian comedian and politician Beppe Grillo gave a speech wearing the Joker's makeup [243] Yusuke Kawai, a candidate for governor of Chiba Prefecture, appeared on NHK with a Joker costume in 2021 [244] References to the character were also found in anti-government protests worldwide [245] [246] During the 17 October Revolution, a group of graffiti artists called Ashekm painted a mural of the Joker holding a Molotov cocktail and it was also reported that there was a Joker facepaint station at the protests in Beirut [245] In Los Ángeles, Chile, during the 2019–2022 Chilean protests, the phrase \"We are all clowns\", which is adopted by Gotham City protesters in the movie, was written at the foot of a statue [245] [246] In Hong Kong, protesters challenged an emergency decree prohibiting the wearing of masks by wearing those of fictional characters such as the Joker [245] In France, during the Yellow Vest Protests, firefighters donned Joker makeup holding placards [247] In 2020, during the George Floyd protests, Argentine president Alberto Fernández compared the pictures of the protests to those seen in the film [248]\n\n\nSequel\nJoker was intended to be a stand-alone film with no sequels but Warner Bros greenlit a follow-up project [97] [254] Joker: Folie à Deux, with Phoenix and Beetz reprising their roles and Lady Gaga joining as Harley Quinn, was released on October 4, 2024, to negative reviews and a poor commercial performance [255] [256]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Joker (2019 film)**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nJoker is a 2019 American psychological thriller film directed by Todd Phillips, written by Phillips and Scott Silver, and produced by Phillips, Silver, Bradley Cooper, and Emma Tillinger Koskoff. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a struggling clown and comedian who descends into madness and becomes the Joker. The film received widespread critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor for Phoenix's performance.\n\n**Plot**\n\nArthur Fleck is a professional clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who lives with his mother, Penny, in the crime- and recession-ridden city of Gotham, New York. He suffers from a neurological disorder that causes him to have random, uncontrollable laughing fits, requiring medication he depends on social services to obtain. One day, after Arthur is attacked by street youths while on the job, his co-worker Randall gives him a revolver for self-defense. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to see his routine at a comedy club.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including:\n\n* Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker\n* Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin\n* Zazie Beetz as Sophie Dumond\n* Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck\n* Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne\n* Shea Whigham as Murray Franklin's producer\n* Glenn Fleshler as Randall\n* Bill Camp as Detective Garrity\n* Josh Pais as Dr. Burke\n* Douglas Hodge as Alfred Pennyworth\n\n**Production**\n\nBetween 2014 and 2015, Joaquin Phoenix expressed interest to his agent in acting in a low-budget \"character study\" type of film about a comic book villain, like DC Comics character the Joker. Phoenix had previously declined to act in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) because he would have been required to reprise a role, such as Bruce Banner / Hulk or Stephen Strange / Doctor Strange. Phoenix ruled out the Joker for his \"character study\" idea and tried to think of a different one.\n\nTodd Phillips had been offered to direct comic-based films a number of times, but declined because he thought they were \"loud\" and did not interest him. Phillips was attracted to the Joker because he did not think there was a definitive portrayal of the character, which he knew would provide considerable creative freedom.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe development of Joker was a long and arduous process. Phillips and Silver worked on the script for over a year, trying to get the right tone and direction for the film. They drew inspiration from various sources, including Martin Scorsese's films, particularly Taxi Driver, and the works of Arthur Miller.\n\n**Writing**\n\nThe writing process was a collaborative effort between Phillips and Silver. They worked together to develop the script, trying to get the right balance of humor and drama. They also drew inspiration from various sources, including comics, literature, and music.\n\n**Pre-production**\n\nPre-production was a key part of the filmmaking process. Phillips and his team worked tirelessly to prepare for the shoot, including location scouting, casting, and set design. They also worked with the special effects team to create the iconic look of the Joker.\n\n**Filming**\n\nFilming took place in New York City and Newark, New Jersey, over a period of several months. The shoot was relatively low-key, with a small crew and a tight schedule. Phoenix threw himself into the role, immersing himself in the character's psyche and behavior.\n\n**Post-production**\n\nPost-production was a lengthy process, with the editors working tirelessly to shape the film into its final form. The visual effects team also worked on the film, creating the iconic look of the Joker and other characters.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe design of the film was a key aspect of the production. Mark Friedberg, the production designer, worked closely with Phillips to create the look and feel of Gotham City. They drew inspiration from various sources, including the works of Jean Giraud and the architecture of New York City.\n\n**Character design**\n\nThe character design of the Joker was a key aspect of the film. Phoenix worked closely with the costume designer to create the iconic look of the character.

'They're pretty bold that they did this.'\n\n\nPre-production\nFollowing the disappointing critical and financial performance of Justice League (2017), in January 2018 Walter Hamada replaced Jon Berg as the head of DC-based film production at Warner Bros [65] Hamada sorted through the various DC films in development, canceling some while advancing work on others; the film was set to begin filming in late 2018 with a small budget of $55 million [66] Kim Masters of The Hollywood Reporter said Warner Bros was reluctant to let Joker move forward and gave it a small budget in an effort to dissuade Phillips [49] Phillips said that Hamada did not understand what he was trying to do [67] By June, Robert De Niro was under consideration for a supporting role in the film [68] The deal with Phoenix was finalized in July 2018, [69] after four months of persuasion from Phillips [39] Immediately afterwards, [69] Warner Bros officially green-lit the film, [70] titled it Joker and gave it an October 4, 2019, release date [71] Warner Bros described the film as \"an exploration of a man disregarded by society  [that] is not only a gritty character study, but also a broader cautionary tale\" [72]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography commenced in September 2018 in New York City, [b] under the working title Romeo [81] Shortly after filming began, De Niro, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Glenn Fleshler, Bill Camp, Josh Pais and Douglas Hodge were announced to have joined the film, with Cullen replacing Baldwin [26] [82] Bradley Cooper joined the film as a producer, [83] and the director of photography was Lawrence Sher, both of whom Phillips had previously collaborated with [26] On September 22, a scene depicting a violent protest was filmed at the Church Avenue station in Kensington, Brooklyn, [84] although the station was modified to look like the Bedford Park Boulevard station in the Bronx [85] Filming of violent scenes also took place at the abandoned lower platform of the Ninth Avenue station in Sunset Park, Brooklyn [86]\n\n\nPost-production\nPhillips confirmed he was in the process of editing Joker in March 2019 [96] At CinemaCon the following month, he stated the film was \"still taking shape\" and was difficult to discuss, as he hoped to maintain secrecy [97] Phillips also denied most reports surrounding the film, which he felt was because it is \"an origin story about a character that doesn't have a definitive origin\" [98] Brian Tyree Henry was also confirmed to have a role in the film [31] The visual effects were provided by Scanline VFX and Shade VFX and supervised by Matthew Giampa and Bryan Godwin, with Erwin Rivera serving as the overall supervisor [99] Joker used less VFX work than other comics films, except few scenes including that Arthur smeared smile by his blood in crowd [100]\n\n\nDesign\nGotham City in Joker was set in 1980s New York City, according to Todd Phillips, \"to separate it, quite frankly, from the DC universe\" [107] Mark Friedberg, the production designer of this film, said he established the filming location of Gotham Square in Newark as a film set because there was still poverty [108] He wanted Gotham to look like a gritty city, as described in Taxi Driver (1976), so he named all structures and lines in this film and drew a specific map of Gotham city [109] He displayed 1970s brightly colored muscle cars on the set, \"conveying dissonance and being awful and beautiful at the same time\" He also tried to describe Gotham as a decaying city through graffiti, garbage on the road and cracked sidewalks [110] [111] The VFX team added fictional buildings, changing the skyline of the city to give the sense that the city was pressing down on Arthur [112] Lawrence Sher said sodium-vapor lights were used in this film, representing Arthur's isolation and his more hopeful side [113]\n\n\nSet\nGotham City in Joker was set in 1980s New York City, according to Todd Phillips, \"to separate it, quite

Lawrence Sher said sodium-vapor lights were used in this film, representing Arthur's isolation and his more hopeful side [113]\n\n\nCharacter design\nOne of the most important inspirations for Arthur's behavior came from the Little Tramp in Modern Times (1936), while his \"ridiculous\" movement was inspired by Charlie Chaplin [36] [112] Arthur's dance was influenced by that of Ray Bolger, and his gesture of making a smile from two fingers was from the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz (1939) [42] [117] In preparation, Phoenix ate a single sparse meal per day for 8 months, losing 52 pounds (24 kg) to look \"wolf-like and malnourished and hungry\", [39] [118] [8] and watched videos of people suffering from pathological laughter to refine his own laughter for the role [119] He sought to portray a character whom audiences could not relate to and did not look to previous Joker actors for inspiration; instead, he read a book about political assassinations so he could understand killers and their motivations [5] Phillips identified Arthur's normal face as being his \"real mask\", while Joker served as his true personality [120] He had also identified the genuine laugh occurring only in the last scene [121] Director Todd Phillips said that he intentionally left it ambiguous as to whether Arthur becomes the Joker of traditional Batman stories or inspires a separate character, [40] although Phoenix believes that Arthur is the former [122] [123]\n\n\nMake-up and costumes\nNicki Ledermann and Kay Georgiou, the makeup designer and hairstylist tried to show Arthur Fleck to \"be handmade and realistic\" Georgiou designated Arthur as a man with unwashed hair Arthur's costumes, designed by Mark Bridges, were matched to look \"aged, overdyed and distressed\" through wearing him with cheap polyester pants and an acrylic sweater His color palette was inspired by the aesthetics of the 1980s: blue, maroon, brown, mauve and gray [124] Bridges explained Arthur's costume color started from a \"juvenile mode\" and later changing to align with the tone of the film [125] In the first scene, Arthur's \"too small\" hooded jacket and white socks emphasizes the childish concept, being a reflection of him living with his mother Penny, with her calling him \"my little boy\", [124] and the influence of Charlie Chaplin [126] However, he wore a charcoal sweater during the scene in which he is interviewed by the social worker and finally wore a \"scab-colored knit top\" in Arkham State Hospital [125] A line depicting his old suit for many years was interpreted a mustard-toned vest and a patterned bottle-green shirt [124]\n\n\nMusic\nIn August 2018, Hildur Guðnadóttir was hired to compose the film's score [127] Hildur began writing music after reading the script and meeting with Phillips, who \"had a lot of strong ideas\" about how he thought the score should sound She worked on the Joker score alongside the score for the drama miniseries Chernobyl; Hildur told The Hindu's Divya-Kala Bhavani switching between the two was challenging because the scores were so different [128]\n\n\nMarketing\nPhillips promoted Joker by posting on set photos on his Instagram account [134] On September 21, 2018, he released test footage of Phoenix in-costume as the Joker, with \"Laughing\" by The Guess Who accompanying the footage [135] At CinemaCon on April 2, 2019, Phillips unveiled the first trailer for the film, [31] which was released online the following day [136] The trailer, prominently featuring the song \"Smile\" performed by Jimmy Durante, generated positive responses, with some commentators comparing it to Taxi Driver and Requiem for a Dream (2000) and praising Phoenix's performance [137] [138] Writers described the trailer as dark and gritty, [139] with ComicBook.com's Jenna Anderson feeling it appeared more like a psychological thriller than a comic book film [31] Actor Mark Hamill, who has voiced the Joker since the cartoon Batman: The Animated Series (1992–1995), expressed enthusiasm on Twitter [citation needed] Conversely, io9's Germain Lussier said the trailer revealed too little and that it was too similar to photos Phillips had posted on Instagram While he still believed it exhibited potential, Lussier overall thought the trailer was not \"a home run\" [140] The trailer received over eight million views in the first few hours of release [141]\n\n\nRelease\nJoker had its world premiere at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2019, where it received an eight-minute standing ovation and won the

18, 2019, the United States Army distributed an email warning service members of potential violence at theaters screening the film and noting the Joker character's popularity among the incel community A separate memo revealed the Army received \"credible\" information from Texas law enforcement \"regarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the release\" [152] The film, forbidden to minors under 17 in the US, was feared to possibly encourage imitations of the criminal behaviors represented in the film in ordinary life [153] However, according to Deadline Hollywood, the FBI and the United States Department of Homeland Security found no credible threats surrounding the release of the film [154]\n\n\nHome media\nJoker was released on Digital HD on December 17, 2019, and on

Joker holds an approval rating of 68% based on 603 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10 The site's critical consensus reads, \"Joker gives its infamous central character a chillingly plausible origin story that serves as a brilliant showcase for its star – and a dark evolution for comics-inspired cinema.\" [191] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 60 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [192] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 84% (with an average 4 out of 5 stars) and a 60% \"definite recommend\" [104] The critical response to Joker made it one of the worst-reviewed films to ever be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards [193]\n\n\nIndustry response\nJoker generated positive responses from industry figures DC Comics chief creative officer Jim Lee praised it as \"intense, raw and soulful\" and stated that it had remained true to the character despite deviating from the source material [1] [2] Actor Mark Hamill, who has voiced the Joker in animation and video games since Batman: The Animated Series, thought the film had \"brilliantly\" reinvented the character and gave it \" [two] thumbs up\" [207] Superman (1978) director Richard Donner called the film \"brilliant\", \"fascinating\", \"really well-written\" and stated that Phoenix's performance was \"genius\" [208] Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore called Joker a \"cinematic masterpiece\" and stated it was a \"danger to society\" if people did not see it [209] Actor Josh Brolin found the film powerful: \"To appreciate Joker I believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is\" [210] Actor Vincent D'Onofrio vocally commended Phoenix's performance in the film on Twitter, stating that he \"deserve [d] recognition for this performance\", while actress Jessica Chastain agreed, replying: \"It's one of the greatest pieces of acting I've ever seen\" [211] Actress and screenwriter Phoebe Waller-Bridge also praised the film, stating: \"I think the reason people got so uncomfortable  [with the film] is because it feels too true, too raw I was watching it and thinking to myself, God, if this came out a year into Obama's time in office, I don't think we'd be feeling as worried about it\" [212] Filmmaker David Fincher said of the film's unexpected success, \"Nobody would have thought they had a shot at a giant hit with Joker had The Dark Knight not been as massive as it was I don't think anyone would have looked at that material and thought, 'Yeah, let's take  [Taxi Driver's] Travis Bickle and  [The King of Comedy's] Rupert Pupkin and conflate them, then trap him in a betrayal of the mentally ill and trot it out for a billion dollars'\" [213] Actor Brendan Gleeson felt that Phoenix's performance as the Joker was absolutely \"indelible\" and one of the most magnificent achievements in cinema he has ever seen, incidentally being that the reason he opted to join the film's sequel Joker: Folie à Deux (2024) as Jackie Sullivan [214] Filmmaker Ridley Scott, who had previously worked with Phoenix in Gladiator (2000), felt \"blown away\" by the film; while he disliked the apparent way it celebrated violence, Scott felt that Phoenix's performance was remarkable enough to make Phoenix an \"amazing asset\" for his film Napoleon (2023) in a \"creative and commercial sense\" [215]\n\n\nAccolades\nIn September 2019, Joker was awarded the Golden Lion, the festival's highest prize, at the 76th Venice International Film Festival [216] At the 92nd Academy Awards, the film won the Best Actor (Phoenix) and Best Original Score awards It received overall eleven nominations (including Best Picture) from the ceremony, breaking the record of eight held by The Dark Knight for the most nominations received by a film based on a comic book, comic strip or graphic novel [217] Hildur Guðnadóttir also became the first woman to win an original score Oscar since The Full Monty (1997) in 1998 [218] At the 73rd British Academy Film Awards, the film won Best Actor in a Leading Role (Phoenix), Best Casting and Best Original Music out of a leading eleven

[221] [222]\n\n\nThemes and analysis\nJoker deals with the themes of mental illness and its both psychological and sociological effects [226] While its depiction of the Joker has been described as reminiscent of those who commit mass shootings in the United States as well as members of the incel community, [227] [additional citation(s) needed] Christina Newland of The Guardian concludes that Fleck is not an incel, but wrote that incels are likely to relate to him [228] Vejvoda, Hammond and Newland interpreted the film as a cautionary tale—society's disregard of those who are less fortunate will create a person like the Joker [195] [199] [228] Stephen Kent, writing for the Washington Examiner, described Arthur Fleck as blending shared aspects of mass shooters and interpreted its message as a reminder that society is riddled with men like the Joker [227] Writing in People's World, Chauncey K Robinson said the film \"walks a fine line between exploration and validation\" of Joker's character and is \"ultimately an in-your-face examination of a broken system that creates its own monsters.\" [229]\n\n\nCultural impact\nDuring a Five Star Movement event in October 2019, Italian comedian and politician Beppe Grillo gave a speech wearing the Joker's makeup [243] Yusuke Kawai, a candidate for governor of Chiba Prefecture, appeared on NHK with a Joker costume in 2021 [244] References to the character were also found in anti-government protests worldwide [245] [246] During the 17 October Revolution, a group of graffiti artists called Ashekm painted a mural of the Joker holding a Molotov cocktail and it was also reported that there was a Joker facepaint station at the protests in Beirut [245] In Los Ángeles, Chile, during the 2019–2022 Chilean protests, the phrase \"We are all clowns\", which is adopted by Gotham City protesters in the movie, was written at the foot of a statue [245] [246] In Hong Kong, protesters challenged an emergency decree prohibiting the wearing of masks by wearing those of fictional characters such as the Joker [245] In France, during the Yellow Vest Protests, firefighters donned Joker makeup holding placards [247] In 2020, during the George Floyd protests, Argentine president Alberto Fernández compared the pictures of the protests to those seen in the film [248]\n\n\nSequel\nJoker was intended to be a stand-alone film with no sequels but Warner Bros greenlit a follow-up project [97] [254] Joker: Folie à Deux, with Phoenix and Beetz reprising their roles and Lady Gaga joining as Harley Quinn, was released on October 4, 2024, to negative reviews and a poor commercial performance [255] [256]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

In 1714, the general court and legislative assembly of New Hampshire passed \"An Act to Prevent Disorders in the Night,\" which prohibited African Americans from being in the streets after sundown. This law was one of the first to establish a formal system of racial segregation and exclusion in the United States.\n\nOver time, sundown towns became more widespread, particularly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of these towns were established in the Midwest and the South, where African Americans were forcibly removed from their homes and communities through violence and intimidation. These towns were often created as \"white only\" communities, with laws and ordinances that prohibited African Americans and other people of color from owning property, renting homes, or even entering the town after dark.\n\n**Function**\n\nSundown towns served several functions, both explicitly and implicitly. On the surface, they were designed to maintain racial segregation and exclusion, with the goal of keeping African Americans and other people of color out of white communities. However, these towns also served as a means of social control, allowing white residents to maintain their power and privilege over marginalized communities.\n\nIn addition to maintaining racial segregation, sundown towns also served as a means of economic control. By excluding African Americans and other people of color from owning property or participating in the economy, sundown towns were able to maintain a system of economic inequality that benefited white residents.\n\n**Ethnic Exclusions**\n\nAfrican Americans were not the only minority group excluded from sundown towns. Other groups, including Chinese, Japanese, and Native Americans, were also excluded from these communities. In some cases, these exclusions were based on racial or ethnic stereotypes, while in other cases, they were based on economic or social factors.\n\nOne example of ethnic exclusion in a sundown town is the town of Boise, Idaho, which was home to a large Chinese population in the late 19th century. In 1886, a wave of violence and intimidation forced many Chinese residents to leave the town, and by 1910, almost none remained.\n\n**Travel Guides**\n\nDescribed by former NAACP President Julian Bond as \"one of the survival tools of segregated life,\" The Negro Motorist Green Book was an annual guidebook for African American motorists, published by Victor H Green from 1936 to 1966. The guidebook listed safe places for African Americans to eat, sleep, and seek medical attention, while also providing information on how to avoid danger and harassment.\n\nThe Green Book was an essential resource for African American travelers during the Jim Crow era, when discrimination against non-whites was widespread. It was published in the United States from 1936 to 1966, during a time when sundown towns and other forms of racial segregation were prevalent.\n\n**Sundown Suburbs**\n\nMany suburban areas in the United States were incorporated following the establishment of Jim Crow laws. The majority of suburbs were made up of all-white residents from the time they were first created. These suburbs were often created as \"white only\" communities, with laws and ordinances that prohibited African Americans and other people of color from owning property, renting homes, or even entering the town after dark.\n\nSundown suburbs were created between 1906 and 1968, with the peak of the Civil Rights era in 1970. By this time, some sundown suburbs had already begun to desegregate, although many remained segregated until the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n**List of Sundown Towns**\n\nThe following is a list of known sundown towns in the United States:\n\n* Ada, Oklahoma\n* Arcadia, Oklahoma\n* Bethany, Oklahoma\n* Boise, Idaho\n* Broken Arrow, Oklahoma\n* Chickasha, Oklahoma\n* Claremore, Oklahoma\n* Coweta, Oklahoma\n* Dewey, Oklahoma\n* El Reno, Oklahoma\n* Grove, Oklahoma\n* Guymon, Oklahoma\n* Henryetta, Oklahoma\n* Idabel, Oklahoma\n* Miami, Oklahoma\n* Muskogee, Oklahoma\n* Norman, Oklahoma\n* Nowata, Oklahoma\n* Okemah, Oklahoma\n* Okmulgee, Oklahoma\n* Owasso, Oklahoma\n* Pawhuska, Oklahoma\n* Pawnee, Oklahoma\n* Ponca City, Oklahoma\n* Purcell, Oklahoma\n* Sand Springs, Oklahoma\n* Sapulpa, Oklahoma\n* Sayre, Oklahoma\n* Shawnee, Oklahoma\n* Stillwater, Oklahoma\n* Tahlequah, Oklahoma\n* Tulsa, Oklahoma\n* Vinita, Oklahoma\n* Wagoner, Oklahoma\n* Weleetka, Oklahoma\n* Woodward, Oklahoma\n\n**Sundown Towns in Popular Culture**\n\nSundown towns have been featured in several films and books, including:\n\n* \"The Color Purple\" (1985)\n* \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (1962)\n* \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1940)\n* \"A Raisin in the Sun\" (1959)\n* \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Jim Crow laws\n* Racial segregation\n* Racism\n* African American history\n* Civil Rights Movement\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nFor further reading on sundown towns, see:\n\n* Kenneth T.

{"title": "Benito_Mussolini", "content": "\nEarly life\nMussolini was born on 29 July 1883 in Dovia di Predappio, a small town in the province of Forlì in Romagna During the Fascist era, Predappio was dubbed \"Duce's town\" and Forlì was called \"Duce's city\", with pilgrims going to Predappio and Forlì to see the birthplace of Mussolini.\n\n\nEmigration to Switzerland and military service\nIn July 1902, Mussolini emigrated to Switzerland, partly to avoid compulsory military service [2] [12] He worked briefly as a stonemason but was unable to find a permanent job.\n\n\nPolitical journalist, intellectual and socialist\nIn February 1909, [20] Mussolini again left Italy, this time to take the job as the secretary of the labour party in the Italian-speaking city of Trento, then part of Austria-Hungary He also did office work for the local Socialist Party, and edited its newspaper L'Avvenire del Lavoratore (The Future of the Worker) Returning to Italy, he spent a brief time in Milan, and in 1910 he returned to his hometown of Forlì, where he edited the weekly Lotta di classe (The Class Struggle).\n\n\nExpulsion from the Italian Socialist Party\nWhen World War I began in August 1914, many socialist parties worldwide followed the rising nationalist current and supported their country's intervention in the war [34] [35] In Italy, the outbreak of the war created a surge of Italian nationalism and intervention was supported by a variety of political factions One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was Gabriele d'Annunzio who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention [36] The Italian Liberal Party under the leadership of Paolo Boselli promoted intervention on the side of the Allies and utilised the Società Dante Alighieri to promote Italian nationalism [37] [38] Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war [39] Prior to Mussolini taking a position on the war, a number of revolutionary syndicalists had announced their support of intervention, including Alceste De Ambris, Filippo Corridoni, and Angelo Oliviero Olivetti [40] The Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors had been killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week [41]\n\n\nBeginning of Fascism and service in World War I\nAfter being ousted by the Italian Socialist Party, Mussolini made a radical transformation, ending his support for class conflict and joining in support of revolutionary nationalism transcending class lines [43] He formed the interventionist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia and the Fascio Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista (\"Revolutionary Fasces of International Action\") in October 1914 [38] His nationalist support of intervention enabled him to raise funds from Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create Il Popolo d'Italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war [45] Further funding for Il Popolo during the war came from French sources, beginning in May 1915, in part from French socialists who wanted Italian intervention on France's side [46] Britain, and possibly Russia and the United States, also subsidized the paper [47] [48]\n\n\nRise to power\nBy the time he returned from service in the Allied forces of World War I, Mussolini was convinced that socialism as a doctrine had largely been a failure In early 1918 Mussolini called for the emergence of a man \"ruthless and energetic enough to make a clean sweep\" to revive the Italian nation [59] On 23 March 1919 Mussolini re-formed the Milan fascio as the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento (Italian Combat Squad), consisting of 200 members [60]\n\n\nFormation of the National Fascist Party\nBy the time he returned from service in the Allied forces of World War I, Mussolini was convinced that socialism as a doctrine had largely been a failure In early 1918 Mussolini called for the emergence of a man \"ruthless and energetic enough to make a clean sweep\" to revive the Italian nation [59] On 23 March 1919 Mussolini re-formed the Milan fascio as the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento (Italian Combat Squad), consisting of 200 members [60]\n\n\nMarch on Rome\nIn the night between 27 and 28 October 1922, about 30,000 Fascist blackshirts gathered in Rome to demand the resignation of liberal Prime Minister Luigi Facta and the appointment of a new Fascist government On the morning of 28 October, King Victor Emmanuel III, who according to the Albertine Statute held the supreme military power, refused the government request to declare martial law, which led to Facta's resignation The King then handed over power to Mussolini (who stayed in his headquarters in Milan during the talks) by asking him to form a new government The King's controversial decision has been explained by historians as a combination of delusions and fears; Mussolini enjoyed wide support in the military and among the industrial and agrarian elites, while the King and the conservative establishment were afraid of a possible civil war and thought they could use Mussolini to restore law and order, but failed to foresee the danger of a totalitarian evolution [77]\n\n\nAppointment as Prime Minister\nAs Prime Minister, the first years of Mussolini's rule were characterised by a right-wing coalition government of Fascists, nationalists, liberals, and two Catholic clerics from the People's Party The Fascists made up a small minority in his original governments Mussolini's domestic goal was the eventual establishment of a totalitarian state with himself as supreme leader (Il Duce), a message that was articulated by the Fascist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, which was now edited by Mussolini's brother, Arnaldo To that end, Mussolini obtained from the legislature dictatorial powers for one year (legal under the Italian constitution of the time) He favoured the complete restoration of state authority, with the integration of the Italian Fasces of Combat into the armed forces (the foundation in January 1923 of the Voluntary Militia for National Security) and the progressive identification of the party with the state In political and social economy, he passed legislation that favoured the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes (privatisations, liberalisations of rent laws and dismantlement of the unions) [4]\n\n\nAcerbo Law\nIn June 1923, the government passed the Acerbo Law, which transformed Italy into a single national constituency It also granted a two-thirds majority of the seats in Parliament to the party or group of parties that received at least 25% of the votes [78] This law applied in the elections of 6 April 1924 The national alliance, consisting of Fascists, most of the old Liberals and others, won 64% of the vote.\n\n\nSquadristi violence\nThe assassination of the socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti, who had requested that the elections be annulled because of the irregularities, [79] provoked a momentary crisis in the Mussolini government Mussolini ordered a cover-up, but witnesses saw the car that transported Matteotti's body parked outside Matteotti's residence, which linked Amerigo Dumini to the murder.\n\n\nFascist Italy\nGerman-American historian Konrad Jarausch has argued that Mussolini was responsible for an integrated suite of political innovations that made fascism a powerful force in Europe First, he proved the movement could actually seize power and operate a comprehensive government in a major country Second, the movement claimed to represent the entire national community, not a fragment such as the working class or the aristocracy He made a significant effort to include the previously alienated Catholic element He defined public roles for the main sectors of the business community rather than allowing it to operate backstage Third, he developed a cult of one-man leadership that focused media attention and national debate on his own personality As a former journalist, Mussolini proved highly adept at exploiting all forms of mass media Fourth, he created a mass membership party with groups that could be more readily mobilised and monitored Like all dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition [82]\n\n\nOrganizational innovations\nGerman-American historian Konrad Jarausch has argued that Mussolini was responsible for an integrated suite of political innovations that made fascism a powerful force in Europe First, he proved the movement could actually seize power and operate a comprehensive government in a major country Second, the movement claimed to represent the entire national community, not a fragment such as the working class or the aristocracy He made a significant effort to include the previously alienated Catholic element He defined public roles for the main sectors of

dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition [82]\n\n\nPolice state\nBetween 1925 and 1927, Mussolini progressively dismantled virtually all constitutional and conventional restraints on his power and built a police state A law passed on 24 December 1925—Christmas Eve for the largely Roman Catholic country—changed Mussolini's formal title from \"President of the Council of Ministers\" to \"Head of the Government\", although he was still called \"Prime Minister\" by most non-Italian news sources He was no longer responsible to Parliament and could be removed only by the King While the Italian constitution stated that ministers were responsible only to the sovereign, in practice it had become all but impossible to govern against the express will of Parliament The Christmas Eve law ended this practice, and also made Mussolini the only person competent to determine the body's agenda This law transformed Mussolini's government into a de facto legal dictatorship Local autonomy was abolished, and podestàs appointed by the Italian Senate replaced elected mayors and councils.\n\n\n\"Pacification of Libya\"\n\nIn 1919, the Italian state had brought in a series of liberal reforms in Libya that allowed education in Arabic and Berber and allowed for the possibility that the Libyans might become Italian citizens [93] Giuseppe Volpi, who had been appointed governor in 1921, was retained by Mussolini, and withdrew all of the measures offering equality to the Libyans [93] A policy of confiscating land from the Libyans and granting it to Italian colonists gave new vigor to Libyan resistance led by Omar Mukhtar, and during the ensuing \"Pacification of Libya\", the Fascist regime waged a genocidal campaign designed to kill as many Libyans as possible [94] [93] Well over half the population of Cyrenaica were confined to 15 concentration camps by 1931 while the Royal Italian Air Force staged chemical warfare attacks against the Bedouin [95] On 20 June 1930, Marshal Pietro Badoglio wrote to General Rodolfo Graziani: \n\nEconomic policy\nMussolini launched several public construction programs and government initiatives throughout Italy to combat economic setbacks or unemployment levels His earliest (and one of the best known) was the Battle for Wheat, by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them Littoria and Sabaudia) on land reclaimed by draining the Pontine Marshes In Sardinia, a model agricultural town was founded and named Mussolinia (it has long since been renamed Arborea) This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would be thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production from other more economically viable crops Landowners grew wheat on unsuitable soil using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high tariffs were imposed [98] The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government subsidies given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.\n\n\nRailways\nMussolini was keen to take the credit for major public works in Italy, particularly the railway system [101] His reported overhauling of the railway network led to the popular saying, \"Say what you like about Mussolini, he made the trains run on time.\" [101] Kenneth Roberts, journalist and novelist, wrote in 1924:\n\n\nPropaganda and cult of personality\nMussolini's foremost priority was the subjugation of the minds of the Italian people through the use of propaganda The regime promoted a lavish cult of personality centered on the figure of Mussolini He pretended to incarnate the new fascist Übermensch, promoting an aesthetic of exasperated Machismo that attributed to him quasi-divine capacities [105] At various times after 1922, Mussolini personally took over the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, colonies, corporations, defence, and public works Sometimes he held as many as seven departments simultaneously, as well as the premiership He was also head of the all-powerful Fascist Party and the armed local fascist militia, the MVSN or \"Blackshirts\", who terrorised incipient resistance in the cities and provinces He would later form the OVRA, an institutionalised secret police that carried official state support In this way he succeeded in keeping power in his own hands and preventing the emergence of any rival.\n\n\nCulture\nNationalists in the years after World War I thought of themselves as combating the liberal and domineering institutions created by cabinets—such as those of Giovanni Giolitti, including traditional schooling Futurism, a revolutionary cultural movement which would serve as a catalyst for Fascism, argued for \"a school for physical courage and patriotism\", as expressed by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in 1919 Marinetti expressed his disdain for \"the by now prehistoric and troglodyte Ancient Greek and Latin courses\", arguing for their replacement with exercise modelled on those of the Arditi soldiers It was in those years that the first Fascist youth wings were formed: Avanguardia Giovanile Fascista (Fascist Youth Vanguards) in 1919, and Gruppi Universitari Fascisti (Fascist University Groups) in 1922.\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn foreign policy, Mussolini was pragmatic and opportunistic His vision centered on forging a new Roman Empire in Africa and the Balkans, vindicating the so-called \"mutilated victory\" of 1918 imposed by Britain and France, which betrayed the Treaty of London and denied Italy its \"natural right\" to supremacy in the Mediterranean [111] [112] However, in the 1920s, given Germany's weakness, post-war reconstruction, and reparations issues, Europe's situation was unfavorable for openly revising the Treaty of Versailles Italy's foreign policy focused on maintaining an \"equidistant\" stance from major powers to exercise \"determinant weight,\" using alignment with one power to secure support for Italian ambitions in Europe and Africa [113] Mussolini believed that Italy's population, then at 40 million, was insufficient for a major war, and sought to increase it to at least 60 million through relentless natalist policies, including making advocacy of contraception a criminal offense in 1924 [114] [115]\n\n\nWorld War II\nBy the late 1930s, Mussolini concluded that Britain and France were declining powers, and that Germany and Italy, due to their demographic strength, were destined to rule Europe [129] He believed that the declining birth rates in France were \"absolutely horrifying\" and that the British Empire was doomed because one-quarter of the British population was over 50 [129] Mussolini preferred an alliance with Germany over Britain and France, viewing it as better to be allied with the strong instead of the weak [130] He saw international relations as a Social Darwinian struggle between \"virile\" nations with high birth rates destined to destroy \"effete\" nations with low birth rates Mussolini had no interest in an alliance with France, which he considered a \"weak and old\" nation due to its declining birthrate [131]\n\n\nGathering storm\nBy the late 1930s, Mussolini concluded that Britain and France were declining powers, and that Germany and Italy, due to their demographic strength, were destined to rule Europe [129] He believed that the declining birth rates in France were \"absolutely horrifying\" and that the British Empire was doomed because one-quarter of the British population was over 50 [129] Mussolini preferred an alliance with Germany over Britain and France, viewing it as better to be allied with the strong instead of the weak [130] He saw international relations as a Social Darwinian struggle between \"virile\" nations with high birth rates destined to destroy \"effete\" nations with low birth rates Mussolini had no interest in an alliance with France, which he considered a \"weak and old\" nation due to its declining birthrate [131]\n\n\nWar declared\nAs World War II began, Ciano and Viscount Halifax were holding secret phone conversations The British wanted Italy on their side against Germany as it had been in World War I [142] French government opinion was more geared towards action against Italy, as they were eager to attack Italy in Libya In September 1939, France swung to the opposite extreme, offering to discuss issues with Italy, but as the French were unwilling to discuss Corsica, Nice and Savoy, Mussolini did not answer [142] Mussolini's Under-Secretary for War Production, Carlo Favagrossa, had estimated that Italy could not be prepared for major military operations until 1942 due to its relatively weak industrial sector compared to western Europe [144] In late November 1939, Adolf Hitler declared: \"So long as the Duce lives, one can rest assured that Italy will seize every opportunity to achieve its imperialistic aims.\" [142]\n\n\nPath to defeat\nIn September 1940, the Italian Tenth Army was commanded by General Rodolfo Graziani and crossed from Italian Libya into Egypt, where British forces were located; this would become the Western Desert Campaign Advances were successful, but the Italians stopped at Sidi Barrani waiting for logistic supplies to catch up On 24 October 1940, Mussolini sent the Italian Air Corps to Belgium, where it took part in the Blitz until January 1941 [149] In October, Mussolini also sent Italian forces into Greece, starting the Greco-Italian War The Royal Air Force prevented the Italian invasion and allowed the Greeks to push the Italians back to Albania, but the Greek counter-offensive in Italian Albania ended in a stalemate [150]\n\n\nDismissal and arrest\nBy 1943, Italy's military position had become untenable Axis forces in North Africa were defeated in the Tunisian Campaign in early 1943 Italy suffered major setbacks on the Eastern Front and in the Allied invasion of Sicily [162] The Italian home front was also in bad shape as the Allied bombings were taking their toll Factories all over Italy were brought to a virtual standstill because raw materials were lacking There was a chronic shortage of food, and what food was available was being sold at nearly confiscatory prices Mussolini's once-ubiquitous propaganda machine lost its grip on the people; a large number of Italians turned to Vatican Radio or Radio London for more accurate news coverage Discontent came to a head in March 1943 with a wave of labour strikes in the industrial north—the first large-scale strikes since 1925 [163] Also in March, some of the major factories in Milan and Turin stopped production to secure evacuation allowances for workers' families The German presence in Italy had sharply turned public opinion against Mussolini; when the Allies invaded Sicily, the majority of the public there welcomed them as liberators [164]\n\n\nItalian Social Republic (\"Salò Republic\")\nOnly two months after Mussolini had been dismissed and arrested, he was rescued from his prison at the Hotel Campo Imperatore in the Gran Sasso raid on 12 September 1943 by a special Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) unit and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors; Otto Skorzeny was also present [167] The rescue saved Mussolini from being turned over to the Allies in accordance with the armistice [169] Hitler had made plans to arrest the king, the Crown Prince Umberto, Badoglio, and the rest of the government and restore Mussolini to power in Rome, but the government's escape south likely foiled those plans [165]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 25 April 1945, Allied troops were advancing into northern Italy, and the collapse of the Salò Republic was imminent Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci set out for Switzerland, [175] intending to board a plane and escape to Spain [176] Two days later on 27 April, they were stopped near the village of Dongo (Lake Como) by communist partisans named Valerio and Bellini and identified by the Political Commissar of the partisans' 52nd Garibaldi Brigade, Urbano Lazzaro Petacci's brother posed as a Spanish consul [177]\n\n\nMussolini's corpse\nOn 29 April 1945, the bodies of Mussolini, Petacci, and the other executed fascists were loaded into a van and moved south to Milan At 3:00 a.m., the corpses were dumped on the ground in the old Piazzale Loreto The piazza had been renamed \"Piazza Quindici Martiri\" (Fifteen Martyrs' Square) in honour of fifteen Italian partisans recently executed there [182]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMussolini's first wife was Ida Dalser, whom he married in Trento in 1914 The couple had a son the following year and named him Benito Albino Mussolini In December 1915, Mussolini married Rachele Guidi, who had been his mistress since 1910 Due to his upcoming political ascendency, the information about his first marriage was suppressed, and both his first wife and son were later persecuted [58] With Rachele, Mussolini had two daughters, Edda and Anna Maria, the latter of whom married Nando Pucci Negri in Ravenna on 11 June 1960; and three sons: Vittorio, Bruno and Romano Mussolini had several mistresses, among them Margherita Sarfatti and his final companion, Clara Petacci Mussolini had many brief sexual encounters with female supporters, as reported by his biographer Nicholas Farrell [185]\n\n\nReligious views\nMussolini was raised by a devoutly Catholic mother [187] and an anti-clerical father [188] His mother Rosa had him baptised into the Roman Catholic Church, and took her children to services every Sunday His father never attended [187] Mussolini regarded his time at a religious boarding school as punishment, compared the experience to hell, and \"once refused to go to morning Mass and had to be dragged there by force.\" [189]\n\n\nAtheism and anti-clericalism\nMussolini was raised by a devoutly Catholic mother [187] and an anti-clerical father [188] His mother Rosa had him baptised into the Roman Catholic Church, and took her children to services every Sunday His father never attended [187] Mussolini regarded his time at a religious boarding school as punishment, compared the experience to hell, and \"once refused to go to morning Mass and had to be dragged there by force.\" [189]\n\n\nLateran Treaty\nDespite making such attacks, Mussolini tried to win popular support by appeasing the Catholic majority in Italy In 1924, Mussolini saw to it that three of his children were given communion In 1925, he had a priest perform a religious marriage ceremony for himself and his wife Rachele, whom he had married in a civil ceremony 10 years earlier [194] On 11 February 1929, he signed a concordat and treaty with the Roman Catholic Church [195] Under the Lateran Pact, Vatican City was granted independent statehood and placed under Church law—rather than Italian law—and the Catholic religion was recognised as Italy's state religion [196] The Church also regained authority over marriage, Catholicism could be taught in all secondary schools, birth control and freemasonry were banned, and the clergy received subsidies from the state and was exempted from taxation [197] [198] Pope Pius XI praised Mussolini, and the official Catholic newspaper pronounced \"Italy has been given back to God and God to Italy.\" [196]\n\n\nViews on antisemitism and race\nOver the span of his career, Mussolini's views and policies regarding Jews and antisemitism were often inconsistent, contradictory, and radically shifted depending on the situation Most historians have generally labeled him as a political opportunist when it came to the treatment of the Jews rather than following a sincere belief Mussolini considered Italian Jews to be Italians, but this belief may have been influenced more by his anti-clericalism and the general mood of Italy at the time, which denounced the abusive treatment of the Jews in the Roman Ghetto by the Papal States until the Unification of Italy [207] Although Mussolini had initially disregarded biological racism, he was a firm believer in national traits and made several generalisations about Jews Mussolini blamed the Russian Revolution of 1917 on \"Jewish vengeance\" against Christianity with the remark \"Race does not betray race .. Bolshevism is being defended by the international plutocracy That is the real truth.\" He also made an assertion that 80% of Soviet leaders were Jewish [208] Yet, within a few weeks, he contradicted himself with the remark \"Bolshevism is not, as people believe, a Jewish phenomenon The truth is that Bolshevism is leading to the utter ruin of the Jews of Eastern Europe.\" [209]\n\n\nLegacy\nMussolini was survived by his wife, Rachele Mussolini, two sons, Vittorio and Romano Mussolini, and his daughters Edda (the widow of Count Ciano) and Anna Maria A third son, Bruno, was killed in an air accident while flying a Piaggio P.108 bomber on a test mission, on 7 August 1941.\n\n\nFamily\nMussolini was survived by his wife, Rachele Mussolini, two sons, Vittorio and Romano Mussolini, and his daughters Edda (the widow of Count Ciano) and Anna Maria A third son, Bruno, was killed in an air accident while flying a Piaggio P.108 bomber on a test mission, on 7 August 1941.\n\n\nNeo-fascism\nMussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period [242] [243] [244] [245] [246] Although the National Fascist Party was outlawed by the postwar Constitution of Italy, a number of successor neo-fascist parties emerged to carry on its legacy Historically, the largest neo-fascist party was the Italian Social Movement (Movimento Sociale Italiano), which disbanded in 1995 and was replaced by National Alliance, a conservative party that distanced itself from Fascism (its founder, former foreign minister Gianfranco Fini, declared during an official visit to Israel that Fascism was \"an absolute evil\") [247] National Alliance and a number of neo-fascist parties were merged in 2009 to create the short-lived People of Freedom party led by then Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, which eventually disbanded after the defeat in the 2013 general election In 2012, many former members of National Alliance joined Brothers of Italy, led by current Prime Minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni [248]\n\n\nPublic image\nIn February 2018, a poll conducted by the Demos & Pi research institute found that out of the total 1,014 people interviewed, 19% of voters across the Italian political spectrum had a \"positive or very positive\" opinion of Mussolini, 60% saw him negatively and 21% did not have an opinion [249]\n\n\nWritings\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Benito Mussolini**\n\nBenito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini was an Italian politician who served as the 40th Prime Minister of Italy from 1922 to 1943. He is also known as Il Duce, which translates to \"the leader\" in Italian.\n\n**Early life**\n\nMussolini was born on 29 July 1883 in Dovia di Predappio, a small town in the province of Forlì in Romagna. During the Fascist era, Predappio was dubbed \"Duce's town\" and Forlì was called \"Duce's city\", with pilgrims going to Predappio and Forlì to see the birthplace of Mussolini. Mussolini's father, Alessandro Mussolini, was a blacksmith who was also a strong anti-clerical and a socialist. Mussolini's mother, Rosa Maltoni, was a devoutly Catholic and had him baptized into the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n**Emigration to Switzerland and military service**\n\nIn July 1902, Mussolini emigrated to Switzerland, partly to avoid compulsory military service. He worked briefly as a stonemason but was unable to find a permanent job. In February 1909, Mussolini again left Italy, this time to take the job as the secretary of the labour party in the Italian-speaking city of Trento, then part of Austria-Hungary. He also did office work for the local Socialist Party, and edited its newspaper L'Avvenire del Lavoratore (The Future of the Worker). Returning to Italy, he spent a brief time in Milan, and in 1910 he returned to his hometown of Forlì, where he edited the weekly Lotta di classe (The Class Struggle).\n\n**Expulsion from the Italian Socialist Party**\n\nWhen World War I began in August 1914, many socialist parties worldwide followed the rising nationalist current and supported their country's intervention in the war. In Italy, the outbreak of the war created a surge of Italian nationalism and intervention was supported by a variety of political factions. Mussolini, who had initially opposed Italian intervention, began to support it and was ousted from the Italian Socialist Party. He formed the interventionist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia and the Fascio Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista (\"Revolutionary Fasces of International Action\") in October 1914.\n\n**Beginning of Fascism and service in World War I**\n\nAfter being ousted by the Italian Socialist Party, Mussolini made a radical transformation, ending his support for class conflict and joining in support of revolutionary nationalism transcending class lines. He formed the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento (Italian Combat Squad), consisting of 200 members, and began to advocate for a fascist ideology. Mussolini's nationalist support of intervention enabled him to raise funds from Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create Il Popolo d'Italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.\n\n**Rise to power**\n\nBy the time he returned from service in the Allied forces of World War I, Mussolini was convinced that socialism as a doctrine had largely been a failure. In early 1918 Mussolini called for the emergence of a man \"ruthless and energetic enough to make a clean sweep\" to revive the Italian nation. On 23 March 1919 Mussolini re-formed the Milan fascio as the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento, consisting of 200 members. In the night between 27 and 28 October 1922, about 30,000 Fascist blackshirts gathered in Rome to demand the resignation of liberal Prime Minister Luigi Facta and the appointment of a new Fascist government.\n\n**Appointment as Prime Minister**\n\nAs Prime Minister, the first years of Mussolini's rule were characterized by a right-wing coalition government of Fascists, nationalists, liberals, and two Catholic clerics from the People's Party. Mussolini's domestic goal was the eventual establishment of a totalitarian state with himself as supreme leader (Il Duce). He obtained from the legislature dictatorial powers for one year (legal under the Italian constitution of the time) and favoured the complete restoration of state authority.\n\n**Acerbo Law**\n\nIn June 1923, the government passed the Acerbo Law, which transformed Italy into a single national constituency. The law granted a two-thirds majority of the seats in Parliament to the party or group of parties that received at least 25% of the votes. This law applied in the elections of 6 April 1924.\n\n**Squadristi violence**\n\nThe assassination of the socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti, who had requested that the elections be annulled because of the irregularities, provoked a momentary crisis in the Mussolini government. Mussolini ordered a cover-up, but witnesses saw the car that transported Matteotti's body parked outside Matteotti's residence, which linked Amerigo Dumini to the murder.\n\n**Fascist Italy**\n\nMussolini's foremost priority was the subjugation of the minds of the Italian people through the use of propaganda. The regime promoted a lavish cult of personality centered on the figure of Mussolini. At various times after 1922, Mussolini personally took over the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, colonies, corporations, defence, and public works.\n\n**Culture**\n\nMussolini believed that the liberal and domineering institutions created by cabinets, such as those of Giovanni Giolitti, were to be combated. He also believed in a \"school for physical courage and patriotism\", as expressed by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in 1919. Marinetti argued for the replacement of traditional schooling with exercise modelled on those of the Arditi soldiers.\n\n**Foreign policy**\n\nMussolini was pragmatic and opportunistic in his foreign policy. His vision centered on forging a new Roman Empire in Africa and the Balkans. He believed that Italy's population, then at 40 million, was insufficient for a major war, and sought to increase it to at least 60 million through relentless natalist policies.\n\n**World War II**\n\nMussolini concluded that Britain and France were declining powers, and that Germany and Italy, due to their demographic strength, were destined to rule Europe. He believed that the declining birth rates in France were \"absolutely horrifying\" and that the British Empire was doomed because one-quarter of the British population was over 50.\n\n**Dismissal and arrest**\n\nBy 1943, Italy's military position had become untenable. Axis forces in North Africa were defeated in the Tunisian Campaign, and Italy suffered major setbacks on the Eastern Front and in the Allied invasion of Sicily.

country's intervention in the war [34] [35] In Italy, the outbreak of the war created a surge of Italian nationalism and intervention was supported by a variety of political factions One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was Gabriele d'Annunzio who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention [36] The Italian Liberal Party under the leadership of Paolo Boselli promoted intervention on the side of the Allies and utilised the Società Dante Alighieri to promote Italian nationalism [37] [38] Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war [39] Prior to Mussolini taking a position on the war, a number of revolutionary syndicalists had announced their support of intervention, including Alceste De Ambris, Filippo Corridoni, and Angelo Oliviero Olivetti [40] The Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors had been killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week [41]\n\n\nBeginning of Fascism and service in World War I\nAfter being ousted by the Italian Socialist Party, Mussolini made a radical transformation, ending his support for class conflict and joining in support of revolutionary nationalism transcending class lines [43] He formed the interventionist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia and the Fascio Rivoluzionario d'Azione

companies to create Il Popolo d'Italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war [45] Further funding for Il Popolo during the war came from French sources, beginning in May 1915, in part from French socialists who wanted Italian intervention on France's side [46] Britain, and possibly Russia and the United States, also subsidized the paper [47] [48]\n\n\nRise to power\nBy the

October 1922, about 30,000 Fascist blackshirts gathered in Rome to demand the resignation of liberal Prime Minister Luigi Facta and the appointment of a new Fascist government On the morning of 28 October, King Victor Emmanuel III, who according to the Albertine Statute held the supreme military power, refused the government request to declare martial law, which led to Facta's resignation The King then handed over power to Mussolini (who stayed in his headquarters in Milan during the talks) by asking him to form a new government The King's controversial decision has been explained by historians as a combination of delusions and fears; Mussolini enjoyed wide support in the military and among the industrial and agrarian elites, while the King and the conservative establishment were afraid of a possible civil war and thought they could use Mussolini to restore law and order, but failed to foresee the danger of a totalitarian evolution [77]\n\n\nAppointment as Prime Minister\nAs Prime Minister, the first years of Mussolini's rule were characterised by a right-wing coalition government of Fascists, nationalists, liberals, and two Catholic clerics from the People's Party The Fascists made up a small minority in his original governments Mussolini's domestic goal was the eventual establishment of a totalitarian state with himself as supreme leader (Il Duce), a message that was articulated by the Fascist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, which was now edited by Mussolini's brother, Arnaldo To that end, Mussolini obtained from the legislature dictatorial powers for one year (legal under the Italian constitution of the time) He favoured the complete restoration of state authority, with the integration of the Italian Fasces of Combat into the armed forces (the foundation in January 1923 of the Voluntary Militia for National Security) and the progressive identification of the party with the state In political and social economy, he passed legislation that favoured the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes (privatisations, liberalisations of rent laws and dismantlement of the unions) [4]\n\n\nAcerbo Law\nIn June 1923, the government passed the Acerbo Law, which transformed Italy into a single national constituency It also granted a two-thirds majority of the seats in Parliament to the party or group of parties that received at least 25% of the votes [78]

ordered a cover-up, but witnesses saw the car that transported Matteotti's body parked outside Matteotti's residence, which linked Amerigo Dumini to the murder.\n\n\nFascist Italy\nGerman-American historian Konrad Jarausch has argued that Mussolini was responsible for an integrated suite of political innovations that made fascism a powerful force in Europe First, he proved the movement could actually seize power and operate a comprehensive government in a major country Second, the movement claimed to represent the entire national community, not a fragment such as the working class or the aristocracy He made a significant effort to include the previously alienated Catholic element He defined public roles for the main sectors of the business community rather than allowing it to operate backstage Third, he developed a cult of one-man leadership that focused media attention and national debate on his own personality As a former journalist, Mussolini proved highly adept at exploiting all forms of mass media Fourth, he created a mass membership party with groups that could be more readily mobilised and monitored Like all dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition [82]\n\n\nOrganizational innovations\nGerman-American historian Konrad Jarausch has argued that Mussolini was

include the previously alienated Catholic element He defined public roles for the main sectors of the business community rather than allowing it to operate backstage Third, he developed a cult of one-man leadership that focused media attention and national debate on his own personality As a former journalist, Mussolini proved highly adept at exploiting all forms of mass media Fourth, he created a mass membership party with groups that could be more readily mobilised and monitored Like all dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition [82]\n\n\nPolice state\nBetween 1925 and 1927, Mussolini progressively dismantled virtually all constitutional and conventional restraints on his power and built a police state A law passed on 24 December 1925—Christmas Eve for the largely Roman Catholic country—changed Mussolini's formal title from \"President of the Council of Ministers\" to \"Head of the Government\", although he was still called \"Prime Minister\" by most non-Italian news sources He was no longer responsible to Parliament and could be removed only by the King While the Italian constitution stated that ministers were responsible only to the sovereign, in practice it had become all but impossible to govern against the express will of Parliament The Christmas Eve law ended this practice, and also made Mussolini the only person competent to determine the body's agenda This law transformed Mussolini's government into a de facto legal dictatorship Local autonomy was abolished, and podestàs appointed by the Italian Senate replaced elected mayors and councils.\n\n\n\"Pacification of Libya\"\n\nIn 1919, the Italian state had brought in a series of liberal reforms in Libya that allowed education in Arabic and Berber and allowed for the possibility that the Libyans might become Italian citizens [93] Giuseppe Volpi, who had been appointed governor in 1921, was retained by Mussolini, and withdrew all of the measures offering equality to the Libyans [93] A policy of confiscating land from the Libyans and granting it to Italian colonists gave new vigor to Libyan resistance led by Omar Mukhtar, and during the ensuing \"Pacification of Libya\", the Fascist regime waged a genocidal campaign designed to kill as many Libyans as possible [94] [93] Well over half the population of Cyrenaica were confined to 15 concentration camps by 1931 while the Royal Italian Air Force staged chemical warfare attacks against the Bedouin [95] On 20 June 1930, Marshal Pietro Badoglio wrote to General Rodolfo Graziani: \n\nEconomic policy\nMussolini launched several public construction programs and government initiatives throughout Italy to combat economic setbacks or unemployment levels His earliest (and one of the best known) was the Battle for Wheat, by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them Littoria and Sabaudia) on land reclaimed by draining the Pontine Marshes In Sardinia, a model agricultural town was founded and named Mussolinia (it has long since been renamed Arborea) This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would be thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production from other more economically viable crops Landowners grew wheat on unsuitable soil using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high tariffs were imposed [98] The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government subsidies given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.\n\n\nRailways\nMussolini was keen to take the credit for major public works in Italy, particularly the railway system [101] His reported overhauling of the railway network led to the popular saying, \"Say what you like about Mussolini, he made the trains run on time.\" [101] Kenneth Roberts, journalist and novelist, wrote in 1924:\n\n\nPropaganda and cult of personality\nMussolini's foremost priority was the subjugation of the minds of the Italian people through the use of propaganda The regime promoted a lavish cult of personality centered on the figure of Mussolini He pretended to incarnate the new fascist Übermensch, promoting an aesthetic of exasperated Machismo that attributed to him quasi-divine capacities [105] At various times after 1922, Mussolini personally took over the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, colonies, corporations, defence, and public works Sometimes he held as many as seven departments simultaneously, as well as the premiership He was also head of the all-powerful Fascist Party and the armed local fascist militia, the MVSN or \"Blackshirts\", who terrorised incipient resistance in the cities and provinces He would later form the OVRA, an institutionalised secret police that carried official state support In this way he succeeded in keeping power in his own hands and preventing the emergence of any rival.\n\n\nCulture\nNationalists in the years after World War I thought of themselves as combating the liberal and domineering institutions created by cabinets—such as those of Giovanni Giolitti, including traditional schooling Futurism, a revolutionary cultural movement which would serve as a catalyst for Fascism, argued for \"a school for physical courage and patriotism\", as expressed by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in 1919 Marinetti expressed his disdain for \"the by now prehistoric and troglodyte Ancient Greek and Latin courses\", arguing for their replacement with exercise modelled on those of the Arditi soldiers It was in those years that the first Fascist youth wings were formed: Avanguardia Giovanile Fascista (Fascist Youth Vanguards) in 1919, and Gruppi Universitari Fascisti (Fascist University Groups) in 1922.\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn foreign policy, Mussolini was pragmatic and opportunistic His vision centered on forging a new Roman Empire in Africa and the Balkans, vindicating the so-called \"mutilated victory\" of 1918 imposed by Britain and France, which betrayed the Treaty of London and denied Italy its \"natural right\" to supremacy in the Mediterranean [111] [112] However, in the 1920s, given Germany's weakness, post-war reconstruction, and reparations issues, Europe's situation was unfavorable for openly revising the Treaty of Versailles Italy's foreign policy focused on maintaining an \"equidistant\" stance from major powers to exercise \"determinant weight,\" using alignment with one power to secure support for Italian ambitions in Europe and Africa [113] Mussolini believed that Italy's population, then at 40 million, was insufficient for a major war, and sought to increase it to at least 60 million through relentless natalist policies, including making advocacy of contraception a criminal offense in 1924 [114] [115]\n\n\nWorld War II\nBy the late 1930s, Mussolini concluded that Britain and France were declining powers, and that Germany and Italy, due to their demographic strength, were destined to rule Europe [129] He believed that the declining birth rates in France were \"absolutely horrifying\" and that the British Empire was doomed because one-quarter of the British population was over 50 [129] Mussolini preferred an alliance with Germany over Britain and France, viewing it as better to be allied with the strong instead of the weak [130] He saw international relations as a Social Darwinian struggle between \"virile\" nations with high birth rates destined to destroy \"effete\" nations with low birth rates Mussolini had no interest in an alliance with France, which he considered a \"weak and old\" nation due to its declining birthrate [131]\n\n\nGathering storm\nBy the late 1930s, Mussolini concluded that Britain and France were declining powers, and that Germany and Italy, due to their demographic strength, were destined to rule Europe [129] He believed that the declining birth rates in France were \"absolutely horrifying\" and that the British Empire was doomed because one-quarter of the British population was over 50 [129] Mussolini preferred an alliance with Germany over Britain and France, viewing it as better to be allied with the strong instead of the weak [130] He saw international relations as a Social Darwinian struggle between \"virile\" nations with high birth rates destined to destroy \"effete\" nations with low birth rates Mussolini had no interest in an alliance with France, which he considered a \"weak and old\" nation due to its declining birthrate [131]\n\n\nWar declared\nAs World War II began, Ciano and Viscount Halifax were holding secret phone conversations The British wanted Italy on their side against Germany as it had been in World War I [142] French government opinion was more geared towards action against Italy, as they were eager to attack Italy in Libya In September 1939, France swung to the opposite extreme, offering to discuss issues with Italy, but as the French were unwilling to discuss Corsica, Nice and Savoy, Mussolini did not answer [142] Mussolini's Under-Secretary for War Production, Carlo Favagrossa, had estimated that Italy could not be prepared for major military operations until 1942 due to its relatively weak industrial sector compared to western Europe [144] In late November 1939, Adolf Hitler declared: \"So long as the Duce lives, one can rest assured that Italy will seize every opportunity to achieve its imperialistic aims.\" [142]\n\n\nPath to defeat\nIn September 1940, the Italian Tenth Army was commanded by General Rodolfo Graziani and crossed from Italian Libya into Egypt, where British forces were located; this would become the Western Desert Campaign Advances were successful, but the Italians stopped at Sidi Barrani waiting for logistic supplies to catch up On 24 October 1940, Mussolini sent the Italian Air Corps to Belgium, where it took part in the Blitz until January 1941 [149] In October, Mussolini also sent Italian forces into Greece, starting the Greco-Italian War The Royal Air Force prevented the Italian invasion and allowed the Greeks to push the Italians back to Albania, but the Greek counter-offensive in Italian Albania ended in a stalemate [150]\n\n\nDismissal and arrest\nBy 1943, Italy's military position had become untenable Axis forces in North Africa were defeated in the Tunisian Campaign in early 1943 Italy suffered major setbacks on the Eastern Front and in the Allied invasion of Sicily [162] The Italian home front was also in bad shape as the Allied bombings were taking their toll Factories all over Italy were brought to a virtual standstill because raw materials were lacking There was a chronic shortage of food, and what food was available was being sold at nearly confiscatory prices Mussolini's once-ubiquitous propaganda machine lost its grip on the people; a large number of Italians turned to Vatican Radio or Radio London for more accurate news coverage Discontent came to a head in March 1943 with a wave of labour strikes in the industrial north—the first large-scale strikes since 1925 [163] Also in March, some of the major factories in Milan and Turin stopped production to secure evacuation allowances for workers' families The German presence in Italy had sharply turned public opinion against Mussolini; when the Allies invaded Sicily, the majority of the public there welcomed them as liberators [164]\n\n\nItalian Social Republic (\"Salò Republic\")\nOnly two months after Mussolini had been dismissed and arrested, he was rescued from his prison at the Hotel Campo Imperatore in the Gran Sasso raid on 12 September 1943 by a special Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) unit and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors; Otto Skorzeny was also present [167] The rescue saved Mussolini from being turned over to the Allies in accordance with the armistice [169] Hitler had made plans to arrest the king, the Crown Prince Umberto, Badoglio, and the rest of the government and restore Mussolini to power in Rome, but the government's escape south likely foiled those plans [165]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 25 April 1945, Allied troops were advancing into northern Italy, and the collapse of the Salò Republic was imminent Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci set out for Switzerland, [175] intending to board a plane and escape to Spain [176] Two days later on 27 April, they were stopped near the village of Dongo (Lake Como) by communist partisans named Valerio and Bellini and identified by the Political Commissar of the partisans' 52nd Garibaldi Brigade, Urbano Lazzaro Petacci's brother posed as a Spanish consul [177]\n\n\nMussolini's corpse\nOn 29 April 1945, the bodies of Mussolini, Petacci, and the other executed fascists were loaded into a van and moved south to Milan At 3:00 a.m., the corpses were dumped on the ground in the old Piazzale Loreto The piazza had been renamed \"Piazza Quindici Martiri\" (Fifteen Martyrs' Square) in honour of fifteen Italian partisans recently executed there [182]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMussolini's first wife was Ida Dalser, whom he married in Trento in 1914 The couple had a son the following year and named him Benito Albino Mussolini In December 1915, Mussolini married Rachele Guidi, who had been his mistress since 1910 Due to his upcoming political ascendency, the information about his first marriage was suppressed, and both his first wife and son were later persecuted [58] With Rachele, Mussolini had two daughters, Edda and Anna Maria, the latter of whom married Nando Pucci Negri in Ravenna on 11 June 1960; and three sons: Vittorio, Bruno and Romano Mussolini had several mistresses, among them Margherita Sarfatti and his final companion, Clara Petacci Mussolini had many brief sexual encounters with female supporters, as reported by his biographer Nicholas Farrell [185]\n\n\nReligious views\nMussolini was raised by a devoutly Catholic mother [187] and an anti-clerical father [188] His mother Rosa had him baptised into the Roman Catholic Church, and took her children to services every Sunday His father never attended [187] Mussolini regarded his time at a religious boarding school as punishment, compared the experience to hell, and \"once refused to go to morning Mass and had to be dragged there by force.\" [189]\n\n\nAtheism and anti-clericalism\nMussolini was raised by a devoutly Catholic mother [187] and an anti-clerical father [188] His mother Rosa had him baptised into the Roman Catholic Church, and took her children to services every Sunday His father never attended [187] Mussolini regarded his time at a religious boarding school as punishment, compared the experience to hell, and \"once refused to go to morning Mass and had to be dragged there by force.\" [189]\n\n\nLateran Treaty\nDespite making such attacks, Mussolini tried to win popular support by appeasing the Catholic majority in Italy In 1924, Mussolini saw to it that three of his children were given communion In 1925, he had a priest perform a religious marriage ceremony for himself and his wife Rachele, whom he had married in a civil ceremony 10 years earlier [194] On 11 February 1929, he signed a concordat and treaty with the Roman Catholic Church [195] Under the Lateran Pact, Vatican City was granted independent statehood and placed under Church law—rather than Italian law—and the Catholic religion was recognised as Italy's state religion [196] The Church also regained authority over marriage, Catholicism could be taught in all secondary schools, birth control and freemasonry were banned, and the clergy received subsidies from the state and was exempted from taxation [197] [198] Pope Pius XI praised Mussolini, and the official Catholic newspaper pronounced \"Italy has been given back to God and God to Italy.\" [196]\n\n\nViews on antisemitism and race\nOver the span of his career, Mussolini's views and policies regarding Jews and antisemitism were often inconsistent, contradictory, and radically shifted depending on the situation Most historians have generally labeled him as a political opportunist when it came to the treatment of the Jews rather than following a sincere belief Mussolini considered Italian Jews to be Italians, but this belief may have been influenced more by his anti-clericalism and the general mood of Italy at the time, which denounced the abusive treatment of the Jews in the Roman Ghetto by the Papal States until the Unification of Italy [207] Although Mussolini had initially disregarded biological racism, he was a firm believer in national traits and made several generalisations about Jews Mussolini blamed the Russian Revolution of 1917 on \"Jewish vengeance\" against Christianity with the remark \"Race does not betray race .. Bolshevism is being defended by the international plutocracy That is the real truth.\" He also made an assertion that 80% of Soviet leaders were Jewish [208] Yet, within a few weeks, he contradicted himself with the remark \"Bolshevism is not, as people believe, a Jewish phenomenon The truth is that Bolshevism is leading to the utter ruin of the Jews of Eastern Europe.\" [209]\n\n\nLegacy\nMussolini was survived by his wife, Rachele Mussolini, two sons, Vittorio and Romano Mussolini, and his daughters Edda (the widow of Count Ciano) and Anna Maria A third son, Bruno, was killed in an air accident while flying a Piaggio P.108 bomber on a test mission, on 7 August 1941.\n\n\nFamily\nMussolini was survived by his wife, Rachele Mussolini, two sons, Vittorio and Romano Mussolini, and his daughters Edda (the widow of Count Ciano) and Anna Maria A third son, Bruno, was killed in an air accident while flying a Piaggio P.108 bomber on a test mission, on 7 August 1941.\n\n\nNeo-fascism\nMussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period [242] [243] [244] [245] [246] Although the National Fascist Party was outlawed by the postwar Constitution of Italy, a number of successor neo-fascist parties emerged to carry on its legacy Historically, the largest neo-fascist party was the Italian Social Movement (Movimento Sociale Italiano), which disbanded in 1995 and was replaced by National Alliance, a conservative party that distanced itself from Fascism (its founder, former foreign minister Gianfranco Fini, declared during an official visit to Israel that Fascism was \"an absolute evil\") [247] National Alliance and a number of neo-fascist parties were merged in 2009 to create the short-lived People of Freedom party led by then Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, which eventually disbanded after the defeat in the 2013 general election In 2012, many former members of National Alliance joined Brothers of Italy, led by current Prime Minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni [248]\n\n\nPublic image\nIn February 2018, a poll conducted by the Demos & Pi research institute found that out of the total 1,014 people interviewed, 19% of voters across the Italian political spectrum had a \"positive or very positive\" opinion of Mussolini, 60% saw him negatively and 21% did not have an opinion [249]\n\n\nWritings\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

for a vote [162] [163]\n\n\nFederal indictment\nOn November 12, 2023, The New York Times reported that Adams' investigation by the FBI was related in part to an alleged influence by the Turkish

products, processed sugar, salt, oil, and processed starches He also began exercising regularly, using an exercise bike and treadmill in his office Within six months, he lost 30 lb (14 kg), reversed his diabetes, and reduced his blood pressure and cholesterol levels [196] He has said that he wants to encourage others to switch to a healthier diet, and that some of the public health spending for diabetes should go toward lifestyle changes rather than treating disease [197] In February 2022, after several accounts surfaced of Adams eating fish in public, questions emerged about whether Adams was truly a vegan He responded that while he follows a plant-based diet, \"I am perfectly imperfect and have occasionally eaten fish.\" [198]\n\n\nSexual assault lawsuit\nOn November 22, 2023, a

{"title": "Scarlet_fever", "content": "\nSigns and symptoms\nScarlet fever typically presents with a sudden onset of sore throat, fever, and malaise Headache, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain may also be present [11] Scarlet fever usually follows from a group A streptococcal infection that involves a strep throat such as streptococcal tonsillitis or more usually streptococcal pharyngitis Often these can present together known as pharyngotonsillitis The signs and symptoms are therefore those of a strep throat but these are followed by the inclusion of the characteristic widespread rash [12] The rash usually appears one to two days later but may appear before or up to seven days following feeling ill [1]\n\n\nMouth and throat\nStrep throat is usually associated with fatigue and a fever of over 39 °C (102.2 °F) [13] The tonsils may appear red and enlarged and are typically covered in exudate [12] The throat may be red with small red spots on the roof of the mouth [4] The uvula can look red and swollen [5] 30% to 60% of cases have associated enlarged and tender lymph nodes in the neck [5] During the first two days of illness the tongue may have a whitish coating from which red swollen papillae protrude, giving the appearance of a \"white strawberry tongue\" [5] After four to five days when the white coating sheds it becomes a \"red strawberry tongue\" [5] The symptomatic appearance of the tongue is part of the rash that is characteristic of scarlet fever [14] [15] [16]\n\n\nRash\nThe characteristic rash has been denoted as \"scarlatiniform\", and it appears as a diffuse redness of the skin with small bumps resembling goose bumps [17] It typically appears as small flat spots on the neck or torso before developing into small bumps that spread to the arms and legs [18] It tends to feel rough like sandpaper [19] The cheeks might look flushed with a pale area around the mouth [1] The scarlet fever rash generally looks red on white and pale skin, and might be difficult to visualise on brown or black skin, in whom the bumps are typically larger, the skin less like sandpaper, and the perioral pallor less obvious [5] The palms and soles are spared [18] The reddened skin blanches when pressure is applied to it [5] The skin may feel itchy, but is not painful [5] A more intense redness on the inside of skin folds and creases might be noticed [4] These are lines of petechiae, appearing as pink/red areas located in arm pits and elbow pits [18] It takes around a week for the main rash to disappear [1] This may be followed by several weeks of peeling of the skin of typically fingers and toes [1] The desquamation process usually begins on the face and progresses downward on the body [5] Sometimes, this peeling is the only sign that scarlet fever occurred [12] If the case of scarlet fever is uncomplicated, recovery from the fever and clinical symptoms, other than the process of desquamation, occurs in 5–10 days [20] After the desquamation, the skin will be left with a sunburned appearance [21]\n\n\nVariable presentations\nChildren younger than five years old may have atypical presentations Children younger than 3 years old can present with nasal congestion and a lower grade fever [22] Infants may present with symptoms of increased irritability and decreased appetite [22]\n\n\nComplications\nThe complications, which can arise from scarlet fever when left untreated or inadequately treated, can be divided into two categories: suppurative and nonsuppurative [4]\n\n\nCause\nStrep throat spreads by close contact among people, via respiratory droplets (for example, saliva or nasal discharge) [21] A person in close contact with another person infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis has a 35% chance of becoming infected [22] One in ten children who are infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis will develop scarlet fever [16]\n\n\nPathophysiology\nThe rash of scarlet fever, which is what differentiates this disease from an isolated group A strep pharyngitis (or strep throat), is caused by specific strains of group A streptococcus that produce a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, [21] which is mainly responsible for the skin manifestation of the infection [25] These toxin-producing strains cause scarlet fever in people who do not already have antitoxin antibodies Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins – SPEs A, B, C and F have been identified The pyrogenic exotoxins, also called erythrogenic toxins, cause the erythematous rash of scarlet fever [26] [21] The strains of group A streptococcus that cause scarlet fever need specific bacteriophages for there to be pyrogenic exotoxin production Specifically, bacteriophage T12 is responsible for the production of speA [27] Streptococcal Pyrogenic Exotoxin A, speA, is the one most commonly associated with cases of scarlet fever that are complicated by the immune-mediated sequelae of acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [15]\n\n\nMicrobiology\nThe disease is caused by secretion of pyrogenic exotoxins by the infecting Streptococcus bacteria [28] [29] Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (speA) is probably the best studied of these toxins It is carried by the bacteriophage T12 which integrates into the streptococcal genome from where the toxin is transcribed The phage itself integrates into a serine tRNA gene on the chromosome [30]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nAlthough the presentation of scarlet fever can be clinically diagnosed, further testing may be required to distinguish it from other illnesses [5] Also, history of a recent exposure to someone with strep throat can be useful in diagnosis [21] There are two methods used to confirm suspicion of scarlet fever; rapid antigen detection test and throat culture [22]\n\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nScarlet fever might appear similar to Kawasaki disease, which has a characteristic red but not white strawberry tongue, and staphylococcal scarlatina which does not have the strawberry tongue at all [12] Other conditions that might appear similar include impetigo, erysipelas, measles, chickenpox, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and may be distinguished by the pattern of symptoms [4]\n\n\nPrevention\nOne method is long-term use of antibiotics to prevent future group A streptococcal infections This method is only indicated for people who have had complications like recurrent attacks of acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease Antibiotics are limited in their ability to prevent these infections since there are a variety of subtypes of group A streptococci that can cause the infection [21]\n\n\nTreatment\nAntibiotics to combat the streptococcal infection are the mainstay of treatment for scarlet fever Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics decreases the length of illness Peeling of the outer layer of skin, however, will happen despite treatment [5] One of the main goals of treatment is to prevent the child from developing one of the suppurative or nonsuppurative complications, especially acute rheumatic fever [22] As long as antibiotics are started within nine days, it is very unlikely for the child to develop acute rheumatic fever [21] Antibiotic therapy has not been shown to prevent the development of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [5] Another important reason for prompt treatment with antibiotics is the ability to prevent transmission of the infection between children An infected individual is most likely to pass on the infection to another person during the first two weeks [24] A child is no longer contagious (able to pass the infection to another child) after 24 hours of antibiotics [21]\n\n\nAntibiotic resistance and resurgence\nA drug-resistant strain of scarlet fever, resistant to macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, but retaining drug-sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, emerged in Hong Kong in 2011, accounting for at least two deaths in that city—the first such in over a decade [44] About 60% of circulating strains of the group A streptococcus that cause scarlet fever in Hong Kong are resistant to macrolide antibiotics, according to Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, head of Hong Kong University's microbiology department Previously, observed resistance rates had been 10–30%; the increase is likely the result of overuse of macrolide antibiotics in recent years [citation needed]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nScarlet fever occurs equally in both males and females [16] Children are most commonly infected, typically between 5–15 years old Although streptococcal infections can happen at any time of year, infection rates peak in the winter and spring months, typically in colder climates [21]\n\n\nHistory\nIt is unclear when a description of this disease was first recorded [54] Hippocrates, writing around 400 BC, described the condition of a person with a reddened skin and fever [55]\n\n\nThe Dick test\nThe Dick test, developed in 1924 by George F Dick and Gladys Dick, was used to identify those susceptible to scarlet fever [69] The Dick test involved injecting a diluted strain of the streptococci known to cause scarlet fever; a reaction in the skin at the injection site identified people susceptible to developing scarlet fever The reaction could be seen four hours after the injection, but was more noticeable after 24 hours If no reaction was seen in the skin, then the person was assumed not to be at risk from the disease, having developed immunity to it [70]\n\n\nReferences\n\n", "lang": "en",

It is a highly contagious disease that can spread easily among people, especially children. Scarlet fever is often associated with strep throat, but the rash is what distinguishes it from an isolated group A strep pharyngitis.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nScarlet fever is a preventable disease that has been documented for centuries. The disease is caused by a specific strain of group A Streptococcus that produces pyrogenic exotoxins. The symptoms of scarlet fever include a rash, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. The disease is highly contagious and can spread easily among people, especially children. With proper treatment and prevention, the risk of complications and long-term effects can be minimized.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nScarlet fever typically presents with a sudden onset of sore throat, fever, and malaise. Headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may also be present. The rash usually appears one to two days later but may appear before or up to seven days following feeling ill. The rash typically starts on the neck and torso before spreading to the arms and legs.\n\n**Mouth and Throat**\n\nStrep throat is usually associated with fatigue and a fever of over 39°C (102.2°F). The tonsils may appear red and enlarged and are typically covered in exudate. The throat may be red with small red spots on the roof of the mouth. The uvula can look red and swollen. 30% to 60% of cases have associated enlarged and tender lymph nodes in the neck.\n\n**Rash**\n\nThe characteristic rash has been denoted as \"scarlatiniform\" and appears as a diffuse redness of the skin with small bumps resembling goose bumps.

Suppurative complications include rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Nonsuppurative complications include scarlet fever syndrome, which is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition.\n\n**Cause**\n\nStrep throat spreads by close contact among people, via respiratory droplets (for example, saliva or nasal discharge).

She was born on 13 June 1992 in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. She comes from a Hindu Kumaoni Rajput background.\n\n**Early Life and Family**\n\nDisha Patani was born on 13 June 1992 in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. Her father, Jagadish Singh Patani, is a police officer, and her mother is a health inspector. She has an elder sister, Khushboo Patani, who is a lieutenant in the Indian Army, and a younger brother, Suryansh Patani. Patani left her studies in the second year of engineering at Amity University, Lucknow.\n\nPatani's early life and family background have had a significant impact on her career. Growing up in a traditional Rajput family, she was exposed to the values of discipline and hard work from a young age. Her father's profession as a police officer instilled in her a sense of responsibility and duty. Her mother's role as a health inspector taught her the importance of caring for others. These values have shaped her into a dedicated and hardworking individual.\n\n**Career**\n\nPatani made her acting debut with a Telugu film, Loafer, alongside Varun Tej in 2015. She played the role of Mouni, a girl who runs from home to escape a forced marriage. Directed by Puri Jagannadh and produced by C Kalyan under C.K Entertainment, the film was made on a budget of ₹200 million and performed poorly at the box office with a lifetime collection of ₹106 million.\n\nIn the following year, Patani appeared in a music video, Befikra, along with Tiger Shroff. The music video was produced by Bhushan Kumar and Krishan Kumar under T-Series and composed by Meet Bros. Written and directed by Meet Bros, the singer, Aditi Singh Sharma, lent her voice.\n\n**Early Work (2015–2020)**\n\nPatani's early work in the film industry was marked by her appearances in Telugu films and music videos. Her debut film, Loafer, was a commercial failure, but it did not deter her from pursuing her acting career. She continued to work in the film industry, taking on roles in various music videos and films.\n\nIn 2016, Patani appeared in the film, Rustom, alongside Akshay Kumar. Although the film was a commercial success, Patani's role was relatively minor. Despite this, she continued to work in the film industry, taking on roles in various projects.\n\n**Career Downturn and Large Scale Projects (2021–present)**\n\nIn 2021, Patani reunited with Salman Khan as the leading lady in Prabhu Deva's Radhe. The film was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was released coinciding with Eid al-Fitr as a premium video on demand on Zee Plex through ZEE5. Although the film had strong viewership on OTT, it received highly negative reviews from critics and audiences alike, who criticized the story, screenplay, direction, and VFX. Patani also received backlash for her unimportant character.\n\nIn 2022, Patani played a retail salesgirl in Mohit Suri's psychological thriller Ek Villain Returns alongside John Abraham, Tara Sutaria, and Arjun Kapoor. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics but was a box office debacle. Sukanya Vema of Rediff wrote, \"Ek Villain Returns falls back on the popularity of the Galliyan track to boost its appeal.\"\n\n**Other Work and Public Image**\n\nPatani was placed fifth in the list of most searched celebrities on Google in 2016. She is one of the most followed celebrities on social media, with over 57.5 million Instagram followers. In 2019, Patani appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list, ranking 43rd with an estimated annual income of ₹58.0 million (US$690,000).\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **Films**\n\t+ Loafer (2015)\n\t+ Rustom (2016)\n\t+ Baaghi 2 (2018)\n\t+ Bharat (2019)\n\t+ Radhe (2021)\n\t+ Ek Villain Returns (2022)\n* **Music Videos**\n\t+ Befikra (2016)\n\t+ Ghazab Ka Hai Din (2017)\n\t+ Kala Chashma (2017)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* **Filmfare Awards**\n\t+ Best Female Debut (Telugu) for Loafer (2016)\n* **Zee Cine Awards**\n\t+ Best Female Debut (Telugu) for Loafer (2016)\n* **Star Guild Awards**\n\t+ Best Female Debut (Telugu) for Loafer (2016)\n\nNote: The awards and nominations listed above are not exhaustive and are based on the information available at the time of writing.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Disha_Patani\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and family\nDisha Patani was born on 13 June 1992 in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India [3] She is from a Hindu Kumaoni Rajput background [4] [5] Her father, Jagadish Singh Patani is a police officer and her mother is a health inspector Her elder sister, Khushboo Patani is a lieutenant in the Indian Army [6] She also has a younger brother, Suryansh Patani [7] She left in 2nd year of engineering at Amity University, Lucknow [8]  She was the first runner up of Pond's Femina Miss India Indore 2013 [9]\n\n\nCareer\nPatani debuted with a Telugu film, Loafer alongside Varun Tej in 2015 She played the role of Mouni, a girl who runs from home to escape a forced marriage Directed by Puri Jagannadh and produced by C Kalyan under C.K Entertainment, the film was made on a budget of ₹200 million and performed poorly at the box office with a lifetime collection of ₹106 million In the following year, Disha appeared in a music video, Befikra along with Tiger Shroff which was produced by Bhushan Kumar and Krishan Kumar under T-Series and composed by Meet Bros Written and directed by Meet Bros, the singer, Aditi Singh Sharma lent her voice [10]\n\n\nEarly work (2015–2020)\nPatani debuted with a Telugu film, Loafer alongside Varun Tej in 2015 She played the role of Mouni, a girl who runs from home to escape a forced marriage Directed by Puri Jagannadh and produced by C Kalyan under C.K Entertainment, the film was made on a budget of ₹200 million and performed poorly at the box office with a lifetime collection of ₹106 million In the following year, Disha appeared in a music video, Befikra along with Tiger Shroff which was produced by Bhushan Kumar and Krishan Kumar under T-Series and composed by Meet Bros Written and directed by Meet Bros, the singer, Aditi Singh Sharma lent her voice [10]\n\n\nCareer downturn and large scale projects (2021–present)\nIn 2021, Patani reunited with Salman Khan as the leading lady in Prabhu Deva's Radhe, which was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic [25] The film was released coinciding with Eid al-Fitr, as premium video on demand on Zee Plex through ZEE5 Although the film had strong viewership on OTT, it received highly negative reviews from critics and audiences alike, who criticised the story, screenplay, direction and VFX and even she received backlash for her unimportant character [26] In 2022, Patani played a retail salesgirl in Mohit Suri's psychological thriller Ek Villain Returns alongside John Abraham, Tara Sutaria and Arjun Kapoor [27] The film opened to mixed reviews from critics but was a box office debacle [28] Sukanya Vema of Rediff wrote \"Ek Villain Returns falls back on the popularity of the Galliyan track to boost its appeal\" [29]\n\n\nOther work and public image\nPatani was placed fifth in the list of most searched celebrities on Google of 2016 [40] She is one of the most followed celebrities on social media with over 57.5 million Instagram followers [41] In 2019, Patani appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list, ranking 43rd with an estimated annual income of ₹58.0 million (US$690,000) [42]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilms\n\n\nMusic videos\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
